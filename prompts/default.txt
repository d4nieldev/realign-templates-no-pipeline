You are given an example of a question from a dataset along with a short description of the dataset:

[[ dataset description ]]
{dataset_description}

[[ example question ]]
{example_question}


I am trying to reformat my dataset in the format of chain of thoughts instruction. In order to do so, I will need some kind of high level structure that will contain the following:
You should start with a sentence or two that describe the task in the dataset, then write a list of steps (the desired structure) - each step should be one line. Finally, if needed, provide general instructions that apply to all steps.
The template should be to the point, without unnecessary explanations and steps.

In your output, simply provide the task description, the list of steps, and the general instructions (if any). No other explanations needed.
