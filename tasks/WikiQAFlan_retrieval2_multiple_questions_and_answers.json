It was obtained through a security breach of Netsential, a web developer that works with fusion centers and law enforcement.\nThe leaks were released at hunter.ddosecrets.com and announced on the @DDoSecrets Twitter account. The account was banned shortly after for \"dissemination of hacked materials\" and \"information that could have put individuals at risk of real-world harm.\" Wired reported that Distributed Denial of Secrets attempted to remove sensitive information from the data before publication. National Fusion Center Association (NFCA) officials confirmed the authenticity of the data, according to documents obtained by security journalist Brian Krebs; the organization warned its members that hackers may use the leaked information to target them.\n\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Blue Leaks data comes largely from the intelligence gathered by fusion centers. After the September 11 attacks, the United States government sought to improve communication between different levels of law enforcement to better discover and prevent terrorist attacks. They encouraged state and local governments to create fusion centers: physical locations where representatives of different law enforcement agencies share and collectively analyze intelligence before distributing reports back to their respective agencies. Fusion centers have since begun working with private data brokers with little public oversight.Fusion centers have been criticized as privacy-invading, ineffective, and targeted at political groups. In 2012, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that over the 13 months of review, fusion centers did not contribute to the identification or prevention of a terrorist plot,:\u200a2\u200a and that of the 386 unclassified fusion center reports it reviewed, three-quarters had no connection to terrorism at all.:\u200a32\u200a In 2008, the Department of Homeland Security identified a number of privacy-related concerns created by fusion centers. The department noted that the excessive secrecy of fusion centers led to comparisons with COINTELPRO, and that fusion center reports sometimes distribute inaccurate or incomplete information.:\u200a28\u20139\u200a The 2012 Senate report points to a report issued by an Illinois fusion center in 2011. The report wrongly claimed that Russian hackers were to blame for a broken water pump, and despite the Department of Homeland Security publicly stating the report was false, its Office of Intelligence and Analysis included the claims in its report to Congress.After the murder of George Floyd and other instances of police violence in 2020, law enforcement in the United States came under renewed scrutiny. In early June, the hacker collective Anonymous announced its intent to expose police misconduct. The collective did high-profile hacks in the 2000s and early 2010s. In 2011, Antisec, a subgroup of Anonymous, released law enforcement information in support of Occupy Wall Street protestors, but the collective had few significant operations within the United States since then.\n\n== Findings ==\nThe BlueLeaks collection includes internal memos, financial records, and more from over 200 state, local, and federal agencies. More than one million documents were leaked from law enforcement fusion centers. In leaked documents, officers track individual, group, and event pages with protest or anti-law enforcement rhetoric. Some of the documents contain material related to the attitudes of law enforcement and their response to the Black Lives Matter movement, George Floyd protests, and COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the George Floyd protests, law enforcement agencies monitored protesters' communications over social media and messaging apps. Reports leaked found that the police were aware of the potential for their surveillance to violate the Constitution. They distributed documents to police filled with rumors and warnings that the protests would become violent, sparking fear among police officers.The documents also show a much broader trend of surveillance. They show details about the data that police can obtain from social media sites including Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Reddit and Tumblr, among others. Fusion centers also collect and distribute detailed data from automatic license plate readers.Surveys from law enforcement training programs reveal that some instructors were prejudiced and unprofessional. Classes taught biased, outdated, and incorrect content. Some contain sexual content unrelated to the class, and there was one report of an instructor admitting to lying in court frequently.In Maine, legislators took interest in BlueLeaks thanks to details about the Maine Information and Analysis Center, which is under investigation. The leaks showed the fusion center was spying on and keeping records on people who had been legally protesting or had been \"suspicious\" but committed no crime.Documents also contain reports about other countries from the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Department of State and other agencies. Officials discussed cyber attacks from Iran and concerns about further attacks in early 2020. Another report discusses possible Chinese espionage at natural gas facilities. Homeland Security also discussed Russian interference with American elections, attempts to hack the 2020 census, and manipulation of social media discussion.\n\n\n*** Google's CyberCrime Investigation Group ***\nOn August 21, The Guardian revealed, based on the leaked documents, the existence of Google's \"CyberCrime Investigation Group\" (CIG). The group focused on voluntarily forwarding detailed information of Google, YouTube, and Gmail users, among other products, to members of the Northern California Regional Intelligence, a counter-terrorist fusion center, for content threatening violence or otherwise expressing extremist views, often associated with the far right. The company has also been said to report users who appeared to be in mental distress, indicating suicidal thoughts or intent to commit self-harm.One way Google identified its users in order to report them to law enforcement was by cross-referencing different Gmail accounts, which eventually led them to a single Android phone. In some cases, the company did not ban the users they reported to the authorities, and some were said to still have accounts on YouTube, Gmail, and other services.\n\n== Response ==\nShortly after the leaks were released, on June 23, Twitter permanently banned DDoSecrets's Twitter account for distributing hacked materials. Twitter also censored all links to the DDoSecrets website.German authorities seized a server used by DDoSecrets at the request of U.S. authorities. The server had hosted the BlueLeaks files, but the documents remained available for download through BitTorrent and other websites.Reddit banned r/BlueLeaks, a community created to discuss BlueLeaks, claiming they had posted personal information.There is a federal investigation relating to BlueLeaks. Various Freedom of Information Act requests filed about BlueLeaks and DDoSecrets were rejected due to an ongoing federal investigation. Homeland Security Investigations has questioned at least one person, seeking information about BlueLeaks, DDoSecrets, and one of its founders, Emma Best.The editor for The Intercept described BlueLeaks as the law enforcement equivalent to the Pentagon Papers.\n\nUsing the text above, answer these questions: What is BlueLeaks and how was the data obtained?question: Who is responsible for releasing the BlueLeaks data and what was their motivation?question: What is the role of fusion centers and how do they operate?question: What criticisms have been leveled against fusion centers?question: How did law enforcement agencies use social media surveillance during the George Floyd protests?question: What type of data do fusion centers collect and distribute?question: What is the \"CyberCrime Investigation Group\" (CIG) and what does it focus on?question: How does Google identify users to report to law enforcement?question: What has been the response to the release of the BlueLeaks data?question: How have legislators in Maine responded to the BlueLeaks data?question: What other countries' reports are included in the BlueLeaks data?question: How have various Freedom of Information Act requests regarding BlueLeaks been handled?question: What is the significance of the BlueLeaks data in the context of law enforcement?question: How have social media companies responded to the release of the BlueLeaks data?question: What is the role of the Northern California Regional Intelligence, a counter-terrorist fusion center, in relation to the CyberCrime Investigation Group (CIG)?",

    "instruction": "Context: Spam and Open Relay Blocking System\n\n==Introduction==\nSORBS (\"Spam and Open Relay Blocking System\") is a list of e-mail servers suspected of sending or relaying spam (a DNS Blackhole List).  It has been augmented with complementary lists that include various other classes of hosts, allowing for customized email rejection by its users.\n\n== DUHL ==\nSORBS adds IP ranges that belong to dialup modem pools, dynamically allocated wireless, and DSL connections as well as DHCP LAN ranges by using reverse DNS PTR records, WHOIS records, and sometimes by submission from the ISPs themselves. This is called the DUHL or Dynamic User and Host List. SORBS does not automatically rescan DUHL listed hosts for updated rDNS so to remove an IP address from the DUHL the user or ISP has to request a delisting or rescan. If other blocks are scanned in the region of listings and the scan includes listed netspace, SORBS automatically removes the netspace marked as static.\nMatthew Sullivan of SORBS proposed in an Internet Draft that generic reverse DNS addresses include purposing tokens such as static or dynamic, abbreviations thereof, and more. That naming scheme would have allowed end users to classify IP addresses without the need to rely on third party lists, such as the SORBS DUHL. The Internet Draft has since expired. Generally it is considered more appropriate for ISPs to simply block outgoing traffic to port 25 if they wish to prevent users from sending email directly, rather than specifying it in the reverse DNS record for the IP.SORBS' dynamic IP list originally came from Dynablock but has been developed independently since Dynablock stopped updating in December 2003.\n\n== Spam traps ==\nIP addresses that send spam to SORBS spamtraps are added to their spam database automatically or manually.  In order to prevent being blacklisted, major free email services such as Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail, as well as major ISPs now implement outgoing anti-spam countermeasures. Gmail, for example, continues to get listed and delisted because they refuse abuse reports. However, smaller networks may still be unwittingly blocked.  Because spammers use viruses, malware, and rootkits to force compromised computers to send spam, SORBS lists the IP addresses of servers that the infected system uses to send its spam.  Because of this, larger ISPs and corporate networks have started blocking port 25 in order to prevent these compromised computers from being able to send email except through designated email servers.\n\n== Preemptive listings ==\nSORBS maintains a list of networks and addresses that it believes are assigned dynamically to end users/machines, it refers to this list as the DUHL (Dynamic User/Host List). The list includes wide networks of computers sharing the same IP address using network address translation which are also affected (If one computer behind the NAT is allowed to send spam, the whole network will be blacklisted if the NAT IP is ever blacklisted.) This is a common method of pre-emptive blocking as most legitimate mail servers are hosted in data centers designed and provisioned for such services, the legitimate mail servers that are affected by such listings are most commonly home hobbyists running their own mail servers.  The Spamhaus Policy Block List (PBL) is another such pre-emptive list which does not just list dynamic hosts, but also blocks hosts it believes should not be sending email directly to third-party servers.  SORBS also operate another list which is similar to the Spamhaus PBL called the NoServers list, which is wholly maintained by the network administrators of the respective networks and is therefore theoretically False Positive free.\n\n== Escalated listings ==\nSORBS has been accused of deliberately targeting innocent users through escalated listings. Its website describes the process as follows: \"An escalated listing on the other hand is where a whole network of IP addresses is listed in SORBS and all hosts and IPs (whether assigned to a single customer or multiple) are listed and therefore blocked or result in spam folder issues. Why does SORBS create escalated listings? The simple answer is to stop spam. You ask, 'How does listing innocent IPs help stop spam?' Simple, some providers don\u2019t care about spam.\" There have been many heated discussions on this practice as often it would appear that email users who are caught in this trap have no recourse, because the listing applies to a block of IP addresses, and they are unable to release their own IP address.\n\n== False positives ==\nDue to the automation of SORBS listings it is possible for the addresses of legitimate mail servers to be listed from time to time. Therefore, users of the SORBS Spam list in particular should consider carefully any such implications and may wish to use the service as part of a larger spam blocking system.  The SORBS 'No Servers' list is reported to be wholly administered by the network administrators of the networks concerned therefore it should be false positive free.\n\n== Statistics ==\nSORBS produces and publishes daily statistics about its list to the otherwise defunct usenet newsgroup news.admin.net-abuse.bulletins (NANAB). As of 7 April 2021 statistics published show the following listing totals:\n\nUnique IPs in Proxy entries:             613259\nUnique IPs in Relay entries:             7824\nUnique IPs in Spam entries:              48515896\nUnique IPs in Hacked entries:            7337019\nUnique IPs in DUHL entries:              381194921\nUnique IPs in exDUHL entries:            1072776\nUnique IPs in Cable entries:             3877257\nUnique IPs in Zombie entries:            1772805\nUnique IPs in AdminRequested entries:    1\nUnique IPs in UnAllocated entries:       139101\nUnique IPs in CoLo entries:              136259\nUnique IPs in MailServer entries:        31\nUnique IPs in Spammer entries:           1\nUnique IPs in Escalated entries:         2305\nUnique IPs in Phishing entries:          110995\nUnique IPs in Virus entries:             5630114\nUnique IPs in BackScatter entries:       36\nUnique IPs in Business entries:          5693190\nUnique IPs in Static entries:            8906441\nUnique IPs in WhiteHat entries:          1\nUnique IPs in NoServers entries:         46844194\nUnique IPs in CoreNetwork entries:       42588\nUnique IPs in InstantReport entries:     31\nUnique IPs in EmailReport entries:       1\nUnique IPs in Permission entries:        81\nUnique IPs in Botnet entries:            379527\nTotal IPs listed in the database         512276654\nQuestions:\n\nHow does SORBS identify and add IP ranges to their DUHL list?Question: What is the significance of Matthew Sullivan's Internet Draft proposal for reverse DNS addresses?Question: How do major free email services and ISPs prevent being blacklisted in SORBS?Question: Why do larger ISPs and corporate networks block port 25?Question: What is the purpose of SORBS' preemptive listing, the DUHL?Question: How does SORBS create escalated listings, and what are the implications?Question: What are false positives in SORBS listings, and how can they be avoided?Question: How does SORBS produce and publish daily statistics about its list?Question: What is the significance of the large number of unique IPs listed in the DUHL entries?Question: How does SORBS define and handle spam traps?Question: What is the Spamhaus Policy Block List (PBL), and how is it similar to SORBS' DUHL list?Question: How does SORBS' NoServers list differ from other SORBS lists, and what are its implications?Question: How does SORBS handle the listing of legitimate mail servers?Question: What is the significance of the large number of unique IPs listed in the Unique IPs in Spam entries?Question: How does SORBS' Escalated listings affect email delivery?.

      "context": "Spam and Open Relay Blocking System\n\n==Introduction==\nSORBS (\"Spam and Open Relay Blocking System\") is a list of e-mail servers suspected of sending or relaying spam (a DNS Blackhole List).  It has been augmented with complementary lists that include various other classes of hosts, allowing for customized email rejection by its users.\n\n== DUHL ==\nSORBS adds IP ranges that belong to dialup modem pools, dynamically allocated wireless, and DSL connections as well as DHCP LAN ranges by using reverse DNS PTR records, WHOIS records, and sometimes by submission from the ISPs themselves. This is called the DUHL or Dynamic User and Host List. SORBS does not automatically rescan DUHL listed hosts for updated rDNS so to remove an IP address from the DUHL the user or ISP has to request a delisting or rescan. If other blocks are scanned in the region of listings and the scan includes listed netspace, SORBS automatically removes the netspace marked as static.\nMatthew Sullivan of SORBS proposed in an Internet Draft that generic reverse DNS addresses include purposing tokens such as static or dynamic, abbreviations thereof, and more. That naming scheme would have allowed end users to classify IP addresses without the need to rely on third party lists, such as the SORBS DUHL. The Internet Draft has since expired. Generally it is considered more appropriate for ISPs to simply block outgoing traffic to port 25 if they wish to prevent users from sending email directly, rather than specifying it in the reverse DNS record for the IP.SORBS' dynamic IP list originally came from Dynablock but has been developed independently since Dynablock stopped updating in December 2003.\n\n== Spam traps ==\nIP addresses that send spam to SORBS spamtraps are added to their spam database automatically or manually.  In order to prevent being blacklisted, major free email services such as Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail, as well as major ISPs now implement outgoing anti-spam countermeasures. Gmail, for example, continues to get listed and delisted because they refuse abuse reports. However, smaller networks may still be unwittingly blocked.  Because spammers use viruses, malware, and rootkits to force compromised computers to send spam, SORBS lists the IP addresses of servers that the infected system uses to send its spam.  Because of this, larger ISPs and corporate networks have started blocking port 25 in order to prevent these compromised computers from being able to send email except through designated email servers.\n\n== Preemptive listings ==\nSORBS maintains a list of networks and addresses that it believes are assigned dynamically to end users/machines, it refers to this list as the DUHL (Dynamic User/Host List). The list includes wide networks of computers sharing the same IP address using network address translation which are also affected (If one computer behind the NAT is allowed to send spam, the whole network will be blacklisted if the NAT IP is ever blacklisted.) This is a common method of pre-emptive blocking as most legitimate mail servers are hosted in data centers designed and provisioned for such services, the legitimate mail servers that are affected by such listings are most commonly home hobbyists running their own mail servers.  The Spamhaus Policy Block List (PBL) is another such pre-emptive list which does not just list dynamic hosts, but also blocks hosts it believes should not be sending email directly to third-party servers.  SORBS also operate another list which is similar to the Spamhaus PBL called the NoServers list, which is wholly maintained by the network administrators of the respective networks and is therefore theoretically False Positive free.\n\n== Escalated listings ==\nSORBS has been accused of deliberately targeting innocent users through escalated listings. Its website describes the process as follows: \"An escalated listing on the other hand is where a whole network of IP addresses is listed in SORBS and all hosts and IPs (whether assigned to a single customer or multiple) are listed and therefore blocked or result in spam folder issues. Why does SORBS create escalated listings? The simple answer is to stop spam. You ask, 'How does listing innocent IPs help stop spam?' Simple, some providers don\u2019t care about spam.\" There have been many heated discussions on this practice as often it would appear that email users who are caught in this trap have no recourse, because the listing applies to a block of IP addresses, and they are unable to release their own IP address.\n\n== False positives ==\nDue to the automation of SORBS listings it is possible for the addresses of legitimate mail servers to be listed from time to time. Therefore, users of the SORBS Spam list in particular should consider carefully any such implications and may wish to use the service as part of a larger spam blocking system.  The SORBS 'No Servers' list is reported to be wholly administered by the network administrators of the networks concerned therefore it should be false positive free.\n\n== Statistics ==\nSORBS produces and publishes daily statistics about its list to the otherwise defunct usenet newsgroup news.admin.net-abuse.bulletins (NANAB). As of 7 April 2021 statistics published show the following listing totals:\n\nUnique IPs in Proxy entries:             613259\nUnique IPs in Relay entries:             7824\nUnique IPs in Spam entries:              48515896\nUnique IPs in Hacked entries:            7337019\nUnique IPs in DUHL entries:              381194921\nUnique IPs in exDUHL entries:            1072776\nUnique IPs in Cable entries:             3877257\nUnique IPs in Zombie entries:            1772805\nUnique IPs in AdminRequested entries:    1\nUnique IPs in UnAllocated entries:       139101\nUnique IPs in CoLo entries:              136259\nUnique IPs in MailServer entries:        31\nUnique IPs in Spammer entries:           1\nUnique IPs in Escalated entries:         2305\nUnique IPs in Phishing entries:          110995\nUnique IPs in Virus entries:             5630114\nUnique IPs in BackScatter entries:       36\nUnique IPs in Business entries:          5693190\nUnique IPs in Static entries:            8906441\nUnique IPs in WhiteHat entries:          1\nUnique IPs in NoServers entries:         46844194\nUnique IPs in CoreNetwork entries:       42588\nUnique IPs in InstantReport entries:     31\nUnique IPs in EmailReport entries:       1\nUnique IPs in Permission entries:        81\nUnique IPs in Botnet entries:            379527\nTotal IPs listed in the database         512276654",

    "instruction": "Context: Dirty COW\n\n==Introduction==\nDirty COW (Dirty copy-on-write) is a computer security vulnerability of the Linux kernel that affected all Linux-based operating systems, including Android devices, that used older versions of the Linux kernel created before 2018. It is a local privilege escalation bug that exploits a race condition in the implementation of the copy-on-write mechanism in the kernel's memory-management subsystem. Computers and devices that still use the older kernels remain vulnerable.\nThe vulnerability was discovered by Phil Oester. \nBecause of the race condition, with the right timing, a local attacker can exploit the copy-on-write mechanism to turn a read-only mapping of a file into a writable mapping. Although it is a local privilege escalation, remote attackers can use it in conjunction with other exploits that allow remote execution of non-privileged code to achieve remote root access on a computer. The attack itself does not leave traces in the system log.The vulnerability has the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures designation CVE-2016-5195. Dirty Cow was one of the first security issues transparently fixed in Ubuntu by the Canonical Live Patch service.It has been demonstrated that the vulnerability can be utilized to root any Android device up to (and excluding) Android version 7 (Nougat).\n\n\n\n== Applications ==\nThe Dirty COW vulnerability has many perceived use cases including proven examples, such as obtaining root permissions in Android devices, as well as several speculated implementations. There are many binaries used in Linux which are read-only, and can only be modified or written to by a user of higher permissions, such as the root. When privileges are escalated, whether by genuine or malicious means \u2013 such as by using the Dirty COW exploit \u2013 the user can modify usually unmodifiable binaries and files. If a malicious individual could use the Dirty COW vulnerability to escalate their permissions, they could change a file, such as /bin/bash, so that it performs additional, unexpected functions, such as a keylogger. When a user starts a program which has been infected, they will inadvertently allow the malicious code to run. If the exploit targets a program which is run with root privileges, the exploit will have those same privileges.\n\n== Remedies and recourse ==\nAt the dawn of its discovery, anyone using a machine running Linux was susceptible to the exploit. The exploit has no preventative work around, the only cure is a patch or running a newer version which is not vulnerable anymore. Linus Torvalds committed a patch on October 18, 2016, acknowledging that it was an old vulnerability he had attempted to fix eleven years ago.

Linus Torvalds committed a patch on October 18, 2016, acknowledging that it was an old vulnerability he had attempted to fix eleven years ago. Some distributors provide patches, such as Canonical, who provided a live patch. In the absence of a patch, there are a few mitigation technologies including SystemTap, and very little security from SELinux or AppArmor. Antivirus software has the potential to detect elevated permissions attacks, but it cannot prevent the attack.

    "instruction": "Context: SIGABA\n\n==Introduction==\nIn the history of cryptography, the ECM Mark II was a cipher machine used by the United States for message encryption from World War II until the 1950s. The machine was also known as the SIGABA or Converter M-134 by the Army, or CSP-888/889 by the Navy, and a modified Navy version was termed the CSP-2900.\nLike many machines of the era it used an electromechanical system of rotors to encipher messages, but with a number of security improvements over previous designs. No successful cryptanalysis of the machine during its service lifetime is publicly known.\n\n== Description ==\n\nSIGABA was similar to the Enigma in basic theory, in that it used a series of rotors to encipher every character of the plaintext into a different character of ciphertext. Unlike Enigma's three rotors however, the SIGABA included fifteen, and did not use a reflecting rotor.\nThe SIGABA had three banks of five rotors each; the action of two of the banks controlled the stepping of the third.\n\nThe main bank of five rotors was termed the cipher rotors (Army) or alphabet maze (Navy) and each rotor had 26 contacts. This assembly acted similarly to other rotor machines, such as the Enigma; when a plaintext letter was entered,  a signal would enter one side of the bank and exit the other, denoting the ciphertext letter. Unlike the Enigma, there was no reflector.\nThe second bank of five rotors was termed the control rotors or stepping maze. These were also 26-contact rotors. The control rotors received four signals at each step. After passing through the control rotors, the outputs were divided into ten groups of various sizes, ranging from 1\u20136 wires. Each group corresponded to an input wire for the next bank of rotors.\nThe third bank of rotors was called the index rotors. These rotors were smaller, with only ten contacts, and did not step during the encryption. After travelling though the index rotors, one to four of five output lines would have power. These then turned the cypher rotors.\nThe SIGABA advanced one or more of its main rotors in a complex, pseudorandom fashion. This meant that attacks which could break other rotor machines with simpler stepping (for example, Enigma) were made much more complex. Even with the plaintext in hand, there were so many potential inputs to the encryption that it was difficult to work out the settings.\nOn the downside, the SIGABA was also large, heavy, expensive, difficult to operate, mechanically complex, and fragile. It was nowhere near as practical a device as the Enigma, which was smaller and lighter than the radios with which it was used. It found widespread use in the radio rooms of US Navy ships, but as a result of these practical problems the SIGABA simply couldn't be used in the field. In most theatres other systems were used instead, especially for tactical communications. One of the most famous was the use of Navajo code talkers for tactical field communications in the Pacific Theater. In other theatres, less secure, but smaller, lighter, and sturdier machines were used, such as the M-209. SIGABA, impressive as it was, was overkill for tactical communications. This said, new speculative evidence emerged more recently that the M-209 code was broken by German cryptanalysts during World War II.\n\n== Operation ==\n\nBecause SIGABA did not have a reflector, a 26+ pole switch was needed  to change the signal paths through the alphabet maze between the encryption and decryption modes. The long \u201ccontroller\u201d switch was mounted vertically, with its knob on the top of the housing. See image. It had five positions, O, P, R, E and D. Besides encrypt (E) and decrypt (D), it had a plain text position (P) that printed whatever was typed on the output tape, and a reset position (R) that was used to set the rotors and to zeroize the machine. The O position turned the machine off. The P setting was used to print the indicators and date/time groups on the output tape. It was the only mode that printed numbers. No printing took place in the R setting, but digit keys were active to increment rotors.\nDuring encryption, the Z key was connected to the X key and the space bar produced a Z input to the alphabet maze. A Z was printed as a space on decryption. The reader was expected to understand that a word like \u201cxebra\u201d in a decrypted message was actually \u201czebra.\u201d The printer automatically added a space between each group of five characters during encryption.\nThe SIGABA was zeroized when all the index rotors read zero in their low order digit and all the alphabet and code rotors were set to the letter O. Each rotor had a cam that caused the rotor to stop in the proper position during the zeroize process.\nSIGABA\u2019s rotors were all housed in a removable frame held in place by four thumb screws. This allowed the most sensitive elements of the machine to be stored in more secure safes and to be quickly thrown overboard or otherwise destroyed if capture was threatened. It also allowed a machine to  quickly switch between networks that used different rotor orders. Messages had two 5- character indicators, an exterior indicator that specified the system being used and the security classification and an interior indicator that determined the initial settings of the code and alphabet rotors. The key list included separate index rotor settings for each security classification. This prevented lower classification messages from being used as cribs to attack higher classification messages.\nThe Navy and Army had different procedures for the interior indicator. Both started by zeroizing the machine and having the operator select a random 5-character string for each new message. This was then encrypted to produce the interior indicator. Army key lists included an initial setting for the rotors that was used to encrypt the random string. The Navy operators used the keyboard to increment the code rotors until they matched the random character string. The alphabet rotor would move during this process and their final position was the internal indicator. In case of joint operations, the Army procedures were followed.\nThe key lists included a \u201c26-30\u201d check string. After the rotors were reordered according to the current key, the operator would zeroize the machine, encrypt 25 characters and then encrypt \u201cAAAAA\u201d. The ciphertext resulting from the five A\u2019s had to match the check string. The manual warned that typographical errors were possible in key lists and that a four character match should be accepted.\nThe manual also gave suggestions on how to generate random strings for creating indicators.  These included using playing cards and poker chips, to selecting characters from cipher texts and using the SIGABA itself as a random character generator.\n\n== Security ==\n\nAlthough the SIGABA was extremely secure, the US continued to upgrade its capability throughout the war, for fear of the Axis cryptanalytic ability to break SIGABA's code. When the German's ENIGMA messages and Japan's Type B Cipher Machine were broken, the messages were closely scrutinized for signs that Axis forces were able to read the US cryptography codes. Axis prisoners of war (POWs) were also interrogated with the goal of finding evidence that US cryptography had been broken. However, both the Germans and Japanese were not making any progress in breaking the SIGABA code. A decrypted JN-A-20 message, dated 24 January 1942, sent from the naval attach\u00e9 in Berlin to vice chief of Japanese Naval General Staff in Tokyo stated that \"joint Jap[anese]-German cryptanalytical efforts\" to be \"highly satisfactory\", since the \"German[s] have exhibited commendable ingenuity and recently experienced some success on English Navy systems\", but are \"encountering difficulty in establishing successful techniques of attack on 'enemy' code setup\". In another decrypted JN-A-20 message, the Germans admitted that their progress in breaking US communications was unsatisfactory. The Japanese also admitted in their own communications that they had made no real progress against the American cipher system. In September 1944, when the Allies were advancing steadily on the Western front, the war diary of the German Signal Intelligence Group recorded: \"U.S. 5-letter traffic: Work discontinued as unprofitable at this time\".SIGABA systems were closely guarded at all times, with separate safes for the system base and the code-wheel assembly, but there was one incident where a unit was lost for a time. On February 3, 1945, a truck carrying a SIGABA system in three safes was stolen while its guards were visiting a brothel in recently-liberated Colmar, France. General Eisenhower ordered an extensive search, which finally discovered the safes six weeks later in a nearby river.:\u200app.510\u2013512\n\n== Interoperability with Allied counterparts ==\nThe need for cooperation among the US/British/Canadian forces in carrying out joint military operations against Axis forces gave rise to the need for a cipher  system that could be used by all Allied forces. This functionality was achieved in three different ways. Firstly, the ECM Adapter (CSP 1000), which could be retrofitted on Allied cipher machines, was produced at the Washington Naval Yard ECM Repair Shop. A total of 3,500 adapters were produced. The second method was to adapt the SIGABA for interoperation with a modified British machine, the Typex. The common machine was known as the Combined Cipher Machine (CCM), and was used from November 1943. Because of the high cost of production, only 631 CCMs were made. The third way was the most common and most cost-effective. It was the \"X\" Adapter manufactured by the Teletype Corporation in Chicago. A total of 4,500 of these adapters were installed at depot-level maintenance facilities.\nQuestions:\n\nHow many banks of rotors did the SIGABA machine have, and what were their functions?Question: How was the SIGABA different from the Enigma in terms of its rotor system?Question: How did the SIGABA's rotors step in a complex, pseudorandom fashion?Question: What were some of the practical problems with the SIGABA that made it difficult to use in the field?Question: How did the SIGABA's lack of a reflector affect its operation?Question: How were the SIGABA's rotors zeroized?Question: How were messages encrypted using the SIGABA?Question: How were the Navy and Army different in their procedures for the interior indicator?Question: How was the SIGABA's capability upgraded throughout the war?Question: What was the significance of the \"26-30\" check string in the SIGABA's key lists?Question: What were some of the suggestions given in the SIGABA manual for generating random strings for creating indicators?Question: Why were the SIGABA systems closely guarded at all times?Question: What was the ECM Adapter (CSP 1000) and how was it used in the SIGABA system?Question: What was the Combined Cipher Machine (CCM) and how was it used in the SIGABA system?Question: What was the \"X\" Adapter and how was it used in the SIGABA system?.

    "instruction": "Context: VLAN hopping\n\n==Introduction==\nVLAN hopping is a computer security exploit, a method of attacking networked resources on a virtual LAN (VLAN).  The basic concept behind all VLAN hopping attacks is for an attacking host on a VLAN to gain access to traffic on other VLANs that would normally not be accessible.  There are two primary methods of VLAN hopping: switch spoofing and double tagging.  Both attack vectors can be mitigated with proper switch port configuration.\n\n== Switch spoofing ==\nIn a switch spoofing attack, an attacking host imitates a trunking switch by speaking the tagging and trunking protocols (e.g. Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol, IEEE 802.1Q, Dynamic Trunking Protocol) used in maintaining a VLAN.  Traffic for multiple VLANs is then accessible to the attacking host.\n\n\n*** Mitigation ***\nSwitch spoofing can only be exploited when interfaces are set to negotiate a trunk.  To prevent this attack on Cisco IOS, use one of the following methods::\u200a163\u200a1. Ensure that ports are not set to negotiate trunks automatically by disabling DTP:\n\nSwitch (config-if)# switchport nonegotiate\n2. Ensure that ports that are not meant to be trunks are explicitly configured as access ports \n\nSwitch (config-if)# switchport mode access\n\n== Double tagging ==\nIn a double tagging attack, an attacker connected to an 802.1Q-enabled port prepends two VLAN tags to a frame that it transmits. The frame (externally tagged with VLAN ID that the attacker's port is really a member of) is forwarded without the first tag because it is the native VLAN of a trunk interface. The second tag is then visible to the second switch that the frame encounters. This second VLAN tag indicates that the frame is destined for a target host on a second switch. The frame is then sent to the target host as though it originated on the target VLAN, effectively bypassing the network mechanisms that logically isolate VLANs from one another.\nHowever, possible replies are not forwarded to the attacking host (unidirectional flow).\n\n\n*** Mitigation ***\nDouble Tagging can only be exploited on switch ports configured to use native VLANs.:\u200a162\u200a Trunk ports configured with a native VLAN don't apply a VLAN tag when sending these frames. This allows an attacker's fake VLAN tag to be read by the next switch.Double Tagging can be mitigated by any of the following actions (Incl. IOS example):\n\nSimply do not put any hosts on VLAN 1 (The default VLAN).  i.e., assign an access VLAN other than VLAN 1 to every access port\n Switch (config-if)# switchport access vlan 2\nChange the native VLAN on all trunk ports to an unused VLAN ID.\nSwitch (config-if)# switchport trunk native vlan 999\nExplicit tagging of the native VLAN on all trunk ports. Must be configured on all switches in network autonomy.\nSwitch(config)# vlan dot1q tag native\n\n\n*** Example ***\nAs an example of a double tagging attack, consider a secure web server on a VLAN called VLAN2.  Hosts on VLAN2 are allowed access to the web server; hosts from outside VLAN2 are blocked by layer 3 filters.  An attacking host on a separate VLAN, called VLAN1(Native), creates a specially formed packet to attack the web server.

      "context": "VLAN hopping\n\n==Introduction==\nVLAN hopping is a computer security exploit, a method of attacking networked resources on a virtual LAN (VLAN).  The basic concept behind all VLAN hopping attacks is for an attacking host on a VLAN to gain access to traffic on other VLANs that would normally not be accessible.  There are two primary methods of VLAN hopping: switch spoofing and double tagging.  Both attack vectors can be mitigated with proper switch port configuration.\n\n== Switch spoofing ==\nIn a switch spoofing attack, an attacking host imitates a trunking switch by speaking the tagging and trunking protocols (e.g. Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol, IEEE 802.1Q, Dynamic Trunking Protocol) used in maintaining a VLAN.  Traffic for multiple VLANs is then accessible to the attacking host.\n\n\n*** Mitigation ***\nSwitch spoofing can only be exploited when interfaces are set to negotiate a trunk.  To prevent this attack on Cisco IOS, use one of the following methods::\u200a163\u200a1. Ensure that ports are not set to negotiate trunks automatically by disabling DTP:\n\nSwitch (config-if)# switchport nonegotiate\n2. Ensure that ports that are not meant to be trunks are explicitly configured as access ports \n\nSwitch (config-if)# switchport mode access\n\n== Double tagging ==\nIn a double tagging attack, an attacker connected to an 802.1Q-enabled port prepends two VLAN tags to a frame that it transmits. The frame (externally tagged with VLAN ID that the attacker's port is really a member of) is forwarded without the first tag because it is the native VLAN of a trunk interface. The second tag is then visible to the second switch that the frame encounters. This second VLAN tag indicates that the frame is destined for a target host on a second switch. The frame is then sent to the target host as though it originated on the target VLAN, effectively bypassing the network mechanisms that logically isolate VLANs from one another.\nHowever, possible replies are not forwarded to the attacking host (unidirectional flow).\n\n\n*** Mitigation ***\nDouble Tagging can only be exploited on switch ports configured to use native VLANs.:\u200a162\u200a Trunk ports configured with a native VLAN don't apply a VLAN tag when sending these frames. This allows an attacker's fake VLAN tag to be read by the next switch.Double Tagging can be mitigated by any of the following actions (Incl. IOS example):\n\nSimply do not put any hosts on VLAN 1 (The default VLAN).  i.e., assign an access VLAN other than VLAN 1 to every access port\n Switch (config-if)# switchport access vlan 2\nChange the native VLAN on all trunk ports to an unused VLAN ID.\nSwitch (config-if)# switchport trunk native vlan 999\nExplicit tagging of the native VLAN on all trunk ports. Must be configured on all switches in network autonomy.\nSwitch(config)# vlan dot1q tag native\n\n\n*** Example ***\nAs an example of a double tagging attack, consider a secure web server on a VLAN called VLAN2.  Hosts on VLAN2 are allowed access to the web server; hosts from outside VLAN2 are blocked by layer 3 filters.  An attacking host on a separate VLAN, called VLAN1(Native), creates a specially formed packet to attack the web server.  It places a header tagging the packet as belonging to VLAN2 under the header tagging the packet as belonging to VLAN1.  When the packet is sent, the switch sees the default VLAN1 header and removes it and forwards the packet.  The next switch sees the VLAN2 header and puts the packet in VLAN2.  The packet thus arrives at the target server as though it were sent from another host on VLAN2, ignoring any layer 3 filtering that might be in place.",

    "instruction": "Pretty Easy privacy\n\n==Introduction==\npretty Easy privacy (p\u2261p or pEp) is a pluggable data encryption and verification system, which provides automatic cryptographic key management through a set of libraries (providing p\u2261p adapters for application developers' used programming languages and development environments) for written digital communications. Its main goal is to make end-to-end encryption the default in written digital communications for all users in the easiest way possible and on the channels they already make use of, including e-mails, SMS, or other types of messages.\nIt exists as a plugin for Microsoft Outlook and Mozilla Thunderbird as well as a mobile app for Android and iOS. p\u2261p also works under Microsoft Windows, Unix-like and Mac OS X operating systems. Its cryptographic functionality is handled by an open-source p\u2261p engine relying on already existing cryptographic implementations in software like GnuPG, a modified version of netpgp (used only in iOS), and (as of p\u2261p v2.0) GNUnet.\nIn its default configuration, p\u2261p does not rely on a web of trust or any form of centralized trust infrastructure, but instead lets users verify each other's authenticity by comparing cryptographic fingerprints in the form of natural language strings. \npretty Easy privacy was first released in 2016. All software already released, including p\u2261p engine, adapters, apps and add-ons (including Microsoft Outlook), is free and open-source software.\nIn March 2021, it was revealed that the company behind pEp paid for fake reviews for their apps.\n\n== Design principles ==\nAbove all, p\u2261p \u2013 supposedly contrary to existing cryptographic solutions \u2013 should be easy to install, use and understand.

    "instruction": "Context: Security event manager\n\n==Introduction==\nSecurity event management (SEM), and the related SIM and SIEM, are computer security disciplines that use data inspection tools to centralize the storage and interpretation of logs or events generated by other software running on a network.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe acronyms SEM, SIM and SIEM have sometimes been used interchangeably, but generally refer to the different primary focus of products:\n\nLog management: Focus on simple collection and storage of log messages and audit trails\nSecurity information management (SIM): Long-term storage as well as analysis and reporting of log data.\nSecurity event manager (SEM): Real-time monitoring, correlation of events, notifications and console views.\nSecurity information and event management (SIEM): Combines SIM and SEM and provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications.\n\n== Event logs ==\nMany systems and applications which run on a computer network generate events which are kept in event logs. These logs are essentially lists of activities that occurred, with records of new events being appended to the end of the logs as they occur. Protocols, such as syslog and SNMP, can be used to transport these events, as they occur, to logging software that is not on the same host on which the events are generated. The better SEMs provide a flexible array of supported communication protocols to allow for the broadest range of event collection.\nIt is beneficial to send all events to a centralized SEM system for the following reasons:\n\nAccess to all logs can be provided through a consistent central interface.\nThe SEM can provide secure, forensically sound storage and archival of event logs (this is also a classic log management function).\nPowerful reporting tools can be run on the SEM to mine the logs for useful information.\nEvents can be parsed as they hit the SEM for significance, and alerts and notifications can be immediately sent out to interested parties as warranted.\nRelated events which occur on multiple systems can be detected which would be very difficult to detect if each system had a separate log.\nEvents which are sent from a system to a SEM remain on the SEM even if the sending system fails or the logs on it are accidentally or intentionally erased.\n\n== Security analysis ==\nAlthough centralised logging has existed for long time, SEMs are a relatively new idea, pioneered in 1999 by a small company called E-Security, and are still evolving rapidly. The key feature of a Security Event Management tool is the ability to analyse the collected logs to highlight events or behaviors of interest, for example an Administrator or Super User logon, outside of normal business hours. This may include attaching contextual information, such as host information (value, owner, location, etc.), identity information (user info related to accounts referenced in the event like first/last name, workforce ID, manager's name, etc.), and so forth. This contextual information can be leveraged to provide better correlation and reporting capabilities and is often referred to as Meta-data. Products may also integrate with external remediation, ticketing, and workflow tools to assist with the process of incident resolution. The better SEMs will provide a flexible, extensible set of integration capabilities to ensure that the SEM will work with most customer environments.\n\n== Regulatory requirements ==\nSEMs are often sold to help satisfy U.S. regulatory requirements such as those of Sarbanes\u2013Oxley, PCI-DSS, GLBA.\n\n== Standardization ==\nOne of the major problems in the SEM space is the difficulty in consistently analyzing event data. Every vendor, and indeed in many cases different products by one vendor, uses a different proprietary event data format and delivery method. Even in cases where a \"standard\" is used for some part of the chain, like Syslog, the standards don't typically contain enough guidance to assist developers in how to generate events, administrators in how to gather them correctly and reliably, and consumers to analyze them effectively.\nAs an attempt to combat this problem, a couple parallel standardization efforts are underway. First, The Open Group is updating their circa 1997 XDAS standard, which never made it past draft status. This new effort, dubbed XDAS v2, will attempt to formalize an event format including which data should be included in events and how it should be expressed. The XDAS v2 standard will not include event delivery standards but other standards in development by the Distributed Management Task Force may provide a wrapper.\nIn addition, MITRE developed efforts to unify event reporting with the Common Event Expression (CEE) which was somewhat broader in scope as it attempted to define an event structure as well as delivery methods. The project, however, ran out of funding in 2014.\nQuestions:\n\nHow do Security Event Management (SEM) systems differ from simple log management systems?Q: What is the role of Security Information Management (SIM) in network security?Q: How does Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) combine SIM and SEM?Q: Why is it beneficial to send all events to a centralized SEM system?Q: What is the role of event logs in network security?Q: How do SEMs help in regulatory compliance?Q: What is the significance of contextual information in SEM?Q: How do SEMs help with incident resolution?Q: What are the main challenges in analyzing event data in the SEM space?Q: What is The Open Group's XDAS standard, and how does it address event data analysis?Q: How does the Common Event Expression (CEE) initiative aim to unify event reporting?Q: What are the limitations of the XDAS standard and the Common Event Expression initiative in addressing event data analysis issues?Q: Why were SEMs pioneered in 1999, and how have they evolved since then?Q: How do proprietary event data formats and delivery methods impact the analysis of event data in the SEM space?Q: How do standardization efforts, such as XDAS v2 and CEE, address the challenges in the SEM space?.

      "context": "Security event manager\n\n==Introduction==\nSecurity event management (SEM), and the related SIM and SIEM, are computer security disciplines that use data inspection tools to centralize the storage and interpretation of logs or events generated by other software running on a network.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe acronyms SEM, SIM and SIEM have sometimes been used interchangeably, but generally refer to the different primary focus of products:\n\nLog management: Focus on simple collection and storage of log messages and audit trails\nSecurity information management (SIM): Long-term storage as well as analysis and reporting of log data.\nSecurity event manager (SEM): Real-time monitoring, correlation of events, notifications and console views.\nSecurity information and event management (SIEM): Combines SIM and SEM and provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications.\n\n== Event logs ==\nMany systems and applications which run on a computer network generate events which are kept in event logs. These logs are essentially lists of activities that occurred, with records of new events being appended to the end of the logs as they occur. Protocols, such as syslog and SNMP, can be used to transport these events, as they occur, to logging software that is not on the same host on which the events are generated. The better SEMs provide a flexible array of supported communication protocols to allow for the broadest range of event collection.\nIt is beneficial to send all events to a centralized SEM system for the following reasons:\n\nAccess to all logs can be provided through a consistent central interface.\nThe SEM can provide secure, forensically sound storage and archival of event logs (this is also a classic log management function).\nPowerful reporting tools can be run on the SEM to mine the logs for useful information.\nEvents can be parsed as they hit the SEM for significance, and alerts and notifications can be immediately sent out to interested parties as warranted.\nRelated events which occur on multiple systems can be detected which would be very difficult to detect if each system had a separate log.\nEvents which are sent from a system to a SEM remain on the SEM even if the sending system fails or the logs on it are accidentally or intentionally erased.\n\n== Security analysis ==\nAlthough centralised logging has existed for long time, SEMs are a relatively new idea, pioneered in 1999 by a small company called E-Security, and are still evolving rapidly. The key feature of a Security Event Management tool is the ability to analyse the collected logs to highlight events or behaviors of interest, for example an Administrator or Super User logon, outside of normal business hours. This may include attaching contextual information, such as host information (value, owner, location, etc.), identity information (user info related to accounts referenced in the event like first/last name, workforce ID, manager's name, etc.), and so forth. This contextual information can be leveraged to provide better correlation and reporting capabilities and is often referred to as Meta-data. Products may also integrate with external remediation, ticketing, and workflow tools to assist with the process of incident resolution. The better SEMs will provide a flexible, extensible set of integration capabilities to ensure that the SEM will work with most customer environments.\n\n== Regulatory requirements ==\nSEMs are often sold to help satisfy U.S. regulatory requirements such as those of Sarbanes\u2013Oxley, PCI-DSS, GLBA.\n\n== Standardization ==\nOne of the major problems in the SEM space is the difficulty in consistently analyzing event data. Every vendor, and indeed in many cases different products by one vendor, uses a different proprietary event data format and delivery method. Even in cases where a \"standard\" is used for some part of the chain, like Syslog, the standards don't typically contain enough guidance to assist developers in how to generate events, administrators in how to gather them correctly and reliably, and consumers to analyze them effectively.\nAs an attempt to combat this problem, a couple parallel standardization efforts are underway. First, The Open Group is updating their circa 1997 XDAS standard, which never made it past draft status. This new effort, dubbed XDAS v2, will attempt to formalize an event format including which data should be included in events and how it should be expressed. The XDAS v2 standard will not include event delivery standards but other standards in development by the Distributed Management Task Force may provide a wrapper.\nIn addition, MITRE developed efforts to unify event reporting with the Common Event Expression (CEE) which was somewhat broader in scope as it attempted to define an event structure as well as delivery methods. The project, however, ran out of funding in 2014.",

    "instruction": "Strong cryptography\n\n==Introduction==\nStrong cryptography or cryptographically strong are general terms applied to cryptographic systems or components that are considered highly resistant to cryptanalysis.\nDemonstrating the resistance of any cryptographic scheme to attack is a complex matter, requiring extensive testing and reviews, preferably in a public forum. Good algorithms and protocols are required, and good system design and implementation is needed as well. For instance, the operating system on which the cryptographic software runs should be as carefully secured as possible. Users may handle passwords insecurely, or trust 'service' personnel overly much, or simply misuse the software. (See social engineering.) \"Strong\" thus is an imprecise term and may not apply in particular situations.\n\n== Background ==\nThe use of computers changed the process of cryptanalysis, famously with Bletchley Park's Colossus.  But just as the development of digital computers and electronics helped in cryptanalysis, it also made possible much more complex ciphers. It is typically the case that use of a quality cipher is very efficient, while breaking it requires an effort many orders of magnitude larger - making cryptanalysis so inefficient and impractical as to be effectively impossible.\nSince the publication of Data Encryption Standard, the Diffie-Hellman and RSA algorithm in the 1970s, cryptography has had deep connections with abstract mathematics and become a widely used tool in communications, computer networks, and computer security generally.\n\n== Cryptographically strong algorithms ==\nThis term \"cryptographically strong\" is often used to describe an encryption algorithm, and implies, in comparison to some other algorithm (which is thus cryptographically weak), greater resistance to attack. But it can also be used to describe hashing and unique identifier and filename creation algorithms. See for example the description of the Microsoft .NET runtime library function Path.GetRandomFileName. In this usage, the term means \"difficult to guess\".\nAn encryption algorithm is intended to be unbreakable (in which case it is as strong as it can ever be), but might be breakable (in which case it is as weak as it can ever be) so there is not, in principle, a continuum of strength as the idiom would seem to imply: Algorithm A is stronger than Algorithm B which is stronger than Algorithm C, and so on. The situation is made more complex, and less subsumable into a single strength metric, by the fact that there are many types of cryptanalytic attack and that any given algorithm is likely to force the attacker to do more work to break it when using one attack than another.\nThere is only one known unbreakable cryptographic system, the one-time pad, which is not generally possible to use because of the difficulties involved in exchanging one-time pads without their being compromised. So any encryption algorithm can be compared to the perfect algorithm, the one-time pad.\nThe usual sense in which this term is (loosely) used, is in reference to a particular attack, brute force key search \u2014 especially in explanations for newcomers to the field. Indeed, with this attack (always assuming keys to have been randomly chosen), there is a continuum of resistance depending on the length of the key used. But even so there are two major problems: many algorithms allow use of different length keys at different times, and any algorithm can forgo use of the full key length possible. Thus, Blowfish and RC5 are block cipher algorithms whose design specifically allowed for several key lengths, and who cannot therefore be said to have any particular strength with respect to brute force key search. Furthermore, US export regulations restrict key length for exportable cryptographic products and in several cases in the 1980s and 1990s (e.g., famously in the case of Lotus Notes' export approval) only partial keys were used, decreasing 'strength' against brute force attack for those (export) versions. More or less the same thing happened outside the US as well, as for example in the case of more than one of the cryptographic algorithms in the GSM cellular telephone standard.\nThe term is commonly used to convey that some algorithm is suitable for some task in cryptography or information security, but also resists cryptanalysis and has no, or fewer, security weaknesses. Tasks are varied, and might include:\n\ngenerating randomness\nencrypting data\nproviding a method to ensure data integrityCryptographically strong would seem to mean that the described method has some kind of maturity, perhaps even approved for use against different kinds of systematic attacks in theory and/or practice. Indeed, that the method may resist those attacks long enough to protect the information carried (and what stands behind the information) for a useful length of time. But due to the complexity and subtlety of the field, neither is almost ever the case. Since such assurances are not actually available in real practice, sleight of hand in language which implies that they are will generally be misleading.\nThere will always be uncertainty as advances (e.g., in cryptanalytic theory or merely affordable computer capacity) may reduce the effort needed to successfully use some attack method against an algorithm.\nIn addition, actual use of cryptographic algorithms requires their encapsulation in a cryptosystem, and doing so often introduces vulnerabilities which are not due to faults in an algorithm. For example, essentially all algorithms require random choice of keys, and any cryptosystem which does not provide such keys will be subject to attack regardless of any attack resistant qualities of the encryption algorithm(s) used.\n\n== Legal issues ==\n\nSince use of strong cryptography makes the job of intelligence agencies more difficult, many countries have enacted laws or regulations restricting or simply banning the non-official use of strong cryptography. For instance, the United States previously defined cryptographic products as munitions since World War II and prohibited export of cryptography beyond a certain 'strength' (measured in part by key size). However, the U.S. restrictions eased in the 1990s along with the rising need for secure e-Commerce and web-connected public software applications. The Clinton Administration issued new rules in 2000 allowing export of products containing strong cryptography, subject to certain limitations. President and government of Russia in 90s has issued a few decrees formally banning uncertified cryptosystems from use by government agencies. Presidential decree of 1995 also attempted to ban individuals from producing and selling cryptography systems without having appropriate license, but it wasn't enforced in any way as it was suspected to be contradictory the Russian Constitution of 1993 and wasn't a law per se. The decree of No.313 issued in 2012 further amended previous ones allowing to produce and distribute products with embedded cryptosystems and requiring no license as such, even though it declares some restrictions. France had quite strict regulations in this field, but has relaxed them in recent years.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n\n*** Strong ***\nPGP is generally considered an example of strong cryptography, with versions running under most popular operating systems and on various hardware platforms. The open source standard for PGP operations is OpenPGP, and GnuPG is an implementation of that standard from the FSF. However, the IDEA signature key in classical PGP is only 64 bits long, therefore no longer immune to collision attacks. OpenPGP therefore uses the SHA-2 hash function and AES cryptography.\nThe AES algorithm is considered strong after being selected in a lengthy selection process that was open and involved numerous tests.\nElliptic curve cryptography is another system which is based on a graphical geometrical function.\nThe latest version of TLS protocol (version 1.3), used to secure Internet transactions, is generally considered strong. Several vulnerabilities exist in previous versions, including demonstrated attacks such as POODLE. Worse, some cipher-suites are deliberately weakened to use a 40-bit effective key to allow export under pre-1996 U.S. regulations.\n\n\n*** Weak ***\nExamples that are not considered cryptographically strong include:\n\nThe DES, whose 56-bit keys allow attacks via exhaustive search.\nTriple-DES (3DES / EDE3-DES). see DES - this also suffers a meanwhile known phenomenon, called the \"sweet32\" or \"birthday oracle\"\nWired Equivalent Privacy which is subject to a number of attacks due to flaws in its design.\nSSL v2 and v3.  TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are also deprecated now [see RFC7525] because of irreversible flaws which are still present by design and because they do not provide elliptical handshake (EC) for ciphers, no modern cryptography, no CCM/GCM ciphermodes. TLS1.x are also announced off by the PCIDSS 3.2 for commercial business/banking implementations on web frontends. Only TLS1.2 and TLS 1.3 are allowed and recommended, modern ciphers, handshakes and ciphermodes must be used exclusively.\nThe MD5 and SHA-1 hash functions, no longer immune to collision attacks.\nThe RC4 stream cipher.\nThe Clipper Chip, a failed initiative of the U.S. government that included key escrow provisions, allowing the government to gain access to the keys.\nThe 40-bit Content Scramble System used to encrypt most DVD-Video discs.\nAlmost all classical ciphers.\nMost rotary ciphers, such as the Enigma machine.\nSome flawed RSA implementations exist, leading to weak, biased keys and other vulnerabilities (\"Bleichenbacher Oracle\", \"ROBOT\" attack).\nRSA keys weaker than 2048 bits.\nDH keys weaker than 2048 bits.\nECDHE keys weaker than 192 bits; also, not all known older named curves still in use for this are vetted \"safe\".\nDHE/EDHE is guessable/weak when using/re-using known default prime values on the server\nThe CBC block cipher mode of operation is considered weak for TLS (the CCM/GCM modes are now recommended).\n\nUsing the text above, answer these questions: What is strong cryptography and what are its general requirements?question: How have computers changed the field of cryptography and cryptanalysis?question: What is the significance of the term \"cryptographically strong\" when applied to encryption algorithms?question: What is the relationship between key length and resistance to brute force key search in encryption algorithms?question: What are some tasks that cryptographically strong algorithms may be used for in cryptography and information security?question: What are the challenges in providing assurances about the security of cryptographic algorithms and their implementations?question: How have governments restricted or banned the use of strong cryptography in various countries?question: What is the one-time pad and why is it considered unbreakable?question: What is the difference between a cryptographic algorithm and a cryptosystem?question: What are some examples of weak cryptographic algorithms and systems?question: What is the significance of key length in the security of encryption algorithms?question: What is the role of abstract mathematics in modern cryptography?question: What are some legal issues surrounding the use of strong cryptography in various countries?question: How can cryptographic algorithms be compared in terms of their security?question: What are some examples of cryptographically strong algorithms and systems?question: What are some potential vulnerabilities introduced by the encapsulation of cryptographic algorithms in cryptosystems?",

      "answers": "Strong cryptography, also known as cryptographically strong, refers to cryptographic systems or components that are highly resistant to cryptanalysis. These systems typically require good algorithms, protocols, and system design, as well as careful implementation and operation. Factors such as securely handling passwords, securing the operating system, and avoiding social engineering are also crucial.answer: The use of computers has significantly impacted cryptography and cryptanalysis. While computers have made cryptanalysis more efficient, they have also enabled the creation of more complex ciphers that are resistant to attack. Breaking these ciphers often requires an effort that is several orders of magnitude larger than using them, making cryptanalysis impractical.answer: When used to describe encryption algorithms, \"cryptographically strong\" implies greater resistance to attack compared to other algorithms. However, there is no true continuum of strength, as an algorithm is either unbreakable or breakable. The one-time pad is the only known unbreakable cryptographic system, and any encryption algorithm can be compared to it.answer: With brute force key search, there is a continuum of resistance depending on the length of the key used. However, several factors can complicate this relationship, such as the use of different key lengths at different times or not using the full key length possible. Additionally, algorithms like Blowfish and RC5 are specifically designed to allow for various key lengths, making it difficult to assign a single strength metric.answer: Cryptographically strong algorithms can be used for various tasks, such as generating randomness, encrypting data, and providing data integrity. These algorithms are expected to have some maturity, resist systematic attacks, and protect information for a useful length of time.answer: Due to the complexity and subtlety of the field, providing assurances about the security of cryptographic algorithms and their implementations is difficult. There is always uncertainty, as advances in cryptanalytic theory or computer capacity may reduce the effort required to successfully attack an algorithm. Additionally, actual use of cryptographic algorithms often introduces vulnerabilities unrelated to the algorithms themselves.answer: Many countries, such as the United States, Russia, and France, have enacted laws or regulations restricting or banning the non-official use of strong cryptography. The reasons for these restrictions often involve making the job of intelligence agencies easier or protecting national security interests.answer: The one-time pad is the only known unbreakable cryptographic system. It uses a random key that is as long as the plaintext message, and the key is used only once. Due to its randomness and one-time use, it is considered impossible to break using any cryptanalytic attack.answer: A cryptographic algorithm is a mathematical function used for encryption, decryption, or other cryptographic operations. A cryptosystem, on the other hand, is a complete system that includes algorithms, key management, and other components necessary for implementing cryptography in a secure manner.answer: Examples of weak cryptographic algorithms and systems include the DES, Triple-DES, Wired Equivalent Privacy, SSL v2 and v3, the MD5 and SHA-1 hash functions, the RC4 stream cipher, and the 40-bit Content Scramble System used to encrypt most DVD-Video discs.answer: Key length plays a crucial role in the security of encryption algorithms. Longer keys generally provide better resistance to brute force attacks, while shorter keys can be more susceptible to these attacks.answer: Modern cryptography has deep connections with abstract mathematics and is widely used in communications, computer networks, and computer security. Algorithms like the Diffie-Hellman and RSA, which were developed in the 1970s, have become foundational to the field.answer: Legal issues surrounding the use of strong cryptography include export restrictions, government access to encrypted data, and concerns about national security. In some cases, these legal issues have led to bans or restrictions on the use of strong cryptography.answer: Cryptographic algorithms can be compared based on their resistance to various cryptanalytic attacks, the complexity of the attacks required to break them, and their key lengths. Additionally, algorithms can be compared to the one-time pad, which is considered the perfect cryptographic system.answer: Examples of cryptographically strong algorithms and systems include the AES algorithm, elliptic curve cryptography, OpenPGP, GnuPG, and the latest version of the TLS protocol (version 1.3). These systems have been designed with strong security in mind and have undergone extensive testing and review.answer: Some potential vulnerabilities introduced by the encapsulation of cryptographic algorithms in cryptosystems include poor key management, weak key generation, and the failure to provide random keys. These vulnerabilities can lead to attacks on the cryptosystem, even if the underlying encryption algorithm is strong."

    "instruction": "Context: Zeus (malware)\n\n==Introduction==\nZeus, ZeuS, or Zbot  is a Trojan horse malware package that runs on versions of Microsoft Windows. While it can be used to carry out many malicious and criminal tasks, it is often used to steal banking information by man-in-the-browser keystroke logging and form grabbing. It is also used to install the CryptoLocker ransomware. Zeus is spread mainly through drive-by downloads and phishing schemes. First identified in July 2007 when it was used to steal information from the United States Department of Transportation, it became more widespread in March 2009. In June 2009 security company Prevx discovered that Zeus had compromised over 74,000 FTP accounts on websites of such companies as the Bank of America, NASA, Monster.com, ABC, Oracle, Play.com, Cisco, Amazon, and BusinessWeek. Similarly to Koobface, Zeus has also been used to trick victims of technical support scams into giving the scam artists money through pop-up messages that claim the user has a virus, when in reality they might have no viruses at all. The scammers may use programs such as Command prompt or Event viewer to make the user believe that their computer is infected.\n\n== Detection ==\nZeus is very difficult to detect even with up-to-date antivirus and other security software as it hides itself using stealth techniques. It is considered that this is the primary reason why the Zeus malware has become the largest botnet on the Internet: Damballa estimated that the malware infected 3.6 million PCs in the U.S. in 2009. Security experts are advising that businesses continue to offer training to users to teach them to not to click on hostile or suspicious links in emails or Web sites, and to keep antivirus protection up to date. Antivirus software does not claim to reliably prevent infection; for example Symantec's Browser Protection says that it can prevent \"some infection attempts\".\n\n== FBI crackdown ==\n\nIn October 2010 the US FBI announced that hackers in Eastern Europe had managed to infect computers around the world using Zeus. The virus was distributed in an e-mail, and when targeted individuals at businesses and municipalities opened the e-mail, the trojan software installed itself on the victimized computer, secretly capturing passwords, account numbers, and other data used to log into online banking accounts.\nThe hackers then used this information to take over the victims\u2019 bank accounts and make unauthorized transfers of thousands of dollars at a time, often routing the funds to other accounts controlled by a network of money mules, paid a commission. Many of the U.S. money mules were recruited from overseas. They created bank accounts using fake documents and false names. Once the money was in the accounts, the mules would either wire it back to their bosses in Eastern Europe, or withdraw it in cash and smuggle it out of the country.More than 100 people were arrested on charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and money laundering, over 90 in the US, and the others in the UK and Ukraine. Members of the ring had stolen $70 million.\nIn 2013 Hamza Bendelladj, known as Bx1 online, was arrested in Thailand  and deported to Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Early reports said that he was the mastermind behind ZeuS. He was accused of operating SpyEye (a bot functionally similar to ZeuS) botnets, and suspected of also operating ZeuS botnets. He was charged with several counts of wire fraud and computer fraud and abuse. Court papers allege that from 2009 to 2011 Bendelladj and others \"developed, marketed, and sold various versions of the SpyEye virus and component parts on the Internet and allowed cybercriminals to customize their purchases to include tailor-made methods of obtaining victims\u2019 personal and financial information\". It was also alleged that Bendelladj advertised SpyEye on Internet forums devoted to cyber- and other crimes and operated Command and Control servers. The charges in Georgia relate only to SpyEye, as a SpyEye botnet control server was based in Atlanta.\n\n== Possible retirement of creator ==\nIn late 2010, a number of Internet security vendors including McAfee and Internet Identity claimed that the creator of Zeus had said that he was retiring and had given the source code and rights to sell Zeus to his biggest competitor, the creator of the SpyEye trojan. However, those same experts warned the retirement was a ruse and expect the developer to return with new tricks.\nQuestions:\n\nHow does the Zeus malware propagate and what are its common targets?Question: What methods does Zeus use to evade detection, and why is it difficult to detect with antivirus software?Question: How was the Zeus malware used in bank fraud and money laundering schemes in 2010, and who were the primary parties involved in the conspiracy?Question: What is the relationship between Zeus and SpyEye botnets, and who was Hamza Bendelladj in the context of these malicious tools?Question: What were the alleged activities of Hamza Bendelladj and his associates during their SpyEye operation, and how were they connected to cybercriminal forums?Question: What were the concerns of security experts when the creator of Zeus announced his retirement in late 2010, and what did they expect would happen next?Question: How does the Zeus malware compromise FTP accounts on websites, and what were the consequences of its widespread use in March 2009?Question: How were technical support scams associated with the Zeus malware, and what tools did scammers use to deceive victims?Question: What was the initial purpose of the Zeus malware when it was first identified in July 2007, and how did it evolve over time?Question: How can businesses and individuals protect themselves from the Zeus malware, and what precautions do security experts recommend?Question: How did the FBI cooperate with international law enforcement agencies to dismantle the Zeus-related bank fraud and money laundering operation?Question: What is the role of money mules in Zeus-related bank fraud and money laundering schemes, and how were they recruited and compensated?Question: What are the potential consequences of a Zeus infection for both individuals and businesses, and how can they minimize the risks?Question: How did the creators of Zeus and SpyEye benefit from the alleged transfer of source code and rights in late 2010, and what did this mean for the cybercrime landscape?Question: What lessons can be learned from the history of the Zeus malware, and how can the cybersecurity community improve its response to similar threats in the future?.

The charges in Georgia relate only to SpyEye, as a SpyEye botnet control server was based in Atlanta.\n\n== Possible retirement of creator ==\nIn late 2010, a number of Internet security vendors including McAfee and Internet Identity claimed that the creator of Zeus had said that he was retiring and had given the source code and rights to sell Zeus to his biggest competitor, the creator of the SpyEye trojan. However, those same experts warned the retirement was a ruse and expect the developer to return with new tricks.",
      "questions": "How does the Zeus malware propagate and what are its common targets?Question: What methods does Zeus use to evade detection, and why is it difficult to detect with antivirus software?Question: How was the Zeus malware used in bank fraud and money laundering schemes in 2010, and who were the primary parties involved in the conspiracy?Question: What is the relationship between Zeus and SpyEye botnets, and who was Hamza Bendelladj in the context of these malicious tools?Question: What were the alleged activities of Hamza Bendelladj and his associates during their SpyEye operation, and how were they connected to cybercriminal forums?Question: What were the concerns of security experts when the creator of Zeus announced his retirement in late 2010, and what did they expect would happen next?Question: How does the Zeus malware compromise FTP accounts on websites, and what were the consequences of its widespread use in March 2009?Question: How were technical support scams associated with the Zeus malware, and what tools did scammers use to deceive victims?Question: What was the initial purpose of the Zeus malware when it was first identified in July 2007, and how did it evolve over time?Question: How can businesses and individuals protect themselves from the Zeus malware, and what precautions do security experts recommend?Question: How did the FBI cooperate with international law enforcement agencies to dismantle the Zeus-related bank fraud and money laundering operation?Question: What is the role of money mules in Zeus-related bank fraud and money laundering schemes, and how were they recruited and compensated?Question: What are the potential consequences of a Zeus infection for both individuals and businesses, and how can they minimize the risks?Question: How did the creators of Zeus and SpyEye benefit from the alleged transfer of source code and rights in late 2010, and what did this mean for the cybercrime landscape?Question: What lessons can be learned from the history of the Zeus malware, and how can the cybersecurity community improve its response to similar threats in the future?",
      "answers": "The Zeus malware primarily spreads through drive-by downloads and phishing schemes. It is often used to steal banking information by employing man-in-the-browser keystroke logging and form grabbing techniques. Some of its common targets include big corporations, government entities, and various businesses such as Bank of America, NASA, Monster.com, ABC, Oracle, Play.com, Cisco, Amazon, and BusinessWeek.Answer: Zeus employs stealth techniques to hide itself, making it challenging to detect even with updated antivirus and security software. Damballa estimated that the malware had infected 3.6 million PCs in the U.S. in 2009. Antivirus software does not guarantee prevention of infection, as it only claims to prevent \"some infection attempts\".Answer: In 2010, hackers used Zeus to infect computers worldwide, stealing banking information and making unauthorized transfers of thousands of dollars at a time. The stolen funds were often routed through a network of money mules, who were paid a commission. More than 100 people were arrested in the US, the UK, and Ukraine, with members of the ring having stolen $70 million.Answer: Although initially unrelated, the creator of Zeus allegedly retired in late 2010 and gave the source code and rights to sell Zeus to the creator of SpyEye. Hamza Bendelladj, known online as Bx1, was a prominent figure in the SpyEye botnet operation. He was accused of operating SpyEye botnets and suspected of involvement with Zeus botnets as well. Bendelladj was charged with wire fraud and computer fraud and abuse in Atlanta, Georgia, in 2013.Answer: Hamza Bendelladj and his associates allegedly developed, marketed, and sold various versions of the SpyEye virus and its components on the Internet, allowing cybercriminals to customize their purchases. They advertised SpyEye on cybercrime-dedicated forums and operated Command and Control servers. The charges against Bendelladj relate only to SpyEye, as a SpyEye botnet control server was based in Atlanta.Answer: Security experts, including McAfee and Internet Identity, were skeptical about the retirement of the Zeus creator and cautioned that it might be a ruse. They expected the developer to return with new malicious tricks.Answer: The Zeus malware compromises FTP accounts on websites by exploiting vulnerabilities, enabling it to steal sensitive information. In March 2009, the widespread use of Zeus led to the compromise of over 74,000 FTP accounts on websites of various companies, banks, and organizations.Answer: Technical support scams were linked to Zeus through pop-up messages that claimed users had viruses, leading victims to give scam artists money. Scammers used programs like Command prompt or Event viewer to make users believe their computers were infected.Answer: Initially identified in July 2007, Zeus was used to steal information from the United States Department of Transportation. Over time, it evolved into a widespread tool for stealing banking information and installing CryptoLocker ransomware.Answer: Businesses and individuals can protect themselves from Zeus by keeping antivirus protection up to date and offering training to users to avoid clicking on hostile or suspicious links in emails or websites. However, antivirus software does not guarantee prevention of infection. Security experts advise users to remain vigilant and cautious when dealing with potentially malicious content.Answer: The FBI collaborated with law enforcement agencies in the UK and Ukraine to arrest more than 100 individuals involved in the conspiracy to commit bank fraud and money laundering using the Zeus malware. This international cooperation aimed to disrupt the criminal network and bring the perpetrators to justice.Answer: Money mules played a crucial role in Zeus-related bank fraud and money laundering schemes by creating bank accounts using fake documents and false names to receive stolen funds. They were then responsible for wiring the funds back to their bosses in Eastern Europe or withdrawing it in cash and smuggling it out of the country. Many of the U.S. money mules were recruited from overseas, and they were compensated with a commission for their services.Answer: A Zeus infection can result in stolen banking information, unauthorized transfers, and ransomware installation, causing significant financial and reputational damage to both individuals and businesses. Minimizing the risks involves maintaining up-to-date antivirus protection, offering user training, and avoiding suspicious links in emails and websites.Answer: The alleged transfer of source code and rights from the Zeus creator to the SpyEye creator allowed both parties to benefit from each other's malware technologies. This merger potentially enhanced their malicious capabilities and contributed to the evolution of the cybercrime landscape, as the two most notorious banking trojans combined forces.Answer: The history of the Zeus malware teaches the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures, continuous user education, and international cooperation in addressing cybercrime. The cybersecurity community can improve its response to similar threats by staying informed about the latest tactics, tools, and procedures used by cybercriminals and adapting defense strategies accordingly."

    "instruction": "Shell Control Box\n\n==Introduction==\nShell Control Box (SCB) is a network security appliance that controls privileged access to remote IT systems, records activities in replayable audit trails, and prevents malicious actions. For example, it records as a system administrator updates a file server or a third-party network operator configures a router. The recorded audit trails can be replayed like a movie to review the events as they occurred. The content of the audit trails is indexed to make searching for events and automatic reporting possible.\nSCB is a Linux-based device developed by Balabit. It is an application level proxy gateway. In 2017, Balabit changed the name of the product to Privileged Session Management (PSM) and repositioned it as the core module of its Privileged Access Management solution.\n\n\n\n== Main Features ==\nBalabit\u2019s Privileged Session Management (PSM), Shell Control Box (SCB) is a device that controls, monitors, and audits remote administrative access to servers and network devices. It is a tool to oversee system administrators by controlling the encrypted connections used for administration. PSM (SCB) has full control over the SSH, RDP, Telnet, TN3270, TN5250, Citrix ICA, and VNC connections, providing a framework (with solid boundaries) for the work of the administrators.\n\n\n*** Gateway Authentication ***\nPSM (SCB) acts as an authentication gateway, enforcing strong authentication before users access IT assets. PSM can also integrate to user directories (for example, a Microsoft Active Directory) to resolve the group memberships of the users who access the protected servers. Credentials for accessing the server are retrieved transparently from PSM\u2019s credential store or a third-party password management system by PSM impersonating the authenticated user. This automatic password retrieval protects the confidentiality of passwords as users can never access them.\n\n\n*** Access Control ***\nPSM controls and audits privileged access over the most wide-spread protocols such as SSH, RDP, or HTTP(s). The detailed access management helps to control who can access what and when on servers. It is also possible to control advanced features of the protocols, like the type of channels permitted. For example, unneeded channels like file transfer or file sharing can be disabled, reducing the security risk on the server. With PSM policies for privileged access can be enforced in one single system.\n\n\n*** 4-eyes Authorization ***\nTo avoid accidental misconfiguration and other human errors, PSM supports the 4-eyes authorization principle. This is achieved by requiring an authorizer to allow administrators to access the server. The authorizer also has the possibility to monitor \u2013 and terminate - the session of the administrator in real-time, as if they were watching the same screen.\n\n\n*** Real-time Monitoring and Session Termination ***\nPSM can monitor the network traffic in real time, and execute various actions if a certain pattern (for example, a suspicious command, window title or text) appears on the screen. PSM can also detect specific patterns such as credit card numbers. In case of detecting a suspicious user action, PSM can send an e-mail alert or immediately terminate the connection. For example, PSM can block the connection before a destructive administrator command, such as the \u201erm\u201d comes into effect.\n\n\n*** Session Recording ***\nPSM makes user activities traceable by recording them in tamper-proof and confidential audit trails. It records the selected sessions into encrypted, timestamped, and digitally signed audit trails. Audit trails can be browsed online, or followed real-time to monitor the activities of the users. PSM replays the recorded sessions just like a movie \u2013 actions of the users can be seen exactly as they appeared on their monitor. The Balabit Desktop Player enables fast forwarding during replays, searching for events (for example, typed commands or pressing Enter) and texts seen by the user. In the case of any problems (database manipulation, unexpected shutdown, etc.) the circumstances of the event are readily available in the trails, thus the cause of the incident can be identified. In addition to recording audit trails, transferred files can be also recorded and extracted for further analysis.\n\nUsing the text above, answer these questions: How does the Shell Control Box (SCB) ensure secure access to remote IT systems?Question: What is the role of the 4-eyes authorization principle in SCB?Question: How does SCB handle the confidentiality of passwords?Question: How does SCB manage advanced features of the protocols it supports?Question: How does SCB ensure traceability of user activities?Question: How does SCB handle file transfers during sessions?Question: How does SCB detect and respond to suspicious user actions?Question: How does SCB integrate with user directories?Question: What is the role of the Balabit Desktop Player in SCB?Question: How does SCB help prevent human errors during administration?Question: How does SCB handle the storage and protection of passwords?Question: How does SCB ensure that only authorized users can access protected servers?Question: How does SCB help reduce the security risk on the server?Question: How does SCB ensure the integrity of recorded sessions?Question: How does SCB help organizations comply with regulatory requirements for auditing and monitoring?",

    "instruction": "Context: Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations\n\n==Introduction==\nCybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) is a framework developed to review the cybersecurity capacity maturity of a country across five dimensions. The five dimensions covers the capacity area required by a country to improve its cybersecurity posture. It was designed by Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre (GCSCC) of University of Oxford and first of its kind framework for countries to review their cybersecurity capacity, benchmark it and receive recommendation for improvement. Each dimension is divided into factors and the factors broken down into aspects. The review process includes rating each factor or aspect along five stages that represents the how well a country is doing in respect to that factor or aspect. The recommendations includes guidance on areas of cybersecurity that needs improvement and thus will require more focus and investment. As at June, 2021, the framework has been adopted and implemented in over 80 countries worldwide. Its deployment has been catalyzed by the involvement of international organizations such as the Organization of American States (OAS), the World Bank (WB), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the Commonwealth Telecommunications Union (CTO) and Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE).\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe World Summit on Information Society identified capacity building in the realm of cybersecurity as one of the pillars necessary to reap the benefits of processes and services digitalization, especially in developing nations. The International Telecommunication Union reported that developing nations lack the necessary cybersecurity capacity to manage ICT risk and respond to cyberthreats. Because cyberattacks and vulnerabilities in one nation can affect other parts of the world, some maturity models were developed to assess the cybersecurity capacity of nations and benchmark the capacity level. One of such models is the CMM.The CMM was developed in 2014, through collaborative effort between the GCSCC and over 200 experts from academia, international and regional organizations and the private sector. CMM assesses the capacity of a country from five identified area called dimensions with the objective of improving the coverage, measurement and effectiveness of cyber security capacity building within five levels of progression. Benchmarking of a country's cybersecurity capacity involves reviewing its initiatives and activities against the entire CMM and across all Dimensions. According to the report of a regional CMM assessment of Latin America and the Caribbean, CMM assessment aims to identify cybersecurity gaps and discover actions that works.Since 2014, the CMM has undergone revisions and it is intended to be a living model that remain relevant to every aspect of cybersecurity needs at the national level.\n\n\n*** Structure ***\n\nThe framework consists of dimensions, factors, aspects, indicators and stages.Dimension.\nThe dimensions represent the scope of a country's cybersecurity capacity that will be assessed by CMM and it is broken down into factors. The dimensions are not stand alone, rather they are related to one another because a nation's performance in one dimension of capacity may require input from another dimension.The five dimensions from the 2021 version are:\nDeveloping cybersecurity policy and strategy - This dimension examines how a nation fares in terms of availability and implementation of Cybersecurity policies and strategy.\nEncouraging responsible cybersecurity culture within society - This dimension views how well citizens of a nation are familiar with digital risk and the provision of a viable channel for reporting cybercriminal activities.\nBuilding cybersecurity knowledge and capabilities - This dimension explores structures in place for cybersecurity awareness and education within the nation.\nCreating effective legal and regulatory frameworks - Examine the ability of a country to develop, ratify and enforce cybersecurity and privacy related legislation.\nControlling risks through standards and technologies - This dimension examines the common use of cybersecurity standard and presence of structures for development of such technologies.Factors:\nThe factors are the important component of a country's capacity whose maturity level is measured and there are 23 factors in the latest version with each having one\nor more aspects Aspects:\nThese are smaller subdivision of factors which helps with understanding each factor and help in evidence gathering and measurement.Indicators:\nEach Indicator define the actions that suggest that a nation has maintain a specific stage of maturity. The level of maturity assigned to an aspect depend on the ability of a nation to fulfill the steps and actions listed as its indicator. Evidence will be required to be provided before a particular stage can be attained. It is either an\nevidence is available or not and to move to a higher stage, all of the Indicators within a particular stage will need to have been fulfilled.Stage:\nThis represent how matured a nations is on each factor or aspect. There are 5 stages of maturity; start-up, formative, established, strategic and dynamic. For a nation to met a particular maturity stage, it has to fulfill some indicators.\nStart-up - At this stage, a nation has no presentable evidence to show existence of cybersecurity initiatives.\nFormative - Evidence is available to proof initiatives on some of the aspects, however these efforts may be at the initiation state or be ad hoc.\nEstablished - The is evidence to show that the aspect is defined, functional and working but adequate resource allocation is lacking.\nStrategic - Aspect has been prioritized based on national need.\nDynamic - A working adaptable cybersecurity strategy is available, which is evidenced by global leadership on cybersecurity issues, agility of decision-making, and resources allocation.\n\n\n*** Development ***\nThe first version of the framework was released in 2014. Based on pilot assessments conducted in six countries, improvements were made on the model and an updated version was published in 2017. Based on lessons learnt over the years from CMM deployments and consultations from GCSCC Expert Advisory Panel, strategic, regional and implementation partners of the GCSCC, and other experts from academia, international and regional organisations, governments, the private sector, and civil society, an updated version was released in 2021.The dimensions, factors and aspects have changed overtime between CMM versions.\nThe 2014 has 5 dimensions and 21 factors. The 2017 version has 5 dimensions with 24 factors. The 2021 version has 5 dimensions and 23 factors.Table 1 lists the dimensions across the three versions.\n\nTable 2 list the factors for each version.\n\n== The Review Process ==\nCMM review process has 3 stages.Stage 1: Desk research and country-partner identification.\nThe first step is selection of a country. A CMM review can be requested by a country or a country can be selected for assessment by an international or regional organization.Once a nation is selected for assessment, a relationship is established with the host country and necessary stakeholders identified from academia, civil societies, government ministries/department, international organizations and the private sector.Stage 2: The Review\nThe actual review with the stakeholders is a three-day consultation process and based on the five dimensions, multiple teams are created across stakeholders .Open discussions or focus groups method is applied to ask and answers questions. Questions and answer can also be collected using online tool. Inability to provide evidence for all indicators under each aspect will result in a lower maturity level for that aspect.Remote follow-up sessions or email communication may be used for further data collection.Stage 3: Review Report\nA report is presented to the country's government and it is at the discretion of that country to make it publicly available or not.\n\n== The recommendation ==\nThe output of the CMM assessment is a report which details the gaps identified from each aspect and the present maturity level of each indicator. The assessment report is the property of the assessed nation  and they choose whether to make it public or not. Depending on a nation's need, it recommend areas that should be given priority in terms of resource allocation.The report include a sunburst representation of the cybersecurity capacity of the nation, reason for placing each factor or aspect in a particular stage and recommendation of what can be done to move up along the maturity stage.Sample results from some of the reviews are available on GCSCC's website.\n\n== Nations with CMM Assessment ==\nThe GCSCC website has the list of nations that has been assessed, which have been listed below.Albania\nAntigua and Barbuda\nArgentina\nArmenia\nBahamas\nBangladesh\nBarbados\nBelize\nBenin\nBhutan\nBolivia\nBosnia and Herzegovina\nBotswana\nBrazil\nBurkina Faso\nCabo Verde\nCameroon\nChile\nColombia\nCook Islands\nCosta Rica\nCyprus\nDominica\nDominican Republic\nEcuador\nEl Salvador\nEswatini\nFiji\nGambia\nGeorgia\nGhana\nGrenada\nGuatemala\nGuyana\nHaiti\nHonduras\nIceland\nIndonesia\nIvory Coast\nJamaica\nKiribati\nKosovo\nKyrgyzstan\nLesotho\nLiberia\nLithuania\nMadagascar\nMalawi\nMauritius\nMexico\nMicronesia\nMontenegro\nMorocco\nMozambique\nMyanmar\nNamibia\nNicaragua\nNiger\nNigeria\nNorth Macedonia\nPanama\nPapua New Guinea\nParaguay\nPeru\nRwanda\nSaint Kitts and Nevis\nSaint Lucia\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines\nSamoa\nSenegal\nSerbia\nSierra Leone\nSomalia\nSri Lanka\nSuriname\nSwitzerland\nTanzania\nThailand\nTonga\nTrinidad and Tobago\nTunisia\nTuvalu\nUganda\nUnited Kingdom\nUruguay\nVanuatu\nVenezuela\nZambia\nQuestions:\n\nHow is the CMM framework structured and what are its key components?question: How does the CMM framework assess the cybersecurity capacity of a country?question: How many dimensions does the CMM framework have and what are they?question: What is the purpose of the CMM framework and how was it developed?question: How is the maturity of a country's cybersecurity capacity measured in the CMM framework?question: How often has the CMM framework been updated since its initial release in 2014?question: How does the CMM framework identify cybersecurity gaps in a country?question: What organizations are involved in the deployment of the CMM framework worldwide?question: How are stakeholders involved in the CMM review process?question: What is the output of the CMM assessment?question: How does the CMM framework help in improving the coverage, measurement, and effectiveness of cyber security capacity building?question: How can a nation move up along the maturity stage in the CMM framework?question: What is the role of the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre (GCSCC) in the development and deployment of the CMM framework?question: How does the CMM framework help in benchmarking a country's cybersecurity capacity?question: How does the CMM framework help in improving a nation's cybersecurity posture?.

      "context": "Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations\n\n==Introduction==\nCybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) is a framework developed to review the cybersecurity capacity maturity of a country across five dimensions. The five dimensions covers the capacity area required by a country to improve its cybersecurity posture. It was designed by Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre (GCSCC) of University of Oxford and first of its kind framework for countries to review their cybersecurity capacity, benchmark it and receive recommendation for improvement. Each dimension is divided into factors and the factors broken down into aspects. The review process includes rating each factor or aspect along five stages that represents the how well a country is doing in respect to that factor or aspect. The recommendations includes guidance on areas of cybersecurity that needs improvement and thus will require more focus and investment. As at June, 2021, the framework has been adopted and implemented in over 80 countries worldwide. Its deployment has been catalyzed by the involvement of international organizations such as the Organization of American States (OAS), the World Bank (WB), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the Commonwealth Telecommunications Union (CTO) and Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE).\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe World Summit on Information Society identified capacity building in the realm of cybersecurity as one of the pillars necessary to reap the benefits of processes and services digitalization, especially in developing nations. The International Telecommunication Union reported that developing nations lack the necessary cybersecurity capacity to manage ICT risk and respond to cyberthreats. Because cyberattacks and vulnerabilities in one nation can affect other parts of the world, some maturity models were developed to assess the cybersecurity capacity of nations and benchmark the capacity level. One of such models is the CMM.The CMM was developed in 2014, through collaborative effort between the GCSCC and over 200 experts from academia, international and regional organizations and the private sector. CMM assesses the capacity of a country from five identified area called dimensions with the objective of improving the coverage, measurement and effectiveness of cyber security capacity building within five levels of progression. Benchmarking of a country's cybersecurity capacity involves reviewing its initiatives and activities against the entire CMM and across all Dimensions. According to the report of a regional CMM assessment of Latin America and the Caribbean, CMM assessment aims to identify cybersecurity gaps and discover actions that works.Since 2014, the CMM has undergone revisions and it is intended to be a living model that remain relevant to every aspect of cybersecurity needs at the national level.\n\n\n*** Structure ***\n\nThe framework consists of dimensions, factors, aspects, indicators and stages.Dimension.\nThe dimensions represent the scope of a country's cybersecurity capacity that will be assessed by CMM and it is broken down into factors. The dimensions are not stand alone, rather they are related to one another because a nation's performance in one dimension of capacity may require input from another dimension.The five dimensions from the 2021 version are:\nDeveloping cybersecurity policy and strategy - This dimension examines how a nation fares in terms of availability and implementation of Cybersecurity policies and strategy.\nEncouraging responsible cybersecurity culture within society - This dimension views how well citizens of a nation are familiar with digital risk and the provision of a viable channel for reporting cybercriminal activities.\nBuilding cybersecurity knowledge and capabilities - This dimension explores structures in place for cybersecurity awareness and education within the nation.\nCreating effective legal and regulatory frameworks - Examine the ability of a country to develop, ratify and enforce cybersecurity and privacy related legislation.\nControlling risks through standards and technologies - This dimension examines the common use of cybersecurity standard and presence of structures for development of such technologies.Factors:\nThe factors are the important component of a country's capacity whose maturity level is measured and there are 23 factors in the latest version with each having one\nor more aspects Aspects:\nThese are smaller subdivision of factors which helps with understanding each factor and help in evidence gathering and measurement.Indicators:\nEach Indicator define the actions that suggest that a nation has maintain a specific stage of maturity. The level of maturity assigned to an aspect depend on the ability of a nation to fulfill the steps and actions listed as its indicator. Evidence will be required to be provided before a particular stage can be attained. It is either an\nevidence is available or not and to move to a higher stage, all of the Indicators within a particular stage will need to have been fulfilled.Stage:\nThis represent how matured a nations is on each factor or aspect. There are 5 stages of maturity; start-up, formative, established, strategic and dynamic. For a nation to met a particular maturity stage, it has to fulfill some indicators.\nStart-up - At this stage, a nation has no presentable evidence to show existence of cybersecurity initiatives.\nFormative - Evidence is available to proof initiatives on some of the aspects, however these efforts may be at the initiation state or be ad hoc.\nEstablished - The is evidence to show that the aspect is defined, functional and working but adequate resource allocation is lacking.\nStrategic - Aspect has been prioritized based on national need.\nDynamic - A working adaptable cybersecurity strategy is available, which is evidenced by global leadership on cybersecurity issues, agility of decision-making, and resources allocation.\n\n\n*** Development ***\nThe first version of the framework was released in 2014. Based on pilot assessments conducted in six countries, improvements were made on the model and an updated version was published in 2017. Based on lessons learnt over the years from CMM deployments and consultations from GCSCC Expert Advisory Panel, strategic, regional and implementation partners of the GCSCC, and other experts from academia, international and regional organisations, governments, the private sector, and civil society, an updated version was released in 2021.The dimensions, factors and aspects have changed overtime between CMM versions.\nThe 2014 has 5 dimensions and 21 factors. The 2017 version has 5 dimensions with 24 factors. The 2021 version has 5 dimensions and 23 factors.Table 1 lists the dimensions across the three versions.\n\nTable 2 list the factors for each version.\n\n== The Review Process ==\nCMM review process has 3 stages.Stage 1: Desk research and country-partner identification.\nThe first step is selection of a country. A CMM review can be requested by a country or a country can be selected for assessment by an international or regional organization.Once a nation is selected for assessment, a relationship is established with the host country and necessary stakeholders identified from academia, civil societies, government ministries/department, international organizations and the private sector.Stage 2: The Review\nThe actual review with the stakeholders is a three-day consultation process and based on the five dimensions, multiple teams are created across stakeholders .Open discussions or focus groups method is applied to ask and answers questions. Questions and answer can also be collected using online tool. Inability to provide evidence for all indicators under each aspect will result in a lower maturity level for that aspect.Remote follow-up sessions or email communication may be used for further data collection.Stage 3: Review Report\nA report is presented to the country's government and it is at the discretion of that country to make it publicly available or not.\n\n== The recommendation ==\nThe output of the CMM assessment is a report which details the gaps identified from each aspect and the present maturity level of each indicator. The assessment report is the property of the assessed nation  and they choose whether to make it public or not. Depending on a nation's need, it recommend areas that should be given priority in terms of resource allocation.The report include a sunburst representation of the cybersecurity capacity of the nation, reason for placing each factor or aspect in a particular stage and recommendation of what can be done to move up along the maturity stage.Sample results from some of the reviews are available on GCSCC's website.\n\n== Nations with CMM Assessment ==\nThe GCSCC website has the list of nations that has been assessed, which have been listed below.Albania\nAntigua and Barbuda\nArgentina\nArmenia\nBahamas\nBangladesh\nBarbados\nBelize\nBenin\nBhutan\nBolivia\nBosnia and Herzegovina\nBotswana\nBrazil\nBurkina Faso\nCabo Verde\nCameroon\nChile\nColombia\nCook Islands\nCosta Rica\nCyprus\nDominica\nDominican Republic\nEcuador\nEl Salvador\nEswatini\nFiji\nGambia\nGeorgia\nGhana\nGrenada\nGuatemala\nGuyana\nHaiti\nHonduras\nIceland\nIndonesia\nIvory Coast\nJamaica\nKiribati\nKosovo\nKyrgyzstan\nLesotho\nLiberia\nLithuania\nMadagascar\nMalawi\nMauritius\nMexico\nMicronesia\nMontenegro\nMorocco\nMozambique\nMyanmar\nNamibia\nNicaragua\nNiger\nNigeria\nNorth Macedonia\nPanama\nPapua New Guinea\nParaguay\nPeru\nRwanda\nSaint Kitts and Nevis\nSaint Lucia\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines\nSamoa\nSenegal\nSerbia\nSierra Leone\nSomalia\nSri Lanka\nSuriname\nSwitzerland\nTanzania\nThailand\nTonga\nTrinidad and Tobago\nTunisia\nTuvalu\nUganda\nUnited Kingdom\nUruguay\nVanuatu\nVenezuela\nZambia",

    "instruction": "Context: Forward secrecy\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, forward secrecy (FS), also known as perfect forward secrecy (PFS), is a feature of specific key-agreement protocols that gives assurances that session keys will not be compromised even if long-term secrets used in the session key exchange are compromised. For HTTPS, the long-term secret is typically the private key of the server. Forward secrecy protects past sessions against future compromises of keys or passwords. By generating a unique session key for every session a user initiates, the compromise of a single session key will not affect any data other than that exchanged in the specific session protected by that particular key. This by itself is not sufficient for forward secrecy which additionally requires that a long-term secret compromise does not affect the security of past session keys.\nForward secrecy protects data on the transport layer of a network that uses common transport layer security protocols, including OpenSSL, when its long-term secret keys are compromised, as with the Heartbleed security bug. If forward secrecy is used, encrypted communications and sessions recorded in the past cannot be retrieved and decrypted should long-term secret keys or passwords be compromised in the future, even if the adversary actively interfered, for example via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.\nThe value of forward secrecy is that it protects past communication. This reduces the motivation for attackers to compromise keys. For instance, if an attacker learns a long-term key, but the compromise is detected and the long-term key is revoked and updated, relatively little information is leaked in a forward secure system.\nThe value of forward secrecy depends on the assumed capabilities of an adversary. Forward secrecy has value if an adversary is assumed to be able to obtain secret keys from a device (read access) but is either detected or unable to modify the way session keys are generated in the device (full compromise).  In some cases an adversary who can read long-term keys from a device may also be able to modify the functioning of the session key generator, as in the backdoored Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator. If an adversary can make the random number generator predictable, then past traffic will be protected but all future traffic will be compromised.\nThe value of forward secrecy is limited not only by the assumption that an adversary will attack a server by only stealing keys and not modifying the random number generator used by the server but it is also limited by the assumption that the adversary will only passively collect traffic on the communications link and not be active using a man-in-the-middle attack.  Forward secrecy typically uses an ephemeral Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange to prevent reading past traffic.  The ephemeral Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange is often signed by the server using a static signing key.  If an adversary can steal (or obtain through a court order) this static (long term) signing key, the adversary can masquerade as the server to the client and as the client to the server and implement a classic man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n== Definition ==\nAn encryption system has the property of forward secrecy if plain-text (decrypted) inspection of the data exchange that occurs during key agreement phase of session initiation does not reveal the key that was used to encrypt the remainder of the session.\n\n== Example ==\nThe following is a hypothetical example of a simple instant messaging protocol that employs forward secrecy:\n\nAlice and Bob each generate a pair of long-term, asymmetric public and private keys, then verify public-key fingerprints in person or over an already-authenticated channel. Verification establishes with confidence that the claimed owner of a public key is the actual owner.\nAlice and Bob use a key exchange algorithm such as Diffie\u2013Hellman, to securely agree on an ephemeral session key. They use the keys from step 1 only to authenticate one another during this process.\nAlice sends Bob a message, encrypting it with a symmetric cipher using the session key negotiated in step 2.\nBob decrypts Alice's message using the key negotiated in step 2.\nThe process repeats for each new message sent, starting from step 2 (and switching Alice and Bob's roles as sender/receiver as appropriate). Step 1 is never repeated.Forward secrecy (achieved by generating new session keys for each message) ensures that past communications cannot be decrypted if one of the keys generated in an iteration of step 2 is compromised, since such a key is only used to encrypt a single message. Forward secrecy also ensures that past communications cannot be decrypted if the long-term private keys from step 1 are compromised. However, masquerading as Alice or Bob would be possible going forward if this occurred, possibly compromising all future messages.\n\n== Attacks ==\nForward secrecy is designed to prevent the compromise of a long-term secret key from affecting the confidentiality of past conversations. However, forward secrecy cannot defend against a successful cryptanalysis of the underlying ciphers being used, since a cryptanalysis consists of finding a way to decrypt an encrypted message without the key, and forward secrecy only protects keys, not the ciphers themselves. A patient attacker can capture a conversation whose confidentiality is protected through the use of public-key cryptography and wait until the underlying cipher is broken (e.g. large quantum computers could be created which allow the discrete logarithm problem to be computed quickly). This would allow the recovery of old plaintexts even in a system employing forward secrecy.\nNon-interactive forward-secure key exchange protocols face additional threats that are not relevant to interactive protocols. In a message suppression attack, an attacker in control of the network may itself store messages while preventing them from reaching the intended recipient; as the messages are never received, the corresponding private keys may not be destroyed or punctured, so a compromise of the private key can lead to successful decryption. Proactively retiring private keys on a schedule mitigates, but does not eliminate, this attack. In a malicious key exhaustion attack, the attacker sends many messages to the recipient and exhausts the private key material, forcing a protocol to choose between failing closed (and enabling denial of service attacks) or failing open (and giving up some amount of forward secrecy).\n\n== Non-interactive forward secrecy ==\nMost key exchange protocols are interactive, requiring bidirectional communication between the parties. A protocol that permits the sender to transmit data without first needing to receive any replies from the recipient may be called non-interactive, or asynchronous, or zero round trip (0-RTT).Interactivity is onerous for some applications\u2014for example, in a secure messaging system, it may be desirable to have a store-and-forward implementation, rather than requiring sender and recipient to be online at the same time; loosening the bidirectionality requirement can also improve performance even where it is not a strict requirement, for example at connection establishment or resumption. These use cases have stimulated interest in non-interactive key exchange, and, as forward security is a desirable property in a key exchange protocol, in non-interactive forward secrecy. This combination has been identified as desirable since at least 1996. However, combining forward secrecy and non-interactivity has proven challenging; it had been suspected that forward secrecy with protection against replay attacks was impossible non-interactively, but it has been shown to be possible to achieve all three desiderata.Broadly, two approaches to non-interactive forward secrecy have been explored, pre-computed keys and puncturable encryption.With pre-computed keys, many key pairs are created and the public keys shared, with the private keys destroyed after a message has been received using the corresponding public key. This approach has been deployed as part of the Signal protocol.In puncturable encryption, the recipient modifies their private key after receiving a message in such a way that the new private key cannot read the message but the public key is unchanged. Ross J. Anderson informally described a puncturable encryption scheme for forward secure key exchange in 1997, and Green & Miers (2015) formally described such a system, building on the related scheme of Canetti, Halevi & Katz (2003), which modifies the private key according to a schedule so that messages sent in previous periods cannot be read with the private key from a later period.

      "context": "Forward secrecy\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, forward secrecy (FS), also known as perfect forward secrecy (PFS), is a feature of specific key-agreement protocols that gives assurances that session keys will not be compromised even if long-term secrets used in the session key exchange are compromised. For HTTPS, the long-term secret is typically the private key of the server. Forward secrecy protects past sessions against future compromises of keys or passwords. By generating a unique session key for every session a user initiates, the compromise of a single session key will not affect any data other than that exchanged in the specific session protected by that particular key. This by itself is not sufficient for forward secrecy which additionally requires that a long-term secret compromise does not affect the security of past session keys.\nForward secrecy protects data on the transport layer of a network that uses common transport layer security protocols, including OpenSSL, when its long-term secret keys are compromised, as with the Heartbleed security bug. If forward secrecy is used, encrypted communications and sessions recorded in the past cannot be retrieved and decrypted should long-term secret keys or passwords be compromised in the future, even if the adversary actively interfered, for example via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.\nThe value of forward secrecy is that it protects past communication. This reduces the motivation for attackers to compromise keys. For instance, if an attacker learns a long-term key, but the compromise is detected and the long-term key is revoked and updated, relatively little information is leaked in a forward secure system.\nThe value of forward secrecy depends on the assumed capabilities of an adversary. Forward secrecy has value if an adversary is assumed to be able to obtain secret keys from a device (read access) but is either detected or unable to modify the way session keys are generated in the device (full compromise).  In some cases an adversary who can read long-term keys from a device may also be able to modify the functioning of the session key generator, as in the backdoored Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator. If an adversary can make the random number generator predictable, then past traffic will be protected but all future traffic will be compromised.\nThe value of forward secrecy is limited not only by the assumption that an adversary will attack a server by only stealing keys and not modifying the random number generator used by the server but it is also limited by the assumption that the adversary will only passively collect traffic on the communications link and not be active using a man-in-the-middle attack.  Forward secrecy typically uses an ephemeral Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange to prevent reading past traffic.  The ephemeral Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange is often signed by the server using a static signing key.  If an adversary can steal (or obtain through a court order) this static (long term) signing key, the adversary can masquerade as the server to the client and as the client to the server and implement a classic man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n== Definition ==\nAn encryption system has the property of forward secrecy if plain-text (decrypted) inspection of the data exchange that occurs during key agreement phase of session initiation does not reveal the key that was used to encrypt the remainder of the session.\n\n== Example ==\nThe following is a hypothetical example of a simple instant messaging protocol that employs forward secrecy:\n\nAlice and Bob each generate a pair of long-term, asymmetric public and private keys, then verify public-key fingerprints in person or over an already-authenticated channel. Verification establishes with confidence that the claimed owner of a public key is the actual owner.\nAlice and Bob use a key exchange algorithm such as Diffie\u2013Hellman, to securely agree on an ephemeral session key. They use the keys from step 1 only to authenticate one another during this process.\nAlice sends Bob a message, encrypting it with a symmetric cipher using the session key negotiated in step 2.\nBob decrypts Alice's message using the key negotiated in step 2.\nThe process repeats for each new message sent, starting from step 2 (and switching Alice and Bob's roles as sender/receiver as appropriate). Step 1 is never repeated.Forward secrecy (achieved by generating new session keys for each message) ensures that past communications cannot be decrypted if one of the keys generated in an iteration of step 2 is compromised, since such a key is only used to encrypt a single message. Forward secrecy also ensures that past communications cannot be decrypted if the long-term private keys from step 1 are compromised. However, masquerading as Alice or Bob would be possible going forward if this occurred, possibly compromising all future messages.\n\n== Attacks ==\nForward secrecy is designed to prevent the compromise of a long-term secret key from affecting the confidentiality of past conversations. However, forward secrecy cannot defend against a successful cryptanalysis of the underlying ciphers being used, since a cryptanalysis consists of finding a way to decrypt an encrypted message without the key, and forward secrecy only protects keys, not the ciphers themselves. A patient attacker can capture a conversation whose confidentiality is protected through the use of public-key cryptography and wait until the underlying cipher is broken (e.g. large quantum computers could be created which allow the discrete logarithm problem to be computed quickly). This would allow the recovery of old plaintexts even in a system employing forward secrecy.\nNon-interactive forward-secure key exchange protocols face additional threats that are not relevant to interactive protocols. In a message suppression attack, an attacker in control of the network may itself store messages while preventing them from reaching the intended recipient; as the messages are never received, the corresponding private keys may not be destroyed or punctured, so a compromise of the private key can lead to successful decryption. Proactively retiring private keys on a schedule mitigates, but does not eliminate, this attack. In a malicious key exhaustion attack, the attacker sends many messages to the recipient and exhausts the private key material, forcing a protocol to choose between failing closed (and enabling denial of service attacks) or failing open (and giving up some amount of forward secrecy).\n\n== Non-interactive forward secrecy ==\nMost key exchange protocols are interactive, requiring bidirectional communication between the parties. A protocol that permits the sender to transmit data without first needing to receive any replies from the recipient may be called non-interactive, or asynchronous, or zero round trip (0-RTT).Interactivity is onerous for some applications\u2014for example, in a secure messaging system, it may be desirable to have a store-and-forward implementation, rather than requiring sender and recipient to be online at the same time; loosening the bidirectionality requirement can also improve performance even where it is not a strict requirement, for example at connection establishment or resumption. These use cases have stimulated interest in non-interactive key exchange, and, as forward security is a desirable property in a key exchange protocol, in non-interactive forward secrecy. This combination has been identified as desirable since at least 1996. However, combining forward secrecy and non-interactivity has proven challenging; it had been suspected that forward secrecy with protection against replay attacks was impossible non-interactively, but it has been shown to be possible to achieve all three desiderata.Broadly, two approaches to non-interactive forward secrecy have been explored, pre-computed keys and puncturable encryption.With pre-computed keys, many key pairs are created and the public keys shared, with the private keys destroyed after a message has been received using the corresponding public key. This approach has been deployed as part of the Signal protocol.In puncturable encryption, the recipient modifies their private key after receiving a message in such a way that the new private key cannot read the message but the public key is unchanged. Ross J. Anderson informally described a puncturable encryption scheme for forward secure key exchange in 1997, and Green & Miers (2015) formally described such a system, building on the related scheme of Canetti, Halevi & Katz (2003), which modifies the private key according to a schedule so that messages sent in previous periods cannot be read with the private key from a later period. Green & Miers (2015) make use of hierarchical identity-based encryption and attribute-based encryption, while G\u00fcnther et al. (2017) use a different construction that can be based on any hierarchical identity-based scheme. Dallmeier et al. (2020) experimentally found that modifying QUIC to use a 0-RTT forward secure and replay-resistant key exchange implemented with puncturable encryption incurred significantly increased resource usage, but not so much as to make practical use infeasible.\n\n== Weak perfect forward secrecy ==\nWeak perfect forward secrecy (Wpfs) is the weaker property whereby when agents' long-term keys are compromised, the secrecy of previously established session-keys is guaranteed, but only for sessions in which the adversary did not actively interfere. This new notion, and the distinction between this and forward secrecy was introduced by Hugo Krawczyk in 2005.\nThis weaker definition implicitly requires that full (perfect) forward secrecy maintains the secrecy of previously established session keys even in sessions where the adversary did actively interfere, or attempted to act as a man in the middle.\n\n== Protocols ==\nForward secrecy is present in several major protocol implementations, such as SSH and as an optional feature in IPsec (RFC 2412).

    "instruction": "Online identity management\n\n==Introduction==\nOnline identity management (OIM), also known as online image management, online personal branding, or personal reputation management (PRM),  is a set of methods for generating a distinguished Web presence of a person on the Internet. Online identity management also refers to identity exposure and identity disclosure, and has particularly developed in the management on online identity in social network services or online dating services.\n\n== Aspects ==\nOne aspect of the online identity management process has to do with improving the quantity and quality of traffic to sites that have content related to a person. In that aspect, OIM is a part of another discipline called search engine optimization with the difference that the only keyword is the person's name, and the optimization object is not necessary a single web site; it can consider a set of completely different sites that contain positive online references. The objective in this case is to get high rankings for as many sites as possible when someone search for a person's name. If the search engine used is Google, this action is called \"to google someone\".Another aspect has to do with impression management, i.e. \"the process through which people try to control the impressions other people form of them\". One of the objectives, in particular, is to increase the online reputation of the person.\nPseudonyms are sometimes used to protect the true online identity of individuals from harm. This can be the case when presenting unpopular views or dissenting opinion online in a way that will not affect the true identity of the author. Facebook estimates that up to 11.2% of accounts are fake. Many of these profiles are used as logins to protect the true identity of online authors.An individual's presence could be reflected in any kind of content that refers to that person, including news, participation in blogs and forums, personal web sites, social media presence, pictures, video, etc. Because of that, online identity management often involves participation in social media sites like Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Flickr, YouTube, Twitter, Last.fm, Myspace, Quora, Tumblr, Pinterest and other online communities and community websites, and is related to blogging, blog social networks like MyBlogLog and blog search engines like Technorati.\nOIM can serve specific purposes such as a professional networking platform. OSN platforms represent who the user is and what attributes they bring to the world. The information a user can plug into their profile is usually not verified, which can lead to specifics forms of false identity. OIM can also consist in more questionable practices such as the case of buying \"likes\", \"friends\", or \"subscribers\".\n\n== Objective ==\nThe Objective of Online Identity Management is to:\n\nMaximize the appearances of positive online references about a specific person, targeting not only to users that actively search for that person on any search engine, but also to those that eventually can reach a person's reference while browsing the web.\nBuild an online identity in case the person's web presence is minimal or nonexistent.\nSolve online reputation problems. In this case, the process can also be named online reputation management.\nTo express opinions that may be unheard, if the person's reputation wasn't previously favored.Online Identity management can be utilized on a personal and professional level. Online identity management utilizes web presence to gain attention from potential huge clients to followers. A person managing online identity will use social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram Youtube, Snapchat, and networking sites to increase their online activity. They also use other tools like search engine optimization and advertisements to boost their audience and gain insights on their audience. Online Identity Management is most effective with the use of all social networking sites and posting frequently. This technique is used to target their audience and to make sure their audience does not miss any content. Additionally, Online Identity Management can be used to manipulate followers, viewers, and clients by using misleading or over-exaggerated information.\n\n== Motivation ==\nThe reason why someone would be interested in doing online identity management is closely related to the increasing number of constituencies that use the internet as a tool to find information about people. A survey by CareerBuilder.com found that one in four hiring managers used search engines to screen candidates. One in 10 also checked candidates' profiles on social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Youtube and other communicative networks. According to a December 2007 survey by the Ponemon Institute, a privacy research organization, roughly half of U.S. hiring officials use the Internet in vetting job applications. Online identity management may also be used to increase an individual's professional online presence. When practicing online identity management, employers receive a satisfied notion regarding their candidate's professional attitudes and personality. This may result in a candidate receiving the job based on their professional online presence. Online Identity management is key to having a successful business and relationship with the public. An online presence is vital to the digital world we live in today. Many employers check the social network account of their candidate to grasp the kind of person they are. Even after being hired companies will continuously check account to ensure professionalism and company privacy is being maintained.The concept of manipulating search results to show positive results is intriguing for both individuals and businesses. Individuals that want to hide from their past can use OIM to repair their online image and suppress content that damages their credibility, employability and reputation. By changing what people see when searching for an individual, they are able to create a completely new and positive identity in its place. In 2014, the EU ruled that people have \"The right to be forgotten\", and that in some circumstances content can be removed from Google's search index.\nIn 1988, the European Union passed the Safe Harbor Act which prohibited the sharing unauthorized personal information. Many companies to this day voluntarily comply to this law; however, it is the job of the user to fully ensure the safety of their online identity. The European Union later passed the a landmark ruling back in 2014, that stated that all individuals have the \"right to be forgotten\". This granted user's the removal of all irrelevant data that could harm one's online identityOnline identity management is also a factor and important when a person is seeking a need or good. Depending on companies online viewers and content can encourage or discourage a sale. Online identity management is important because decisions can be made depending on online activity. Depending on the motives of the goods, company, and person their online identity should serve the purpose of heightening their likeness, attractiveness, and exposure.\n\nUsing the text above, answer these questions: How does online identity management (OIM) relate to search engine optimization?Question: What is the role of impression management in OIM?Question: How are pseudonyms used in OIM?Question: What kind of content is typically included in an individual's online identity?Question: How does OIM relate to social media?Question: What is the objective of OIM in terms of search engine optimization?Question: How can OIM be used to build an online identity?Question: How can OIM be used to solve online reputation problems?Question: How can OIM be used for professional networking?Question: How can OIM be used to manipulate followers, viewers, and clients?Question: Why is online identity management important for job seekers?Question: How can OIM be used to repair an individual's online image?Question: What is the \"right to be forgotten\" and how does it relate to OIM?Question: How can OIM be used to heighten a person's likeness, attractiveness, and exposure?Question: How can OIM be used to maintain company privacy?",

      "context": "Online identity management\n\n==Introduction==\nOnline identity management (OIM), also known as online image management, online personal branding, or personal reputation management (PRM),  is a set of methods for generating a distinguished Web presence of a person on the Internet. Online identity management also refers to identity exposure and identity disclosure, and has particularly developed in the management on online identity in social network services or online dating services.\n\n== Aspects ==\nOne aspect of the online identity management process has to do with improving the quantity and quality of traffic to sites that have content related to a person. In that aspect, OIM is a part of another discipline called search engine optimization with the difference that the only keyword is the person's name, and the optimization object is not necessary a single web site; it can consider a set of completely different sites that contain positive online references. The objective in this case is to get high rankings for as many sites as possible when someone search for a person's name. If the search engine used is Google, this action is called \"to google someone\".Another aspect has to do with impression management, i.e. \"the process through which people try to control the impressions other people form of them\". One of the objectives, in particular, is to increase the online reputation of the person.\nPseudonyms are sometimes used to protect the true online identity of individuals from harm. This can be the case when presenting unpopular views or dissenting opinion online in a way that will not affect the true identity of the author. Facebook estimates that up to 11.2% of accounts are fake. Many of these profiles are used as logins to protect the true identity of online authors.An individual's presence could be reflected in any kind of content that refers to that person, including news, participation in blogs and forums, personal web sites, social media presence, pictures, video, etc. Because of that, online identity management often involves participation in social media sites like Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, Flickr, YouTube, Twitter, Last.fm, Myspace, Quora, Tumblr, Pinterest and other online communities and community websites, and is related to blogging, blog social networks like MyBlogLog and blog search engines like Technorati.\nOIM can serve specific purposes such as a professional networking platform. OSN platforms represent who the user is and what attributes they bring to the world. The information a user can plug into their profile is usually not verified, which can lead to specifics forms of false identity. OIM can also consist in more questionable practices such as the case of buying \"likes\", \"friends\", or \"subscribers\".\n\n== Objective ==\nThe Objective of Online Identity Management is to:\n\nMaximize the appearances of positive online references about a specific person, targeting not only to users that actively search for that person on any search engine, but also to those that eventually can reach a person's reference while browsing the web.\nBuild an online identity in case the person's web presence is minimal or nonexistent.\nSolve online reputation problems. In this case, the process can also be named online reputation management.\nTo express opinions that may be unheard, if the person's reputation wasn't previously favored.Online Identity management can be utilized on a personal and professional level. Online identity management utilizes web presence to gain attention from potential huge clients to followers. A person managing online identity will use social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram Youtube, Snapchat, and networking sites to increase their online activity. They also use other tools like search engine optimization and advertisements to boost their audience and gain insights on their audience. Online Identity Management is most effective with the use of all social networking sites and posting frequently. This technique is used to target their audience and to make sure their audience does not miss any content. Additionally, Online Identity Management can be used to manipulate followers, viewers, and clients by using misleading or over-exaggerated information.\n\n== Motivation ==\nThe reason why someone would be interested in doing online identity management is closely related to the increasing number of constituencies that use the internet as a tool to find information about people. A survey by CareerBuilder.com found that one in four hiring managers used search engines to screen candidates. One in 10 also checked candidates' profiles on social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Youtube and other communicative networks. According to a December 2007 survey by the Ponemon Institute, a privacy research organization, roughly half of U.S. hiring officials use the Internet in vetting job applications. Online identity management may also be used to increase an individual's professional online presence. When practicing online identity management, employers receive a satisfied notion regarding their candidate's professional attitudes and personality. This may result in a candidate receiving the job based on their professional online presence. Online Identity management is key to having a successful business and relationship with the public. An online presence is vital to the digital world we live in today. Many employers check the social network account of their candidate to grasp the kind of person they are. Even after being hired companies will continuously check account to ensure professionalism and company privacy is being maintained.The concept of manipulating search results to show positive results is intriguing for both individuals and businesses. Individuals that want to hide from their past can use OIM to repair their online image and suppress content that damages their credibility, employability and reputation. By changing what people see when searching for an individual, they are able to create a completely new and positive identity in its place. In 2014, the EU ruled that people have \"The right to be forgotten\", and that in some circumstances content can be removed from Google's search index.\nIn 1988, the European Union passed the Safe Harbor Act which prohibited the sharing unauthorized personal information. Many companies to this day voluntarily comply to this law; however, it is the job of the user to fully ensure the safety of their online identity. The European Union later passed the a landmark ruling back in 2014, that stated that all individuals have the \"right to be forgotten\". This granted user's the removal of all irrelevant data that could harm one's online identityOnline identity management is also a factor and important when a person is seeking a need or good. Depending on companies online viewers and content can encourage or discourage a sale. Online identity management is important because decisions can be made depending on online activity. Depending on the motives of the goods, company, and person their online identity should serve the purpose of heightening their likeness, attractiveness, and exposure.",

    "instruction": "Context: Security level management\n\n==Introduction==\nSecurity level management (SLM) comprises a quality assurance system for electronic information security.\nThe aim of SLM is to display the IT security status transparently across a company at any time, and to make IT security a measurable quantity. Transparency and measurability form the prerequisites for making IT security proactively monitorable, so that it can be improved continuously.\nSLM is oriented towards the phases of the Deming Cycle/Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Cycle: within the scope of SLM, abstract security policies or compliance guidelines at a company are transposed into operative, measureable specifications for the IT security infrastructure. The operative aims form the security level to be reached.\nThe security level is checked permanently against the current performance of the security systems (malware scanner, patch systems, etc.). Deviations can be recognised early on and adjustments made to the security system.\nSLM falls under the range of duties of the chief security officer (CSO), the chief information officer (CIO) or the chief information security officer (CISO), who report directly to the Executive Board on IT Security and data availability.\n\n\n\n== Classification ==\nSLM is related to the disciplines of Security and Security Event management (SIEM), which the analysts Gartner summarise in their Magic Quadrant for Security Information and Event Management, and define as follows:\n\"[\u2026] SIM provides reporting and analysis of data primarily from host systems and applications, and secondarily from security devices \u2014 to support security policy compliance management, internal threat management and regulatory compliance initiatives.

SLM allows CSOs, CIOs and CISOs to prove that SLM is contributing towards protecting electronic data relevant to processes adequately, and therefore makes a contribution in part to IT governance.\n\n== The Steps towards SLM ==\nDefining the Security Level (Plan): Each company specifies security policies. The executive management defines aims in relation to the integrity, confidentiality, availability and authority of classified data. In order to be able to verify compliance with these specifications, concrete aims for the individual security systems at the company need to be derived from the abstract security policies. A security level consists of a collection of measurable limiting and threshold values.\nExample: operative aims like \"the anti-virus systems at our UK sites need to be up-to-date no longer than four hours after publication of the current definition\" need to be derived from superordinate security policies like \"our employees should be able to work without being interrupted.\"\nLimiting and threshold values are to be specified separately and individually for different sites, locations and countries, because the IT infrastructure on-site and any other local determining factors need to be taken into consideration.\nExample: office buildings in the UK are normally equipped with high-speed dedicated lines. It is wholly realistic here to limit the deadline for supplying all computers with the newest anti-virus definitions to a few hours. For a factory in Asia, with a slow modem link to the web, a realistic limiting value would have to be set that is somewhat higher.\nThe IT control manual Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology Cobit (CobiT) provides companies with instructions on transposing subordinate, abstract aims into measurable aims in a few steps.\nCollecting and Analysing Data (Do):Information on the current status of the systems can be gleaned from the log file and status reports provided by individual anti-virus, anti-spyware or anti-spam consoles. Monitoring and reporting solutions analysing software applications from all software houses can simplify and accelerate data collection.\nChecking the Security Level (Check): SLM prescribes continual reconciliation of the defined security level with the current measured values. Automated real-time reconciliation supplies companies with a permanent status report on the security status across all locations.\nAdjusting the Security Structure (Act): Efficient SLM allows trend analyses and long-term comparative assessments to be made. Through the rolling observation of the security level, weak spots in the network can be identified early on and appropriate adjustments made proactively in the security systems.\nQuestions:\n\nHow does Security Level Management (SLM) contribute to the transparency and measurability of IT security in a company?Q: What is the role of the Deming Cycle/PDCA Cycle in SLM?Q: Who is responsible for overseeing SLM in a company?Q: How does SLM differ from Security and Security Event management (SIEM)?Q: What is the role of the IT control manual Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology Cobit (CobiT) in SLM?Q: How are the current status of the systems and the defined security level continually reconciled in SLM?Q: How do trend analyses and long-term comparative assessments benefit SLM?Q: What are the four main components of the SLM process?Q: How are security policies translated into specific, measurable objectives in SLM?Q: How do limiting and threshold values differ in SLM?Q: How do local determining factors impact the specification of limiting and threshold values in SLM?Q: What is the role of monitoring and reporting solutions in data collection in SLM?Q: How do automated real-time reconciliation and permanent status reports contribute to SLM?Q: How do trend analyses and long-term comparative assessments help identify weak spots in the network in SLM?Q: How does SLM contribute to IT governance?.

    "instruction": "Key (cryptography)\n\n==Introduction==\nA key in cryptography is a piece of information, usually a string of numbers or letters that are stored in a file, which, when processed through a cryptographic algorithm, can encode or decode cryptographic data. Based on the used method, the key can be different sizes and varieties, but in all cases, the strength of the encryption relies on the security of the key being maintained. A key's security strength is dependent on its algorithm, the size of the key, the generation of the key, and the process of key exchange.\n\n\n\n== Scope ==\nThe key is what is used to encrypt data from plaintext to ciphertext. There are different methods for utilizing keys and encryption.\n\n\n*** Symmetric cryptography ***\nSymmetric cryptography refers to the practice of the same key being used for both encryption and decryption.\n\n\n*** Asymmetric cryptography ***\nAsymmetric cryptography has separate keys for encrypting and decrypting. These keys are known as the public and private keys, respectively.\n\n== Purpose ==\nSince the key protects the confidentiality and integrity of the system, it is important to be kept secret from unauthorized parties. With public key cryptography, only the private key must be kept secret, but with symmetric cryptography, it is important to maintain the confidentiality of the key. Kerckhoff's principle states that the entire security of the cryptographic system relies on the secrecy of the key.\n\n== Key sizes ==\n\nKey size is the number of bits in the key defined by the algorithm. This size defines the upper bound of the cryptographic algorithm's security. The larger the key size, the longer it will take before the key is compromised by a brute force attack. Since perfect secrecy is not feasible for key algorithms, researches are now more focused on computational security.\nIn the past, keys were required to be a minimum of 40 bits in length, however, as technology advanced, these keys were being broken quicker and quicker. As a response, restrictions on symmetric keys were enhanced to be greater in size.\nCurrently, 2048 bit RSA is commonly used, which is sufficient for current systems. However, current key sizes would all be cracked quickly with a powerful quantum computer.\n\u201cThe keys used in public key cryptography have some mathematical structure. For example, public keys used in the RSA system are the product of two prime numbers. Thus public key systems require longer key lengths than symmetric systems for an equivalent level of security. 3072 bits is the suggested key length for systems based on factoring and integer discrete logarithms which aim to have security equivalent to a 128 bit symmetric cipher.\u201d\n\n== Key generation ==\n\nTo prevent a key from being guessed, keys need to be generated randomly and contain sufficient entropy. The problem of how to safely generate random keys is difficult and has been addressed in many ways by various cryptographic systems. A key can directly be generated by using the output of a Random Bit Generator (RBG), a system that generates a sequence of unpredictable and unbiased bits. A RBG can be used to directly produce either a symmetric key or the random output for an asymmetric key pair generation. Alternatively, a key can also be indirectly created during a key-agreement transaction, from another key or from a password.Some operating systems include tools for \"collecting\" entropy from the timing of unpredictable operations such as disk drive head movements. For the production of small amounts of keying material, ordinary dice provide a good source of high-quality randomness.\n\n== Establishment scheme ==\n\nThe security of a key is dependent on how a key is exchanged between parties. Establishing a secured communication channel is necessary so that outsiders cannot obtain the key. A key establishment scheme (or key exchange) is used to transfer an encryption key among entities. Key agreement and key transport are the two types of a key exchange scheme that are used to be  remotely exchanged between entities . In a key agreement scheme, a secret key, which is used between the sender and the receiver to encrypt and decrypt information, is set up to be sent indirectly. All parties exchange information (the shared secret) that permits each party to derive the secret key material. In a key transport scheme, encrypted keying material that is chosen by the sender is transported to the receiver. Either symmetric key or asymmetric key techniques can be used in both schemes.The Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) are the most two widely used key exchange algorithms. In 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman constructed the Diffie\u2013Hellman algorithm, which was the first public key algorithm. The Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange protocol allows key exchange over an insecure channel by electronically generating a shared key between two parties. On the other hand, RSA is a form of the asymmetric key system which consists of three steps: key generation, encryption, and decryption.Key confirmation delivers an assurance between the key confirmation recipient and provider that the shared keying materials are correct and established. The National Institute of Standards and Technology recommends key confirmation to be integrated into a key establishment scheme to validate its implementations.\n\n== Management ==\n\nKey management concerns the generation, establishment, storage, usage and replacement of cryptographic keys. A key management system (KMS) typically includes three steps of establishing, storing and using keys. The base of security for the generation, storage, distribution, use and destruction of keys depends on successful key management protocols.\n\n== Key vs password ==\nA password is a memorized series of characters including letters, digits, and other special symbols that are used to verify identity. It is often produced by a human user or a password management software to protect personal and sensitive information or generate cryptographic keys. Passwords are often created to be memorized by users and may contain non-random information such as dictionary words. On the other hand, a key can help strengthen password protection by implementing a cryptographic algorithm which is difficult to guess or replace the password altogether. A key is generated based on random or pseudo-random data and can often be unreadable to humans.A password is less safe than a cryptographic key due to its low entropy, randomness, and human-readable properties. However, the password may be the only secret data that is accessible to the cryptographic algorithm for information security in some applications such as securing information in storage devices. Thus, a deterministic algorithm called a key derivation function (KDF) uses a password to generate the secure cryptographic keying material to compensate for the password's weakness. Various methods such as adding a salt or key stretching may be used in the generation.\n\nUsing the text above, answer these questions: How does the size of a key impact the security of a cryptographic system?q: What is the difference in key usage between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography?q: What principle states that the entire security of a cryptographic system relies on the secrecy of the key?q: How does the key length in RSA public key cryptography compare to symmetric ciphers for equivalent security?q: How can randomness and entropy be ensured during the generation of a cryptographic key?q: What are the two main types of key exchange schemes for secure communication?q: Which key exchange algorithm was the first to allow secure key exchange over an insecure channel?q: What is the purpose of key confirmation in a key establishment scheme?q: What are the primary concerns of a key management system (KMS)?q: How does a key differ from a password in terms of security?q: What is the role of a key derivation function (KDF) in cryptographic systems?q: What methods can be employed to enhance the security of a password-derived key?q: Why are smaller key sizes vulnerable to being cracked quickly with modern computing power?q: How can a key management system (KMS) ensure the secure distribution and use of cryptographic keys?q: In what scenarios might a password be the only secret data accessible to a cryptographic algorithm for information security?",

    "instruction": "Context: DNS Certification Authority Authorization\n\n==Introduction==\nDNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) is an Internet security policy mechanism that allows domain name holders to indicate to certificate authorities whether they are authorized to issue digital certificates for a particular domain name. It does this by means of a new \"CAA\" Domain Name System (DNS) resource record.\nIt was drafted by computer scientists Phillip Hallam-Baker and Rob Stradling in response to increasing concerns about the security of publicly trusted certificate authorities. It is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) proposed standard.\n\n== Background ==\nA series of incorrectly issued certificates from 2001 onwards damaged trust in publicly trusted certificate authorities, and accelerated work on various security mechanisms, including Certificate Transparency to track mis-issuance, HTTP Public Key Pinning and DANE to block mis-issued certificates on the client-side, and CAA to block mis-issuance on the certificate authority side.The first draft of CAA was written by Phillip Hallam-Baker and Rob Stradling, and submitted as an IETF Internet Draft in October 2010. This was progressively improved by the PKIX Working Group, and approved by the IESG as RFC 6844, a Proposed Standard, in January 2013. CA/Browser Forum discussion began shortly afterward, and in March 2017 they voted in favor of making CAA implementation mandatory for all certificate authorities by September 2017. At least one certificate authority, Comodo, failed to implement CAA before the deadline. A 2017 study by the Technical University of Munich found many instances where certificate authorities failed to correctly implement some part of the standard.In September 2017, Jacob Hoffman-Andrews submitted an Internet Draft intended to simplify the CAA standard. This was improved by the LAMPS Working Group, and approved as RFC 8659, a Proposed Standard, in November 2019.As of January 2020, Qualys reports that still, only 6.8% of the 150,000 most popular TLS-supporting websites use CAA records.\n\n== Record ==\nCertificate authorities implementing CAA perform a DNS lookup for CAA resource records, and if any are found, ensure that they are listed as an authorized party before issuing a digital certificate. Each CAA resource record consists of the following components:\nflag\nA flags byte which implements an extensible signaling system for future use. As of 2018, only the issuer critical flag has been defined, which instructs certificate authorities that they must understand the corresponding property tag before issuing a certificate. This flag allows the protocol to be extended in the future with mandatory extensions, similar to critical extensions in X.509 certificates.\ntag\nOne of the following property:\nissue\nThis property authorizes the holder of the domain specified in associated property value to issue certificates for the domain for which the property is published.\nissuewild\nThis property acts like issue but only authorizes the issuance of wildcard certificates, and takes precedence over the issue property for wildcard certificate requests.\niodef\nThis property specifies a method for certificate authorities to report invalid certificate requests to the domain name holder using the Incident Object Description Exchange Format. As of 2018, not all certificate authorities support this tag, so there is no guarantee that all certificate issuances will be reported.\ncontactemail\nIncreasingly, contact information is not available in WHOIS due to concerns about potential GDPR violations. This property allows domain holders to publish contact information in DNS.\ncontactphone\nAs above, for phone numbers.value\nThe value associated with the chosen property tag.The lack of any CAA records authorizes normal unrestricted issuance, and the presence of a single blank issue tag disallows all issuance.Third parties monitoring certificate authority behavior might check newly issued certificates against the domain's CAA records.

It does this by means of a new \"CAA\" Domain Name System (DNS) resource record.\nIt was drafted by computer scientists Phillip Hallam-Baker and Rob Stradling in response to increasing concerns about the security of publicly trusted certificate authorities. It is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) proposed standard.\n\n== Background ==\nA series of incorrectly issued certificates from 2001 onwards damaged trust in publicly trusted certificate authorities, and accelerated work on various security mechanisms, including Certificate Transparency to track mis-issuance, HTTP Public Key Pinning and DANE to block mis-issued certificates on the client-side, and CAA to block mis-issuance on the certificate authority side.The first draft of CAA was written by Phillip Hallam-Baker and Rob Stradling, and submitted as an IETF Internet Draft in October 2010. This was progressively improved by the PKIX Working Group, and approved by the IESG as RFC 6844, a Proposed Standard, in January 2013. CA/Browser Forum discussion began shortly afterward, and in March 2017 they voted in favor of making CAA implementation mandatory for all certificate authorities by September 2017. At least one certificate authority, Comodo, failed to implement CAA before the deadline. A 2017 study by the Technical University of Munich found many instances where certificate authorities failed to correctly implement some part of the standard.In September 2017, Jacob Hoffman-Andrews submitted an Internet Draft intended to simplify the CAA standard. This was improved by the LAMPS Working Group, and approved as RFC 8659, a Proposed Standard, in November 2019.As of January 2020, Qualys reports that still, only 6.8% of the 150,000 most popular TLS-supporting websites use CAA records.\n\n== Record ==\nCertificate authorities implementing CAA perform a DNS lookup for CAA resource records, and if any are found, ensure that they are listed as an authorized party before issuing a digital certificate.

    "instruction": "Context: Idle scan\n\n==Introduction==\nAn idle scan is a TCP port scan method for determining what services are open on a target computer without leaving traces pointing back at oneself. This is accomplished by using packet spoofing to impersonate another computer (called a \"zombie\") so that the target believes it's being accessed by the zombie. The target will respond in different ways depending on whether the port is open, which can in turn be detected by querying the zombie.\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThis action can be done through common software network utilities such as nmap and hping. The attack involves sending forged packets to a specific machine target in an effort to find distinct characteristics of another zombie machine. The attack is sophisticated because there is no interaction between the attacker computer and the target: the attacker interacts only with the \"zombie\" computer.\nThis exploit functions with two purposes, as a port scanner and a mapper of trusted IP relationships between machines. The target system interacts with the \"zombie\" computer and difference in behavior can be observed using different \"zombies\" with evidence of different privileges granted by the target to different computers.The overall intention behind the idle scan is to \"check the port status while remaining completely invisible to the targeted host.\"\n\n\n*** Origins ***\nDiscovered by Salvatore Sanfilippo (also known by his handle \"Antirez\") in 1998, the idle scan has been used by many black hat \"hackers\" to covertly identify open ports on a target computer in preparation for attacking it. Although it was originally named dumb scan, the term idle scan was coined in 1999, after the publication of a proof of concept 16-bit identification field (IPID) scanner named idlescan, by Filipe Almeida (aka LiquidK). This type of scan can also be referenced as zombie scan; all the nomenclatures are due to the nature of one of the computers involved in the attack.\n\n== TCP/IP basics ==\nThe design and operation of the Internet is based on the Internet Protocol Suite, commonly also called TCP/IP. IP is the primary protocol in the Internet Layer of the Internet Protocol Suite and has the task of delivering datagrams from the source host to the destination host solely based on their addresses. For this purpose, IP defines addressing methods and structures for datagram encapsulation. It is a connectionless protocol and relies on the transmission of packets. Every IP packet from a given source has an ID that uniquely identifies IP datagram.TCP provides reliable, ordered delivery of a stream of bytes from a program on one computer to another program on another computer. TCP is the protocol that major Internet applications rely on, such as the World Wide Web, e-mail, and file transfer. Each of these applications (web server, email server, FTP server) is called a network service. In this system, network services are identified using two components: a host address and a port number.  There are 65536 distinct and usable port numbers per host. Most services use a limited range of numbers by default, and the default port number for a service is almost always used.\nSome port scanners scan only the most common port numbers, or ports most commonly associated with vulnerable services, on a given host. See: List of TCP and UDP port numbers.\nThe result of a scan on a port is usually generalized into one of three categories:\n\nOpen or Accepted: The host sent a reply indicating that a service is listening on the port.\nClosed or Denied or Not Listening: The host sent a reply indicating that connections will be denied to the port.\nFiltered, Dropped or Blocked: There was no reply from the host.Open ports present two vulnerabilities of which administrators must be wary:\n\nSecurity and stability concerns associated with the program responsible for delivering the service - Open ports.\nSecurity and stability concerns associated with the operating system that is running on the host - Open or Closed ports.Filtered ports do not tend to present vulnerabilities. The host in a local network can be protected by a firewall that filters, according with rules that its administrator set up, packets. This is done to deny services to hosts not known and prevent intrusion in the inside network.\nThe IP protocol is network layer transmission protocol.\n\n== Basic mechanics ==\nIdle scans take advantage of predictable Identification field value from IP header: every IP packet from a given source has an ID that uniquely identifies fragments of an original IP datagram; the protocol implementation assigns values to this mandatory field generally by a fixed value (1) increment. Because transmitted packets are numbered in a sequence you can say how many packets are transmitted between two packets that you receive.\nAn attacker would first scan for a host with a sequential and predictable sequence number (IPID). The latest versions of Linux, Solaris, OpenBSD, and Windows Vista are not suitable as zombie, since the IPID has been implemented with patches that randomized the IPID. Computers chosen to be used in this stage are known as \"zombies\".Once a suitable zombie is found the next step would be to try to establish a TCP connection with a given service (port) of the target system, impersonating the zombie. It is done by sending a SYN packet to the target computer, spoofing the IP address from the zombie, i.e. with the source address equal to zombie IP address.\nIf the port of the target computer is open it will accept the connection for the service, responding with a SYN/ACK packet back to the zombie.\nThe zombie computer will then send a RST packet  to the target computer (to reset the connection) because it did not actually send the SYN packet in the first place.\nSince the zombie had to send the RST packet it will increment its IPID. This is how an attacker would find out if the target's port is open. The attacker will send another packet to the zombie. If the IPID is incremented only by a step then the attacker would know that the particular port is closed.\nThe method assumes that zombie has no other interactions: if there is any message sent for other reasons between the first interaction of the attacker with the zombie and the second interaction other than RST message, there will be a false positive.\n\n== Finding a zombie host ==\nThe first step in executing an idle scan is to find an appropriate zombie. It needs to assign IP ID packets incrementally on a global (rather than per-host it communicates with) basis. It should be idle (hence the scan name), as extraneous traffic will bump up its IP ID sequence, confusing the scan logic. The lower the latency between the attacker and the zombie, and between the zombie and the target, the faster the scan will proceed.\nNote that when a port is open, IPIDs increment by 2. Following is the sequence: \n1. Attacker to target -> SYN, target to zombie ->SYN/ACK, Zombie to target -> RST (IPID increment by 1)\n2. Now attacker tries to probe zombie for result. Attacker to Zombie ->SYN/ACK, Zombie to Attacker -> RST (IPID increment by 1)\nSo, in this process IPID increments by 2 finally.\nWhen an idle scan is attempted, tools (for example nmap) tests the proposed zombie and reports any problems with it. If one doesn't work, try another. Enough Internet hosts are vulnerable that zombie candidates aren't hard to find.\nA common approach is to simply execute a ping sweep of some network. Choosing a network near your source address, or near the target, produces better results. You can try an idle scan using each available host from the ping sweep results until you find one that works. As usual, it is best to ask permission before using someone's machines for unexpected purposes such as idle scanning.\nSimple network devices often make great zombies because they are commonly both underused (idle) and built with simple network stacks which are vulnerable to IP ID traffic detection.\nWhile identifying a suitable zombie takes some initial work, you can keep re-using the good ones. Alternatively, there have been some research on utilizing unintended public web services as zombie hosts to perform similar idle scans. Leveraging the way some of these services perform outbound connections upon user submissions can serve as some kind of poor's man idle scanning.\n\n== Using hping ==\nThe hping method for idle scanning provides a lower level example for how idle scanning is performed. In this example the target host (172.16.0.100) will be scanned using an idle host (172.16.0.105). An open and a closed port will be tested to see how each scenario plays out.\nFirst, establish that the idle host is actually idle, send packets using hping2\nand observe the id numbers increase incrementally by one. If the id numbers\nincrease haphazardly, the host is not actually idle or has an OS that has no predictable IP ID.\n\nSend a spoofed SYN packet to the target host on a port you expect to be open. In this case, port 22 (ssh) is being tested.\n\nSince we spoofed the packet, we did not receive a reply and hping reports 100% packet loss. The target host replied directly to the idle host with a syn/ack packet. Now, check the idle host to see if the id number has increased.\n\nNotice that the proxy hosts id increased from id\n\n== Using nmap ==\nThe first thing the user would do is to find a suitable zombie on the LAN:\nPerforming a port scan and OS identification (-O option in nmap) on the zombie candidate network rather than just a ping scan helps in selecting a good zombie. As long as verbose mode (-v) is enabled, OS detection will usually determine the IP ID sequence generation method and print a line such as \u201cIP ID Sequence Generation: Incremental\u201d. If the type is given as Incremental or Broken little-endian incremental, the machine is a good zombie candidate. That is still no guarantee that it will work, as Solaris and some other systems create a new IP ID sequence for each host they communicate with. The host could also be too busy. OS detection and the open port list can also help in identifying systems that are likely to be idle.\nAnother approach to identifying zombie candidates is the run the ipidseq NSE script against a host. This script probes a host to classify its IP ID generation method, then prints the IP ID classification much like the OS detection does. Like most NSE scripts, ipidseq.nse can be run against many hosts in parallel, making it another good choice when scanning entire networks looking for suitable hosts.\nnmap -v -O -sS 192.168.1.0/24\nThis tells nmap to do a ping sweep and show all hosts that are up in the given IP range. Once you have found a zombie, next you would send the spoofed packets:\nnmap -P0 -p <port> -sI <zombie IP> <target IP>\nThe images juxtaposition show both of these stages in a successful scenario.\n\n== Effectiveness ==\nAlthough many Operating Systems are now immune from being used in this attack, Some popular systems are still vulnerable; making the idle scan still very effective. Once a successful scan is completed there is no trace of the attacker's IP address on the target's firewall or Intrusion-detection system log. Another useful possibility is the chance of by-passing a firewall because you are scanning the target from the zombie's computer, which might have extra rights than the attacker's.\nQuestions:\n\nHow does an idle scan determine if a port on a target system is open or closed?Q: What is the purpose of using a \"zombie\" computer in an idle scan?Q: How does the IP protocol play a role in an idle scan?Q: How does an idle scan determine if a host is suitable for use as a \"zombie\"?Q: How does an idle scan avoid detection by a target's firewall or intrusion-detection system?Q: How does an attacker find a suitable \"zombie\" for use in an idle scan?Q: How does an idle scan take advantage of the predictable IPID value from the IP header?Q: What is the difference between an open port and a closed port in the context of an idle scan?Q: How does an idle scan differ from other types of port scans?Q: How does an idle scan exploit trusted IP relationships between machines?Q: What is the origin of the term \"idle scan\"?Q: How does an idle scan determine if a port is filtered?Q: What is the role of the IPID in the IP header in the context of an idle scan?Q: How does an attacker find a suitable \"zombie\" for use in an idle scan?Q: How does an idle scan exploit trusted IP relationships between machines?.

The attack is also performed from the \"zombie\" computer, which may have extra rights on the network compared to the attacker's computer.A: An attacker can find a suitable \"zombie\" for use in an idle scan by executing a ping sweep of a network and testing each available host to see if it meets the requirements for a \"zombie\".

      "context": "Idle scan\n\n==Introduction==\nAn idle scan is a TCP port scan method for determining what services are open on a target computer without leaving traces pointing back at oneself. This is accomplished by using packet spoofing to impersonate another computer (called a \"zombie\") so that the target believes it's being accessed by the zombie. The target will respond in different ways depending on whether the port is open, which can in turn be detected by querying the zombie.\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThis action can be done through common software network utilities such as nmap and hping. The attack involves sending forged packets to a specific machine target in an effort to find distinct characteristics of another zombie machine. The attack is sophisticated because there is no interaction between the attacker computer and the target: the attacker interacts only with the \"zombie\" computer.\nThis exploit functions with two purposes, as a port scanner and a mapper of trusted IP relationships between machines. The target system interacts with the \"zombie\" computer and difference in behavior can be observed using different \"zombies\" with evidence of different privileges granted by the target to different computers.The overall intention behind the idle scan is to \"check the port status while remaining completely invisible to the targeted host.\"\n\n\n*** Origins ***\nDiscovered by Salvatore Sanfilippo (also known by his handle \"Antirez\") in 1998, the idle scan has been used by many black hat \"hackers\" to covertly identify open ports on a target computer in preparation for attacking it. Although it was originally named dumb scan, the term idle scan was coined in 1999, after the publication of a proof of concept 16-bit identification field (IPID) scanner named idlescan, by Filipe Almeida (aka LiquidK). This type of scan can also be referenced as zombie scan; all the nomenclatures are due to the nature of one of the computers involved in the attack.\n\n== TCP/IP basics ==\nThe design and operation of the Internet is based on the Internet Protocol Suite, commonly also called TCP/IP. IP is the primary protocol in the Internet Layer of the Internet Protocol Suite and has the task of delivering datagrams from the source host to the destination host solely based on their addresses. For this purpose, IP defines addressing methods and structures for datagram encapsulation. It is a connectionless protocol and relies on the transmission of packets. Every IP packet from a given source has an ID that uniquely identifies IP datagram.TCP provides reliable, ordered delivery of a stream of bytes from a program on one computer to another program on another computer. TCP is the protocol that major Internet applications rely on, such as the World Wide Web, e-mail, and file transfer. Each of these applications (web server, email server, FTP server) is called a network service. In this system, network services are identified using two components: a host address and a port number.  There are 65536 distinct and usable port numbers per host. Most services use a limited range of numbers by default, and the default port number for a service is almost always used.\nSome port scanners scan only the most common port numbers, or ports most commonly associated with vulnerable services, on a given host. See: List of TCP and UDP port numbers.\nThe result of a scan on a port is usually generalized into one of three categories:\n\nOpen or Accepted: The host sent a reply indicating that a service is listening on the port.\nClosed or Denied or Not Listening: The host sent a reply indicating that connections will be denied to the port.\nFiltered, Dropped or Blocked: There was no reply from the host.Open ports present two vulnerabilities of which administrators must be wary:\n\nSecurity and stability concerns associated with the program responsible for delivering the service - Open ports.\nSecurity and stability concerns associated with the operating system that is running on the host - Open or Closed ports.Filtered ports do not tend to present vulnerabilities. The host in a local network can be protected by a firewall that filters, according with rules that its administrator set up, packets. This is done to deny services to hosts not known and prevent intrusion in the inside network.\nThe IP protocol is network layer transmission protocol.\n\n== Basic mechanics ==\nIdle scans take advantage of predictable Identification field value from IP header: every IP packet from a given source has an ID that uniquely identifies fragments of an original IP datagram; the protocol implementation assigns values to this mandatory field generally by a fixed value (1) increment. Because transmitted packets are numbered in a sequence you can say how many packets are transmitted between two packets that you receive.\nAn attacker would first scan for a host with a sequential and predictable sequence number (IPID). The latest versions of Linux, Solaris, OpenBSD, and Windows Vista are not suitable as zombie, since the IPID has been implemented with patches that randomized the IPID. Computers chosen to be used in this stage are known as \"zombies\".Once a suitable zombie is found the next step would be to try to establish a TCP connection with a given service (port) of the target system, impersonating the zombie. It is done by sending a SYN packet to the target computer, spoofing the IP address from the zombie, i.e. with the source address equal to zombie IP address.\nIf the port of the target computer is open it will accept the connection for the service, responding with a SYN/ACK packet back to the zombie.\nThe zombie computer will then send a RST packet  to the target computer (to reset the connection) because it did not actually send the SYN packet in the first place.\nSince the zombie had to send the RST packet it will increment its IPID. This is how an attacker would find out if the target's port is open. The attacker will send another packet to the zombie. If the IPID is incremented only by a step then the attacker would know that the particular port is closed.\nThe method assumes that zombie has no other interactions: if there is any message sent for other reasons between the first interaction of the attacker with the zombie and the second interaction other than RST message, there will be a false positive.\n\n== Finding a zombie host ==\nThe first step in executing an idle scan is to find an appropriate zombie. It needs to assign IP ID packets incrementally on a global (rather than per-host it communicates with) basis. It should be idle (hence the scan name), as extraneous traffic will bump up its IP ID sequence, confusing the scan logic. The lower the latency between the attacker and the zombie, and between the zombie and the target, the faster the scan will proceed.\nNote that when a port is open, IPIDs increment by 2. Following is the sequence: \n1. Attacker to target -> SYN, target to zombie ->SYN/ACK, Zombie to target -> RST (IPID increment by 1)\n2. Now attacker tries to probe zombie for result. Attacker to Zombie ->SYN/ACK, Zombie to Attacker -> RST (IPID increment by 1)\nSo, in this process IPID increments by 2 finally.\nWhen an idle scan is attempted, tools (for example nmap) tests the proposed zombie and reports any problems with it. If one doesn't work, try another. Enough Internet hosts are vulnerable that zombie candidates aren't hard to find.\nA common approach is to simply execute a ping sweep of some network. Choosing a network near your source address, or near the target, produces better results. You can try an idle scan using each available host from the ping sweep results until you find one that works. As usual, it is best to ask permission before using someone's machines for unexpected purposes such as idle scanning.\nSimple network devices often make great zombies because they are commonly both underused (idle) and built with simple network stacks which are vulnerable to IP ID traffic detection.\nWhile identifying a suitable zombie takes some initial work, you can keep re-using the good ones. Alternatively, there have been some research on utilizing unintended public web services as zombie hosts to perform similar idle scans. Leveraging the way some of these services perform outbound connections upon user submissions can serve as some kind of poor's man idle scanning.\n\n== Using hping ==\nThe hping method for idle scanning provides a lower level example for how idle scanning is performed. In this example the target host (172.16.0.100) will be scanned using an idle host (172.16.0.105). An open and a closed port will be tested to see how each scenario plays out.\nFirst, establish that the idle host is actually idle, send packets using hping2\nand observe the id numbers increase incrementally by one. If the id numbers\nincrease haphazardly, the host is not actually idle or has an OS that has no predictable IP ID.\n\nSend a spoofed SYN packet to the target host on a port you expect to be open. In this case, port 22 (ssh) is being tested.\n\nSince we spoofed the packet, we did not receive a reply and hping reports 100% packet loss. The target host replied directly to the idle host with a syn/ack packet. Now, check the idle host to see if the id number has increased.\n\nNotice that the proxy hosts id increased from id\n\n== Using nmap ==\nThe first thing the user would do is to find a suitable zombie on the LAN:\nPerforming a port scan and OS identification (-O option in nmap) on the zombie candidate network rather than just a ping scan helps in selecting a good zombie. As long as verbose mode (-v) is enabled, OS detection will usually determine the IP ID sequence generation method and print a line such as \u201cIP ID Sequence Generation: Incremental\u201d. If the type is given as Incremental or Broken little-endian incremental, the machine is a good zombie candidate. That is still no guarantee that it will work, as Solaris and some other systems create a new IP ID sequence for each host they communicate with. The host could also be too busy. OS detection and the open port list can also help in identifying systems that are likely to be idle.\nAnother approach to identifying zombie candidates is the run the ipidseq NSE script against a host. This script probes a host to classify its IP ID generation method, then prints the IP ID classification much like the OS detection does. Like most NSE scripts, ipidseq.nse can be run against many hosts in parallel, making it another good choice when scanning entire networks looking for suitable hosts.\nnmap -v -O -sS 192.168.1.0/24\nThis tells nmap to do a ping sweep and show all hosts that are up in the given IP range. Once you have found a zombie, next you would send the spoofed packets:\nnmap -P0 -p <port> -sI <zombie IP> <target IP>\nThe images juxtaposition show both of these stages in a successful scenario.\n\n== Effectiveness ==\nAlthough many Operating Systems are now immune from being used in this attack, Some popular systems are still vulnerable; making the idle scan still very effective. Once a successful scan is completed there is no trace of the attacker's IP address on the target's firewall or Intrusion-detection system log. Another useful possibility is the chance of by-passing a firewall because you are scanning the target from the zombie's computer, which might have extra rights than the attacker's.",

    "instruction": "Cipher disk\n\n==Introduction==\nA cipher disk is an enciphering and deciphering tool developed in 1470 by the Italian architect and author Leon Battista Alberti. He constructed a device, (eponymously called the Alberti cipher disk) consisting of two concentric circular plates mounted one on top of the other. The larger plate is called the \"stationary\" and the smaller one the \"moveable\" since the smaller one could move on top of the \"stationary\".The first incarnation of the disk had plates made of copper and featured the alphabet, in order, inscribed on the outer edge of each disk in cells split evenly along the circumference of the circle. This enabled the two alphabets to move relative to each other creating an easy to use key. Rather than using an impractical and complicated table indicating the encryption method, one could use the much simpler cipher disk. This made both encryption and decryption faster, simpler and less prone to error.\n\n== Methods of encryption ==\nThe cipher disk can be used in one of two ways. The code can be a consistent monoalphabetic substitution for the entire cipher or the disks can be moved periodically throughout the cipher making it polyalphabetic. For a monoalphabetic use, the sender and the person receiving the messages would agree on a cipher key setting (e.g., the \"G\" in the regular alphabet would be positioned next to the \"Q\" in the cipher alphabet). The entire message is then encoded according to this key.\nIn addition to simple substitution ciphers, the cipher disk opened the way for convenient polyalphabetic ciphers.  An easy way to do this is for the sender and the recipient to agree that a certain number of characters into the message, the scales would be shifted one character to the right, repeating the procedure every (say) tenth letter.  This would make it more difficult to crack, using statistical methods.\n\n== Variations ==\n\nCipher disks had many small variations on the basic design. Instead of letters it would occasionally use combinations of numbers on the outer disk with each combination corresponding to a letter. To make the encryption especially hard to crack, the advanced cipher disk would only use combinations of two numbers. Instead of 1 and 2 though, 1 and 8 were used since these numerals look the same upside down (as things often are on a cipher disk) as they do right side up.Cipher disks would also add additional symbols for commonly used combinations of letters like \"ing\", \"tion\", and \"ed\". Symbols were also frequently added to indicate \"and\" at the end of a word.\n\n== Weaknesses ==\nWhen encoding a message using a cipher disk, a character is always used to mean \u201cend of word.\u201d  The frequency of said character is abnormally high and thus easily detected.  If this character, however, is omitted, then the words run together and it takes much longer for the recipient to read the message.  To remedy this, some cipher disks now have multiple characters that stand for \"end of word.\"  Similarly a cipher disk may also have multiple characters that could be used for the letter \"e\" (the most common letter in English) so that instead of having a character with a frequency of roughly 13%, there would be two characters that stood for \"e\" - each with a frequency of 6% or so. Users could also use a keyword so that all the characters including the letter e would change throughout the ciphertext.\n\n== Popular culture ==\nSince the 1930s, cipher disks have been labeled \"decoders\" and have been used for novelties.

Additionally, cipher disks might include symbols for commonly used letter combinations such as \"ing\", \"tion\", and \"ed\", as well as symbols for \"and\" at the end of a word.answer: Decrypting a message using a cipher disk without knowing the key settings can be challenging due to the large number of possible alphabet combinations. Since the smaller disk can rotate independently, there are numerous ways to align the letters, making it difficult to determine the correct substitution alphabet without prior knowledge of the key settings.answer: Using multiple characters for \"end of word\" and \"e\" enhances the security of the cipher disk by reducing the frequency of these characters in the ciphertext. Instead of having a single character with a high frequency (13% for \"e\" and abnormally high for \"end of word\"), multiple characters are used, each with a lower frequency. This makes it harder for an attacker to identify patterns or common elements in the ciphertext.answer: A keyword can be used to change the positions of all characters, including the letter \"e\", throughout the ciphertext. By using a keyword, the encryption becomes more dynamic, as the substitution alphabet will change with each occurrence of the keyword, making it even more difficult for an attacker to crack the cipher without knowing the keyword.answer: The numerals 1 and 8 were chosen for cipher disks because they look the same upside down as they do right side up. This symmetry ensures that the encryption remains consistent regardless of the orientation of the disk, providing an additional layer of complexity to the cipher and making it more challenging to crack.answer: Cipher disks can cause efficiency issues during decryption due to the use of a consistent monoalphabetic substitution or polyalphabetic substitution. In a monoalphabetic cipher, the same letter will always be substituted with the same character, making the cipher vulnerable to frequency analysis. In a polyalphabetic cipher, the recipient must keep track of the positions of the disks and adjust them accordingly throughout the ciphertext, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.answer: The inclusion of additional symbols in cipher disks can aid in encryption by representing commonly used letter combinations or word endings, like \"ing\", \"tion\", and \"ed\". This can help reduce the frequency of certain patterns in the ciphertext, making it more difficult for an attacker to identify the underlying plaintext.answer: The primary advantage of the cipher disk over other encryption methods in its early days was its convenience and ease of use compared to complex tables indicating the encryption method. By using two rotating disks with alphabets, the cipher disk provided a more straightforward and efficient way of performing encryption and decryption, reducing the likelihood of errors and streamlining the process.answer: Using the cipher disk as a \"secret decoder ring\" in popular culture can impact its perceived security by downplaying its complexity and historical significance as a cryptographic tool. While these novelties might still provide some level of encryption, their association with toys and novelties may lead to underestimation of the challenges and techniques required to break more sophisticated cipher disks.answer: The use of a consistent monoalphabetic substitution with a cipher disk can be vulnerable to attack through frequency analysis. In a monoalphabetic cipher, each letter in the plaintext is consistently replaced by the same letter in the ciphertext. By analyzing the frequency distribution of characters in the ciphertext, an attacker might be able to infer the most likely corresponding letters in the plaintext, eventually breaking the cipher.answer: Cipher disks can be used to create more complex ciphers compared to simple substitution ciphers by allowing for polyalphabetic substitution. By periodically shifting the positions of the disks, the substitution alphabet changes, making it more difficult for an attacker to crack the cipher using statistical methods. Additionally, the use of multiple characters for \"end of word\" and \"e\", as well as the inclusion of additional symbols, can further increase the complexity of the cipher and obscure patterns in the ciphertext.answer: The use of a movable disk in cipher disks contributes to their versatility in encryption by allowing for a wide range of substitution alphabets. By rotating the smaller disk relative to the larger one, users can create various monoalphabetic or polyalphabetic substitution ciphers, adapting the encryption method to the desired level of complexity and security.answer: A cipher disk's design can be modified to further enhance the security of the encrypted messages by incorporating additional layers of complexity. This could include using more than two disks, employing different types of encodings (e.g., numbers, symbols, or custom alphabets) on each disk, or integrating dynamic key changes based on pre-agreed rules or keywords. These modifications aim to obscure patterns in the ciphertext and make it even more challenging for an attacker to crack the encryption.",

This makes it harder for an attacker to identify patterns or common elements in the ciphertext.answer: A keyword can be used to change the positions of all characters, including the letter \"e\", throughout the ciphertext. By using a keyword, the encryption becomes more dynamic, as the substitution alphabet will change with each occurrence of the keyword, making it even more difficult for an attacker to crack the cipher without knowing the keyword.answer: The numerals 1 and 8 were chosen for cipher disks because they look the same upside down as they do right side up. This symmetry ensures that the encryption remains consistent regardless of the orientation of the disk, providing an additional layer of complexity to the cipher and making it more challenging to crack.answer: Cipher disks can cause efficiency issues during decryption due to the use of a consistent monoalphabetic substitution or polyalphabetic substitution. In a monoalphabetic cipher, the same letter will always be substituted with the same character, making the cipher vulnerable to frequency analysis. In a polyalphabetic cipher, the recipient must keep track of the positions of the disks and adjust them accordingly throughout the ciphertext, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.answer: The inclusion of additional symbols in cipher disks can aid in encryption by representing commonly used letter combinations or word endings, like \"ing\", \"tion\", and \"ed\". This can help reduce the frequency of certain patterns in the ciphertext, making it more difficult for an attacker to identify the underlying plaintext.answer: The primary advantage of the cipher disk over other encryption methods in its early days was its convenience and ease of use compared to complex tables indicating the encryption method. By using two rotating disks with alphabets, the cipher disk provided a more straightforward and efficient way of performing encryption and decryption, reducing the likelihood of errors and streamlining the process.answer: Using the cipher disk as a \"secret decoder ring\" in popular culture can impact its perceived security by downplaying its complexity and historical significance as a cryptographic tool. While these novelties might still provide some level of encryption, their association with toys and novelties may lead to underestimation of the challenges and techniques required to break more sophisticated cipher disks.answer: The use of a consistent monoalphabetic substitution with a cipher disk can be vulnerable to attack through frequency analysis. In a monoalphabetic cipher, each letter in the plaintext is consistently replaced by the same letter in the ciphertext. By analyzing the frequency distribution of characters in the ciphertext, an attacker might be able to infer the most likely corresponding letters in the plaintext, eventually breaking the cipher.answer: Cipher disks can be used to create more complex ciphers compared to simple substitution ciphers by allowing for polyalphabetic substitution. By periodically shifting the positions of the disks, the substitution alphabet changes, making it more difficult for an attacker to crack the cipher using statistical methods. Additionally, the use of multiple characters for \"end of word\" and \"e\", as well as the inclusion of additional symbols, can further increase the complexity of the cipher and obscure patterns in the ciphertext.answer: The use of a movable disk in cipher disks contributes to their versatility in encryption by allowing for a wide range of substitution alphabets. By rotating the smaller disk relative to the larger one, users can create various monoalphabetic or polyalphabetic substitution ciphers, adapting the encryption method to the desired level of complexity and security.answer: A cipher disk's design can be modified to further enhance the security of the encrypted messages by incorporating additional layers of complexity. This could include using more than two disks, employing different types of encodings (e.g., numbers, symbols, or custom alphabets) on each disk, or integrating dynamic key changes based on pre-agreed rules or keywords. These modifications aim to obscure patterns in the ciphertext and make it even more challenging for an attacker to crack the encryption."

Informally, Five Eyes can also refer to the group of intelligence agencies of these countries.\nThe origins of the FVEY can be traced to informal secret meetings during World War II between British and American code-breakers, which started before the U.S. formally entered the war, followed by the Allies' 1941 Atlantic Charter that established their vision of the post-war world. Canadian academic Srdjan Vucetic argues the alliance emerged from Winston Churchill's Iron Curtain speech in 1946, which warned of open conflict with the Soviet bloc unless the English-speaking democracies learned to cooperate:\n\nNeither the sure prevention of war, nor the continuous rise of world organisation will be gained without what I have called the fraternal association of the English-speaking peoples. This means a special relationship between the British Commonwealth and Empire and the United States... the continuance of the intimate relationship between our military advisers, leading to common study of potential dangers...\"\nAs the Cold War deepened, the intelligence sharing arrangement became formalised under the ECHELON surveillance system in the 1960s. This was initially developed by the FVEY to monitor the communications of the former Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, although it is now used to monitor communications worldwide.In the late 1990s, the existence of ECHELON was disclosed to the public, triggering a major debate in the European Parliament and, to a lesser extent, the United States Congress. The FVEY further expanded their surveillance capabilities during the course of the \"war on terror\", with much emphasis placed on monitoring the World Wide Web. Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden described the Five Eyes as a \"supra-national intelligence organisation that does not answer to the known laws of its own countries\". Documents leaked by Snowden in 2013 revealed that the FVEY has been spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other, although the FVEY nations maintain that this was done legally. It has been claimed that FVEY nations have been sharing intelligence in order to circumvent domestic laws, but only one court case in Canada has found any FVEY nation breaking domestic laws when sharing intelligence with a FVEYs partner.In spite of continued controversy over its methods, the Five Eyes relationship remains one of the most comprehensive known espionage alliances in human history.Since processed intelligence is gathered from multiple sources, the intelligence shared is not restricted to signals intelligence (SIGINT) and often involves defence intelligence as well as human intelligence (HUMINT) and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT).\n\n== Organisations ==\nThe following table provides an overview of most of the FVEY agencies involved in such forms of data sharing.\n\n== Domestic espionage sharing controversy ==\n\nOne of the core principles is that members do not spy on other governments in the alliance. U.S. Director of National Intelligence, Admiral Dennis C. Blair, said in 2013: \"We do not spy on each other. We just ask.\"In recent years, documents of the FVEY have shown that they are intentionally spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other. Although the FVEYs countries claim that all intelligence sharing was done legally and followed the domestic law of each nation.  Shami Chakrabarti, the director of the advocacy group Liberty, claimed that the FVEY alliance increases the ability of member states to \"subcontract their dirty work\" to each other. The former NSA contractor Edward Snowden described the FVEY as a \"supra-national intelligence organisation that doesn't answer to the laws of its own countries\". While many claims of illegal intelligence sharing among FVEY nations have been made, only once has any FVEY intelligence agency been shown to have broken the law with intelligence sharing in Canada.As a result of Snowden's disclosures, the FVEY alliance has become the subject of a growing amount of controversy in parts of the world:\n\n Canada: In late 2013, Canadian federal judge Richard Mosley strongly rebuked the CSIS for outsourcing its surveillance of Canadians to overseas partner agencies. A 51-page court ruling asserts that the CSIS and other Canadian federal agencies have been illegally enlisting FVEY allies in global surveillance dragnets, while keeping domestic federal courts in the dark.\n New Zealand: In 2014, the NZSIS and the GCSB of New Zealand were asked by the New Zealand Parliament to clarify if they had received any monetary contributions from members of the FVEY alliance. Both agencies withheld relevant information and refused to disclose any possible monetary contributions from the FVEY. David Cunliffe, leader of the Labour Party, asserted that the public is entitled to be informed.\n European Union: In early 2014, the European Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs released a draft report which confirmed that the intelligence agencies of New Zealand and Canada have cooperated with the NSA under the Five Eyes programme and may have been actively sharing the personal data of EU citizens. The EU report did not investigate if any international or domestic US laws were broken by the US and did not claim that any FVEY nation was illegally conducting intelligence collection on the EU. The NSA maintains that any intelligence collection done on the EU was in accordance with domestic US law and international law. So far, no court case has found the NSA broke any laws while spying on the EU.\n United Kingdom: In 2013, the British Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee conducted an investigation and concluded that the GCHQ had broken no domestic British laws in its intelligence sharing operations with the NSA. According the investigation \"It has been alleged that GCHQ circumvented UK law by using the NSA\u2019s PRISM programme to access the content of private communications. From the evidence we have seen, we have concluded that this is unfounded. We have reviewed the reports that GCHQ produced on the basis of intelligence sought from the US, and we are satisfied that they conformed with GCHQ\u2019s statutory duties. The legal authority for this is contained in the Intelligence Services Act 1994. Further, in each case where GCHQ sought information from the US, a warrant for interception, signed by a Minister, was already in place, in accordance with the legal safeguards contained in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.\"\n United States: So far, no court case has been brought against any US intelligence community member claiming that they went around US domestic law to have foreign countries spy on US citizens and give that intelligence to the US.\n\n== Other international cooperatives ==\nBeginning with its founding by the United States and United Kingdom in 1946, the alliance expanded twice, inducting Canada in 1948 and Australia and New Zealand in 1956, establishing the Five Eyes as it remains to this day. Further, there are nations termed \"Third Party Partners\" that share their intelligence with the Five Eyes despite not being formal members. While the Five Eyes is rooted in a particular agreement with specific operations amongst the five nations, similar sharing agreements have been set up independently and for specific purposes; for example, according to Edward Snowden, the NSA has a \"massive body\" called the Foreign Affairs Directorate dedicated to partnering with foreign countries beyond the alliance.\n\n\n*** Six Eyes (proposed) ***\nSeveral countries have been prospective members of the Five Eyes. Israel, Singapore, South Korea, and Japan have or continue to collaborate with the alliance, though none are formally members. According to French news magazine L'Obs, in 2009, the United States propositioned France to join the treaty and form a subsequent \"Six Eyes\" alliance. French President Nicolas Sarkozy required that France have the same status as the other members, including the signing of a \"no-spy agreement\". This proposal was approved by the director of the NSA, but rejected by the director of the CIA and by President Barack Obama, resulting in a refusal from France.In 2013 it was reported that Germany was interested in joining the Five Eyes alliance. At that time, several members of the United States Congress, including Tim Ryan and Charles Dent, were pushing for Germany's entrance to the Five Eyes alliance.\n\n\n*** Five Eyes Plus ***\nSince 2018, through an initiative sometimes termed \"Five Eyes Plus 3\", Five Eyes formed associations with France, Germany and Japan to introduce an information-sharing framework to counter threats arising from foreign activities of China as well as Russia.  Five Eyes plus France, Japan and South Korea share information about North Korea's military activities including ballistic missiles, in an arrangement sometimes dubbed \"Five Eyes Plus\".\n\n\n*** Nine Eyes ***\n\nThe Nine Eyes is a different arrangement that consists of the same members of Five Eyes working with Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Norway.\n\n\n*** Fourteen Eyes ***\n\nAccording to a document leaked by Edward Snowden, there is another working agreement among 14 nations officially known as SIGINT Seniors Europe, or \"SSEUR\". These \"14 Eyes\" consist of the same members of Nine Eyes plus Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden.\n\n\n*** Further intelligence sharing collaborations ***\nAs spelled out by Privacy International, there are a number of issue-specific intelligence agreements that include some or all the above nations and numerous others, such as:\nAn area specific sharing amongst the 41 nations that formed the allied coalition in Afghanistan;\nA shared effort of the Five Eyes nations in \"focused cooperation\" on computer network exploitation with Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey;\nClub of Berne: 17 members including primarily European States; the US is not a member;\nMaximator: an intelligence alliance between Denmark, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Sweden\nThe Counterterrorist Group: a wider membership than the 17 European states that make up the Club of Berne, and includes the US;\nNATO Special Committee: made up of the heads of the security services of NATO's 31 member countries\n\nUsing the text above, answer these questions: What is the origin and purpose of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance?question: What is ECHELON surveillance system and how does it relate to the Five Eyes alliance?question: How does the Five Eyes alliance enable member states to conduct espionage activities?question: What are the implications of the Five Eyes alliance on privacy and civil liberties?question: How has the Canadian government responded to allegations of illegal espionage sharing by the Five Eyes alliance?question: How has the New Zealand government responded to allegations of illegal espionage sharing by the Five Eyes alliance?question: How has the European Union responded to allegations of illegal espionage sharing by the Five Eyes alliance?question: How has the United Kingdom responded to allegations of illegal espionage sharing by the Five Eyes alliance?question: How has the United States responded to allegations of illegal espionage sharing by the Five Eyes alliance?question: What are the implications of the Five Eyes alliance for international relations and cooperation?question: How does the Five Eyes alliance impact the balance of power in the global intelligence community?question: How does the Five Eyes alliance impact the privacy and civil liberties of individuals around the world?question: How does the Five Eyes alliance impact the global economy and trade?question: How does the Five Eyes alliance impact the global political landscape?question: How does the Five Eyes alliance impact the global security landscape?",

    "instruction": "Context: Probabilistic encryption\n\n==Introduction==\nProbabilistic encryption is the use of randomness in an encryption algorithm, so that when encrypting the same message several times it will, in general, yield different ciphertexts.  The term \"probabilistic encryption\" is typically used in reference to public key encryption algorithms; however various symmetric key encryption algorithms achieve a similar property (e.g., block ciphers when used in a chaining mode such as CBC), and stream ciphers such as Freestyle which are inherently random.  To be semantically secure, that is, to hide even partial information about the plaintext, an encryption algorithm must be probabilistic.\n\n\n\n== Security ==\nProbabilistic encryption is particularly important when using public key cryptography.  Suppose that the adversary observes a ciphertext, and suspects that the plaintext is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", or has a hunch that the plaintext might be \"ATTACK AT CALAIS\". When a deterministic encryption algorithm is used, the adversary can simply try encrypting each of his guesses under the recipient's public key, and compare each result to the target ciphertext.  To combat this attack, public key encryption schemes must incorporate an element of randomness, ensuring that each plaintext maps into one of a large number of possible ciphertexts.\nAn intuitive approach to converting a deterministic encryption scheme into a probabilistic one is to simply pad the plaintext with a random string before encrypting with the deterministic algorithm.

      "context": "Probabilistic encryption\n\n==Introduction==\nProbabilistic encryption is the use of randomness in an encryption algorithm, so that when encrypting the same message several times it will, in general, yield different ciphertexts.  The term \"probabilistic encryption\" is typically used in reference to public key encryption algorithms; however various symmetric key encryption algorithms achieve a similar property (e.g., block ciphers when used in a chaining mode such as CBC), and stream ciphers such as Freestyle which are inherently random.  To be semantically secure, that is, to hide even partial information about the plaintext, an encryption algorithm must be probabilistic.\n\n\n\n== Security ==\nProbabilistic encryption is particularly important when using public key cryptography.  Suppose that the adversary observes a ciphertext, and suspects that the plaintext is either \"YES\" or \"NO\", or has a hunch that the plaintext might be \"ATTACK AT CALAIS\". When a deterministic encryption algorithm is used, the adversary can simply try encrypting each of his guesses under the recipient's public key, and compare each result to the target ciphertext.  To combat this attack, public key encryption schemes must incorporate an element of randomness, ensuring that each plaintext maps into one of a large number of possible ciphertexts.\nAn intuitive approach to converting a deterministic encryption scheme into a probabilistic one is to simply pad the plaintext with a random string before encrypting with the deterministic algorithm.  Conversely, decryption involves applying a deterministic algorithm and ignoring the random padding.

    "instruction": "Context: Privacy in file sharing networks\n\n==Introduction==\nPeer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) systems like Gnutella, KaZaA, and eDonkey/eMule, have become extremely popular in recent years, with the estimated user population in the millions. An academic research paper analyzed Gnutella and eMule protocols and found weaknesses in the protocol; many of the issues found in these networks are fundamental and probably common on other P2P networks. Users of file sharing networks, such as eMule and Gnutella, are subject to monitoring of their activity. Clients may be tracked by IP address, DNS name, software version they use, files they share, queries they initiate, and queries they answer to. Clients may also share their private files to the network without notice due to inappropriate settings.Much is known about the network structure, routing schemes, performance load and fault tolerance of P2P systems in general. It might be surprising, but the eMule protocol does not provide much privacy to the users, although it is a P2P protocol which is supposed to be decentralized.\n\n\n\n== The Gnutella and eMule protocols ==\n\n\n*** The eMule protocol ***\neMule is one of the clients which implements the eDonkey network. The eMule protocol consists of more than 75 types of messages. When an eMule client connects to the network, it first gets a list of known eMule servers which can be obtained from the Internet. Despite the fact that there are millions of eMule clients, there are only small amount of servers. The client connects to a server with TCP connection. That stays open as long as the client is connected to the network. Upon connecting, the client sends a list of its shared files to the server. By this the server builds a database with the files that reside on this client. The server also returns a list of other known servers. The server returns an ID to the client, which is a unique client identifier within the system. The server can only generate query replies to clients which are directly connected to it. The download is done by dividing the file into parts and asking each client a part.\n\n\n*** The Gnutella protocol ***\n\n\n**** Gnutella protocol v0.4 ****\nIn Gnutella protocol V0.4 all the nodes are identical, and every node may choose to connect to every other. The Gnutella protocol consist of 5 message types: query for tile search. Query messages use a flooding mechanism, i.e. each node that receives a query forwards it on all of its adjacent graph node links. A node that receives a query and has the appropriate file replies with a query hit message. A hop count field in the header limits the message lifetime. Ping and Pong messages are used for detecting new nodes that can be linked to the actual file download performed by opening TCP connection  and using the HTTP GET mechanism.\n\n\n**** Gnutella protocol v0.6 ****\nGnutella protocol V0.6 includes several modifications: A node has one of two operational modes: \"leaf node\" or \"ultrapeer\". Initially each node starts in a leaf node mode in which it can only connect to ultrapeers. The leaf nodes send query to an ultrapeer, the ultrapeer forwards the query and waits for the replies. When a node has enough bandwidth and uptime, the node may become an ultrapeer. Ultrapeers send periodically a request for their clients to send a list with the shared files they have. If a query arrives with a search string that matches one of the files in the leaves, the ultrapeer replies and pointing to the specific leaf.\n\n\n***** Tracking initiators and responders*****\nIn version 0.4 of the Gnutella protocol, an ultrapeer which receives a message from a leaf node (message with hop count zero) knows for sure that the message was originated from that leaf node.In version 0.6 of the protocol, If an ultrapeer receives a message from an ultrapeer with hop count zero then it knows that the message originated by the ultrapeer or by one of its leaves (The average number of the leaves nodes that are connected to an ultrapeer is 200).\n\n\n***** Tracking a single node*****\nMany clients of Gnutella have an HTTP monitor feature. This feature allows sending information about the node to any node which supports an empty HTTP request, and receiving on response. Research shows that a simple crawler which is connected to Gnutella network can get from an initial entry point a list of IP addresses which are connected to that entry point. Then the crawler can continue to inquire for other IP addresses. An academic research performed the following experiment: At NYU, a regular Gnucleus software client that was connected to the Gnutella network as a leaf node, with distinctive listening TCP port 44121. At the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel, a crawler ran looking for client listening with port 44121. In less than 15 minutes the crawler found the IP address of the Gnucleus client in NYU with the unique port.\n\n\n***** IP address harvesting*****\nIf a user is connected to the Gnutella network within, say, the last 24 hours, that user's IP address can be easily harvested by hackers, since the HTTP monitoring feature can collect about 300,000 unique addresses within 10 hours.\n\n\n***** Tracking nodes by GUID creation*****\nA Globally unique identifier (GUID) is a 16 bytes field in the Gnutella message header, which uniquely identifies every Gnutella message. The protocol does not specify how to generate the GUID.Gnucleus on Windows uses the Ethernet MAC address used as the GUID 6 lower bytes. Therefore, Windows clients reveal their MAC address when sending queries.In the JTella 0.7 client software the GUID is created using the Java random number without an initialization. Therefore, on each session, the client creates a sequence of queries with the same repeating IDs. Over time, a correlation between the user queries can be found.\n\n\n***** Collecting miscellaneous information users*****\nThe monitoring facility of Gnutella reveals an abundance of precious information on its users. It is possible to collect the information about the software vendor and the version that the clients use. Other statistical information about the client is available as well: capacity, uptime, local files etc.In Gnutella V0.6, information about client software can be collected (even if the client does not support HTTP monitoring). The information is found in the first two messages connection handshake.\n\n\n***** Tracking users by partial information*****\nSome Gnutella users have a small look-alike set, which makes it easier to track them by knowing this very partial information.\n\n\n***** Tracking users by queries*****\nAn academic research team performed the following experiment: the team ran five Gnutella as ultrapeer (in order to listen to other nodes\u2019 queries). The team revealed about 6% of the queries.\n\n\n***** Usage of hash functions*****\n SHA-1 hashes refer to SHA-1 of files not search strings.\nHalf of the search queries are strings and half of them are the output of a hash function (SHA-1) applied on the string. Although the usage of hash function is intended to improve the privacy, an academic research showed that the query content can be exposed easily by a dictionary attack: collaborators ultrapeers can gradually collect common search strings, calculate their hash value and store them into a dictionary. When a hashed query arrives, each collaborated ultrapeer can check matches with the dictionary and expose the original string accordingly.\n\n== Measures ==\nA common countermeasure used is concealing a user's IP address when downloading or uploading content by using anonymous networks, such as  I2P - The Anonymous Network. There is also data encryption and the use of indirect connections (mix networks) to exchange data between peers.\nThus all traffic is anonymized and encrypted. Unfortunately, anonymity and safety come at the price of much lower speeds, and due to the nature of those networks being internal networks there currently still is less content. However, this will change, once there are more users.\nQuestions:\n\nWhat are some of the weaknesses in file sharing networks like Gnutella and eMule, and why might they be common to other P2P networks?Q: How does the eMule protocol handle the process of connecting to the network and sharing files with other clients?Q: How does the Gnutella protocol v0.4 handle query messages and the process of detecting new nodes for file downloads?Q: How does the Gnutella protocol v0.6 differ from v0.4 in terms of node operation and query handling?Q: How can an ultrapeer in the Gnutella protocol track the origin of a message, and how does this differ between v0.4 and v0.6?Q: How can a hacker harvest a user's IP address in the Gnutella network, and how can the HTTP monitoring feature be used for this purpose?Q: How does the GUID field in the Gnutella message header uniquely identify messages, and how can it be used to reveal a user's MAC address?Q: How can the monitoring facility of Gnutella be used to collect information on its users, and what types of information can be collected?Q: How can partial information about Gnutella users be used to track them, and what is a small look-alike set?Q: How can the usage of hash functions in Gnutella queries improve privacy, and how can it be compromised by a dictionary attack?Q: What is a common countermeasure used to conceal a user's IP address in file sharing networks, and what are the trade-offs of using this countermeasure?Q: How does the process of connecting to the eMule network differ from connecting to the Gnutella network?Q: How does the process of downloading files differ between the eMule and Gnutella networks?Q: How does the Gnutella protocol handle the process of tracking initiators and responders, and how does this differ between v0.4 and v0.6?Q: How can a hacker use the HTTP monitor feature to harvest a user's IP address in the Gnutella network, and what is the potential impact of this?.

However, this will change, once there are more users.",
      "questions": "What are some of the weaknesses in file sharing networks like Gnutella and eMule, and why might they be common to other P2P networks?Q: How does the eMule protocol handle the process of connecting to the network and sharing files with other clients?Q: How does the Gnutella protocol v0.4 handle query messages and the process of detecting new nodes for file downloads?Q: How does the Gnutella protocol v0.6 differ from v0.4 in terms of node operation and query handling?Q: How can an ultrapeer in the Gnutella protocol track the origin of a message, and how does this differ between v0.4 and v0.6?Q: How can a hacker harvest a user's IP address in the Gnutella network, and how can the HTTP monitoring feature be used for this purpose?Q: How does the GUID field in the Gnutella message header uniquely identify messages, and how can it be used to reveal a user's MAC address?Q: How can the monitoring facility of Gnutella be used to collect information on its users, and what types of information can be collected?Q: How can partial information about Gnutella users be used to track them, and what is a small look-alike set?Q: How can the usage of hash functions in Gnutella queries improve privacy, and how can it be compromised by a dictionary attack?Q: What is a common countermeasure used to conceal a user's IP address in file sharing networks, and what are the trade-offs of using this countermeasure?Q: How does the process of connecting to the eMule network differ from connecting to the Gnutella network?Q: How does the process of downloading files differ between the eMule and Gnutella networks?Q: How does the Gnutella protocol handle the process of tracking initiators and responders, and how does this differ between v0.4 and v0.6?Q: How can a hacker use the HTTP monitor feature to harvest a user's IP address in the Gnutella network, and what is the potential impact of this?",
      "answers": "The weaknesses in file sharing networks like Gnutella and eMule include the lack of privacy for users, who can be tracked by IP address, DNS name, software version, files they share, queries they initiate, and queries they answer. These issues are fundamental and likely common to other P2P networks because of the decentralized nature of these systems, which can make it difficult to provide privacy and security for users.A: When an eMule client connects to the network, it first obtains a list of known eMule servers from the Internet and connects to a server with a TCP connection. The client then sends a list of its shared files to the server, which builds a database of files residing on the client. The server also returns a list of other known servers and assigns a unique client identifier to the client. The client can then download files by dividing them into parts and requesting each part from different clients.A: In Gnutella protocol v0.4, query messages use a flooding mechanism where each node forwards the query to all of its adjacent graph node links. A node that receives a query and has the appropriate file replies with a query hit message. Ping and Pong messages are used to detect new nodes for file downloads, which are performed by opening a TCP connection and using the HTTP GET mechanism.A: In Gnutella protocol v0.6, nodes have two operational modes: leaf node or ultrapeer. Leaf nodes can only connect to ultrapeers, while ultrapeers can connect to other ultrapeers and handle queries from leaf nodes. When a query arrives with a search string that matches one of the files in the leaves, the ultrapeer replies and points to the specific leaf. This differs from v0.4, where all nodes are identical and every node may choose to connect to every other.A: In v0.4, an ultrapeer that receives a message from a leaf node (with hop count zero) knows for sure that the message was originated from that leaf node. In v0.6, if an ultrapeer receives a message from an ultrapeer with hop count zero, it knows that the message originated from the ultrapeer or one of its leaves. This is because the average number of leaves connected to an ultrapeer is 200.A: A hacker can harvest a user's IP address in the Gnutella network by using the HTTP monitoring feature, which can collect a list of unique IP addresses within a certain time frame. For example, an academic research study found that an HTTP monitor crawler could collect 300,000 unique addresses within 10 hours.A: The GUID field in the Gnutella message header is a 16 bytes field that uniquely identifies every Gnutella message. In the Gnucleus on Windows client, the GUID is generated using the Ethernet MAC address as the lower 6 bytes, revealing the user's MAC address. In the JTella 0.7 client software, the GUID is created using the Java random number without an initialization, causing the client to create a sequence of queries with the same repeating IDs.A: The monitoring facility of Gnutella can be used to collect a wide range of information on its users, including the software vendor and version, capacity, uptime, local files, and other statistical information. In Gnutella V0.6, information about client software can be collected even if the client does not support HTTP monitoring, by using the first two messages connection handshake.A: Partial information about Gnutella users can be used to track them by using a small look-alike set, which is a set of users with similar characteristics that make them easier to identify. A small look-alike set can be based on any partial information about the user, such as their IP address, GUID, or other identifying information.A: The usage of hash functions in Gnutella queries is intended to improve privacy by referring to the SHA-1 of files, rather than search strings. However, an academic research study showed that the query content can be exposed easily by a dictionary attack, where collaborators can gradually collect common search strings, calculate their hash value, and store them into a dictionary. When a hashed query arrives, each collaborated ultrapeer can check matches with the dictionary and expose the original string accordingly.A: A common countermeasure used to conceal a user's IP address in file sharing networks is the use of anonymous networks, such as I2P, along with data encryption and indirect connections (mix networks) to exchange data between peers. This ensures that all traffic is anonymized and encrypted, but comes at the cost of lower speeds and less content due to the nature of these networks being internal networks. However, this is expected to change as more users join these networks.A: The process of connecting to the eMule network involves obtaining a list of known eMule servers from the Internet and connecting to a server with a TCP connection, which stays open as long as the client is connected to the network. The client then sends a list of its shared files to the server and receives a unique client identifier. The process of connecting to the Gnutella network, on the other hand, involves connecting to a node and sending query messages to search for files.A: In the eMule network, downloading a file is done by dividing the file into parts and asking each client for a part. In the Gnutella network, downloading a file is performed by opening a TCP connection and using the HTTP GET mechanism.A: In v0.4 of the Gnutella protocol, an ultrapeer that receives a message from a leaf node (with hop count zero) knows for sure that the message was originated from that leaf node. In v0.6, if an ultrapeer receives a message from an ultrapeer with hop count zero, it knows that the message originated from the ultrapeer or one of its leaves. This is because the average number of leaves connected to an ultrapeer is 200.A: A hacker can use the HTTP monitor feature to collect a list of unique IP addresses in the Gnutella network, which can be used for malicious purposes such as launching attacks on those IP addresses. This can be done by sending information about the node to any node that supports an empty HTTP request and receiving a response. An academic research study found that a simple crawler connected to the Gnutella network could find the IP address of a Gnucleus client in NYU with a unique listening TCP port in less than 15 minutes."

    "instruction": "Context: Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor\n\n==Introduction==\nComputer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor (COFEE) is a tool kit, developed by Microsoft, to help computer forensic investigators extract evidence from a Windows computer. Installed on a USB flash drive or other external disk drive, it acts as an automated forensic tool during a live analysis. Microsoft provides COFEE devices and online technical support free to law enforcement agencies.\n\n== Development and distribution ==\nCOFEE was developed by Anthony Fung, a former Hong Kong police officer who now works as a senior investigator on Microsoft's Internet Safety Enforcement Team.  Fung conceived the device following discussions he had at a 2006 law enforcement technology conference sponsored by Microsoft.  The device is used by more than 2,000 officers in at least 15 countries.A case cited by Microsoft in April 2008 credits COFEE as being crucial in a New Zealand investigation into the trafficking of child pornography, producing evidence that led to an arrest.In April 2009 Microsoft and Interpol signed an agreement under which INTERPOL would serve as principal international distributor of COFEE. University College Dublin's Center for Cyber Crime Investigations in conjunction with Interpol develops programs for training forensic experts in using COFEE.  The National White Collar Crime Center has been licensed by Microsoft to be the sole US domestic distributor of COFEE.\n\n\n*** Public leak ***\nOn November 6, 2009, copies of Microsoft COFEE were leaked onto various torrent websites. Analysis of the leaked tool indicates that it is largely a wrapper around other utilities previously available to investigators. Microsoft confirmed the leak; however a spokesperson for the firm said \"We do not anticipate the possible availability of COFEE for cybercriminals to download and find ways to \u2018build around' to be a significant concern\".\n\n== Use ==\nThe device is activated by being plugged into a USB port. It contains 150 tools and a graphical user interface to help investigators collect data. The software is reported to be made up of three sections. First COFEE is configured in advance with an investigator selecting the data they wish to export, this is then saved to a USB device for plugging into the target computer. A further interface generates reports from the collected data. Estimates cited by Microsoft state jobs that previously took 3\u20134 hours can be done with COFEE in as little as 20 minutes.COFEE includes tools for password decryption, Internet history recovery and other data extraction. It also recovers data stored in volatile memory which could be lost if the computer were shut down.\n\n== DECAF ==\nIn mid to late 2009 a tool named Detect and Eliminate Computer Acquired Forensics (DECAF) was announced by an uninvolved group of programmers. The tool would reportedly protect computers against COFEE and render the tool ineffective. It alleged that it would provide real-time monitoring of COFEE signatures on USB devices and in running applications and that when a COFEE signature is detected, DECAF would perform numerous user-defined processes. These included COFEE log clearing, ejecting USB devices, and contamination or spoofing of MAC addresses. On December 18, 2009, the DECAF creators announced that the tool was a hoax and part of \"a stunt to raise awareness for security and the need for better forensic tools\".\nQuestions:\n\nWhat is Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor (COFEE) and what is its purpose?question: Who developed COFEE and what inspired its development?question: How is COFEE distributed and who are its primary distributors?question: What happened in the public leak of COFEE in November 2009?question: How is COFEE used during an investigation, and what benefits does it provide?question: What is DECAF and what was its alleged purpose?question: What actions did DECAF claim to perform when a COFEE signature was detected?question: Was DECAF real or a hoax, and what was the purpose of the hoax?question: How many officers use COFEE in at least 15 countries?question: In what types of cases has COFEE been credited as being crucial?question: How does COFEE assist investigators in collecting data?question: What types of tools does COFEE include for data extraction?question: How does COFEE recover data stored in volatile memory?question: What is the role of University College Dublin's Center for Cyber Crime Investigations in relation to COFEE?question: How does the National White Collar Crime Center contribute to the distribution of COFEE?.

    "instruction": "Hashcash\n\n==Introduction==\nHashcash is a proof-of-work system used to limit E-mail spam and denial-of-service attacks. Hashcash was proposed in 1997 by Adam Back and described more formally in Back's 2002 paper \"Hashcash - A Denial of Service Counter-Measure\".\n\n== Background ==\nThe idea \"...to require a user to compute a moderately hard, but not intractable function...\" was proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in their 1992 paper \"Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail\".\n\n== How it works ==\nHashcash is a cryptographic hash-based proof-of-work algorithm that requires a selectable amount of work to compute, but the proof can be verified efficiently. For email uses, a textual encoding of a hashcash stamp is added to the header of an email to prove the sender has expended a modest amount of CPU time calculating the stamp prior to sending the email. In other words, as the sender has taken a certain amount of time to generate the stamp and send the email, it is unlikely that they are a spammer. The receiver can, at negligible computational cost, verify that the stamp is valid. However, the only known way to find a header with the necessary properties is brute force, trying random values until the answer is found; though testing an individual string is easy, satisfactory answers are rare enough that it will require a substantial number of tries to find the answer.\nThe hypothesis is that spammers, whose business model relies on their ability to send large numbers of emails with very little cost per message, will cease to be profitable if there is even a small cost for each spam they send. Receivers can verify whether a sender made such an investment and use the results to help filter email.\n\n== Technical details ==\nThe header line looks something like this:\nX-Hashcash: 1:20:1303030600:anni@cypherspace.org::McMybZIhxKXu57jd:ckvi\n\nThe header contains:\n\nver: Hashcash format version, 1 (which supersedes version 0).\nbits: Number of \"partial pre-image\" (zero) bits in the hashed code.\ndate: The time that the message was sent, in the format YYMMDD[hhmm[ss]].\nresource: Resource data string being transmitted, e.g., an IP address or email address.\next: Extension (optional; ignored in version 1).\nrand: String of random characters, encoded in base-64 format.\ncounter: Binary counter, encoded in base-64 format.The header contains the recipient's email address, the date of the message, and information proving that the required computation has been performed. The presence of the recipient's email address requires that a different header be computed for each recipient. The date allows the recipient to record headers received recently and to ensure that the header is unique to the email message.\n\n\n*** Sender's side ***\nThe sender prepares a header and appends a counter value initialized to a random number. It then computes the 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the header. If the first 20 bits (i.e. the 5 most significant hex digits) of the hash are all zeros, then this is an acceptable header. If not, then the sender increments the counter and tries the hash again. Out of 2160 possible hash values, there are 2140 hash values that satisfy this criterion. Thus the chance of randomly selecting a header that will have 20 zeros as the beginning of the hash is 1 in 220 (approx. 106, or about one in a million). The number of times that the sender needs to try to get a valid hash value is modeled by geometric distribution. Hence the sender will on average have to try 220 values to find a valid header. Given reasonable estimates of the time needed to compute the hash, this would take about one second to find. No more efficient method than this brute force approach is known to find a valid header.\nA normal user on a desktop PC would not be significantly inconvenienced by the processing time required to generate the Hashcash string. However, spammers would suffer significantly due to the large number of spam messages sent by them.\n\n\n*** Recipient's side ***\nTechnically the system is implemented with the following steps:\n\nThe recipient's computer calculates the 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the entire string (e.g., \"1:20:060408:anni@cypherspace.org::1QTjaYd7niiQA/sc:ePa\"). This takes about two microseconds on a 1 GHz machine, far less time than the time it takes for the rest of the e-mail to be received. If the first 20 bits are not all zero, the hash is invalid. (Later versions may require more bits to be zero as machine processing speeds increase.)\nThe recipient's computer checks the date in the header (e.g., \"060408\", which represents the date 8 Apr 2006). If it is not within two days of the current date, it is invalid. (The two-day window compensates for clock skew and network routing time between different systems.)\nThe recipient's computer checks whether the e-mail address in the hash string matches any of the valid e-mail addresses registered by the recipient, or matches any of the mailing lists to which the recipient is subscribed. If a match is not found, the hash string is invalid.\nThe recipient's computer inserts the hash string into a database. If the string is already in the database (indicating that an attempt is being made to re-use the hash string), it is invalid.If the hash string passes all of these tests, it is considered a valid hash string. All of these tests take far less time and disk space than receiving the body content of the e-mail.\n\n\n*** Required effort ***\nThe time needed to compute such a hash collision is exponential with the number of zero bits. So additional zero bits can be added (doubling the amount of time needed to compute a hash with each additional zero bit) until it is too expensive for spammers to generate valid header lines.\nConfirming that the header is valid is much faster and always takes the same amount of time, no matter how many zero bits are required for a valid header, since this requires only a single hashing operation.\n\n== Advantages and disadvantages ==\nThe Hashcash system has the advantage over micropayment proposals applying to legitimate e-mail that no real money is involved. Neither the sender nor recipient need to pay, thus the administrative issues involved with any micropayment system and moral issues related to charging for e-mail are entirely avoided.\nOn the other hand, as Hashcash requires potentially significant computational resources to be expended on each e-mail being sent, it is somewhat difficult to tune the ideal amount of average time one wishes clients to expend computing a valid header. This can mean sacrificing accessibility from low-end embedded systems or else running the risk of hostile hosts not being challenged enough to provide an effective filter from spam.\nHashcash is also fairly simple to implement in mail user agents and spam filters. No central server is needed. Hashcash can be incrementally deployed\u2014the extra Hashcash header is ignored when it is received by mail clients that do not understand it.\nOne plausible analysis concluded that only one of the following cases is likely: either non-spam e-mail will get stuck due to lack of processing power of the sender, or spam e-mail is bound to still get through. Examples of each include, respectively, a centralized e-mail topology (like a mailing list), in which some server is to send an enormous amount of legitimate e-mails, and botnets or cluster farms with which spammers can increase their processing power enormously.\nMost of these issues may be addressed. E.g., botnets may expire faster because users notice the high CPU load and take counter-measures, and mailing list servers can be registered in white lists on the subscribers' hosts and thus be relieved from the hashcash challenges. \nAnother projected problem is that computers continue to get faster according to Moore's law. So the difficulty of the calculations required must be increased over time. However, developing countries can be expected to use older hardware, which means that they will find it increasingly difficult to participate in the e-mail system. This also applies to lower-income individuals in developed countries who cannot afford the latest hardware.\nLike hashcash, cryptocurrencies use a hash function as their proof-of-work system. The rise of cryptocurrency has created a demand for ASIC-based mining machines. Although most cryptocurrencies use the SHA-256 hash function, the same ASIC technology could be used to create hashcash solvers that are three orders of magnitude faster than a consumer CPU, reducing the computational hurdle for spammers.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n\n*** Bitcoin mining ***\nIn contrast to hashcash in mail applications that relies on recipients to set manually an amount of work intended to deter malicious senders, the Bitcoin cryptocurrency network employs a different hash-based proof-of-work challenge to enable competitive Bitcoin mining. A Bitcoin miner runs a computer program that collects unconfirmed transactions from users on the network. Together, these can form a \"block\" and earn a payment to the miner, but a block is only accepted by the network if its hash meets the network's difficulty target. Thus, as in hashcash, miners must discover by brute force the \"nonce\" that, when included in the block, results in an acceptable hash.\nUnlike hashcash, Bitcoin's difficulty target does not specify a minimum number of leading zeros in the hash. Instead, the hash is interpreted as a (very large) integer, and this integer must be less than the target integer. This is necessary because the Bitcoin network must periodically adjust its difficulty level to maintain an average time of 10 minutes between successive blocks. If only leading zeros were considered, then the difficulty could only be doubled or halved, causing the adjustment to greatly overshoot or undershoot in response to small changes in the average block time. Still, the number of leading zeros in the target serves as a good approximation of the current difficulty. In January 2020, block #614525 had 74 leading zeros.\n\n\n*** Spam filters ***\nHashcash is used as a potential solution for false positives with automated spam filtering systems, as legitimate users will rarely be inconvenienced by the extra time it takes to mine a stamp. SpamAssassin has been able to check for Hashcash stamps since version 2.70, assigning a negative score (i.e. less likely to be spam) for valid, unspent Hashcash stamps. However, although the hashcash plugin is on by default, it still needs to be configured with a list of address patterns that must match against the Hashcash resource field before it will be used.\n\n\n*** Email clients ***\nThe Penny Post software project on SourceForge implements Hashcash in the Mozilla Thunderbird email client. The project is named for the historical availability of conventional mailing services that cost the sender just one penny; see Penny Post for information about such mailing services in history.\n\n\n*** Email Postmark ***\nMicrosoft also designed and implemented a now deprecated open spec, similar to and yet incompatible with Hashcash, Email Postmark, as part of their Coordinated Spam Reduction Initiative (CSRI). The Microsoft email postmark variant of Hashcash is implemented in the Microsoft mail infrastructure components Exchange, Outlook and Hotmail.\nThe format differences between Hashcash and Microsoft's email postmark is that postmark hashes the body in addition to the recipient, and uses a modified SHA-1 as the hash function and uses multiple sub-puzzles to reduce proof of work variance.\n\n\n*** Blogs ***\nLike e-mail, blogs often fall victim to comment spam.\nSome blog owners have used hashcash scripts written in the JavaScript language to slow down comment spammers. Some scripts (such as wp-hashcash) claim to implement hashcash but instead depend on JavaScript obfuscation to force the client to generate a matching key; while this does require some processing power, it does not use the hashcash algorithm or hashcash stamps.\n\n\n*** Reputation ***\nIn a digital marketplace, service providers can use hashcash to build reputation to attract clients. To build reputation, a service provider first selects a public key as its ID, and then discovers by brute force a nonce that, when concatenated to the ID, results in a hash digest with several leading zeros. The more zeros, the higher the reputation.\n\n== Intellectual property ==\nHashcash is not patented, and the reference implementation and most of the other implementations are free software. Hashcash is included or available for many Linux distributions.\nRSA has made IPR statements to the IETF about client-puzzles in the context of an RFC that described client-puzzles (not hashcash). The RFC included hashcash in the title and referenced hashcash, but the mechanism described in it is a known-solution interactive challenge which is more akin to Client-Puzzles; hashcash is non-interactive and therefore does not have a known solution. In any case RSA's IPR statement can not apply to hashcash because hashcash predates (March 1997) the client-puzzles publication (February 1999) and the client-puzzles patent filing US7197639 (February 2000).\n\nUsing the text above, answer these questions: How does Hashcash help in preventing denial-of-service attacks and limiting email spam?q: What is the format of a Hashcash header and what does it contain?q: How does the sender generate a valid Hashcash header?q: How does the recipient verify a Hashcash header?q: What is the time complexity of generating a Hashcash header?q: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Hashcash system?q: How is Hashcash used in Bitcoin mining?q: How is Hashcash used in spam filters?q: How is Hashcash used in email clients?q: How is Hashcash used in blogs?q: How is Hashcash used in building reputation in a digital marketplace?q: Is Hashcash patented?q: How does Hashcash differ from Microsoft's email postmark variant?q: How do hashcash scripts in JavaScript language slow down comment spammers in blogs?q: How is Hashcash used in preventing denial-of-service attacks?",

However, spammers would suffer significantly due to the large number of spam messages sent by them.\n\n\n*** Recipient's side ***\nTechnically the system is implemented with the following steps:\n\nThe recipient's computer calculates the 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the entire string (e.g., \"1:20:060408:anni@cypherspace.org::1QTjaYd7niiQA/sc:ePa\"). This takes about two microseconds on a 1 GHz machine, far less time than the time it takes for the rest of the e-mail to be received. If the first 20 bits are not all zero, the hash is invalid. (Later versions may require more bits to be zero as machine processing speeds increase.)\nThe recipient's computer checks the date in the header (e.g., \"060408\", which represents the date 8 Apr 2006). If it is not within two days of the current date, it is invalid. (The two-day window compensates for clock skew and network routing time between different systems.)\nThe recipient's computer checks whether the e-mail address in the hash string matches any of the valid e-mail addresses registered by the recipient, or matches any of the mailing lists to which the recipient is subscribed. If a match is not found, the hash string is invalid.\nThe recipient's computer inserts the hash string into a database. If the string is already in the database (indicating that an attempt is being made to re-use the hash string), it is invalid.If the hash string passes all of these tests, it is considered a valid hash string. All of these tests take far less time and disk space than receiving the body content of the e-mail.\n\n\n*** Required effort ***\nThe time needed to compute such a hash collision is exponential with the number of zero bits. So additional zero bits can be added (doubling the amount of time needed to compute a hash with each additional zero bit) until it is too expensive for spammers to generate valid header lines.\nConfirming that the header is valid is much faster and always takes the same amount of time, no matter how many zero bits are required for a valid header, since this requires only a single hashing operation.\n\n== Advantages and disadvantages ==\nThe Hashcash system has the advantage over micropayment proposals applying to legitimate e-mail that no real money is involved. Neither the sender nor recipient need to pay, thus the administrative issues involved with any micropayment system and moral issues related to charging for e-mail are entirely avoided.\nOn the other hand, as Hashcash requires potentially significant computational resources to be expended on each e-mail being sent, it is somewhat difficult to tune the ideal amount of average time one wishes clients to expend computing a valid header. This can mean sacrificing accessibility from low-end embedded systems or else running the risk of hostile hosts not being challenged enough to provide an effective filter from spam.\nHashcash is also fairly simple to implement in mail user agents and spam filters. No central server is needed. Hashcash can be incrementally deployed\u2014the extra Hashcash header is ignored when it is received by mail clients that do not understand it.\nOne plausible analysis concluded that only one of the following cases is likely: either non-spam e-mail will get stuck due to lack of processing power of the sender, or spam e-mail is bound to still get through. Examples of each include, respectively, a centralized e-mail topology (like a mailing list), in which some server is to send an enormous amount of legitimate e-mails, and botnets or cluster farms with which spammers can increase their processing power enormously.\nMost of these issues may be addressed. E.g., botnets may expire faster because users notice the high CPU load and take counter-measures, and mailing list servers can be registered in white lists on the subscribers' hosts and thus be relieved from the hashcash challenges. \nAnother projected problem is that computers continue to get faster according to Moore's law. So the difficulty of the calculations required must be increased over time. However, developing countries can be expected to use older hardware, which means that they will find it increasingly difficult to participate in the e-mail system. This also applies to lower-income individuals in developed countries who cannot afford the latest hardware.\nLike hashcash, cryptocurrencies use a hash function as their proof-of-work system. The rise of cryptocurrency has created a demand for ASIC-based mining machines. Although most cryptocurrencies use the SHA-256 hash function, the same ASIC technology could be used to create hashcash solvers that are three orders of magnitude faster than a consumer CPU, reducing the computational hurdle for spammers.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n\n*** Bitcoin mining ***\nIn contrast to hashcash in mail applications that relies on recipients to set manually an amount of work intended to deter malicious senders, the Bitcoin cryptocurrency network employs a different hash-based proof-of-work challenge to enable competitive Bitcoin mining. A Bitcoin miner runs a computer program that collects unconfirmed transactions from users on the network. Together, these can form a \"block\" and earn a payment to the miner, but a block is only accepted by the network if its hash meets the network's difficulty target. Thus, as in hashcash, miners must discover by brute force the \"nonce\" that, when included in the block, results in an acceptable hash.\nUnlike hashcash, Bitcoin's difficulty target does not specify a minimum number of leading zeros in the hash. Instead, the hash is interpreted as a (very large) integer, and this integer must be less than the target integer. This is necessary because the Bitcoin network must periodically adjust its difficulty level to maintain an average time of 10 minutes between successive blocks. If only leading zeros were considered, then the difficulty could only be doubled or halved, causing the adjustment to greatly overshoot or undershoot in response to small changes in the average block time. Still, the number of leading zeros in the target serves as a good approximation of the current difficulty. In January 2020, block #614525 had 74 leading zeros.\n\n\n*** Spam filters ***\nHashcash is used as a potential solution for false positives with automated spam filtering systems, as legitimate users will rarely be inconvenienced by the extra time it takes to mine a stamp. SpamAssassin has been able to check for Hashcash stamps since version 2.70, assigning a negative score (i.e. less likely to be spam) for valid, unspent Hashcash stamps. However, although the hashcash plugin is on by default, it still needs to be configured with a list of address patterns that must match against the Hashcash resource field before it will be used.\n\n\n*** Email clients ***\nThe Penny Post software project on SourceForge implements Hashcash in the Mozilla Thunderbird email client. The project is named for the historical availability of conventional mailing services that cost the sender just one penny; see Penny Post for information about such mailing services in history.\n\n\n*** Email Postmark ***\nMicrosoft also designed and implemented a now deprecated open spec, similar to and yet incompatible with Hashcash, Email Postmark, as part of their Coordinated Spam Reduction Initiative (CSRI). The Microsoft email postmark variant of Hashcash is implemented in the Microsoft mail infrastructure components Exchange, Outlook and Hotmail.\nThe format differences between Hashcash and Microsoft's email postmark is that postmark hashes the body in addition to the recipient, and uses a modified SHA-1 as the hash function and uses multiple sub-puzzles to reduce proof of work variance.\n\n\n*** Blogs ***\nLike e-mail, blogs often fall victim to comment spam.\nSome blog owners have used hashcash scripts written in the JavaScript language to slow down comment spammers. Some scripts (such as wp-hashcash) claim to implement hashcash but instead depend on JavaScript obfuscation to force the client to generate a matching key; while this does require some processing power, it does not use the hashcash algorithm or hashcash stamps.\n\n\n*** Reputation ***\nIn a digital marketplace, service providers can use hashcash to build reputation to attract clients. To build reputation, a service provider first selects a public key as its ID, and then discovers by brute force a nonce that, when concatenated to the ID, results in a hash digest with several leading zeros. The more zeros, the higher the reputation.\n\n== Intellectual property ==\nHashcash is not patented, and the reference implementation and most of the other implementations are free software. Hashcash is included or available for many Linux distributions.\nRSA has made IPR statements to the IETF about client-puzzles in the context of an RFC that described client-puzzles (not hashcash). The RFC included hashcash in the title and referenced hashcash, but the mechanism described in it is a known-solution interactive challenge which is more akin to Client-Puzzles; hashcash is non-interactive and therefore does not have a known solution. In any case RSA's IPR statement can not apply to hashcash because hashcash predates (March 1997) the client-puzzles publication (February 1999) and the client-puzzles patent filing US7197639 (February 2000).",

      "answers": "Hashcash is a proof-of-work system that requires a selectable amount of work to compute, but the proof can be verified efficiently. In the context of email, a textual encoding of a Hashcash stamp is added to the header of an email to prove the sender has expended a modest amount of CPU time calculating the stamp prior to sending the email. This makes it unlikely for spammers to send a large number of emails, as there is a small cost for each spam they send. Receivers can verify whether a sender made such an investment and use the results to help filter email.a: The Hashcash header is a string that contains the following fields: ver (Hashcash format version, 1), bits (Number of \"partial pre-image\" zero bits in the hashed code), date (The time that the message was sent, in the format YYMMDD[hhmm[ss]]), resource (Resource data string being transmitted, e.g., an IP address or email address), ext (Extension, optional and ignored in version 1), rand (String of random characters, encoded in base-64 format), and counter (Binary counter, encoded in base-64 format). The header contains the recipient's email address, the date of the message, and information proving that the required computation has been performed.a: The sender prepares a header and appends a counter value initialized to a random number. It then computes the 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the header. If the first 20 bits (i.e. the 5 most significant hex digits) of the hash are all zeros, then this is an acceptable header. If not, then the sender increments the counter and tries the hash again. The chance of randomly selecting a header that will have 20 zeros as the beginning of the hash is 1 in 2^20 (approx. 106, or about one in a million).a: The recipient's computer calculates the 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the entire string. If the first 20 bits are all zero, the hash is valid. The recipient's computer checks the date in the header. If it is not within two days of the current date, it is invalid.

This model is widely recognized A more general definition is in CNSS Instruction No. 4009 dated 26 April 2010 by Committee on National Security Systems of United States of America:\nA capability that supports one, or more, of the security requirements (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Examples of security services are key management, access control, and authentication.Another authoritative definition is in W3C Web service Glossary  adopted by NIST SP 800-95:\nA processing or communication service that is provided by a system to give a specific kind of protection to resources, where said resources may reside with said system or reside with other systems, for example, an authentication service or a PKI-based document attribution and authentication service. A security service is a superset of AAA services. Security services typically implement portions of security policies and are implemented via security mechanisms.\n\n\n\n== Basic security terminology ==\n\nInformation security and Computer security are disciplines that are dealing with the requirements of Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, the so-called CIA Triad, of information asset of an organization (company or agency) or the information managed by computers respectively.\n\nThere are threats that can [[Attack (Hacking)|attack]] the resources (information or devices to manage it) exploiting one or more vulnerabilities. The resources can be protected by one or more countermeasures or security controls.So security services implement part of the countermeasures, trying to achieve the security requirements of an organization.\n\n== Basic OSI terminology ==\n\nIn order to let different devices (computers, routers, cellular phones) to communicate data in a standardized way, communication protocols had been defined.\nThe ITU-T organization published a large set of protocols. The general architecture of these protocols is defined in recommendation X.200.The different means (air, cables) and ways (protocols and protocol stacks) to communicate are called a communication network.\nSecurity requirements are applicable to the information sent over the network. The discipline dealing with security over a network is called Network security.The X.800 Recommendation:\nprovides a general description of security services and related mechanisms, which may be provided by the Reference Model; and\ndefines the positions within the Reference Model where the services and mechanisms may be provided.This Recommendation extends the field of application of Recommendation X.200, to cover secure communications between open systems.\nAccording to X.200 Recommendation, in the so-called OSI Reference model there are 7 layers, each one is generically called N layer. The N+1 entity ask for transmission services to the N entity.At each level two entities (N-entity) interact by means of the (N) protocol by transmitting Protocol Data Units (PDU).\nService Data Unit (SDU) is a specific unit of data that has been passed down from an OSI layer, to a lower layer, and has not yet been encapsulated into a PDU, by the lower layer. It is a set of data that is sent by a user of the services of a given layer, and is transmitted semantically unchanged to a peer service user .\nThe PDU at any given layer, layer 'n', is the SDU of the layer below, layer 'n-1'. In effect the SDU is the 'payload' of a given PDU. That is, the process of changing a SDU to a PDU, consists of an encapsulation process, performed by the lower layer. All the data contained in the SDU becomes encapsulated within the PDU. The layer n-1 adds headers or footers, or both, to the SDU, transforming it into a PDU of layer n-1. The added headers or footers are part of the process used to make it possible to get data from a source to a destination.\n\n== OSI security services description ==\nThe following are considered to be the security services which can be provided optionally within the framework of the OSI Reference Model. The authentication services require authentication information comprising locally stored information and data that is transferred (credentials) to facilitate the authentication:\nAuthentication\nThese services provide for the authentication of a communicating peer entity and the source of data as described below.\nPeer entity authentication\nThis service, when provided by the (N)-layer, provides corroboration to the (N + 1)-entity that the peer entity is the claimed (N + 1)-entity.\nData origin authentication\nThis service, when provided by the (N)-layer, provides corroboration to an (N + 1)-entity that the source of the data is the claimed peer (N + 1)-entity.Access control\nThis service provides protection against unauthorized use of resources accessible via OSI. These may be OSI or non-OSI resources accessed via OSI protocols. This protection service may be applied to various types of access to a resource (e.g., the use of a communications resource; the reading, the writing, or the deletion of an information resource; the execution of a processing resource) or to all accesses to a resource.\nData confidentiality\nThese services provide for the protection of data from unauthorized disclosure as described below\nConnection confidentiality\nThis service provides for the confidentiality of all (N)-user-data on an (N)-connection\nConnectionless confidentiality\nThis service provides for the confidentiality of all (N)-user-data in a single connectionless (N)-SDU\nSelective field confidentiality\nThis service provides for the confidentiality of selected fields within the (N)-user-data on an (N)-connection or in a single connectionless (N)-SDU.\nTraffic flow confidentiality\nThis service provides for the protection of the information which might be derived from observation of traffic flows.Data integrity\nThese services counter active threats and may take one of the forms described below.\nConnection integrity with recovery\nThis service provides for the integrity of all (N)-user-data on an (N)-connection and detects any modification, insertion, deletion or replay of any data within an entire SDU sequence (with recovery attempted).\nConnection integrity without recovery\nAs for the previous one but with no recovery attempted.\nSelective field connection integrity\nThis service provides for the integrity of selected fields within the (N)-user data of an (N)-SDU transferred over a connection and takes the form of determination of whether the selected fields have been modified, inserted, deleted or replayed.\nConnectionless integrity\nThis service, when provided by the (N)-layer, provides integrity assurance to the requesting (N + 1)-entity. This service provides for the integrity of a single connectionless SDU and may take the form of determination of whether a received SDU has been modified. Additionally, a limited form of detection of replay may be provided.\nSelective field connectionless integrity\nThis service provides for the integrity of selected fields within a single connectionless SDU and takes the form of determination of whether the selected fields have been modified. Non-repudiation\nThis service may take one or both of two forms.\nNon-repudiation with proof of origin\nThe recipient of data is provided with proof of the origin of data. This will protect against any attempt by the sender to falsely deny sending the data or its contents.\n Non-repudiation with proof of delivery\nThe sender of data is provided with proof of delivery of data. This will protect against any subsequent attempt by the recipient to falsely deny receiving the data or its contents.\n\n== Specific security mechanisms ==\nThe security services may be provided by means  of security mechanism:\nEncipherment\nDigital signature\nAccess control\nData integrity\nAuthentication exchange\nTraffic padding\nRouting control\nNotarizationThe table1/X.800 shows the relationships between services and mechanisms\n\nSome of them can be applied to connection oriented protocols, other to connectionless protocols or both.\nThe table 2/X.800 illustrates the relationship of security services and layers:\n\n== Other related meanings ==\n\n\n*** Managed security service ***\n\nManaged security service (MSS) are network security services that have been outsourced to a service provider.\nQuestions:\n\nWhat is a security service according to the ITU-T X.800 Recommendation?Question: How are Information security and Computer security related to the CIA Triad?Question: What is the role of security services with respect to countermeasures?Question: What is the OSI Reference Model and how many layers does it have?Question: How do two entities at a given layer communicate in the OSI Reference Model?Question: What is the difference between Service Data Unit (SDU) and Protocol Data Unit (PDU) in the OSI Reference Model?Question: What are the security services defined in the OSI Reference Model?Question: What is the difference between Peer Entity Authentication and Data Origin Authentication?Question: What is the role of authentication information in OSI security services?Question: How is Data Confidentiality provided in the OSI Reference Model?Question: What is the purpose of Data Integrity services in the OSI Reference Model?Question: What is the difference between Connection Integrity with Recovery and Connection Integrity without Recovery?Question: What is the function of Non-repudiation services in the OSI Reference Model?Question: How are security mechanisms related to security services in the OSI Reference Model?Question: What is a Managed Security Service?.

    "instruction": "Context: Shellcode\n\n==Introduction==\nIn hacking, a shellcode is a small piece of code used as the payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability.  It is called \"shellcode\" because it typically starts a command shell from which the attacker can control the compromised machine, but any piece of code that performs a similar task can be called shellcode.  Because the function of a payload is not limited to merely spawning a shell, some have suggested that the name shellcode is insufficient. However, attempts at replacing the term have not gained wide acceptance. Shellcode is commonly written in machine code.\nWhen creating shellcode, it is generally desirable to make it both small and executable, which allows it to be used in as wide a variety of situations as possible. Writing good shellcode can be as much an art as it is a science. In assembly code, the same function can be performed in a multitude of ways and there is some variety in the lengths of opcodes that can be used for this purpose; good shellcode writers can put these small opcodes to use to create more compact shellcode. Some have reached the smallest possible size while maintaining stability.\n\n== Types of shellcode ==\nShellcode can either be local or remote, depending on whether it gives an attacker control over the machine it runs on (local) or over another machine through a network (remote).\n\n\n*** Local ***\nLocal shellcode is used by an attacker who has limited access to a machine but can exploit a vulnerability, for example a buffer overflow, in a higher-privileged process on that machine. If successfully executed, the shellcode will provide the attacker access to the machine with the same higher privileges as the targeted process.\n\n\n*** Remote ***\nRemote shellcode is used when an attacker wants to target a vulnerable process running on another machine on a local network, intranet, or a remote network. If successfully executed, the shellcode can provide the attacker access to the target machine across the network. Remote shellcodes normally use standard TCP/IP socket connections to allow the attacker access to the shell on the target machine. Such shellcode can be categorized based on how this connection is set up: if the shellcode establishes the connection, it is called a \"reverse shell\" or a connect-back shellcode because the shellcode connects back to the attacker's machine. On the other hand, if the attacker establishes the connection, the shellcode is called a bindshell because the shellcode binds to a certain port on the victim's machine. There's a peculiar shellcode named bindshell random port that skips the binding part and listens on a random port made available by the operating system. Because of that the bindshell random port became the smallest and stable bindshell shellcode for x86_64 available to this date. A third, much less common type, is socket-reuse shellcode. This type of shellcode is sometimes used when an exploit establishes a connection to the vulnerable process that is not closed before the shellcode is run. The shellcode can then re-use this connection to communicate with the attacker. Socket re-using shellcode is more elaborate, since the shellcode needs to find out which connection to re-use and the machine may have many connections open.A firewall can be used to detect outgoing connections made by connect-back shellcode as well as incoming connections made by bindshells. They can therefore offer some protection against an attacker, even if the system is vulnerable, by preventing the attacker from connecting to the shell created by the shellcode. This is one reason why socket re-using shellcode is sometimes used: it does not create new connections and therefore is harder to detect and block.\n\n\n*** Download and execute ***\nDownload and execute is a type of remote shellcode that downloads and executes some form of malware on the target system. This type of shellcode does not spawn a shell, but rather instructs the machine to download a certain executable file off the network, save it to disk and execute it. Nowadays, it is commonly used in drive-by download attacks, where a victim visits a malicious webpage that in turn attempts to run such a download and execute shellcode in order to install software on the victim's machine. A variation of this type of shellcode downloads and loads a library. Advantages of this technique are that the code can be smaller, that it does not require the shellcode to spawn a new process on the target system, and that the shellcode does not need code to clean up the targeted process as this can be done by the library loaded into the process.\n\n\n*** Staged ***\nWhen the amount of data that an attacker can inject into the target process is too limited to execute useful shellcode directly, it may be possible to execute it in stages. First, a small piece of shellcode (stage 1) is executed. This code then downloads a larger piece of shellcode (stage 2) into the process's memory and executes it.\n\n\n*** Egg-hunt ***\nThis is another form of staged shellcode, which is used if an attacker can inject a larger shellcode into the process but cannot determine where in the process it will end up. Small egg-hunt shellcode is injected into the process at a predictable location and executed. This code then searches the process's address space for the larger shellcode (the egg) and executes it.\n\n\n*** Omelette ***\nThis type of shellcode is similar to egg-hunt shellcode, but looks for multiple small blocks of data (eggs) and recombines them into one larger block (the omelette) that is subsequently executed. This is used when an attacker can only inject a number of small blocks of data into the process.\n\n== Shellcode execution strategy ==\nAn exploit will commonly inject a shellcode into the target process before or at the same time as it exploits a vulnerability to gain control over the program counter. The program counter is adjusted to point to the shellcode, after which it gets executed and performs its task. Injecting the shellcode is often done by storing the shellcode in data sent over the network to the vulnerable process, by supplying it in a file that is read by the vulnerable process or through the command line or environment in the case of local exploits.\n\n== Shellcode encoding ==\nBecause most processes filter or restrict the data that can be injected, shellcode often needs to be written to allow for these restrictions. This includes making the code small, null-free or alphanumeric. Various solutions have been found to get around such restrictions, including:\n\nDesign and implementation optimizations to decrease the size of the shellcode.\nImplementation modifications to get around limitations in the range of bytes used in the shellcode.\nSelf-modifying code that modifies a number of the bytes of its own code before executing them to re-create bytes that are normally impossible to inject into the process.Since intrusion detection can detect signatures of simple shellcodes being sent over the network, it is often encoded, made self-decrypting or polymorphic to avoid detection.\n\n\n*** Percent encoding ***\nExploits that target browsers commonly encode shellcode in a JavaScript string using percent-encoding, escape sequence encoding \"\\uXXXX\" or entity encoding. Some exploits also obfuscate the encoded shellcode string further to prevent detection by IDS.\nFor example, on the IA-32 architecture, here's how two NOP (no-operation) instructions would look, first unencoded:\n\n90             NOP\n90             NOP\n\nThis instruction is used in NOP slides.\n\n\n*** Null-free shellcode ***\nMost shellcodes are written without the use of null bytes because they are intended to be injected into a target process through null-terminated strings. When a null-terminated string is copied, it will be copied up to and including the first null but subsequent bytes of the shellcode will not be processed. When shellcode that contains nulls is injected in this way, only part of the shellcode would be injected, making it incapable of running successfully.\nTo produce null-free shellcode from shellcode that contains null bytes, one can substitute machine instructions that contain zeroes with instructions that have the same effect but are free of nulls. For example, on the IA-32 architecture one could replace this instruction:\n\nB8 01000000    MOV EAX,1          // Set the register EAX to 0x00000001\n\nwhich contains zeroes as part of the literal (1 expands to 0x00000001) with these instructions:\n\n33C0           XOR EAX,EAX        // Set the register EAX to 0x00000000\n40             INC EAX            // Increase EAX to 0x00000001\n\nwhich have the same effect but take fewer bytes to encode and are free of nulls.\n\n\n*** Alphanumeric and printable shellcode ***\nAn alphanumeric shellcode is a shellcode that consists of or assembles itself on execution into entirely alphanumeric ASCII or Unicode characters such as 0\u20139, A-Z and a-z. This type of encoding was created by hackers to hide working machine code inside what appears to be text. This can be useful to avoid detection of the code and to allow the code to pass through filters that scrub non-alphanumeric characters from strings (in part, such filters were a response to non-alphanumeric shellcode exploits). A similar type of encoding is called printable code and uses all printable characters (0-9, A-Z, a-z, !@#%^&*() etc.). An similarly restricted variant is ECHOable code not containing any characters which are not accepted by the ECHO command. It has been shown that it is possible to create shellcode that looks like normal text in English.\nWriting alphanumeric or printable code requires good understanding of the instruction set architecture of the machine(s) on which the code is to be executed. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to write alphanumeric code that is executable on more than one machine, thereby constituting multi-architecture executable code.\nIn certain circumstances, a target process will filter any byte from the injected shellcode that is not a printable or alphanumeric character. Under such circumstances, the range of instructions that can be used to write a shellcode becomes very limited. A solution to this problem was published by Rix in Phrack 57 in which he showed it was possible to turn any code into alphanumeric code. A technique often used is to create self-modifying code, because this allows the code to modify its own bytes to include bytes outside of the normally allowed range, thereby expanding the range of instructions it can use. Using this trick, a self-modifying decoder can be created that initially uses only bytes in the allowed range. The main code of the shellcode is encoded, also only using bytes in the allowed range. When the output shellcode is run, the decoder can modify its own code to be able to use any instruction it requires to function properly and then continues to decode the original shellcode. After decoding the shellcode the decoder transfers control to it, so it can be executed as normal. It has been shown that it is possible to create arbitrarily complex shellcode that looks like normal text in English.\n\n\n*** Unicode proof shellcode ***\nModern programs use Unicode strings to allow internationalization of text. Often, these programs will convert incoming ASCII strings to Unicode before processing them. Unicode strings encoded in UTF-16 use two bytes to encode each character (or four bytes for some special characters). When an ASCII (Latin-1 in general) string is transformed into UTF-16, a zero byte is inserted after each byte in the original string. Obscou proved in Phrack 61 that it is possible to write shellcode that can run successfully after this transformation. Programs that can automatically encode any shellcode into alphanumeric UTF-16-proof shellcode exist, based on the same principle of a small self-modifying decoder that decodes the original shellcode.\n\n== Platforms ==\nMost shellcode is written in machine code because of the low level at which the vulnerability being exploited gives an attacker access to the process. Shellcode is therefore often created to target one specific combination of processor, operating system and service pack, called a platform. For some exploits, due to the constraints put on the shellcode by the target process, a very specific shellcode must be created. However, it is not impossible for one shellcode to work for multiple exploits, service packs, operating systems and even processors. Such versatility is commonly achieved by creating multiple versions of the shellcode that target the various platforms and creating a header that branches to the correct version for the platform the code is running on. When executed, the code behaves differently for different platforms and executes the right part of the shellcode for the platform it is running on.\n\n== Shellcode analysis ==\nShellcode cannot be executed directly. In order to analyze what a shellcode attempts to do it must be loaded into another process. One common analysis technique is to write a small C program which holds the shellcode as a byte buffer, and then use a function pointer or use inline assembler to transfer execution to it. Another technique is to use an online tool, such as shellcode_2_exe, to embed the shellcode into a pre-made executable husk which can then be analyzed in a standard debugger. Specialized shellcode analysis tools also exist, such as the iDefense sclog project which was originally released in 2005 as part of the Malcode Analyst Pack. Sclog is designed to load external shellcode files and execute them within an API logging framework. Emulation based shellcode analysis tools also exist such as the sctest application which is part of the cross platform libemu package. Another emulation based shellcode analysis tool, built around the libemu library, is scdbg which includes a basic debug shell and integrated reporting features.\nQuestions:\n\nWhat is the primary purpose of shellcode in hacking?Q: Why is shellcode commonly written in machine code?Q: What are the two types of shellcode based on control over the machine?Q: What is a \"reverse shell\" or a connect-back shellcode in remote shellcode?Q: What is a bindshell in remote shellcode?Q: What is a bindshell random port in remote shellcode?Q: What is a download and execute type of remote shellcode?Q: What is staged shellcode?Q: What is egg-hunt shellcode?Q: What is omelette shellcode?Q: How is shellcode execution strategy different from shellcode encoding?Q: What is percent encoding in shellcode?Q: What is a null-free shellcode and how is it produced?Q: What is alphanumeric shellcode?Q: What is a Unicode proof shellcode?.

After decoding the shellcode the decoder transfers control to it, so it can be executed as normal. It has been shown that it is possible to create arbitrarily complex shellcode that looks like normal text in English.\n\n\n*** Unicode proof shellcode ***\nModern programs use Unicode strings to allow internationalization of text. Often, these programs will convert incoming ASCII strings to Unicode before processing them. Unicode strings encoded in UTF-16 use two bytes to encode each character (or four bytes for some special characters). When an ASCII (Latin-1 in general) string is transformed into UTF-16, a zero byte is inserted after each byte in the original string. Obscou proved in Phrack 61 that it is possible to write shellcode that can run successfully after this transformation. Programs that can automatically encode any shellcode into alphanumeric UTF-16-proof shellcode exist, based on the same principle of a small self-modifying decoder that decodes the original shellcode.\n\n== Platforms ==\nMost shellcode is written in machine code because of the low level at which the vulnerability being exploited gives an attacker access to the process. Shellcode is therefore often created to target one specific combination of processor, operating system and service pack, called a platform. For some exploits, due to the constraints put on the shellcode by the target process, a very specific shellcode must be created. However, it is not impossible for one shellcode to work for multiple exploits, service packs, operating systems and even processors. Such versatility is commonly achieved by creating multiple versions of the shellcode that target the various platforms and creating a header that branches to the correct version for the platform the code is running on. When executed, the code behaves differently for different platforms and executes the right part of the shellcode for the platform it is running on.\n\n== Shellcode analysis ==\nShellcode cannot be executed directly. In order to analyze what a shellcode attempts to do it must be loaded into another process. One common analysis technique is to write a small C program which holds the shellcode as a byte buffer, and then use a function pointer or use inline assembler to transfer execution to it. Another technique is to use an online tool, such as shellcode_2_exe, to embed the shellcode into a pre-made executable husk which can then be analyzed in a standard debugger. Specialized shellcode analysis tools also exist, such as the iDefense sclog project which was originally released in 2005 as part of the Malcode Analyst Pack. Sclog is designed to load external shellcode files and execute them within an API logging framework. Emulation based shellcode analysis tools also exist such as the sctest application which is part of the cross platform libemu package. Another emulation based shellcode analysis tool, built around the libemu library, is scdbg which includes a basic debug shell and integrated reporting features.",

      "answers": "Shellcode is a small piece of code used in hacking as the payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability. It typically starts a command shell from which the attacker can control the compromised machine, but any piece of code that performs a similar task can be called shellcode.A: Shellcode is commonly written in machine code because it is generally desirable to make it both small and executable, which allows it to be used in as wide a variety of situations as possible. Writing good shellcode can be as much an art as it is a science, and good shellcode writers can put small opcodes to use to create more compact shellcode.A: The two types of shellcode are local and remote. Local shellcode is used by an attacker who has limited access to a machine but can exploit a vulnerability to gain higher privileges on that machine. Remote shellcode is used when an attacker wants to target a vulnerable process running on another machine on a local network, intranet, or a remote network.A: A reverse shell or a connect-back shellcode is a type of remote shellcode that establishes a connection back to the attacker's machine after being executed on the target machine.A: A bindshell is a type of remote shellcode that binds to a certain port on the victim's machine, allowing the attacker to access the shell on the target machine through that port.A: A bindshell random port is a type of bindshell that skips the binding part and listens on a random port made available by the operating system. It is the smallest and stable bindshell shellcode for x86_64 available to date.A: Download and execute is a type of remote shellcode that downloads and executes some form of malware on the target system. This type of shellcode does not spawn a shell, but rather instructs the machine to download a certain executable file off the network, save it to disk and execute it.A: When the amount of data that an attacker can inject into the target process is too limited to execute useful shellcode directly, it may be possible to execute it in stages. First, a small piece of shellcode (stage 1) is executed, which then downloads a larger piece of shellcode (stage 2) into the process's memory and executes it.A: This is a form of staged shellcode, which is used if an attacker can inject a larger shellcode into the process but cannot determine where in the process it will end up. Small egg-hunt shellcode is injected into the process at a predictable location and executed, which then searches the process's address space for the larger shellcode (the egg) and executes it.A: This type of shellcode is similar to egg-hunt shellcode, but looks for multiple small blocks of data (eggs) and recombines them into one larger block (the omelette) that is subsequently executed. This is used when an attacker can only inject a number of small blocks of data into the process.A: Shellcode execution strategy refers to the method of injecting a shellcode into the target process before or at the same time as it exploits a vulnerability to gain control over the program counter. Shellcode encoding, on the other hand, refers to the process of making the code small, null-free or alphanumeric, self-modifying or encoded to avoid detection by intrusion detection systems.A: Percent encoding in shellcode is a method used in exploits that target browsers to encode shellcode in a JavaScript string using percent-encoding, escape sequence encoding \"\\uXXXX\" or entity encoding to avoid detection by IDS.A: A null-free shellcode is a shellcode that is written without the use of null bytes and is intended to be injected into a target process through null-terminated strings. It is produced by substituting machine instructions that contain zeroes with instructions that have the same effect but are free of nulls.A: An alphanumeric shellcode is a shellcode that consists of or assembles itself on execution into entirely alphanumeric ASCII or Unicode characters such as 0\u20139, A-Z and a-z. This type of encoding was created by hackers to hide working machine code inside what appears to be text.A: A Unicode proof shellcode is a shellcode that can run successfully after being transformed into Unicode strings encoded in UTF-16, which use two bytes to encode each character. Programs that can automatically encode any shellcode into alphanumeric UTF-16-proof shellcode exist, based on the same principle of a small self-modifying decoder that decodes the original shellcode."

Concerns about massive growth of telephone tapping incidents led to growing demand for secure telephones.\nThe practical availability of secure telephones is restricted by several factors; notably politics, export issues, incompatibility between different products (the devices on each side of the call have to use the same protocol), and high (though recently decreasing) price of the devices.\n\n== Well-known products ==\nThe best-known product on the US government market is the STU-III family. However, this system has now been replaced by the Secure Terminal Equipment (STE) and SCIP standards which defines specifications for the design of equipment to secure both data and voice. The SCIP standard was developed by the NSA and the US DOD to derive more interoperability between secure communication equipment. A new family of standard secure phones has been developed based on Philip Zimmermann's VoIP encryption standard ZRTP.\n\n== VoIP and direct connection phones ==\nAs the popularity of VoIP grows, secure telephony is becoming more widely used. Many major hardware and software providers offer it as a standard feature at no extra cost.\nExamples include the Gizmo5 and Twinkle. Both of the former work with offerings from the founder of PGP, Phil Zimmermann, and his VoIP secure protocol, ZRTP. ZRTP is implemented in, amongst others, Ripcord Networks product SecurePC with up to NSA Suite B compliant Elliptic Curve math libraries. ZRTP is also being made available for mobile GSM CSD as a new standard for non-VoIP secure calls.\nThe U.S. National Security Agency is developing a secure phone based on Google's Android called Fishbowl.\n\n== Historically significant products ==\n\nScramblers were used to secure voice traffic during World War II, but were often intercepted and decoded due to scrambling's inherent insecurity. The first true secure telephone was SIGSALY, a massive device that weighed over 50 tons. The NSA, formed after World War II, developed a series of secure telephones, including the STU I, STU II and STU-III, as well as voice encryption devices for military telephones.\nIn 1989 an Irish company called Intrepid developed one of the most advanced secure phones. Called Milcode, the phone was the first to implement code-excited linear prediction (or CELP) which dramatically improved voice quality and user operability over previous LPC (Linear Predictive Coding) and LPC-10e versions.\nMilcode also boasted significantly higher levels of security than previous secure telephones. The base model offered a proprietary encryption algorithm with a key length of 512 bits, and a more advanced model with a key length of 1024 bits. Key exchange used a public key, based on Diffie-Hellman, as opposed to a plug-in datakey. A new key was generated for each phone call.
