A ransomware payload is then executed, followed by the XMRig loader; at the same time the user is seeing the ransom note while Monero mining is being performed in the background. The second family discussed is the Prometei backdoor. After a few years in operation, it expanded its capabilities by also distributing XMRig.

Infection is accomplished via multi-stage processes beginning with a malicious Excel file. The file contains an AHK script compiler executable, a malicious AHK script file, and a VBA AutoOpen macro. The malware communicates with C2 servers in the U.S., the Netherlands, and Sweden and specifically targets U.S. and Canadian customers. The compiler is a legitimate application and is used to compile and execute an AHK script. The script is used for persistence, profiling victims, and downloading and executing the AHK script on a victim system. The downloader creates an auto-run link for the executable in the startup folder. The script then profiles victims by generating a unique ID based on the serial number of the C drive. An HTTP GET request is sent every five seconds and is used to serve as the request path to the C2 server as well as retrieve and execute the AHK script on the infected machine. Other AHK scripts can be employed against the victim depending on information obtained by the initial script. At present, the only commands seen have been 'deletecookies' and 'passwords'.

In its report, Kaspersky notes two infection vectors. An email sent to victims contains a Dropbox link which leads to an RAR archive. To disguise the archive as a Word document, the \u201cfile_subpath\u201d parameter is set to that of a file with a DOCX extension. Inside the archive were two malicious DLLs along with two legitimate executables files which were used to sideload the DLLs. If the first stage is successful, the second stage consists of installing a Cobalt Strike beacon and achieving persistence using a registry entry. The report notes that in the Philippines, there may have been another infection vector involved. The malware attempts to spread itself by copying malicious files to removable storage devices. In some cases, on systems located in Myanmar, an information stealer impersonated the Zoom video-conferencing application. It scanned the infected systems for files with specific extensions and exfiltrated those found to its C&C server. On some other systems, a tool to steal cookies from the Chrome web browser was deployed.

The campaign began via a 3rd party compromise that led to the deployment of the ASPXSpy webshell for lateral movement. The actor uses DLL side-loading via the vulnerable Google Updater DLL to install both the PlugX and Clambling backdoors.

This is significant because it could support evidence of APT27 moving from cyber espionage operations to a focus on financial gain.

      "overview": "Job offers are the subject of this particular phishing campaign and they carry BLINDINGCAN RAT as a payload, a SentinelOne paper states. The defense and aerospace industries in Europe and the United States are the primary targets of this campaign. An infected system in a key location can provide the attackers with valuable intelligence and key technologies, the article indicated. The attachment attempts to exploit CVE-2017-0199, a vulnerability in the processing of RTF files, which can result in the execution of arbitrary code if successful. Once infected, the malware contacts its command and control servers for additional components, such as a keylogger and clipboard monitor. Information about the system is sent back to the command and control servers."

The unidentified actors used the SCADA system\u2019s software to increase the amount of sodium hydroxide, also known as lye, a caustic chemical, as part of the water treatment process. Water treatment plant personnel immediately noticed the change in dosing amounts and corrected the issue before the SCADA system\u2019s software detected the manipulation and alarmed due to the unauthorized change. As a result, the water treatment process remained unaffected and continued to operate as normal.

This behavior involved highly sophisticated methods and hitherto unseen malware, suggesting that this is a very capable threat group. The researchers have traced this activity back to July 2020. As this is a long-standing operation, with advanced capabilities and no known affinity to existing threat groups, the researchers have named this group GhostEmperor. This group has been observed using several initial infection vectors, but most commonly, they exploit public-facing servers to gain initial access. They have recently been observed exploiting the ProxyLogon vulnerability. Once initial access is gained, the group deploys a series of malware starting with a PowerShell dropper, which installs the second stage as a service and executes it. This second stage then initiates a third stage payload as an in-memory implant. The third stage is in charge of facilitating a communication channel with a C2 server, where traffic can be masqueraded under the guise of legitimate communications with a benign service. The final stage is injected into the winlogon.exe process by the previous stage, which provides the attacker remote control over the system. In addition to the final stage, the implant also deploys a Windows kernel-mode driver which serves as a rootkit with the sole purpose of concealing malware artifacts. Analysts have named this rootkit Demodex, as it has not been seen before. Once this malware has been established, the attackers perform internal reconnaissance using public tools such as NBTscan, as well as tools from the Sysinternals suite such as PsExec and ProcDump. GhostEmperor mainly targets government entities and telecommunication companies in southeast Asia, with multiple high-profile entities targeted in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.

    "instruction": "Given the following mitigations:\nThe xHunt Campaign has been actively observed since at least July 2018. In the latest developments, Unit 42 has uncovered new techniques being employed to provide new C2 vectors. The campaign has focused its efforts mainly on the Kuwaiti government as well as the shipping and transportation industries. The latest information suggests the threat actors compromised a Microsoft Exchange server, belonging to an organization in Kuwait, on or before August 22, 2019. Analysts note two backdoors, called TriFive and Snugy by Unit 42, as well as a web shell called BumbleBee were discovered. The backdoors are PowerShell scripts that provide the threat actors with backdoor access to the compromised Exchange server. The backdoors each provide a different C2 channel with which the actors communicate. TriFive is a backdoor that utilizes an email-based channel using Exchange Web Services to create draft emails in the Deleted Items folder of a previously compromised email account. Snugy uses DNS tunneling to execute commands on the compromised server. In September 2020, analysts were notified of a breached organization in Kuwait. Suspicious commands were noted as being executed on the Exchange server by an Internet Information Services (IIS) process. Threat actors issued the commands using the BumbleBee web shell, which had been previously installed on the Exchange server. In reviewing the logs, the analysts were unable to find the initial infection vector. They were able to find two scheduled tasks, which were in place prior to the dates of the collected logs. These tasks executed PowerShell scripts, and although the analysts were unable to confirm, they believe the threat actors were able to access the server prior the creation of logging events. The naming of tasks was done in order to blend into other tasks and had names that, upon first glance, could appear to be normal functions. The threat actors were able to resolve hosts through these two scripts. The backdoors mentioned were executed at intervals not matching each other with TriFive occurring every 5 minutes and Snugy every 30 minutes. The hypothesis is that this is done to offer some form of stealth in order to avoid detection. The actor created a draft email with a specific subject that included the commands encrypted and encoded using a base64 format. The commands are executed when PowerShell is directed to the Deleted Items folder and searches for the aforementioned subject line. Persistence for this module is achieved via the scheduled task and not through a looping process. Snugy allows the actors to run commands as well as obtain the system's hostname. Snugy is a variant of the CASHY200 backdoor previously employed in xHunt campaigns. Significant overlap exists to suggest this claim. Snugy uses DNS tunneling to communicate with C2 servers using A record lookups to resolve custom subdomains of C2 domains controlled by the actor. The tunneling protocol only sends one byte of data per query. This speed makes the backdoor inefficient for the exfiltration of data. DNS tunneling allows for the receipt of four bytes of data making it a little more efficient.\n\nTo which threat these mitigations can be relevant for?",

The applications load extra code from a remote server, however the researchers were unable to obtain this code at the time of investigation. Due to the lack of other components in this application, they believe the group is still developing these applications before use."

Netskope notes that the samples they analyzed are also the first case they have observed of the use of both VBA and LoLbins (Live off the Land binaries) in macros. As is common with lure documents, the Office document contains a message claiming that content must be enabled to access the protected file. Enabling macros leads to the start of the infection chain. First, a base64 string stored as a variable in the VBA code is written to a file. A copy of certutil.exe is made and subsequently used to decode the base64 content and save it to a new file. The new file is the malicious payload that is injected into explorer.exe using the Microsoft Application Virtualization Injector. Once running in memory, the malware is used to retrieve the next-stage payload from a remote server.

Specifically, the group has implemented the use of embedded base64-encoded payloads and code injection. Netskope notes that the samples they analyzed are also the first case they have observed of the use of both VBA and LoLbins (Live off the Land binaries) in macros. As is common with lure documents, the Office document contains a message claiming that content must be enabled to access the protected file. Enabling macros leads to the start of the infection chain. First, a base64 string stored as a variable in the VBA code is written to a file. A copy of certutil.exe is made and subsequently used to decode the base64 content and save it to a new file. The new file is the malicious payload that is injected into explorer.exe using the Microsoft Application Virtualization Injector. Once running in memory, the malware is used to retrieve the next-stage payload from a remote server. Throughout this infection chain, various obfuscation and detection evasion techniques are implemented."

    "instruction": "Given the following mitigations:\nResearchers from Independent Security Evaluators have published a blog on their efforts to reverse engineer the popular dating app Bumble. The research has shown that an unverified user can bypass paying for some premium features. The attacker could also have the ability to dump the entire user-base with pictures. Some of the techniques have been mitigated, while others remain. Part of a mitigated issue is the use of sequential user IDs by Bumble as well as updating its encryption scheme. Additionally, providing distance to other users is no longer possible, which eliminates the possibility of using triangulation to locate a specific user. One technique is using an endpoint to obtain Facebook likes, pictures, and other profile information. One limitation is the attack must have the encrypted user ID available to them or one which they own. It is suspected that Bumble will address this vulnerability in the coming days. Bypassing other premium features is still functional. The use of REST APIs for inter-application communication can allow client-side communication in a stateless form. Using the Burp Suite, the team was able to explore API calls and perform the necessary functions to trigger the unintentional data leak. \n\n## Unlimited Votes\n\nBumble's mobile app limits the number of \"swipes\" a non-premium user can use per day. The request is done through an action called SERVER_ENCOUNTERS_VOTE. If the options are manipulated, an attacker could receive unlimited votes during a 24-hour period. Since there is no check on the APIs, the web application user could achieve this rather easily. \n\n## Backtrack\n\nShould a user accidentally swipe left (deny) a prospective match, the backtrack function allows for removing the parameter for exclusion. An API voting request directly would allow an attacker to change his vote from left to right (accept). \n\n## Beeline\n\nOne of the most useful functions to an attacker is the ability to see all those who've swiped right on them. Assigned user codes allow for the exploitation of this information and can be modified and used for other endpoints. \n\n## Enumeration\n\nFinally, perhaps the most useful feature is the ability to find users by employing unlimited filters. This could allow an attacker to limit search results to a certain radius. The results would also include pictures and Facebook (if connected) interests and pages liked by the victim.\n\nTo which threat these mitigations can be relevant for?",

    "instruction": "Given the following mitigations:\nKronos, around since 2014, has undergone changes throughout its history. Now word comes about the latest upgrade to the trojan, Ares. Ares is malware with new capabilities such as information exfiltration. Ares is used in conjunction with another variant dubbed Osiris. The two malwares utilize a packer written in C++ called DarkCrypter. This version of DarkCrypter should not be confused with the commercially available packer, also called DarkCrypter. In the new variant, the first 41 strings match older Kronos variants as well as the addition of eight new strings to detect analysis tools such as sandboxes. There are, at the time of this writing, two versions of the packer. The first decrypts using Blowfish. The key size for this decryption is not the standard Blowfish size - 4 through 56 bytes vs. 288 byte fixed length. The second variant uses an embedding technique that uses a compressed format rather than Blowfish encryption. This compression algorithm is identical to Ares. The packer shows itself to be a bitmap image header. This is an obvious ruse and can be seen in photos within the article. Additionally, the actor behind the malware uses BMPack, so named by Zscaler. This packer uses an XOR-based algorithm as well as RC4. Upon decryption, the file appears as a static bitmap. Each structure within the decompressed file holds a different section of a PE file that is stitched together by a custom loader and is, subsequently, executed. Ares itself is under development as evidenced by the constant testing of new plugins and web injects. An embedded DLL module is compressed and placed within the binary. An export is loaded and used to establish persistence by creating a scheduled task that executes every two hours. Though sharing most of the code with Kronos and Osiris, there are several differences. At present, most of the samples of Ares do not communicate with a C2 over TOR. The removal of the TOR component could be used to reduce the malware size. The Ares stealer attempts to extract information from FTP clients, VPN clients, web browsers, cryptocurrency wallets applications, instant messenger clients, and email clients. Ares supports the commands as Kronos and Osiris though some commands have been modified.\n\nTo which threat these mitigations can be relevant for?",

The MATA backdoor consists of a three-pronged approach - an initial loader (EXE), loader (DLL), and the payload (DAT).

The page has two primary links, one to download a ZIP file which allegedly contains a listing of available positions, and the other to upload a CV. If the victim clinks the upload link, they are taken to a fake LinkedIn login page. Should the victim enter credentials, they will then be asked to provide their mobile number, country, and an application reference number, and of course, to upload their CV. The application reference number and details are noted as being available from the aforementioned ZIP file. In August, a password was added to the ZIP file. The ZIP file contained a binary which would install either Agent Tesla or, according to Zscaler, a previously unknown infostealer. Data from victim systems was exfiltrated using email.

The campaign involved the use of Microsoft Word documents attached to the phishing emails. Rather than including malicious code in the macro itself, the macro simply creates and executes a file based on content in the document itself. Specifically, the content is reversed, base64-encoded JavaScript that is written to an HTA file. The built-in mshta.exe is then used to execute this HTA file, which in turn executes the JavaScript code in-memory. The JavaScript code leverages PowerShell to download the IcedID payload. The use of JavaScript and PowerShell in conjunction can be used as a defense evasion technique as it may confuse certain endpoint security products. The IcedID payload itself is a DLL masquerading as a JPG. From that point the malware steal credentials, which are exfiltrated to the attacker's C2 server.\n\nTo which threat these mitigations can be relevant for?",

Initial infection is accomplished through said phishing email, which contains a Google document link, presumably, from the TrickBot gang. This link leads to the Bazar backdoor as well as the Buer loader. Trickbot has previously used different botnets, including Emotet, for the carrying out of its mission. Unlike most phishing emails, this contains no attachments, only a link to the aforementioned Google documents links. The body of the email states the recipient has been terminated and a link to the termination reasoning is included. In one such email, the reason for termination was positional redundancy. The link actually redirects to a URL used to download the malware payload. Most of the cases analyzed were instances where Bazar malware was downloaded; however, in some cases Buer loader was used. The packer for both is identical. The packed binaries contain an export function that is responsible for decryption and injection. First, a shell is deployed to decrypt a leaderless PE loader which contains the final payload. Using memory allocation, the payload is mapped into memory, given permissions, and transfers control. No self-injection is used. The Bazar backdoor is new malware and is part of TrickBot's toolkit. This is reserved for almost exclusively high profile targets. The Bazar loader is used to download and execute the backdoor, which, in turn, is used to execute binaries, scripts, modules, kill processes, and self removal. Control flow is obfuscated to hinder analysis. The Bazar loader is used to download the backdoor from a C2 using a URI format. This download was captured and analyzed. As with other Trickbot certificates, the certificates for Bazar were created in the same manner. It was also seen that the backdoor downloaded and executed the Cobalt Strike pentesting and post-exploit toolkit. It is hypothesized this is done so ransomware could be deployed, data stolen, or network access could be sold. Buer loader is sold on Russian underground forums.

A report from Cisco Talos notes that Tortilla has been experimenting with various payloads. In the case of the campaign discovered by Talos in October, Tortilla appears to be exploiting the Exchange ProxyShell vulnerabilities and deploying the China Chopper web shell and Babuk ransomware variant. Other products Tortilla has been observed attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in includes Apache Struts, Atlassian Confluence, Liferay, Oracle WebLogic Server, SolarWinds Orion, and WordPress. Most of the victims of this campaign are located in the United States. Countries with smaller numbers of infections include Brazil, Finland, Germany, Honduras, Thailand, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. The deployment of Babuk is believed to be kicked off using the China Chopper web shell to execute the initial downloader which is either a DLL or .NET file. Both lead to a loader being downloaded and executed which in turn downloads an intermediary unpacker that is used to decrypt the Babuk payload, create and execute in suspended mode, a copy of the legitimate binary AddInProcess32.exe. The Babuk payload is injected into this process. The unpacker can also inject the payload into other processes. As is typical of ransomware, backup processes are searched for and if located are terminated, the volume shadow copy is deleted, and several steps including disabling Windows Defender's real-time monitoring, script scanning, and behavior monitoring are taken to avoid detection. Files are encrypted using AES-256-CTR with the ChaCha8 cipher and a ransom note demanding payment in Monero (XMR) equivalent to $10,000 USD is left on the system.

At the time it was removed, it had been installed more than 500 times. The app's author used a number of techniques to avoid Google's malicious app detections. The payload files are downloaded and installed on the victim device when the app is launched."
