    "instruction": "Havex\n\n==Introduction==\nHavex malware, also known as Backdoor.Oldrea, is a RAT employed by the Russian attributed APT group \u201cEnergetic Bear\u201d or \u201cDragonfly.\" Havex was discovered in 2013 and is one of five known ICS tailored malware developed in the past decade. These malwares include Stuxnet, BlackEnergy, Industroyer/CRASHOVERRIDE, and TRITON/TRISIS. Energetic Bear began utilizing Havex in a widespread espionage campaign targeting energy, aviation, pharmaceutical, defense, and petrochemical sectors. The campaign targeted victims primarily in the United States and Europe.\n\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe Havex malware was discovered by cybersecurity researchers at F-Secure and Symantec and reported by ICS-CERT utilizing information from both of these firms in 2013. The ICS-CERT Alert reported analyzing a new malware campaign targeting ICS equipment via several attack vectors and using OPC to conduct reconnaissance on industrial equipment on the target network.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Havex malware has two primary components: A RAT and a C&C server written in PHP.  Havex also includes an OPC (Open Platform Communications) scanning module used to search for industrial devices on a network. The OPC scanning module was designed to scan for TCP devices operating on ports 44818, 105 and 502.  Researchers at SANS noted these ports are common to ICS/SCADA companies such as Siemens and Rockwell Automation. By abusing the OPC protocol, Havex mapped industrial networks once inside victim systems.  Researchers note the OPC scanning module only operated on the older DCOM-based (Distributed Component Object Model) OPC standard and not the more recent OPC Unified Architecture (UA). Havex joins the category of ICS tailored malware because it is written to conduct information gathering on these specific systems. Havex also exploited supply chain and watering-hole attacks on ICS vendor websites in addition to spear phishing campaigns to gain access to victim systems. The watering-hole and supply chain attacks were twofold in methodology. In the first method, victims were redirected from legitimate vendor websites to corrupted pages containing the Havex malware. In the second method, the attackers compromised vulnerable vendor websites and corrupted legitimate software to inject the Havex RAT. Users would then unknowingly download the malware when downloading otherwise legitimate software from vendor websites. This method allowed the malware to bypass traditional security measure because software was downloaded by users with authorization to install programs onto the network. Known compromised vendors were MESA Imaging, eWON/Talk2M, and MB Connect Line. While the attack vectors were aimed at business networks, the lack of robust airgaps in many ICS environments could allow malware like Havex to jump easily from business networks to industrial networks and infect ICS/SCADA equipment. Havex, like other backdoor malwares, also allows for the injection of other malicious code onto victim devices. Specifically, Havex was often used to inject the Karagany payload onto compromised devices. Karagany could steal credentials, take screenshots, and transfer files to and from Dragonfly C&C servers.\n\n== Affected Regions & Victims ==\nThe Dragonfly group utilized Havex malware in an espionage campaign against energy, aviation. pharmaceutical, defense, and petrochemical victims in primarily the United States and Europe. Cybersecurity researchers at Dragos estimated the campaign targeted over 2,000 sites in these regions and sectors. Researchers at Symantec observed Havex malware began seeking energy infrastructure targets after initially targeting US and Canadian defense and aviation sectors. Through the discovery process, researchers examined 146 C&C servers associated with the Havex campaign and 88 variants of the malware.\n\n== Exploit Kits ==\n\n\n*** Website Redirect Injection ***\nHavex infected systems via watering hole attacks redirecting users to malicious websites. Corrupted websites in this campaign used the LightsOut and Hello exploit kits to infect systems with the Havex and Karagany trojans. The LightsOut exploit kit abused Java and browser vulnerabilities to deliver the Havex and Karagany payloads. The Hello exploit kit is an updated version of the LightsOut exploit kit and came into use in 2013. The updated Hello exploit kit uses footprinting to determine target OS versions, fonts, browser add-ons, and other user information. Once this information is gathered, the exploit kit redirects the victim to a malicious URL based on the most efficient exploits to gain access to the target.\n\nBased on the above text, answer the questions. How many known ICS tailored malware have been developed in the past decade, including Havex?question: Which Russian attributed APT group employed the Havex malware in a widespread espionage campaign?question: What are the two primary components of the Havex malware?question: What is the purpose of the OPC (Open Platform Communications) scanning module in the Havex malware?question: On which ports does the OPC scanning module in the Havex malware operate?question: How does the Havex malware bypass traditional security measures?question: Which vendors were known to be compromised by the Havex malware?question: What is the Karagany payload used for in the Havex malware?question: Which regions and sectors were primarily targeted by the Dragonfly group in their espionage campaign using the Havex malware?question: How many C&C servers associated with the Havex campaign were examined by researchers?question: Which exploit kit in the Havex campaign abuses Java and browser vulnerabilities to deliver the Havex and Karagany payloads?question: Which exploit kit in the Havex campaign uses footprinting to determine target OS versions, fonts, browser add-ons, and other user information?question: How does the Hello exploit kit in the Havex campaign redirect the victim to a malicious URL based on the most efficient exploits to gain access to the target?question: Which of the two exploit kits in the Havex campaign came into use in 2013?question: How many variants of the Havex malware were examined by researchers?",

    "instruction": "Great Hacker War\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Great Hacker War was a purported conflict between the Masters of Deception (MOD), an unsanctioned splinter faction of the older hacker group Legion of Doom (LOD), and several smaller associated groups. Both primary groups involved made attempts to hack into the opposing group's networks, across the Internet, X.25, and telephone networks. In a panel debate of The Next HOPE conference, Phiber Optik re-iterated that the rumored \"gang war in cyberspace\" between Legion of Doom and Masters of Deception never happened, and that it was \"a complete fabrication\" by the U.S attorney's office and some sensationalist media. Furthermore, two other high-ranking members of the LOD confirmed that the \"Great Hacker War\" never occurred, reinforcing the idea that this was just a competition of one-upmanship and not a war.\n\n== Timeline ==\nThe Great Hacker War escalated in the space of only a few days with four key events.\n\n\n*** Event One ***\nThe Great Hacker War began with the closing of an invite-only bulletin board called \"Fifth Amendment,\" whose participants were some of the world's most successful hackers. \nSaid board was run by members of the newly reformed LOD under the leadership of Chris Goggans (aka Erik Bloodaxe) and Loyd Blankenship (aka The Mentor).\nThe board's closing had been blamed on John Lee (\"Corrupt\") of the MOD in a cryptic message left to users. Chris Goggans (LOD) had claimed that Lee had been distributing information that was discussed on the board. MOD had discovered that Chris Goggans and his friends had decided to use the information being posted on the board to start a security company and contact all companies being discussed about the security flaws posted on Fifth Amendment.\n\n\n*** Event Two ***\nA few prank phone calls to the home number of the new LOD upset Goggans and prompted him to put out a call to find the personal information of the members of the MOD. Peacemakers intervened, and a conference call was arranged on an unnamed RBOC telephone bridge in the Midwest. As members of the MOD silently joined the conference call, they overheard the members of the LOD using racial slurs to describe the ethnicity of members of the MOD. The peace conference quickly degenerated into threats and prank calls to members of the LOD, whose personal information had already been uncovered by the MOD.\n\n\n*** Event Three ***\nA last-minute, late-night peace talk was held between Chris Goggans (LOD) and Mark Abene (\"Phiber Optik\") of MOD. Unknown to Goggans, John Lee (\"Corrupt\") was listening in on three-way. Goggans became angry that Abene would not fulfill his numerous demands for the personal information of MOD members, and for the MOD's hacking information that he considered the property of LOD.\nAbene refused to meet Goggans's demands, and Goggans uttered his infamous phrase that began the war in earnest \u2013 \"MOD is nothing but niggers, spics, and white trash.\" That night, prank phone calls began to flood Abene's house.\n\n\n*** Event Four ***\nThe members of the MOD decided to eavesdrop on Chris Goggans's phone calls to determine his motives. Using the undocumented remote headset feature on a DMS-100 phone switch local to Goggans, the MOD overheard what they had suspected earlier. Goggans, Scott Chasin (\"Doc Holiday\"), and Jake Kenyon Shulman (\"Malefactor\") had decided to form a security company called ComSec.\n\n\n*** Epilogue ***\nIn 1991, Phiber Optik, while attending the first CFP conference in San Francisco with Craig Neidorf, was invited to join a telephone conference bridge by fellow hackers where an apologetic Shulman expressed his remorse at how the situation had been blown out of proportion and his view that Goggans had crossed the line in informing on other hackers to law enforcement to increase the prestige of ComSec. Further, it was suspected by other LOD members that Goggans had baited Phoenix of the Australian hacker group The Realm, and was instrumental in providing evidence to Australian federal authorities. As a result, Phiber, a friend of Phoenix's, received a conference call from several original LOD members now suspicious of Goggans, wondering if they had been implicated by Goggans or other informants in Abene's pending legal case, in addition to expressing their general distaste and distrust of Goggans. In 1993 at the third CFP conference, also in San Francisco, Phiber/Abene met a small handful of his old LOD friends (minus Goggans) for the first time in person despite having been friends for nearly ten years by that point, and briefly reminisced about old times. Some years later in a public statement, Goggans would show some regret that he involved Abene in his testimonials to law enforcement. Perhaps the one thing in all this that Phiber and Lex Luthor agree on is that in reality, there simply was no \"Great Hacker War\", and that the notion of \"warring hacker gangs\" was an invention of overzealous law enforcement which was latched onto by irresponsible mass media because the imagery made for good copy.\n\nBased on the above text, answer the questions.

Further, it was suspected by other LOD members that Goggans had baited Phoenix of the Australian hacker group The Realm, and was instrumental in providing evidence to Australian federal authorities. As a result, Phiber, a friend of Phoenix's, received a conference call from several original LOD members now suspicious of Goggans, wondering if they had been implicated by Goggans or other informants in Abene's pending legal case, in addition to expressing their general distaste and distrust of Goggans. In 1993 at the third CFP conference, also in San Francisco, Phiber/Abene met a small handful of his old LOD friends (minus Goggans) for the first time in person despite having been friends for nearly ten years by that point, and briefly reminisced about old times. Some years later in a public statement, Goggans would show some regret that he involved Abene in his testimonials to law enforcement. Perhaps the one thing in all this that Phiber and Lex Luthor agree on is that in reality, there simply was no \"Great Hacker War\", and that the notion of \"warring hacker gangs\" was an invention of overzealous law enforcement which was latched onto by irresponsible mass media because the imagery made for good copy.",

      "answers": "The Great Hacker War began due to the closing of an invite-only bulletin board, \"Fifth Amendment,\" operated by members of the Legion of Doom (LOD). The board's closure was attributed to John Lee (\"Corrupt\") of the Masters of Deception (MOD), who distributed the board's information, causing LOD to suspect MOD members of planning to start a security company using the board's data.A: Racial slurs were used during a peace conference between MOD and LOD members, with the LOD using derogatory terms to describe the ethnicity of MOD members. This incident further escalated tensions between the groups.A: Chris Goggans (LOD), in a heated exchange with Mark Abene (\"Phiber Optik\") of MOD, declared that MOD was \"nothing but niggers, spics, and white trash.\" This statement is considered to have ignited the war.A: After eavesdropping on Chris Goggans's phone calls and discovering the plan for a security company, ComSec, the MOD continued to monitor the situation and escalate the war through prank calls and other means.A: The peace talk concluded with Chris Goggans becoming angry at Mark Abene's refusal to meet his demands for MOD members' personal information and hacking data. This led to Goggans making the inflammatory statement that initiated the war.A: Phiber Optik suspected Chris Goggans of informing on other hackers to law enforcement and providing evidence against Australian federal authorities, which was believed to have led to the arrest of a member of the Australian hacker group The Realm.A: Chris Goggans and his associates planned to use the information from the Fifth Amendment board to start a security company, ComSec, and contact companies about security flaws discussed on the board.A: Both Phiber Optik and Lex Luthor agreed that the \"Great Hacker War\" was an invention of overzealous law enforcement, and the concept of \"warring hacker gangs\" was latched onto by irresponsible mass media for sensationalism.A: The Legion of Doom (LOD) played a significant role in the Great Hacker War by operating the Fifth Amendment board, planning to use the information to form a security company, and engaging in heated exchanges with the Masters of Deception (MOD).A: The Great Hacker War intensified tensions between hacker groups, led to mistrust and suspicion, and ultimately resulted in legal actions against individuals involved in the conflict.A: The peace conference ended in a breakdown, as members of the MOD overheard LOD members using racial slurs and tensions escalated, leading to prank calls and further conflict.A: Mark Abene, on behalf of the MOD, refused to meet Chris Goggans's demands for personal information and hacking data, leading to Goggans making the inflammatory statement that ignited the war.A: John Lee (\"Corrupt\") was a key figure in the Great Hacker War, as he was blamed for the closure of the Fifth Amendment board and was later discovered to be listening in on a peace talk between Goggans and Abene.A: The fate of ComSec is not explicitly mentioned in the given text, but it is likely that the company's formation was hindered or derailed due to the conflict and legal actions taken against some of the individuals involved.A: The media played a role in sensationalizing the conflict by portraying it as a \"gang war in cyberspace,\" further fueling tensions and suspicion between hacker groups."

    "instruction": "Context: Darknet market\n\n==Introduction==\nA darknet market is a commercial website on the dark web that operates via darknets such as Tor and I2P. They function primarily as black markets, selling or brokering transactions involving drugs, cyber-arms, weapons, counterfeit currency, stolen credit card details, forged documents, unlicensed pharmaceuticals, steroids, and other illicit goods as well as the sale of legal products. In December 2014, a study by Gareth Owen from the University of Portsmouth suggested the second most popular sites on Tor were darknet markets.Following on from the model developed by Silk Road, contemporary markets are characterized by their use of darknet anonymized access (typically Tor), Bitcoin or Monero payment with escrow services, and eBay-like vendor feedback systems.\n\n\n\n== Market features ==\n\n\n*** Search and discussion ***\nOne of the central discussion forums was Reddit's /r/DarkNetMarkets/, which has been the subject of legal investigation, as well as the Tor-based discussion forum, The Hub. On March 21, 2018, Reddit administrators shut down the popular subreddit /r/DarkNetMarkets citing new changes to their content policy that forbids the sale of \"Drugs, including alcohol and tobacco, or any controlled substances\". This led to the rise of Dread, the dedicated darknet discussion forum and the news site Darknetlive.Many market places maintain their own dedicated discussion forums and subreddits. The majority of the marketplaces are in English, but some are opening up in Chinese, Russian, and Ukrainian.The dedicated market search engine Grams allowed the searching of multiple markets directly without login or registration.Dark web news and review sites such as the former DeepDotWeb, and All Things Vice provide exclusive interviews and commentary into the dynamic markets. Uptime and comparison services provide sources of information about active markets as well as suspected scams and law enforcement activity. Due to the decentralized nature of these markets, phishing and scam sites are often maliciously or accidentally referenced.After discovering the location of a market, a user must register on the site, sometimes with a referral link, after which they can browse listings. A further PIN may be required to perform transactions, better protecting users against login credential compromise.\n\n\n*** Customer interactions ***\n\nTransactions typically use Bitcoin for payment, sometimes combined with tumblers for added anonymity and PGP to secure communications between buyers and vendors from being stored on the site itself. Many sites use Bitcoin multisig transactions to improve security and reduce dependency on the site's escrow. The discontinued Helix Bitcoin tumbler offered direct anonymized marketplace payment integrations.On making a purchase, the buyer must transfer cryptocurrency into the site's escrow, after which a vendor dispatches their goods then claims the payment from the site. On receipt or non-receipt of the item users may leave feedback against the vendor's account. Buyers may \"finalize early\" (FE), releasing funds from escrow to the vendor prior to receiving their goods in order to expedite a transaction, but leave themselves vulnerable to fraud if they choose to do so.Following Operation Onymous, there was a substantial increase in PGP support from vendors, with PGP use on two marketplaces near 90%. This suggests that law enforcement responses to cryptomarkets result in continued security innovations, thereby making markets more resilient to undercover law enforcement efforts.\n\n\n*** Market types ***\nItems on a typical centralized darknet market are listed from a range of vendors in an eBay-like marketplace format. Virtually all such markets have advanced reputation, search and shipping features similar to Amazon.com.By 2015 some of the most popular vendors had their own dedicated online shops separate from the large marketplaces. Individual sites had returned to operating on the clearnet, with mixed success.Some criminal internet forums such as the defunct Tor Carding Forum and the Russian Anonymous Marketplace function as markets with trusted members providing escrow services, and users engaging in off-forum messaging. In May 2014 the \"Deepify\" service attempted to automate the process of setting up markets with a SAAS solution; however, this closed a short time later.Following repeated problems associated with centralized infrastructure, a number of decentralized marketplace software alternatives were set up using blockchain or peer-to-peer technologies, including OpenBazaar and Bitmarkets,\n\n== Vendors ==\nTo list on a market, a vendor may have undergone an application process via referral, proof of reputation from another market or given a cash deposit to the market.Many vendors list their wares on multiple markets, ensuring they retain their reputation even should a single market place close. Grams have launched \"InfoDesk\" to allow central content and identity management for vendors as well as PGP key distribution.Meanwhile, individual law enforcement operations regularly investigate and arrest individual vendors and those purchasing significant quantities for personal use.A February 2016 report suggested that a quarter of all DNM purchases were for resale.\n\n== Products ==\n\n\n*** Drugs ***\n\nWhilst a great many products are sold, drugs dominate the numbers of listings, with the drugs including cannabis, MDMA, modafinil, LSD, cocaine, and designer drugs.\n\n\n*** Personal information ***\nPersonally identifying information, financial information like credit card and bank account information, and medical data from medical data breaches is bought and sold, mostly in darknet markets but also in other black markets. People increase the value of the stolen data by aggregating it with publicly available data, and sell it again for a profit, increasing the damage that can be done to the people whose data was stolen.\n\n\n*** Fraud and hacking services ***\n\nCyber crime and hacking services for financial institutions and banks have also been offered over the dark web. Markets such as AlphaBay Market have hosted a significant share of the commercial fraud market, featuring carding, counterfeiting and many related services. Loyalty card information is also sold as it is easy to launder.\n\n\n*** Prohibitions and restrictions ***\nMany markets refuse to list weapons or poisons. Markets such as the original Silk Road would refuse to list anything where the \"purpose is to harm or defraud, such as stolen credit cards, assassinations, and weapons of mass destruction\".Later markets such as Evolution ban \"child pornography, services related to murder/assassination/terrorism, prostitution, Ponzi schemes, and lotteries\", but allow the wholesaling of credit card data.The market in firearms appears to attract extra attention from law enforcement, as does the selling of other weapons such as certain types of knives and blades.\n\n== Market operations ==\nNachash, former proprietor of Doxbin, wrote a guide in early 2015 entitled So, You Want To Be a Darknet Drug Lord ...\nBackground research tasks included learning from past drug lords, researching legal matters, studying law enforcement agency tactics and obtaining legal representation. With regards to the prospective market's hosting, he recommends identifying a hosting country with gaps in their mutual legal assistance treaty with one's country of residence, avoiding overpriced bulletproof hosting and choosing a web host with Tor support that accepts suitably hard-to-trace payment. Patterns recommended to avoid include hiring hitmen like Dread Pirate Roberts, and sharing handles for software questions on sites like Stack Exchange.\nHe advises on running a secured server operating system with a server-side transparent Tor proxy server, hardening web application configurations, Tor-based server administration, automated server configuration management rebuild and secure destruction with frequent server relocation rather than a darknet managed hosting service. To protect against guard node deanonymization he recommends obfuscating traffic by investing in Tor relays which the market site will exclusively use.\nFor a local machine configuration he recommends a computer purchased for cash running Linux, using a local Tor transparent proxy. For operations security he suggests avoiding storing conversation logs, varying writing styles, avoiding mobile phone-based tracking and leaking false personal details to further obfuscate one's identity. Use of OTR and PGP are recommended.\nHe recommends verifying market employees carefully, and to weed out law enforcement infiltration through barium meal tests.\nLaw enforcement and intelligence agencies have expanded investigations of dark web markets,\n\n== Fraudulent markets ==\nA large number of services pretend to be a legitimate vendor shop, or marketplace of some kind in order to defraud people. These include the notoriously unreliable gun stores, or even fake assassination websites.\n\n== Exit scams ==\n\nCentralized market escrow allows a market to close down and \"exit\" with the buyer's and vendor's cryptocurrency at any time. This has happened on several occasions such as with BlackBank, Evolution, and Wall Street Market.Individual vendors often reach a point of reputation maturity whereby they have sold sufficient product reliably to have gained a significant reputation and accumulated escrowed funds; many may choose to exit with the funds rather than compete at the higher-volume higher-priced matured product level.\n\n== Commentary ==\nIn December 2014, an exhibition by Carmen Weisskopf and Domagoj Smoljo entitled \"The Darknet: From Memes to Onionland\" explored Darknet culture. This featured a bot called the \"Random Darknet Shopper\" which spent $100 in BTC per week on products listed on Agora. Their aim was to explore the ethical and philosophical implications of these markets, which, despite high-profile internationally co-ordinated raids, persist and flourish.James Martin's 2014 book Drugs on the Dark Net: How Cryptomarkets are Transforming the Global Trade in Illicit Drugs discusses some vendors who are even branding their opium or cocaine as \"fair trade\", \"organic\" or sourced from conflict-free zones. In June 2015 journalist Jamie Bartlett gave a TED talk about the state of the darknet market ecosystem as it stood at the time.According to 2014 studies by Martin Aldridge & D\u00e9cary-H\u00e9tu and a January 2015 report from the Global Drug Policy Observatory, many harm reduction trends have been spotted. These include the reduced risks associated with street dealing such as being offered hard drugs. The vendor feedback system provides accountability for risks of mixing and side effects and protection against scammers. Online forum communities provide information about safe drug use in an environment where users can anonymously ask questions. Some users report the online element having a moderating effect on their consumption due to the increased lead time ordering from the sites compared to street dealing.Professor for addiction research Heino St\u00f6ver notes that the shops can be seen as a political statement, advancing drug legalization \"from below\". The results of these markets are higher quality and lower prices of psychoactive substances as well as a lower risk of violent incidents. A number of studies suggest that markets such as Silk Road may have helped users reduce the harm caused by illicit drug use, particularly compared with street-based drug marketplaces. Examples include the sale of high-quality products with low risk for contamination (including lacing  and cutting), vendor-tested products, sharing of trip reports, and online discussion of harm reduction practices. Some health professionals such as \"DoctorX\" provide information, advice and drug-testing services on the darknet. The quality of products is attributed to the competition and transparency of darknet markets which involve user feedback and reputation features.\nEuropol reported in December 2014, \"We have lately seen a large amount of physical crime move online, at least the 'marketing' and delivery part of the business ... [Buyers can] get the illegal commodity delivered risk-free to a place of their choice by the mailman or a courier, or maybe by drone in the future, and can pay with virtual currency and in full anonymity, without the police being able to identify either the buyer or the seller.\"In June 2015 the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) produced a report citing difficulties controlling virtual market places via darknet markets, social media and mobile apps. In August 2015 it was announced that Interpol now offers a dedicated Dark Web training program featuring technical information on Tor and cybersecurity and simulated darknet market takedowns.\nIn October 2015 the UK's National Crime Agency and GCHQ announced the formation of a \"Joint Operations Cell\" to focus on cybercrime. In November 2015 this team would be tasked with tackling child exploitation on the dark web as well as other cybercrime.In February 2015, the EMCDDA produced another report citing the increased importance of customer service and reputation management in the marketplace, the reduced risk of violence and increased product purity. It estimated a quarter of all purchases were for resale and that the trend towards decentralization meant they are unlikely to be eliminated any time soon.A June 2016 report from the Global Drug Survey described how the markets are increasing in popularity, despite ongoing law enforcement action and scams. Other findings include consumers making purchases via friends operating Tor browser and Bitcoin payments, rather than directly. Access to markets in 79% of respondents' cases led to users trying a new type of drug.\n\n== Size of listings ==\nThe size of the darknet markets economy can be problematic to estimate. A study based on a combination of listing scrapes and feedback to estimate sales volume by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University captured some of the best data. A reviewed 2013 analysis put the Silk Road grossing $300,000 a day, extrapolating to over $100 million over a year. Subsequent data from later markets has significant gaps as well as complexities associated with analysing multiple marketplaces.\n18,174 \u2013 October 2013, Digital Citizens Alliance, 13,472 of which were on Silk Road in November 2013\n41,207 \u2013 April 2014 Digital Citizens Alliance\n33,985 \u2013 May 2014 The Guardian via Reddit\n43,175 \u2013 July 2014 a report by the BBC\n65,595 \u2013 August 2014 Digital Citizens Alliance\n51,755 \u2013 December 2014 Digital Citizens Alliance\n68,835 \u2013 March 2015 (before Evolution scam), Digital Citizens Alliance\n68,322 \u2013 April 2015 (after Evolution scam)Digital Citizens Alliance\n\n== In fiction ==\nIn the episode \"eps2.3_logic-b0mb.hc\" (ep. 5 of season 2) of the drama\u2013thriller television series, Mr. Robot, the protagonist, Elliot, is supposed to be repairing a Tor hidden site which turns out to be a darknet market called \"Midland City\" styled after the Silk Road for the sale of guns, sex trafficked women, rocket launchers, drugs and hitmen for hire.In the 2016 movie Nerve starring Emma Roberts and Dave Franco, the dark web plays a major role.\nIn Grand Theft Auto Online, players who purchase warehouses and garages for illicit cargo and stolen cars can buy/steal and sell them through trade on the \"SecuroServ\" syndicate website. After the Biker DLC, players can now purchase buildings for illegal drugs and counterfeit products manufacture, and distribute them through a darknet website called \"The Open Road\" where law enforcement cannot be notified of the player's trade.\nIn the first arc of the anime series Lupin the 3rd Part V, Lupin III steals digital currency from the \"Marco Polo\" darknet market.\n\nQuestions:\nHow do darknet markets ensure anonymity in transactions?Q: What are the common features of discussion forums in darknet markets?Q: How do darknet market vendors protect their communications with buyers?Q: How do decentralized darknet markets operate?Q: What are the common products sold in darknet markets?Q: How do individual law enforcement operations impact darknet markets?Q: How do darknet markets ensure the quality of their products?Q: How have darknet markets adapted to law enforcement efforts?Q: What are some of the challenges associated with estimating the size of the darknet markets economy?Q: How do darknet markets impact the illegal drug trade?Q: How have darknet markets contributed to harm reduction trends?Q: How have darknet markets impacted the sale of illegal weapons?Q: How do fraudulent markets operate in the darknet?Q: How do exit scams operate in centralized darknet markets?Q: How have law enforcement and intelligence agencies responded to darknet markets?\n\nAnswers:\n",

Some users report the online element having a moderating effect on their consumption due to the increased lead time ordering from the sites compared to street dealing.Professor for addiction research Heino St\u00f6ver notes that the shops can be seen as a political statement, advancing drug legalization \"from below\". The results of these markets are higher quality and lower prices of psychoactive substances as well as a lower risk of violent incidents. A number of studies suggest that markets such as Silk Road may have helped users reduce the harm caused by illicit drug use, particularly compared with street-based drug marketplaces. Examples include the sale of high-quality products with low risk for contamination (including lacing  and cutting), vendor-tested products, sharing of trip reports, and online discussion of harm reduction practices. Some health professionals such as \"DoctorX\" provide information, advice and drug-testing services on the darknet. The quality of products is attributed to the competition and transparency of darknet markets which involve user feedback and reputation features.\nEuropol reported in December 2014, \"We have lately seen a large amount of physical crime move online, at least the 'marketing' and delivery part of the business ... [Buyers can] get the illegal commodity delivered risk-free to a place of their choice by the mailman or a courier, or maybe by drone in the future, and can pay with virtual currency and in full anonymity, without the police being able to identify either the buyer or the seller.\"In June 2015 the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) produced a report citing difficulties controlling virtual market places via darknet markets, social media and mobile apps. In August 2015 it was announced that Interpol now offers a dedicated Dark Web training program featuring technical information on Tor and cybersecurity and simulated darknet market takedowns.\nIn October 2015 the UK's National Crime Agency and GCHQ announced the formation of a \"Joint Operations Cell\" to focus on cybercrime. In November 2015 this team would be tasked with tackling child exploitation on the dark web as well as other cybercrime.In February 2015, the EMCDDA produced another report citing the increased importance of customer service and reputation management in the marketplace, the reduced risk of violence and increased product purity. It estimated a quarter of all purchases were for resale and that the trend towards decentralization meant they are unlikely to be eliminated any time soon.A June 2016 report from the Global Drug Survey described how the markets are increasing in popularity, despite ongoing law enforcement action and scams. Other findings include consumers making purchases via friends operating Tor browser and Bitcoin payments, rather than directly. Access to markets in 79% of respondents' cases led to users trying a new type of drug.\n\n== Size of listings ==\nThe size of the darknet markets economy can be problematic to estimate. A study based on a combination of listing scrapes and feedback to estimate sales volume by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University captured some of the best data. A reviewed 2013 analysis put the Silk Road grossing $300,000 a day, extrapolating to over $100 million over a year. Subsequent data from later markets has significant gaps as well as complexities associated with analysing multiple marketplaces.\n18,174 \u2013 October 2013, Digital Citizens Alliance, 13,472 of which were on Silk Road in November 2013\n41,207 \u2013 April 2014 Digital Citizens Alliance\n33,985 \u2013 May 2014 The Guardian via Reddit\n43,175 \u2013 July 2014 a report by the BBC\n65,595 \u2013 August 2014 Digital Citizens Alliance\n51,755 \u2013 December 2014 Digital Citizens Alliance\n68,835 \u2013 March 2015 (before Evolution scam), Digital Citizens Alliance\n68,322 \u2013 April 2015 (after Evolution scam)Digital Citizens Alliance\n\n== In fiction ==\nIn the episode \"eps2.3_logic-b0mb.hc\" (ep. 5 of season 2) of the drama\u2013thriller television series, Mr. Robot, the protagonist, Elliot, is supposed to be repairing a Tor hidden site which turns out to be a darknet market called \"Midland City\" styled after the Silk Road for the sale of guns, sex trafficked women, rocket launchers, drugs and hitmen for hire.In the 2016 movie Nerve starring Emma Roberts and Dave Franco, the dark web plays a major role.\nIn Grand Theft Auto Online, players who purchase warehouses and garages for illicit cargo and stolen cars can buy/steal and sell them through trade on the \"SecuroServ\" syndicate website. After the Biker DLC, players can now purchase buildings for illegal drugs and counterfeit products manufacture, and distribute them through a darknet website called \"The Open Road\" where law enforcement cannot be notified of the player's trade.\nIn the first arc of the anime series Lupin the 3rd Part V, Lupin III steals digital currency from the \"Marco Polo\" darknet market.",

    "instruction": "Generation of primes\n\n==Introduction==\nIn computational number theory, a variety of algorithms make it possible to generate prime numbers efficiently.  These are used in various applications, for example hashing, public-key cryptography, and search of prime factors in large numbers.\nFor relatively small numbers, it is possible to just apply trial division to each successive odd number. Prime sieves are almost always faster. Prime sieving is the fastest known way to deterministically enumerate the primes. There are some known formulas that can calculate the next prime but there is no known way to express the next prime in terms of the previous primes. Also, there is no effective known general manipulation and/or extension of some mathematical expression (even such including later primes) that deterministically calculates the next prime.\n\n\n\n== Prime sieves ==\nA prime sieve or prime number sieve is a fast type of algorithm for finding primes. There are many prime sieves. The simple sieve of Eratosthenes (250s BCE), the sieve of Sundaram (1934), the still faster but more complicated sieve of Atkin (2003), and various wheel sieves are most common.\nA prime sieve works by creating a list of all integers up to a desired limit and progressively removing composite numbers (which it directly generates) until only primes are left. This is the most efficient way to obtain a large range of primes; however, to find individual primes, direct primality tests are more efficient. Furthermore, based on the sieve formalisms, some integer sequences (sequence A240673 in the OEIS) are constructed which also could be used for generating primes in certain intervals.\n\n== Large primes ==\nFor the large primes used in cryptography, provable primes can be generated based on variants of Pocklington primality test, while probable primes can be generated with probabilistic primality tests such as the Baillie\u2013PSW primality test or the Miller\u2013Rabin primality test. Both the provable and probable primality tests rely on modular exponentiation. To further reduce the computational cost, the integers are first checked for any small prime divisors using either sieves similar to the sieve of Eratosthenes or trial division.\nIntegers of special forms, such as Mersenne primes or Fermat primes, can be efficiently tested for primality if the prime factorization of p \u2212 1 or p + 1 is known.\n\n== Complexity ==\nThe sieve of Eratosthenes is generally considered the easiest sieve to implement, but it is not the fastest in the sense of the number of operations for a given range for large sieving ranges. In its usual standard implementation (which may include basic wheel factorization for small primes), it can find all the primes up to N in time \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        log\n        \u2061\n        log\n        \u2061\n        N\n        )\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N\\log \\log N),}\n   while basic implementations of the sieve of Atkin and wheel sieves run in linear time \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N)}\n  .  Special versions of the Sieve of Eratosthenes using wheel sieve principles can have this same linear  \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N)}\n   time complexity.  A special version of the Sieve of Atkin and some special versions of wheel sieves which may include sieving using the methods from the Sieve of Eratosthenes can run in sublinear time complexity of \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        \n          /\n        \n        log\n        \u2061\n        log\n        \u2061\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N/\\log \\log N)}\n  .  Note that just because an algorithm has decreased asymptotic time complexity does not mean that a practical implementation runs faster than an algorithm with a greater asymptotic time complexity:  If in order to achieve that lesser asymptotic complexity the individual operations have a constant factor of increased time complexity that may be many times greater than for the simpler algorithm, it may never be possible within practical sieving ranges for the advantage of the reduced number of operations for reasonably large ranges to make up for this extra cost in time per operation.\nSome sieving algorithms, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes with large amounts of wheel factorization, take much less time for smaller ranges than their asymptotic time complexity would indicate because they have large negative constant offsets in their complexity and thus don't reach that asymptotic complexity until far beyond practical ranges.  For instance, the Sieve of Eratosthenes with a combination of wheel factorization and pre-culling using small primes up to 19 uses time of about a factor of two less than that predicted for the total range for a range of 1019, which total range takes hundreds of core-years to sieve for the best of sieve algorithms.\nThe simple naive \"one large sieving array\" sieves of any of these sieve types take memory space of about \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N)}\n  , which means that 1) they are very limited in the sieving ranges they can handle to the amount of RAM (memory) available and 2) that they are typically quite slow since memory access speed typically becomes the speed bottleneck more than computational speed once the array size grows beyond the size of the CPU caches.  The normally implemented page segmented sieves of both Eratosthenes and Atkin take space \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        \n          /\n        \n        log\n        \u2061\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N/\\log N)}\n   plus small sieve segment buffers which are normally sized to fit within the CPU cache; page segmented wheel sieves including special variations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes typically take much more space than this by a significant factor in order to store the required wheel representations; Pritchard's variation of the linear time complexity sieve of Eratosthenes/wheel sieve takes \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            1\n            \n              /\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        log\n        \u2061\n        log\n        \u2061\n        N\n        \n          /\n        \n        log\n        \u2061\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{1/2}\\log \\log N/\\log N)}\n   space.  The better time complexity special version of the Sieve of Atkin takes space \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          N\n          \n            1\n            \n              /\n            \n            2\n            +\n            o\n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N^{1/2+o(1)}}\n  . Sorenson shows an improvement to the wheel sieve that takes even less space at \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        \n          /\n        \n        (\n        (\n        log\n        \u2061\n        N\n        \n          )\n          \n            L\n          \n        \n        log\n        \u2061\n        log\n        \u2061\n        N\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N/((\\log N)^{L}\\log \\log N))}\n   for any \n  \n    \n      \n        L\n        >\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L>1}\n  .  However, the following is a general observation: the more the amount of memory is reduced, the greater the constant factor increase in the cost in time per operation even though the asymptotic time complexity may remain the same, meaning that the memory-reduced versions may run many times slower than the non-memory-reduced versions by quite a large factor.\nWhat is a prime sieve and how does it work?question: Why are prime sieves more efficient for finding a range of primes compared to direct primality tests?question: What are provable primes and how can they be generated for cryptographic purposes?question: How do integers of special forms, such as Mersenne primes or Fermat primes, differ in primality testing?question: What is the time complexity of the Sieve of Eratosthenes in its standard implementation?question: How does the time complexity of the Sieve of Eratosthenes compare to the Sieve of Atkin and wheel sieves?question: What are the limitations of the \"one large sieving array\" sieves in terms of memory space?question: How do page segmented sieves differ from \"one large sieving array\" sieves in terms of memory space?question: How does the time complexity of the better time complexity special version of the Sieve of Atkin compare to the standard implementation?question: How does the memory usage of Sorenson's improvement to the wheel sieve compare to the standard implementation?question: What is the trade-off between memory usage and time complexity in prime sieve algorithms?question: How do special versions of the Sieve of Eratosthenes differ from the standard implementation in terms of time complexity?question: How do some special versions of wheel sieves differ from the standard implementation in terms of time complexity?question: How can the Sieve of Eratosthenes be optimized for smaller ranges?question: How do page segmented wheel sieves differ from other page segmented sieves in terms of memory usage?",

The normally implemented page segmented sieves of both Eratosthenes and Atkin take space \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        N\n        \n          /\n        \n        log\n        \u2061\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N/\\log N)}\n   plus small sieve segment buffers which are normally sized to fit within the CPU cache; page segmented wheel sieves including special variations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes typically take much more space than this by a significant factor in order to store the required wheel representations; Pritchard's variation of the linear time complexity sieve of Eratosthenes/wheel sieve takes \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          N\n          \n            1\n            \n              /\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n        log\n        \u2061\n        log\n        \u2061\n        N\n        \n          /\n        \n        log\n        \u2061\n        N\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(N^{1/2}\\log \\log N/\\log N)}\n   space.  The better time complexity special version of the Sieve of Atkin takes space \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          N\n          \n            1\n            \n              /\n            \n            2\n            +\n            o\n            (\n            1\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N^{1/2+o(1)}}\n  .

However, the following is a general observation: the more the amount of memory is reduced, the greater the constant factor increase in the cost in time per operation even though the asymptotic time complexity may remain the same, meaning that the memory-reduced versions may run many times slower than the non-memory-reduced versions by quite a large factor.",

    "instruction": "Privilege escalation\n\n==Introduction==\nPrivilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, a design flaw, or a configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. The result is that an application with more privileges than intended by the application developer or system administrator can perform unauthorized actions.\n\n== Background ==\nMost computer systems are designed for use with multiple user accounts, each of which has abilities known as privileges. Common privileges include viewing and editing files or modifying system files.\nPrivilege escalation means users receive privileges they are not entitled to. These privileges can be used to delete files, view private information, or install unwanted programs such as viruses. It usually occurs when a system has a bug that allows security to be bypassed or, alternatively, has flawed design assumptions about how it will be used.  Privilege escalation occurs in two forms:\n\nVertical privilege escalation, also known as privilege elevation, where a lower privilege user or application accesses functions or content reserved for higher privilege users or applications (e.g. Internet Banking users can access site administrative functions or the password for a smartphone can be bypassed.)\nHorizontal privilege escalation, where a normal user accesses functions or content reserved for other normal users (e.g. Internet Banking User A accesses the Internet bank account of User B)\n\n== Vertical ==\n\nThis type of privilege escalation occurs when the user or process is able to obtain a higher level of access than an administrator or system developer intended, possibly by performing kernel-level operations.\n\n\n*** Examples ***\nIn some cases, a high-privilege application assumes that it would only be provided with input matching its interface specification, thus doesn't validate this input. Then, an attacker may be able to exploit this assumption, in order to run unauthorized code with the application's privileges:\n\nSome Windows services are configured to run under the Local System user account. A vulnerability such as a buffer overflow may be used to execute arbitrary code with privilege elevated to Local System.  Alternatively, a system service that is impersonating a lesser user can elevate that user's privileges if errors are not handled correctly while the user is being impersonated (e.g. if the user has introduced a malicious error handler)\nUnder some legacy versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system, the All Users screensaver runs under the Local System account \u2013 any account that can replace the current screensaver binary in the file system or Registry can therefore elevate privileges.\nIn certain versions of the Linux kernel it was possible to write a program that would set its current directory to /etc/cron.d, request that a core dump be performed in case it crashes and then have itself killed by another process. The core dump file would have been placed at the program's current directory, that is, /etc/cron.d, and cron would have treated it as a text file instructing it to run programs on schedule. Because the contents of the file would be under attacker's control, the attacker would be able to execute any program with root privileges.\nCross Zone Scripting is a type of privilege escalation attack in which a website subverts the security model of web browsers, thus allowing it to run malicious code on client computers.\nThere are also situations where an application can use other high privilege services and has incorrect assumptions about how a client could manipulate its use of these services. An application that can execute Command line or shell commands could have a Shell Injection vulnerability if it uses unvalidated input as part of an executed command.  An attacker would then be able to run system commands using the application's privileges.\nTexas Instruments calculators (particularly the TI-85 and TI-82) were originally designed to use only interpreted programs written in dialects of TI-BASIC; however, after users discovered bugs that could be exploited to allow native Z-80 code to run on the calculator hardware, TI released programming data to support third-party development. (This did not carry on to the ARM-based TI-Nspire, for which jailbreaks using Ndless have been found but are still actively fought against by Texas Instruments.)\nSome versions of the iPhone allow an unauthorised user to access the phone while it is locked.\n\n\n*** Jailbreaking ***\n\nIn computer security, jailbreaking is defined as the act of removing limitations that a vendor attempted to hard-code into its software or services. A common example is the use of toolsets to break out of a chroot or jail in UNIX-like operating systems or bypassing digital rights management (DRM). In the former case, it allows the user to see files outside of the filesystem that the administrator intends to make available to the application or user in question. In the context of DRM, this allows the user to run arbitrarily defined code on devices with DRM as well as break out of chroot-like restrictions. The term originated with the iPhone/iOS jailbreaking community and has also been used as a term for PlayStation Portable hacking; these devices have repeatedly been subject to jailbreaks, allowing the execution of arbitrary code, and sometimes have had those jailbreaks disabled by vendor updates.\niOS systems including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch have been subject to iOS jailbreaking efforts since they were released, and continuing with each firmware update. iOS jailbreaking tools include the option to install package frontends such as Cydia and Installer.app, third-party alternatives to the App Store, as a way to find and install system tweaks and binaries. To prevent iOS jailbreaking, Apple has made the device boot ROM execute checks for SHSH blobs in order to disallow uploads of custom kernels and prevent software downgrades to earlier, jailbreakable firmware. In an \"untethered\" jailbreak, the iBoot environment is changed to execute a boot ROM exploit and allow submission of a patched low level bootloader or hack the kernel to submit the jailbroken kernel after the SHSH check.\nA similar method of jailbreaking exists for S60 Platform smartphones, where utilities such as HelloOX allow the execution of unsigned code and full access to system files. or edited firmware (similar to the M33 hacked firmware used for the PlayStation Portable) to circumvent restrictions on unsigned code. Nokia has since issued updates to curb unauthorized jailbreaking, in a manner similar to Apple.\nIn the case of gaming consoles, jailbreaking is often used to execute homebrew games. In 2011, Sony, with assistance from law firm Kilpatrick Stockton, sued 21-year-old George Hotz and associates of the group fail0verflow for jailbreaking the PlayStation 3 (see Sony Computer Entertainment America v. George Hotz and PlayStation Jailbreak).\n\n\n*** Android ***\n\nAndroid phones can be officially rooted by either going through manufacturers controlled process, using an exploit to gain root, or flashing custom recovery. Manufacturers allow rooting through a process they control, while some allow the phone to be rooted simply by pressing specific key combinations at boot time, or by other self-administered methods. Using a manufacturers method almost always factory resets the device, making rooting useless to people who want to view the data, and also voids the warranty permanently, even if the device is derooted and reflashed. Software exploits commonly either target a root-level process that is accessible to the user, by using an exploit specific to the phone's kernel, or using a known Android exploit that has been patched in newer versions; by not upgrading the phone, or intentionally downgrading the version.\n\n\n*** Mitigation strategies ***\nOperating systems and users can use the following strategies to reduce the risk of privilege escalation:\n\nData Execution Prevention\nAddress space layout randomization (to make it harder for buffer overruns to execute privileged instructions at known addresses in memory)\nRunning applications with least privilege (for example by running Internet Explorer with the Administrator SID disabled in the process token) in order to reduce the ability of buffer overrun exploits to abuse the privileges of an elevated user.\nRequiring kernel mode code to be digitally signed.\nPatching\nUse of compilers that trap buffer overruns\nEncryption of software and/or firmware components.\nUse of an operating system with Mandatory Access Controls (MAC) such as SELinux\n\n== Horizontal ==\nHorizontal privilege escalation occurs when an application allows the attacker to gain access to resources which normally would have been protected from an application or user. The result is that the application performs actions with the same user but different security context than intended by the application developer or system administrator; this is effectively a limited form of privilege escalation (specifically, the unauthorized assumption of the capability of impersonating other users). Compared to the vertical privilege escalation, horizontal requires no upgrading the privilege of accounts. It often relies on the bugs in the system.\n\n\n*** Examples ***\nThis problem often occurs in web applications.  Consider the following example:\n\nUser A has access to their own bank account in an Internet Banking application.\nUser B has access to their own bank account in the same Internet Banking application.\nThe vulnerability occurs when User A is able to access User B's bank account by performing some sort of malicious activity.This malicious activity may be possible due to common web application weaknesses or vulnerabilities.\nPotential web application vulnerabilities or situations that may lead to this condition include:\n\nPredictable session IDs in the user's HTTP cookie\nSession fixation\nCross-site scripting\nEasily guessable passwords\nTheft or hijacking of session cookies\nKeystroke logging\n\nWhat is privilege escalation and what are its two forms?Question: What is the impact of vertical privilege escalation?Question: How does vertical privilege escalation occur in Windows?Question: How does vertical privilege escalation occur in Linux?Question: What is Cross Zone Scripting and how is it a type of privilege escalation attack?Question: What is jailbreaking and what are its common uses?Question: How does Apple prevent iOS jailbreaking?Question: What is horizontal privilege escalation and how does it differ from vertical privilege escalation?Question: How does horizontal privilege escalation occur in web applications?Question: What is the impact of horizontal privilege escalation in web applications?Question: How can operating systems and users reduce the risk of privilege escalation?Question: What is an example of a vulnerability that can lead to privilege escalation in Windows?Question: What is an example of a vulnerability that can lead to privilege escalation in Linux?Question: What is an example of a vulnerability that can lead to horizontal privilege escalation in web applications?Question: What is an example of a situation that can lead to horizontal privilege escalation in web applications?",

It exists in two forms: vertical privilege escalation, where a lower privilege user or application accesses functions or content reserved for higher privilege users or applications, and horizontal privilege escalation, where a normal user accesses functions or content reserved for other normal users.Answer: Vertical privilege escalation allows users or applications to perform unauthorized actions, such as deleting files, viewing private information, or installing unwanted programs.Answer: Vertical privilege escalation can occur in Windows when a high-privilege application assumes that it would only be provided with input matching its interface specification, but doesn't validate this input. An attacker may then be able to exploit this assumption to run unauthorized code with the application's privileges.Answer: Vertical privilege escalation can occur in Linux when an attacker is able to write a program that sets its current directory to a protected location, such as /etc/cron.d, and then have the program killed by another process. The resulting core dump file would be treated as a text file instructing cron to run programs on schedule, allowing the attacker to execute any program with root privileges.Answer: Cross Zone Scripting is a type of privilege escalation attack in which a website subverts the security model of web browsers, thus allowing it to run malicious code on client computers. This is a form of vertical privilege escalation, as the website is able to access functions or content reserved for higher privilege users or applications (the web browser).Answer: Jailbreaking is the act of removing limitations that a vendor has attempted to hard-code into its software or services. It is commonly used to allow the execution of arbitrary code, break out of chroot-like restrictions, or bypass digital rights management. In the context of iOS devices, jailbreaking allows users to install package frontends such as Cydia and Installer.app, which provide access to system tweaks and binaries.Answer: Apple prevents iOS jailbreaking by making the device boot ROM execute checks for SHSH blobs in order to disallow uploads of custom kernels and prevent software downgrades to earlier, jailbreakable firmware. In an \"untethered\" jailbreak, the iBoot environment is changed to execute a boot ROM exploit and allow submission of a patched low level bootloader or hack the kernel to submit the jailbroken kernel after the SHSH check.Answer: Horizontal privilege escalation is a type of privilege escalation that occurs when an application allows the attacker to gain access to resources which normally would have been protected from an application or user. It differs from vertical privilege escalation in that it does not involve upgrading the privilege of accounts, and instead relies on bugs in the system.Answer: Horizontal privilege escalation can occur in web applications when an attacker is able to access resources, such as another user's bank account, by performing some sort of malicious activity. This malicious activity may be possible due to common web application weaknesses or vulnerabilities, such as predictable session IDs, session fixation, cross-site scripting, easily guessable passwords, theft or hijacking of session cookies, and keystroke logging.Answer: The impact of horizontal privilege escalation in web applications is that the application performs actions with the same user but different security context than intended by the application developer or system administrator. This is effectively a limited form of privilege escalation, specifically, the unauthorized assumption of the capability of impersonating other users.Answer: Operating systems and users can reduce the risk of privilege escalation by implementing strategies such as Data Execution Prevention, Address space layout randomization, running applications with least privilege, requiring kernel mode code to be digitally signed, patching, using compilers that trap buffer overruns, encryption of software and/or firmware components, and using an operating system with Mandatory Access Controls.Answer: An example of a vulnerability that can lead to privilege escalation in Windows is a buffer overflow in a high-privilege application. This can occur when the application assumes that it would only be provided with input matching its interface specification, but doesn't validate this input. An attacker may then be able to exploit this assumption to run unauthorized code with the application's privileges.Answer: An example of a vulnerability that can lead to privilege escalation in Linux is a bug in the Linux kernel that allows an attacker to write a program that sets its current directory to a protected location, such as /etc/cron.d, and then have the program killed by another process. The resulting core dump file would be treated as a text file instructing cron to run programs on schedule, allowing the attacker to execute any program with root privileges.Answer: An example of a vulnerability that can lead to horizontal privilege escalation in web applications is predictable session IDs in the user's HTTP cookie. This can allow an attacker to access resources, such as another user's bank account, by performing some sort of malicious activity.Answer: An example of a situation that can lead to horizontal privilege escalation in web applications is cross-site scripting. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially allowing the attacker to access resources, such as another user's bank account.",

      "context": "Privilege escalation\n\n==Introduction==\nPrivilege escalation is the act of exploiting a bug, a design flaw, or a configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. The result is that an application with more privileges than intended by the application developer or system administrator can perform unauthorized actions.\n\n== Background ==\nMost computer systems are designed for use with multiple user accounts, each of which has abilities known as privileges. Common privileges include viewing and editing files or modifying system files.\nPrivilege escalation means users receive privileges they are not entitled to. These privileges can be used to delete files, view private information, or install unwanted programs such as viruses. It usually occurs when a system has a bug that allows security to be bypassed or, alternatively, has flawed design assumptions about how it will be used.  Privilege escalation occurs in two forms:\n\nVertical privilege escalation, also known as privilege elevation, where a lower privilege user or application accesses functions or content reserved for higher privilege users or applications (e.g. Internet Banking users can access site administrative functions or the password for a smartphone can be bypassed.)\nHorizontal privilege escalation, where a normal user accesses functions or content reserved for other normal users (e.g. Internet Banking User A accesses the Internet bank account of User B)\n\n== Vertical ==\n\nThis type of privilege escalation occurs when the user or process is able to obtain a higher level of access than an administrator or system developer intended, possibly by performing kernel-level operations.\n\n\n*** Examples ***\nIn some cases, a high-privilege application assumes that it would only be provided with input matching its interface specification, thus doesn't validate this input. Then, an attacker may be able to exploit this assumption, in order to run unauthorized code with the application's privileges:\n\nSome Windows services are configured to run under the Local System user account. A vulnerability such as a buffer overflow may be used to execute arbitrary code with privilege elevated to Local System.  Alternatively, a system service that is impersonating a lesser user can elevate that user's privileges if errors are not handled correctly while the user is being impersonated (e.g. if the user has introduced a malicious error handler)\nUnder some legacy versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system, the All Users screensaver runs under the Local System account \u2013 any account that can replace the current screensaver binary in the file system or Registry can therefore elevate privileges.\nIn certain versions of the Linux kernel it was possible to write a program that would set its current directory to /etc/cron.d, request that a core dump be performed in case it crashes and then have itself killed by another process. The core dump file would have been placed at the program's current directory, that is, /etc/cron.d, and cron would have treated it as a text file instructing it to run programs on schedule. Because the contents of the file would be under attacker's control, the attacker would be able to execute any program with root privileges.\nCross Zone Scripting is a type of privilege escalation attack in which a website subverts the security model of web browsers, thus allowing it to run malicious code on client computers.\nThere are also situations where an application can use other high privilege services and has incorrect assumptions about how a client could manipulate its use of these services. An application that can execute Command line or shell commands could have a Shell Injection vulnerability if it uses unvalidated input as part of an executed command.  An attacker would then be able to run system commands using the application's privileges.\nTexas Instruments calculators (particularly the TI-85 and TI-82) were originally designed to use only interpreted programs written in dialects of TI-BASIC; however, after users discovered bugs that could be exploited to allow native Z-80 code to run on the calculator hardware, TI released programming data to support third-party development. (This did not carry on to the ARM-based TI-Nspire, for which jailbreaks using Ndless have been found but are still actively fought against by Texas Instruments.)\nSome versions of the iPhone allow an unauthorised user to access the phone while it is locked.\n\n\n*** Jailbreaking ***\n\nIn computer security, jailbreaking is defined as the act of removing limitations that a vendor attempted to hard-code into its software or services. A common example is the use of toolsets to break out of a chroot or jail in UNIX-like operating systems or bypassing digital rights management (DRM). In the former case, it allows the user to see files outside of the filesystem that the administrator intends to make available to the application or user in question. In the context of DRM, this allows the user to run arbitrarily defined code on devices with DRM as well as break out of chroot-like restrictions. The term originated with the iPhone/iOS jailbreaking community and has also been used as a term for PlayStation Portable hacking; these devices have repeatedly been subject to jailbreaks, allowing the execution of arbitrary code, and sometimes have had those jailbreaks disabled by vendor updates.\niOS systems including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch have been subject to iOS jailbreaking efforts since they were released, and continuing with each firmware update. iOS jailbreaking tools include the option to install package frontends such as Cydia and Installer.app, third-party alternatives to the App Store, as a way to find and install system tweaks and binaries. To prevent iOS jailbreaking, Apple has made the device boot ROM execute checks for SHSH blobs in order to disallow uploads of custom kernels and prevent software downgrades to earlier, jailbreakable firmware. In an \"untethered\" jailbreak, the iBoot environment is changed to execute a boot ROM exploit and allow submission of a patched low level bootloader or hack the kernel to submit the jailbroken kernel after the SHSH check.\nA similar method of jailbreaking exists for S60 Platform smartphones, where utilities such as HelloOX allow the execution of unsigned code and full access to system files. or edited firmware (similar to the M33 hacked firmware used for the PlayStation Portable) to circumvent restrictions on unsigned code. Nokia has since issued updates to curb unauthorized jailbreaking, in a manner similar to Apple.\nIn the case of gaming consoles, jailbreaking is often used to execute homebrew games. In 2011, Sony, with assistance from law firm Kilpatrick Stockton, sued 21-year-old George Hotz and associates of the group fail0verflow for jailbreaking the PlayStation 3 (see Sony Computer Entertainment America v. George Hotz and PlayStation Jailbreak).\n\n\n*** Android ***\n\nAndroid phones can be officially rooted by either going through manufacturers controlled process, using an exploit to gain root, or flashing custom recovery. Manufacturers allow rooting through a process they control, while some allow the phone to be rooted simply by pressing specific key combinations at boot time, or by other self-administered methods. Using a manufacturers method almost always factory resets the device, making rooting useless to people who want to view the data, and also voids the warranty permanently, even if the device is derooted and reflashed. Software exploits commonly either target a root-level process that is accessible to the user, by using an exploit specific to the phone's kernel, or using a known Android exploit that has been patched in newer versions; by not upgrading the phone, or intentionally downgrading the version.\n\n\n*** Mitigation strategies ***\nOperating systems and users can use the following strategies to reduce the risk of privilege escalation:\n\nData Execution Prevention\nAddress space layout randomization (to make it harder for buffer overruns to execute privileged instructions at known addresses in memory)\nRunning applications with least privilege (for example by running Internet Explorer with the Administrator SID disabled in the process token) in order to reduce the ability of buffer overrun exploits to abuse the privileges of an elevated user.\nRequiring kernel mode code to be digitally signed.\nPatching\nUse of compilers that trap buffer overruns\nEncryption of software and/or firmware components.\nUse of an operating system with Mandatory Access Controls (MAC) such as SELinux\n\n== Horizontal ==\nHorizontal privilege escalation occurs when an application allows the attacker to gain access to resources which normally would have been protected from an application or user. The result is that the application performs actions with the same user but different security context than intended by the application developer or system administrator; this is effectively a limited form of privilege escalation (specifically, the unauthorized assumption of the capability of impersonating other users). Compared to the vertical privilege escalation, horizontal requires no upgrading the privilege of accounts. It often relies on the bugs in the system.\n\n\n*** Examples ***\nThis problem often occurs in web applications.  Consider the following example:\n\nUser A has access to their own bank account in an Internet Banking application.\nUser B has access to their own bank account in the same Internet Banking application.\nThe vulnerability occurs when User A is able to access User B's bank account by performing some sort of malicious activity.This malicious activity may be possible due to common web application weaknesses or vulnerabilities.\nPotential web application vulnerabilities or situations that may lead to this condition include:\n\nPredictable session IDs in the user's HTTP cookie\nSession fixation\nCross-site scripting\nEasily guessable passwords\nTheft or hijacking of session cookies\nKeystroke logging",

    "instruction": "POODLE\n\n==Introduction==\nPOODLE (which stands for \"Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption\") is a security vulnerability which takes advantage of the fallback to SSL 3.0. If attackers successfully exploit this vulnerability, on average, they only need to make 256 SSL 3.0 requests to reveal one byte of encrypted messages. Bodo M\u00f6ller, Thai Duong and Krzysztof Kotowicz from the Google Security Team discovered this vulnerability; they disclosed the vulnerability publicly on October 14, 2014 (despite the paper being dated \"September 2014\" ). On December 8, 2014 a variation of the POODLE vulnerability that affected TLS was announced.The CVE-ID associated with the original POODLE attack is CVE-2014-3566.\nF5 Networks filed for CVE-2014-8730 as well, see POODLE attack against TLS section below.\n\n== Prevention ==\nTo mitigate the POODLE attack, one approach is to completely disable SSL 3.0 on the client side and the server side. However, some old clients and servers do not support TLS 1.0 and above. Thus, the authors of the paper on POODLE attacks also encourage browser and server implementation of TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV, which will make downgrade attacks impossible.Another mitigation is to implement \"anti-POODLE record splitting\". It splits the records into several parts and ensures none of them can be attacked. However the problem of the splitting is that, though valid according to the specification, it may also cause compatibility issues due to problems in server-side implementations.A full list of browser versions and levels of vulnerability to different attacks (including POODLE) can be found in the article Transport Layer Security. \nOpera 25 implemented this mitigation in addition to TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV.Google's Chrome browser and their servers had already supported TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV. Google stated in October 2014 it was planning to remove SSL 3.0 support from their products completely within a few months. Fallback to SSL 3.0 has been disabled in Chrome 39, released in November 2014. SSL 3.0 has been disabled by default in Chrome 40, released in January 2015.Mozilla disabled SSL 3.0 in Firefox 34 and ESR 31.3, which were released in December 2014, and added support of TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV in Firefox 35.Microsoft published a security advisory to explain how to disable SSL 3.0 in Internet Explorer and Windows OS, and on October 29, 2014, Microsoft released a fix which disables SSL 3.0 in Internet Explorer on Windows Vista / Server 2003 and above and announced a plan to disable SSL 3.0 by default in their products and services within a few months. Microsoft disabled fallback to SSL 3.0 in Internet Explorer 11 for Protect Mode sites on February 10, 2015, and for other sites on April 14, 2015.Apple's Safari (on OS X 10.8, iOS 8.1 and later) mitigated against POODLE by removing support for all CBC protocols in SSL 3.0, however, this left RC4 which is also completely broken by the RC4 attacks in SSL 3.0.. POODLE was completely mitigated in OS X 10.11 (El Capitan 2015) and iOS 9 (2015). \nTo prevent the POODLE attack, some web services dropped support of SSL 3.0. Examples include CloudFlare and Wikimedia.Network Security Services version 3.17.1 (released on October 3, 2014) and 3.16.2.3 (released on October 27, 2014) introduced support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV, and NSS will disable SSL 3.0 by default in April 2015. OpenSSL versions 1.0.1j, 1.0.0o and 0.9.8zc, released on October 15, 2014, introduced support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV.

This attack exploits implementation flaws of CBC encryption mode in the TLS 1.0 - 1.2 protocols.  Even though TLS specifications require servers to check the padding, some implementations fail to validate it properly, which makes some servers vulnerable to POODLE even if they disable SSL 3.0.  SSL Pulse showed \"about 10% of the servers are vulnerable to the POODLE attack against TLS\" before this vulnerability was announced.  The CVE-ID for F5 Networks' implementation bug is CVE-2014-8730.  The entry in NIST's NVD states that this CVE-ID is to be used only for F5 Networks' implementation of TLS, and that other vendors whose products have the same failure to validate the padding mistake in their implementations like A10 Networks and Cisco Systems need to issue their own CVE-IDs for their implementation errors because this is not a flaw in the protocol but in the implementation.\nThe POODLE attack against TLS was found to be easier to initiate than the initial POODLE attack against SSL.

The CVE-ID for F5 Networks' implementation bug is CVE-2014-8730.  The entry in NIST's NVD states that this CVE-ID is to be used only for F5 Networks' implementation of TLS, and that other vendors whose products have the same failure to validate the padding mistake in their implementations like A10 Networks and Cisco Systems need to issue their own CVE-IDs for their implementation errors because this is not a flaw in the protocol but in the implementation.\nThe POODLE attack against TLS was found to be easier to initiate than the initial POODLE attack against SSL.  There is no need to downgrade clients to SSL 3.0, meaning fewer steps are needed to execute a successful attack.",

    "instruction": "Patch Tuesday\n\n==Introduction==\nPatch Tuesday (also known as Update Tuesday) is an unofficial term used to refer to when Microsoft, Adobe, Oracle and others regularly release software patches for their software products. It is widely referred to in this way by the industry. Microsoft formalized Patch Tuesday in October 2003. Patch Tuesday is known within Microsoft also as the \"B\" release, to distinguish it from the \"C\" and \"D\" releases that occur in the third and fourth weeks of the month, respectively.Patch Tuesday occurs on the second Tuesday of each month in North America. Critical security updates are occasionally released outside of the normal Patch Tuesday cycle; these are known as \"Out-of-band\" releases. As far as the integrated Windows Update (WU) function is concerned, Patch Tuesday begins at 10:00 a.m. PST. Vulnerability information is immediately available in the Security Update Guide. The updates show up in Download Center before they are added to WU, and the KB articles are unlocked later.\nDaily updates consist of malware database refreshes for Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials, these updates are not part of the normal Patch Tuesday release cycle.\n\n== Security implications ==\nAn obvious security implication is that security problems that have a solution are withheld from the public for up to a month. This policy is adequate when the vulnerability is not widely known or is extremely obscure, but that is not always the case.\nThere have been cases where vulnerability information became public or actual worms were circulating prior to the next scheduled Patch Tuesday. In critical cases Microsoft issues corresponding patches as they become ready, alleviating the risk if updates are checked for and installed frequently.\nAt the Ignite 2015 event, Microsoft revealed a change in distributing security patches. They release security updates to home PCs, tablets and phones as soon as they are ready, while enterprise customers will stay on the monthly update cycle, which was reworked as Windows Update for Business.\n\n== Exploit Wednesday ==\nMany exploitation events are seen shortly after the release of a patch; analysis of the patch helps exploit developers to immediately take advantage of the previously undisclosed vulnerability, which will remain in unpatched systems. Therefore, the term \"Exploit Wednesday\" was coined.\n\n\n*** Discontinued Windows versions ***\nMicrosoft warned users that it discontinued support for Windows XP starting on April 8, 2014 \u2013  users running Windows XP afterwards would be at the risk of attacks. As security patches of newer Windows versions can reveal similar (or same) vulnerabilities already present in older Windows versions, this can allow attacks on devices with unsupported Windows versions (cf. \"zero-day attacks\"). However Microsoft stopped fixing such (and other) vulnerabilities in unsupported Windows versions, regardless how widely known they became, leaving devices running these Windows versions vulnerable to attacks.  Microsoft made a singular exception during the rapid spread of the WannaCry ransomware and released patches in May 2017 for the by then-unsupported Windows XP, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2003 (in addition to then supported Windows versions).For Windows Vista \"extended support\" was ended April 11, 2017, which will leave vulnerabilities discovered afterwards unfixed, creating the same situation for Vista as for XP before.For Windows 7 (including Service Pack 1), support ended January 14, 2020, and on January 10, 2023 for Windows 8.1; this will cause the same \"unfixed vulnerabilities\" issue for users of these operating systems. Support for Windows 8 already ended January 12, 2016 (with users having to install Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 to continue to get support), and support for Windows 7 without SP1 was ended April 9, 2013 (with the ability to install SP1 to continue to get support until 2020, or having to install Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 to receive support after 2020).\n\n\n*** Windows 10 and 11 ***\n\nStarting with Windows 10, Microsoft began releasing feature updates of Windows twice per year. These releases brought new functionalities, and are governed by Microsoft's modern lifecycle policy, which specifies a support period of 18-36 months. This is in contrast to previous Windows versions, which received only infrequent updates via service packs, and whose support was governed by the fixed lifecycle policy. With the release of Windows 11, both Windows 10 and 11 started receiving annual feature updates in the second half of the year.\nOnce a release's support period ends, devices must be updated to the latest feature update in order to receive updates from Microsoft. As such, for Home and Pro editions of Windows 10 and 11, the latest Windows version is downloaded and installed automatically when the device approaches the end of support date.\n\nIn addition to the commonly used editions like Home and Pro, Microsoft offers specialized Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) versions of Windows 10 with longer support timelines, governed by Microsoft's fixed lifecycle policy. For instance, Windows 10 Enterprise 2016 LTSB will receive extended support until October 13, 2026, and Windows 10 LTSC 2019 will receive extended support until January 9, 2029.\n\n== Adoption by other companies ==\nSAP's \"Security Patch Day\", when the company advises users to install security updates, was chosen to coincide with Patch Tuesdays. Adobe Systems' update schedule for Flash Player since November 2012 also coincides with Patch Tuesday. One of the reasons for this is that Flash Player comes as part of Windows starting with Windows 8 and Flash Player updates for the built-in and the plugin based version both need to be published at the same time in order to prevent reverse-engineering threats. Oracle's quarterly updates coincide with Patch Tuesday.\n\n== Bandwidth impact ==\nWindows Update uses the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download the updates, using idle network bandwidth. However BITS will use the speed as reported by the network interface (NIC) to calculate bandwidth. This can lead to bandwidth calculation errors, for example when a fast network adapter (e.g. 10 Mbit/s) is connected to the network via a slow link (e.g. 56 kbit/s) \u2013  according to Microsoft \"BITS will compete for the full bandwidth [of the NIC] ... BITS has no visibility of the network traffic beyond the client.\"Furthermore, the Windows Update servers of Microsoft do not honor the TCP's slow start congestion control strategy. As a result, other users on the same network may experience significantly slower connections from machines actively retrieving updates. This can be particularly noticeable in environments where many machines individually retrieve updates over a shared, bandwidth-constrained link such as those found in many multi-PC homes and small to medium-sized businesses. Bandwidth demands of patching large numbers of computers can be reduced significantly by deploying Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) to distribute the updates locally.\nIn addition to updates being downloaded from Microsoft servers, Windows 10 devices can \"share\" updates in a peer-to-peer fashion with other Windows 10 devices on the local network, or even with Windows 10 devices on the internet. This can potentially distribute updates faster while reducing usage for networks with a metered connection.\n\nAnswer these questions based on the above context: What is the unofficial term used to refer to the day when Microsoft, Adobe, Oracle and others regularly release software patches for their products?q: How often does Microsoft formally release security patches?q: What is the policy of withholding security patches for up to a month before releasing them?q: What is the term for exploitation events seen shortly after the release of a patch?q: What did Microsoft do to address the risk of attacks on devices with unsupported Windows versions?q: What is the support period for feature updates of Windows 10 and 11?q: What happens to devices when the support period of a release ends?q: What are the specialized Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) versions of Windows 10 with longer support timelines?q: What is the bandwidth calculation error caused by BITS using the speed as reported by the network interface (NIC) to calculate bandwidth?q: How do the Windows Update servers of Microsoft impact other users on the same network?q: How do Windows 10 devices \"share\" updates in a peer-to-peer fashion with other Windows 10 devices?q: What is the impact of bandwidth demands of patching large numbers of computers?q: How can bandwidth demands of patching large numbers of computers be reduced?q: What is the reason for Adobe Systems' update schedule for Flash Player since November 2012 coinciding with Patch Tuesday?q: What is the policy of Microsoft for distributing security patches to home PCs, tablets, and phones?",

    "instruction": "Read this text below and answer the questions Identity-based cryptography\n\n==Introduction==\nIdentity-based cryptography is a type of public-key cryptography in which a publicly known string representing an individual or organization is used as a public key. The public string could include an email address, domain name, or a physical IP address.\nThe first implementation of identity-based signatures and an email-address based public-key infrastructure (PKI) was developed by Adi Shamir in 1984, which allowed users to verify digital signatures using only public information such as the user's identifier. Under Shamir's scheme, a trusted third party would deliver the private key to the user after verification of the user's identity, with verification essentially the same as that required for issuing a certificate in a typical PKI.\nShamir similarly proposed identity-based encryption, which appeared particularly attractive since there was no need to acquire an identity's public key prior to encryption. However, he was unable to come up with a concrete solution, and identity-based encryption remained an open problem for many years. The first practical implementations were finally devised by Sakai in 2000, and Boneh and Franklin in 2001. These solutions were based on bilinear pairings. Also in 2001, a solution was developed independently by Clifford Cocks.Closely related to various identity-based encryption schemes are identity based key agreement schemes.  One of the first identity based key agreement algorithms was published in 1986, just two years after Shamir's identity based signature.  The author was E. Okamoto. Identity based key agreement schemes also allow for \"escrow free\" identity based cryptography.  A notable example of such an escrow free identity based key agreement is the McCullagh-Barreto's \"Authenticated Key Agreement without Escrow\" found in section 4 of their 2004 paper, \"A New Two-Party Identity-Based Authenticated Key Agreement\".   A variant of this escrow free key exchange is standardized as the identity based key agreement in the Chinese identity based standard SM9.\n\n\n\n== Usage ==\nIdentity-based systems allow any party to generate a public key from a known identity value, such as an ASCII string.  A trusted third party, called the private key generator (PKG), generates the corresponding private keys.  To operate, the PKG first publishes a master public key, and retains the corresponding master private key (referred to as master key).  Given the master public key, any party can compute a public key corresponding to the identity ID by combining the master public key with the identity value.  To obtain a corresponding private key, the party authorized to use the identity ID contacts the PKG, which uses the master private key to generate the private key for the identity ID.\n\n== Limitation ==\nIdentity-based systems have a characteristic problem in operation. Suppose Alice and Bob are users of such a system. Since the information needed to find Alice's public key is completely determined by Alice's ID and the master public key, it is not possible to revoke Alice's credentials and issue new credentials without either (a) changing Alice's ID (usually a phone number or an email address which will appear in a corporate directory); or (b) changing the master public key and re-issuing private keys to all users, including Bob.This limitation may be overcome by including a time component (e.g. the current month) in the identity.\nWhat type of cryptography is identity-based cryptography and what is its unique feature?Q: Who developed the first implementation of identity-based signatures and an email-address based public-key infrastructure (PKI)?Q: What was the limitation of Shamir's identity-based encryption proposal?Q: Who developed the first practical implementations of identity-based encryption?Q: What is the difference between identity-based encryption and identity-based key agreement schemes?Q: When was the first identity-based key agreement algorithm published?Q: What is the advantage of escrow free identity-based cryptography?Q: What is the role of the private key generator (PKG) in identity-based systems?Q: What information is needed to find Alice's public key in an identity-based system?Q: What is the limitation of revoking Alice's credentials in an identity-based system?Q: How can the limitation of revoking Alice's credentials be overcome in an identity-based system?Q: What is the role of the master public key and master private key in an identity-based system?Q: How is a public key computed in an identity-based system?Q: How is a private key obtained in an identity-based system?Q: What is the disadvantage of including a time component in the identity in an identity-based system?",

      "context": "Identity-based cryptography\n\n==Introduction==\nIdentity-based cryptography is a type of public-key cryptography in which a publicly known string representing an individual or organization is used as a public key. The public string could include an email address, domain name, or a physical IP address.\nThe first implementation of identity-based signatures and an email-address based public-key infrastructure (PKI) was developed by Adi Shamir in 1984, which allowed users to verify digital signatures using only public information such as the user's identifier. Under Shamir's scheme, a trusted third party would deliver the private key to the user after verification of the user's identity, with verification essentially the same as that required for issuing a certificate in a typical PKI.\nShamir similarly proposed identity-based encryption, which appeared particularly attractive since there was no need to acquire an identity's public key prior to encryption. However, he was unable to come up with a concrete solution, and identity-based encryption remained an open problem for many years. The first practical implementations were finally devised by Sakai in 2000, and Boneh and Franklin in 2001. These solutions were based on bilinear pairings. Also in 2001, a solution was developed independently by Clifford Cocks.Closely related to various identity-based encryption schemes are identity based key agreement schemes.  One of the first identity based key agreement algorithms was published in 1986, just two years after Shamir's identity based signature.  The author was E. Okamoto. Identity based key agreement schemes also allow for \"escrow free\" identity based cryptography.  A notable example of such an escrow free identity based key agreement is the McCullagh-Barreto's \"Authenticated Key Agreement without Escrow\" found in section 4 of their 2004 paper, \"A New Two-Party Identity-Based Authenticated Key Agreement\".   A variant of this escrow free key exchange is standardized as the identity based key agreement in the Chinese identity based standard SM9.\n\n\n\n== Usage ==\nIdentity-based systems allow any party to generate a public key from a known identity value, such as an ASCII string.  A trusted third party, called the private key generator (PKG), generates the corresponding private keys.  To operate, the PKG first publishes a master public key, and retains the corresponding master private key (referred to as master key).  Given the master public key, any party can compute a public key corresponding to the identity ID by combining the master public key with the identity value.  To obtain a corresponding private key, the party authorized to use the identity ID contacts the PKG, which uses the master private key to generate the private key for the identity ID.\n\n== Limitation ==\nIdentity-based systems have a characteristic problem in operation. Suppose Alice and Bob are users of such a system. Since the information needed to find Alice's public key is completely determined by Alice's ID and the master public key, it is not possible to revoke Alice's credentials and issue new credentials without either (a) changing Alice's ID (usually a phone number or an email address which will appear in a corporate directory); or (b) changing the master public key and re-issuing private keys to all users, including Bob.This limitation may be overcome by including a time component (e.g. the current month) in the identity.",

The Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team, part of the Department of Homeland Security, issued ICS-ALERT-15-041-01, warning control systems owners that they should expedite applying critical JASBUG fixes.\nMicrosoft released two patches, MS15-011 and MS15-014, to address JASBUG on the same day the vulnerability was disclosed. These fixes took Microsoft over a year to develop and deploy due to the complexity of the JASBUG vulnerability.\nAt the time of disclosure, more than 300 million computers were believed to be vulnerable to the exploit.\n\n== Effect ==\nJASBUG principally affects business and government users. Home users are less likely to be affected by JASBUG because they do not use domain-configured computers.White House cybersecurity advisor Michael Daniel spoke about the importance of addressing JASBUG in a meeting of the Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board of the National Institute for Standards and Technology, and the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Homeland Security immediately took steps to fix the vulnerability on federal networks.Suzanne E.

This method of dumpster diving is also sometimes used by attorneys or their agents when seeking to enforce court-ordered money judgments: the judgment debtor's trash may contain information about assets that can then be more-readily located for levying.Supposedly, information diving was more common in the 1980s due to lax security; when businesses became aware of the need for increased security in the early 1990s, sensitive documents were shredded before being placed in dumpsters. There is still considerable Internet activity on the subject of dumpster diving, so it is unlikely to have stopped with the widespread introduction of document shredding. Security mythology has it that curious hackers or malicious crackers commonly use this technique.\n\n\n\n== Cases ==\n\n\n*** Printed manuals ***\nIn earlier times, the available discarded data included printed manuals and design records. In a famous case, a student, Jerry Schneider, discovered some discarded manuals for a telephone system ordering/shipping system and was able to build a business selling 'surplus' gear ordered from the telephone company as though it was for an internal company department.\n\n\n*** Discarded computers ***\nTwo MIT students purchased a large number of obsolete computers at yard sales, and they were able to obtain information such as credit card information and tax return data. They published a paper, Remembrance of Things Past, documenting their discoveries.\n\n\n*** Dumpster diving ***\nDumpster diving is commonly practiced by \"watchdog\" organizations seeking information on groups they are investigating.  The Trinity Foundation successfully used this technique to report on the activities of televangelist Robert Tilton and was also able to obtain information on Benny Hinn.",

      "answers": "Discarded manuals, especially those containing technical information, can be used to gain unauthorized access to systems or services. For example, a student named Jerry Schneider was able to build a business by ordering 'surplus' gear from a telephone company using discarded manuals.answer: Not properly erasing data from hard drives can lead to sensitive information being recovered and misused. This can include credit card information, tax return data, and other confidential data.answer: Dumpster diving can be used to recover sensitive information that can be used for fraudulent purposes, such as identity theft. This can include files, letters, memos, photographs, IDs, passwords, credit cards, and more.answer: Attorneys can use dumpster diving to obtain information about a judgment debtor's assets that can then be more readily located for levying.answer: Information diving became less common in the 1990s as businesses became aware of the need for increased security and started shredding sensitive documents before discarding them.answer: Discarded computers can contain recoverable data, such as installed software, credit card information, and tax return data.answer: Watchdog organizations can use dumpster diving to obtain information on groups they are investigating. For example, the Trinity Foundation successfully used this technique to report on the activities of televangelist Robert Tilton and Benny Hinn.answer: Not shredding sensitive documents before discarding them can lead to the information being recovered and misused for fraudulent purposes.answer: Information diving is a method of physical information security, as it involves recovering sensitive information from discarded material.answer: Companies can ensure customer data is not at risk from information diving by properly erasing data from hard drives before discarding computers and shredding sensitive documents before discarding them.answer: Security mythology suggests that curious hackers or malicious crackers commonly use dumpster diving as a technique, which can increase the perception of risk associated with this activity.answer: Internet activity on the subject of dumpster diving suggests that it is unlikely to have stopped with the widespread introduction of document shredding, and may even encourage its practice.answer: Printed manuals can contain sensitive information, such as technical data and design records, that can be used for malicious purposes if discarded without proper security measures.answer: Data breaches by various entities, such as education, health care, insurance, and government, suggest that companies may not be as careful with customer data as they claim, making it more likely for sensitive information to be available through information diving.answer: Dumpster diving can be used to obtain information on the activities of controversial figures, such as televangelists, that may not be available through other means."

    "output": "A time-stamping service provides evidence through time-stamp tokens, which are data structures that contain a verifiable cryptographic binding between a data item's representation and a time-value. These tokens can be independently verified to confirm the existence of the data item before the specified time.answer: ISO/IEC 18014 is an international standard that specifies time-stamping techniques and comprises four parts: Part 1 - Framework, Part 2 - Mechanisms producing independent tokens, Part 3 - Mechanisms producing linked tokens, and Part 4 - Traceability of time sources. Part 1 explains the objectives, general model, definitions, and protocols for time-stamping services. Part 2 defines mechanisms that produce independent tokens, which can be verified individually. Part 3 describes services that produce linked tokens, their components, data structures, and specific instances. Part 4 focuses on the traceability of time sources.answer: Part 1 of ISO/IEC 18014 defines time-stamping services as providing evidence of a data item's existence before a certain point in time through time-stamp tokens. It also specifies the basic protocols of time-stamping and the protocols between the involved entities, ensuring security, audit, and non-repudiation.answer: Time-stamping mechanisms that produce independent tokens create individual tokens that can be verified one by one without relying on other tokens. Mechanisms that produce linked tokens, on the other hand, generate tokens that are dependent on a chain of tokens, allowing for the verification of a sequence of events in a tamper-evident manner.answer: Part 3 of ISO/IEC 18014 describes time-stamping services that produce linked tokens by outlining a general model, defining the basic components, specifying data structures, and detailing specific instances of such services.answer: The traceability of time sources is essential in time-stamping services to ensure the accuracy and reliability of time values associated with data items. It enables the verification of the time sources used, ensuring the credibility of the time-stamping process.answer: A time authority in ISO/IEC 18014 is responsible for managing time-stamping services. Its identified objectives include ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and security of time-stamping operations, as well as providing non-repudiation and audit capabilities for time-stamping activities.answer: Part 2 of ISO/IEC 18014 focuses on mechanisms that produce independent tokens, which strengthen the security of time-stamping services by ensuring that each token can be verified independently. This reduces the potential for security vulnerabilities and enables a more robust and secure time-stamping process.answer: Part 3 of ISO/IEC 18014 defines data structures for time-stamping services producing linked tokens by specifying the format, content, and cryptographic techniques used in the creation and verification of linked tokens. This ensures interoperability and consistency across different time-stamping services.answer: The purpose of specifying the protocols between entities involved in time-stamping services in ISO/IEC 18014 Part 1 is to ensure secure, consistent, and auditable communication between the entities participating in the time-stamping process.answer: Time-stamping services producing linked tokens can benefit a system's security and audit capabilities by providing a tamper-evident and verifiable chain of events. This enables the detection of unauthorized modifications, ensures the integrity of time-related data, and strengthens non-repudiation and audit capabilities.answer: The framework outlined in ISO/IEC 18014 Part 1 supports the development of secure time-stamping services by identifying the objectives of a time authority, describing a general model, defining time-stamping services, outlining basic protocols, and specifying protocols between entities. This comprehensive approach ensures a solid foundation for time-stamping services, enhancing security, reliability, and auditability.answer: Time-stamping services producing independent tokens would be more suitable in scenarios where individual data items require independent verification, such as in cases where data items are not related or do not require a sequence of events to be verified. Independent tokens offer the advantage of being verified separately, reducing the potential complexity and resource requirements associated with linked tokens.answer: The traceability of time sources contributes to the non-repudiation property of time-stamping services by ensuring that the time values associated with data items can be verified and proven to be accurate. This prevents disputes regarding the time of data item creation or modification, reinforcing the credibility and trustworthiness of the time-stamping process.answer: The definition of time-stamping mechanisms in ISO/IEC 18014 Part 2 supports standardization and interoperability by specifying the methods and techniques used to produce time-stamp tokens. This ensures that time-stamping services adhering to the standard can communicate and interact effectively, promoting consistency and compatibility across different implementations.",

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nCredential service provider\n\n==Introduction==\nA credential service provider (CSP) is a trusted entity that issues security tokens or electronic credentials to subscribers. A CSP forms part of an authentication system, most typically identified as a separate entity in a Federated authentication system. A CSP may be an independent third party, or may issue credentials for its own use. The term CSP is used frequently in the context of the US government's eGov and e-authentication initiatives. An example of a CSP would be an online site whose primary purpose may be, for example, internet banking - but whose users may be subsequently authenticated to other sites, applications or services without further action on their part.\n\n== CSP Process ==\nThe CSP establishes a mechanism to uniquely identify each subscriber and the associated tokens and credentials issued to that subscriber. The CSP registers or gives the subscriber a token to be used in an authentication protocol and issues credentials as needed to bind that token to the identity, or to bind the identity to some other useful verified attribute. The subscriber may be given electronic credentials to go with the token at the time of registration, or credentials may be generated later as needed. Subscribers have a duty to maintain control of their tokens and comply with the responsibilities to the CSP. The CSP maintains registration records for each subscriber to allow recovery of registration records.In an e-authentication model, a claimant in an authentication protocol is a subscriber to some CSP. At some point, an applicant registers with a Registration Authority (RA), which verifies the identity of the applicant, typically through the presentation of paper credentials and by records in databases. This process is called identity proofing. The RA, in turn, vouches for the identity of the applicant (and possibly other verified attributes) to a CSP. The applicant then becomes a subscriber of the CSP. The CSP establishes a mechanism to uniquely identify each subscriber and the associated tokens and credentials issued to that subscriber. There is always a relationship between the RA and CSP.\n\n== Importance ==\nCSPs can establishes confidence of a user identity through an electronic authentication process. As a result, some regulatory agencies can ask individuals to proof their identities through a CSP. Today, regulatory agencies require physicians to be authenticated electronically before physicians can issue any prescription for controlled dangerous substances (CDS). Physicians have to seek for federally approved CSPs in order to receive a two-factor authentication credential or digital certificates. The CPSs conduct identity proofing that meets National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-63-1 Assurance Level 3.\n\n== CSP and the US Government ==\nThe federal government is currently the CSP for e-government transactions. However, the government plans to focus all their attention in the applications and leave the credential management business to other industries.In 2004, the US government proposed an E-authentication initiative. The goals of the initiative include:\n\nBuild and enable mutual trust needed to support widespread use of electronic interactions between the public and the US Government.\nMinimize the burden on the public when obtaining trusted electronic services from the government.\nDeliver common interoperable authentication solutions, appropriately matching the levels of risk and business risks.As a result of this initiative, campuses may start offering to student, faculty and staff access to certain federal applications. However, before this happens, the government will impose the following requirements:\n\n== FedFed Membership requirements for levels 1 & 2 ==\nCredential Assessment\nSigning Business and Operating Rules\nTechnical Interoperability at SAML 1.0\n\n== FedFed Membership requirements for levels 3 & 4 ==\nCross-certification with Federal PKI\n\n== Service Provider Requirements to Join Federal Federation Directly ==\nThose services provides wishing to join the Federal Federation Directly will have to agree with:\n\neAuthentication Business and Operating rules in\nRisk Analysis\nService levels\nSecurity levels\u2033\nCompliance with FIPS and NIST SPs\nReporting requirements\nProcedural, audit and documentation requirements.\n\n== Providers ==\nBelow is a short list of some CSPs with a short description of the services they provide.\n\n\n*** Equifax ***\nEquifax provides credentialing solutions certified that meet Federal security and privacy requirements.

    "instruction": "Forking lemma\n\n==Introduction==\nThe forking lemma is any of a number of related lemmas in cryptography research.  The lemma states that if an adversary (typically a probabilistic Turing machine), on inputs drawn from some distribution, produces an output that has some property with non-negligible probability, then with non-negligible probability, if the adversary is re-run on new inputs but with the same random tape, its second output will also have the property.\nThis concept was first used by David Pointcheval and Jacques Stern in \"Security proofs for signature schemes,\" published in the proceedings of Eurocrypt 1996.  In their paper, the forking lemma is specified in terms of an adversary that attacks a digital signature scheme instantiated in the random oracle model.  They show that if an adversary can forge a signature with non-negligible probability, then there is a non-negligible probability that the same adversary with the same random tape can create a second forgery in an attack with a different random oracle.  The forking lemma was later generalized by Mihir Bellare and Gregory Neven. The forking lemma has been used and further generalized to prove the security of a variety of digital signature schemes and other random-oracle based cryptographic constructions.\n\n== Statement of the lemma ==\nThe generalized version of the lemma is stated as follows.  Let A be a probabilistic algorithm, with inputs (x, h1, ..., hq; r) that outputs a pair (J, y), where r refers to the random tape of A (that is, the random choices A will make).  Suppose further that IG is a probability distribution from which x is drawn, and that H is a set of size h from which each of the hi values are drawn according to the uniform distribution.  Let acc be the probability that on inputs distributed as described, the J output by A is greater than or equal to 1.\nWe can then define a \"forking algorithm\" FA that proceeds as follows, on input x:\n\nPick a random tape r for A.\nPick h1, ..., hq uniformly from H.\nRun A on input (x, h1, ..., hq; r) to produce (J, y).\nIf J\n\n== Known issues with application of forking lemma ==\nThe reduction provided by the forking lemma is not tight.

      "context": "Forking lemma\n\n==Introduction==\nThe forking lemma is any of a number of related lemmas in cryptography research.  The lemma states that if an adversary (typically a probabilistic Turing machine), on inputs drawn from some distribution, produces an output that has some property with non-negligible probability, then with non-negligible probability, if the adversary is re-run on new inputs but with the same random tape, its second output will also have the property.\nThis concept was first used by David Pointcheval and Jacques Stern in \"Security proofs for signature schemes,\" published in the proceedings of Eurocrypt 1996.  In their paper, the forking lemma is specified in terms of an adversary that attacks a digital signature scheme instantiated in the random oracle model.  They show that if an adversary can forge a signature with non-negligible probability, then there is a non-negligible probability that the same adversary with the same random tape can create a second forgery in an attack with a different random oracle.  The forking lemma was later generalized by Mihir Bellare and Gregory Neven. The forking lemma has been used and further generalized to prove the security of a variety of digital signature schemes and other random-oracle based cryptographic constructions.\n\n== Statement of the lemma ==\nThe generalized version of the lemma is stated as follows.  Let A be a probabilistic algorithm, with inputs (x, h1, ..., hq; r) that outputs a pair (J, y), where r refers to the random tape of A (that is, the random choices A will make).  Suppose further that IG is a probability distribution from which x is drawn, and that H is a set of size h from which each of the hi values are drawn according to the uniform distribution.  Let acc be the probability that on inputs distributed as described, the J output by A is greater than or equal to 1.\nWe can then define a \"forking algorithm\" FA that proceeds as follows, on input x:\n\nPick a random tape r for A.\nPick h1, ..., hq uniformly from H.\nRun A on input (x, h1, ..., hq; r) to produce (J, y).\nIf J\n\n== Known issues with application of forking lemma ==\nThe reduction provided by the forking lemma is not tight.

    "instruction": "Secure copy protocol\n\n==Introduction==\nSecure copy protocol (SCP) is a means of securely transferring computer files between a local host and a remote host or between two remote hosts. It is based on the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. \"SCP\" commonly refers to both the Secure Copy Protocol and the program itself.According to OpenSSH developers in April 2019, SCP is outdated, inflexible and not readily fixed; they recommend the use of more modern protocols like SFTP and rsync for file transfer. As of  OpenSSH version 9.0, scp client therefore uses SFTP for file transfers by default instead of the legacy SCP/RCP protocol.\n\n== Secure Copy Protocol ==\nThe SCP is a network protocol, based on  the BSD RCP protocol,  which supports file transfers between hosts on a network.  SCP uses Secure Shell (SSH) for data transfer and uses the same mechanisms for authentication, thereby ensuring the authenticity and confidentiality of the data in transit.  A client can send (upload) files to a server, optionally including their basic attributes (permissions, timestamps). Clients can also request files or directories from a server (download).  SCP runs over TCP port 22 by default.  Like RCP, there is no RFC that defines the specifics of the protocol.\n\n\n*** Function ***\nNormally, a client initiates an SSH connection to the remote host, and requests an SCP process to be started on the remote server.  The remote SCP process can operate in one of two modes:\n\nsource mode, which reads files (usually from disk) and sends them back to the client, or\nsink mode, which accepts the files sent by the client and writes them (usually to disk) on the remote host.For most SCP clients, source mode is generally triggered with the -f flag (from), while sink mode is triggered with -t (to).  These flags are used internally and are not documented outside the SCP source code.\n\n\n*** Remote to remote mode ***\nIn the past, in remote-to-remote secure copy, the SCP client opens an SSH connection to the source host and requests that it, in turn, open an SCP connection to the destination.  (Remote-to-remote mode did not support opening two SCP connections and using the originating client as an intermediary).  It is important to note that SCP cannot be used to remotely copy from the source to the destination when operating in password or keyboard-interactive authentication mode, as this would reveal the destination server's authentication credentials to the source.  It is, however, possible with key-based or GSSAPI methods that do not require user input.Recently, remote-to-remote mode supports routing traffic through the client which originated the transfer, even though it is a 3rd party to the transfer. This way, authorization credentials must reside only on the originating client, the 3rd party.\n\n\n*** Issues using talkative shell profiles ***\nSCP does not expect text communicating with the SSH login shell.  Text transmitted due to the SSH profile (e.g. echo \"Welcome\" in the .bashrc file) is interpreted as an error message, and a null line (echo \"\") causes SCP client to deadlock waiting for the error message to complete.\n\n== scp program ==\nThe SCP program is a software tool implementing the SCP protocol as a service daemon or client.  It is a program to perform secure copying.\nPerhaps the most widely used SCP program is the OpenSSH command line scp program, which is provided in most SSH implementations. The scp program is the secure analog of the rcp command.  The scp program must be part of all SSH servers that want to provide SCP service, as scp functions as SCP server too. Since OpenSSH 9.0, the program has been updated to use the newer, more secure SFTP protocol; an -O option is added for using SCP with old SCP-only servers.\n\n\n*** Syntax ***\nTypically, a syntax of scp program is like the syntax of cp (copy):\nCopying local file to a remote host:\n\nscp LocalSourceFile user@remotehost:directory/TargetFile\n\nCopying file from remote host and copying folder from remote host (with -r switch):\n\nscp user@remotehost:directory/SourceFile LocalTargetFile\nscp -r user@host:directory/SourceFolder LocalTargetFolder\n\nNote that if the remote host uses a port other than the default of 22, it can be specified in the command. For example, copying a file from host:\n\nscp -P 2222 user@host:directory/SourceFile TargetFile\n\n\n*** Other clients ***\nAs the Secure Copy Protocol implements file transfers only, GUI SCP clients are rare, as implementing it requires additional functionality (directory listing at least). For example, WinSCP defaults to the SFTP protocol. Even when operating in SCP mode, clients like WinSCP are typically not pure SCP clients, as they must use other means to implement the additional functionality (like the ls command). This in turn brings platform-dependency problems.\nMore comprehensive tools for managing files over SSH are SFTP clients.\n\n== Security ==\nIn 2019 vulnerability CVE-2019-6111 was announced related to the openssh SCP tool and protocol allowing users to overwrite arbitrary files in the SCP client target directory.\n\nWhat network protocol does SCP use for data transfer and what mechanism does it use for authentication?Q: How can a client request files or directories from a server using SCP?Q: What flag is used to trigger sink mode in most SCP clients?Q: How can remote-to-remote secure copy be done in the past using SCP?Q: Why cannot SCP be used to remotely copy from the source to the destination when operating in password or keyboard-interactive authentication mode?Q: How does SCP handle text communicating with the SSH login shell?Q: What is the program used for performing secure copying in the OpenSSH implementation?Q: What is the syntax for copying a local file to a remote host using the scp program?Q: What is the purpose of the -r switch in the scp program?Q: How can the port number be specified in the scp command if the remote host uses a port other than the default of 22?Q: Why are GUI SCP clients rare?Q: What is the difference between SCP and SFTP clients?Q: What is the vulnerability announced in 2019 related to the openssh SCP tool and protocol?Q: What changes were made to the OpenSSH scp program in version 9.0?Q: What are the risks associated with using the SCP protocol for file transfers?",

It is important to note that SCP cannot be used to remotely copy from the source to the destination when operating in password or keyboard-interactive authentication mode, as this would reveal the destination server's authentication credentials to the source.  It is, however, possible with key-based or GSSAPI methods that do not require user input.Recently, remote-to-remote mode supports routing traffic through the client which originated the transfer, even though it is a 3rd party to the transfer. This way, authorization credentials must reside only on the originating client, the 3rd party.\n\n\n*** Issues using talkative shell profiles ***\nSCP does not expect text communicating with the SSH login shell.  Text transmitted due to the SSH profile (e.g. echo \"Welcome\" in the .bashrc file) is interpreted as an error message, and a null line (echo \"\") causes SCP client to deadlock waiting for the error message to complete.\n\n== scp program ==\nThe SCP program is a software tool implementing the SCP protocol as a service daemon or client.  It is a program to perform secure copying.\nPerhaps the most widely used SCP program is the OpenSSH command line scp program, which is provided in most SSH implementations. The scp program is the secure analog of the rcp command.  The scp program must be part of all SSH servers that want to provide SCP service, as scp functions as SCP server too. Since OpenSSH 9.0, the program has been updated to use the newer, more secure SFTP protocol; an -O option is added for using SCP with old SCP-only servers.\n\n\n*** Syntax ***\nTypically, a syntax of scp program is like the syntax of cp (copy):\nCopying local file to a remote host:\n\nscp LocalSourceFile user@remotehost:directory/TargetFile\n\nCopying file from remote host and copying folder from remote host (with -r switch):\n\nscp user@remotehost:directory/SourceFile LocalTargetFile\nscp -r user@host:directory/SourceFolder LocalTargetFolder\n\nNote that if the remote host uses a port other than the default of 22, it can be specified in the command. For example, copying a file from host:\n\nscp -P 2222 user@host:directory/SourceFile TargetFile\n\n\n*** Other clients ***\nAs the Secure Copy Protocol implements file transfers only, GUI SCP clients are rare, as implementing it requires additional functionality (directory listing at least). For example, WinSCP defaults to the SFTP protocol. Even when operating in SCP mode, clients like WinSCP are typically not pure SCP clients, as they must use other means to implement the additional functionality (like the ls command). This in turn brings platform-dependency problems.\nMore comprehensive tools for managing files over SSH are SFTP clients.\n\n== Security ==\nIn 2019 vulnerability CVE-2019-6111 was announced related to the openssh SCP tool and protocol allowing users to overwrite arbitrary files in the SCP client target directory.",

      "answers": "SCP uses the Secure Shell (SSH) for data transfer and uses the same mechanisms for authentication, thereby ensuring the authenticity and confidentiality of the data in transit.A: A client can request files or directories from a server by initiating an SSH connection to the remote host and requesting an SCP process to be started on the remote server. The remote SCP process can then operate in sink mode, which accepts the files sent by the client and writes them (usually to disk) on the remote host.A: Sink mode is triggered with the -t flag in most SCP clients.A: In the past, in remote-to-remote secure copy, the SCP client opens an SSH connection to the source host and requests that it, in turn, open an SCP connection to the destination.A: SCP cannot be used to remotely copy from the source to the destination when operating in password or keyboard-interactive authentication mode because it would reveal the destination server's authentication credentials to the source.A: SCP does not expect text communicating with the SSH login shell and interprets it as an error message, which can cause issues when there is text transmitted due to the SSH profile.A: The scp program is the program used for performing secure copying in the OpenSSH implementation.A: The syntax for copying a local file to a remote host using the scp program is: \"scp LocalSourceFile user@remotehost:directory/TargetFile\"A: The -r switch in the scp program is used for copying a folder from a remote host.A: The port number can be specified in the scp command by using the \"-P\" option, followed by the port number.

    "instruction": "Weird machine\n\n==Introduction==\nIn computer security, a weird machine is a computational artifact where additional code execution can happen outside the original specification of the program. It is closely related to the concept of weird instructions, which are the building blocks of an exploit based on crafted input data.The concept of weird machine is a theoretical framework to understand the existence of exploits for security vulnerabilities. Exploits exist empirically, but were not studied from a theoretical perspective prior to the emergence of the framework of weird machines.\n\n\n\n== Theory ==\nFrom a theoretical perspective, the emergence of weird machines becomes clear when one considers software as a way to restrict the number of reachable states and state transitions of a computer: The general-purpose CPU is, through software, specialized to simulate a finite-state machine (with potentially very large state space). Many states the CPU could be in are excluded, and certain state transitions are ruled out - for example those that violate the software's security requirements.

    "instruction": "Cryptographic Service Provider\n\n==Introduction==\nIn Microsoft Windows, a Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP) is a software library that implements the Microsoft CryptoAPI (CAPI).  CSPs implement encoding and decoding functions, which computer application programs may use, for example, to implement strong user authentication or for secure email.  \nCSPs are independent modules that can be used by different applications. A user program calls CryptoAPI functions and these are redirected to CSPs functions. Since CSPs are responsible for implementing cryptographic algorithms and standards, applications do not need to be concerned about security details. Furthermore, one application can define which CSP it is going to use on its calls to CryptoAPI. In fact, all cryptographic activity is implemented in CSPs. CryptoAPI only works as a bridge between the application and the CSP.\nCSPs are implemented basically as a special type of DLL with special restrictions on loading and use.  Every CSP must be digitally signed by Microsoft and the signature is verified when Windows loads the CSP.  In addition, after being loaded, Windows periodically re-scans the CSP to detect tampering, either by malicious software such as computer viruses or by the user him/herself trying to circumvent restrictions (for example on cryptographic key length) that might be built into the CSP's code.\nTo obtain a signature, non-Microsoft CSP developers must supply paperwork to Microsoft promising to obey various legal restrictions and giving valid contact information.  As of circa 2000,  Microsoft did not charge any fees to supply these signatures.  For development and testing purposes, a CSP developer can configure Windows to recognize the developer's own signatures instead of Microsoft's, but this is a somewhat complex and obscure operation unsuitable for nontechnical end users.\nThe CAPI/CSP architecture had its origins in the era of restrictive US government controls on the export of cryptography.  Microsoft's default or \"base\" CSP then included with Windows was limited to 512-bit RSA public-key cryptography and 40-bit symmetric cryptography, the maximum key lengths permitted in exportable mass market software at the time.  CSPs implementing stronger cryptography were available only to U.S. residents, unless the CSPs themselves had received U.S. government export approval.  The system of requiring CSPs to be signed only on presentation of completed paperwork was intended to prevent the easy spread of unauthorized CSPs implemented by anonymous or foreign developers.  As such, it was presented as a concession made by Microsoft to the government, in order to get export approval for the CAPI itself.\nAfter the Bernstein v. United States court decision establishing computer source code as protected free speech and the transfer of cryptographic regulatory authority from the U.S. State Department to the more pro-export Commerce Department, the restrictions on key lengths were dropped, and the CSPs shipped with Windows now include full-strength cryptography.  The main use of third-party CSPs is to interface with external cryptography hardware such as hardware security modules (HSM) or smart cards.\n\n\n\n== Smart Card CSP ==\nThese cryptographic functions can be realised by a smart card, thus the Smart Card CSP is the Microsoft way of a PKCS#11. Microsoft Windows is identifying the correct Smart Card CSP, which have to be used, analysing the answer to reset (ATR) of the smart card, which is registered in the Windows Registry. Installing a new CSP, all ATRs of the supported smart cards are enlisted in the registry.\n\n== Use of CSP in MS Office password protection ==\n\nCryptographic service providers can be used for encryption of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents starting from Microsoft Office XP. A standard encryption algorithm with a 40-bit key is used by default, but enabling a CSP enhances key length and thus makes decryption process more continuous.

    "instruction": "Context: DROWN attack\n\n==Introduction==\nThe DROWN (Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption) attack is a cross-protocol security bug that attacks servers supporting modern SSLv3/TLS protocol suites by using their support for the obsolete, insecure, SSL v2 protocol to leverage an attack on connections using up-to-date protocols that would otherwise be secure. DROWN can affect all types of servers that offer services encrypted with SSLv3/TLS yet still support SSLv2, provided they share the same public key credentials between the two protocols.  Additionally, if the same public key certificate is used on a different server that supports SSLv2, the TLS server is also vulnerable due to the SSLv2 server leaking key information that can be used against the TLS server.Full details of DROWN were announced in March 2016, along with a patch that disables SSLv2 in OpenSSL; the vulnerability was assigned the ID CVE-2016-0800. The patch alone will not be sufficient to mitigate the attack if the certificate can be found on another SSLv2 host. The only viable countermeasure is to disable SSLv2 on all servers.\nThe researchers estimated that 33% of all HTTPS sites were affected by this vulnerability as of March 1, 2016.\n\n== Details ==\nDROWN is an acronym for \"Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption\".\nIt exploits a vulnerability in the combination of protocols used and the configuration of the server, rather than any specific implementation error. According to the discoverers, the exploit cannot be fixed by making changes to client software such as web browsers.The exploit includes a chosen-ciphertext attack with the use of a SSLv2 server as a Bleichenbacher oracle. SSLv2 worked by encrypting the master secret directly using RSA, and 40-bit export ciphersuites worked by encrypting only 40-bit of the master secret and revealing the other 88-bits as plaintext. The 48-byte SSLv3/TLS encrypted RSA ciphertext is \"trimmed\" to 40-bit parts and is then used in the SSLv2 ClientMasterKey message which the server treats as the 40-bit part of the SSLv2 master secret (the other 88 bits can be any value sent by the client as plaintext). By brute forcing the 40-bit encryption the ServerVerify message can be used as the oracle. The proof-of-concept attack demonstrated how both multi-GPU configurations and commercial cloud computing could perform part of the codebreaking calculations, at a cost of around $18,000 for the GPU setup and a per-attack cost of $400 for the cloud. A successful attack will provide the session key for a captured TLS handshake.\nThe investigators, who described the attack above as the general DROWN attack also found a specific weakness in the OpenSSL implementation of SSLv2 that allowed what they called a special DROWN attack. This vastly reduced the effort required to break the encryption, making real-time man-in-the-middle attacks possible that required only modest computing resources. The OpenSSL implementation of SSLv2 until 2015 did not check that the clear and encrypted key lengths are correct, allowing for example only 8-bit of the master secret to be encrypted. Until 2015, OpenSSL would also overwrite the wrong bytes in the SSLv2 master secret during its attempt at the Bleichenbacher countermeasure. Until 2016, OpenSSL would also happily negotiate disabled SSLv2 ciphersuites. Unlike SSLv3 and later, in SSLv2 the client was supposed to choose from a list of ciphersuites offered by the server but OpenSSL would allow use of unlisted ciphersuites.\nThe original reporters of the bug were the security researchers Nimrod Aviram and Sebastian Schinzel.\n\n== Mitigation ==\nTo protect against DROWN, server operators need to ensure that their private keys are not used anywhere with server software that allows SSLv2 connections. This includes web servers, SMTP servers, IMAP and POP servers, and any other software that supports SSL/TLS.The OpenSSL group has released a security advisory, and a set of patches intended to mitigate the vulnerability by removing support for obsolete protocols and ciphers.  However, if the server's certificate is used on other servers that support SSLv2, it is still vulnerable, and so are the patched servers.\nNumerous sources have recommended that the vulnerability be patched as soon as possible by site operators.\n\nQuestions:\nHow does the DROWN attack exploit the combination of protocols used and server configuration?q: What makes the DROWN attack possible on servers that offer services encrypted with SSLv3/TLS?q: How can the DROWN attack be mitigated, and what is the only viable countermeasure?q: What percentage of HTTPS sites were affected by the DROWN vulnerability as of March 1, 2016?q: How does the special DROWN attack differ from the general DROWN attack?q: What was the cost of performing the proof-of-concept attack for the DROWN vulnerability?q: What was the original implementation error in the OpenSSL implementation of SSLv2 that allowed the special DROWN attack?q: How did the OpenSSL implementation of SSLv2 handle disabled SSLv2 ciphersuites before 2016?q: What is the role of the SSLv2 protocol in the DROWN attack?q: How does the DROWN attack affect servers that support both SSLv3/TLS and SSLv2 protocols?q: What is the impact of a successful DROWN attack on a server?q: How can server operators protect their servers against the DROWN attack?q: What was the name of the security researchers who originally reported the DROWN bug?q: What is the CVE ID assigned to the DROWN vulnerability?q: What was the date when the DROWN vulnerability was announced to the public?\n\nAnswers:\n",

      "context": "DROWN attack\n\n==Introduction==\nThe DROWN (Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption) attack is a cross-protocol security bug that attacks servers supporting modern SSLv3/TLS protocol suites by using their support for the obsolete, insecure, SSL v2 protocol to leverage an attack on connections using up-to-date protocols that would otherwise be secure. DROWN can affect all types of servers that offer services encrypted with SSLv3/TLS yet still support SSLv2, provided they share the same public key credentials between the two protocols.  Additionally, if the same public key certificate is used on a different server that supports SSLv2, the TLS server is also vulnerable due to the SSLv2 server leaking key information that can be used against the TLS server.Full details of DROWN were announced in March 2016, along with a patch that disables SSLv2 in OpenSSL; the vulnerability was assigned the ID CVE-2016-0800. The patch alone will not be sufficient to mitigate the attack if the certificate can be found on another SSLv2 host. The only viable countermeasure is to disable SSLv2 on all servers.\nThe researchers estimated that 33% of all HTTPS sites were affected by this vulnerability as of March 1, 2016.\n\n== Details ==\nDROWN is an acronym for \"Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption\".\nIt exploits a vulnerability in the combination of protocols used and the configuration of the server, rather than any specific implementation error. According to the discoverers, the exploit cannot be fixed by making changes to client software such as web browsers.The exploit includes a chosen-ciphertext attack with the use of a SSLv2 server as a Bleichenbacher oracle. SSLv2 worked by encrypting the master secret directly using RSA, and 40-bit export ciphersuites worked by encrypting only 40-bit of the master secret and revealing the other 88-bits as plaintext. The 48-byte SSLv3/TLS encrypted RSA ciphertext is \"trimmed\" to 40-bit parts and is then used in the SSLv2 ClientMasterKey message which the server treats as the 40-bit part of the SSLv2 master secret (the other 88 bits can be any value sent by the client as plaintext). By brute forcing the 40-bit encryption the ServerVerify message can be used as the oracle. The proof-of-concept attack demonstrated how both multi-GPU configurations and commercial cloud computing could perform part of the codebreaking calculations, at a cost of around $18,000 for the GPU setup and a per-attack cost of $400 for the cloud. A successful attack will provide the session key for a captured TLS handshake.\nThe investigators, who described the attack above as the general DROWN attack also found a specific weakness in the OpenSSL implementation of SSLv2 that allowed what they called a special DROWN attack. This vastly reduced the effort required to break the encryption, making real-time man-in-the-middle attacks possible that required only modest computing resources. The OpenSSL implementation of SSLv2 until 2015 did not check that the clear and encrypted key lengths are correct, allowing for example only 8-bit of the master secret to be encrypted. Until 2015, OpenSSL would also overwrite the wrong bytes in the SSLv2 master secret during its attempt at the Bleichenbacher countermeasure. Until 2016, OpenSSL would also happily negotiate disabled SSLv2 ciphersuites. Unlike SSLv3 and later, in SSLv2 the client was supposed to choose from a list of ciphersuites offered by the server but OpenSSL would allow use of unlisted ciphersuites.\nThe original reporters of the bug were the security researchers Nimrod Aviram and Sebastian Schinzel.\n\n== Mitigation ==\nTo protect against DROWN, server operators need to ensure that their private keys are not used anywhere with server software that allows SSLv2 connections. This includes web servers, SMTP servers, IMAP and POP servers, and any other software that supports SSL/TLS.The OpenSSL group has released a security advisory, and a set of patches intended to mitigate the vulnerability by removing support for obsolete protocols and ciphers.  However, if the server's certificate is used on other servers that support SSLv2, it is still vulnerable, and so are the patched servers.\nNumerous sources have recommended that the vulnerability be patched as soon as possible by site operators.",

    "instruction": "Signcryption\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, signcryption is a public-key primitive that simultaneously performs the functions of both digital signature and encryption.\nEncryption and digital signature are two fundamental cryptographic tools that can guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation. Until 1997, they were viewed as important but distinct building blocks of various cryptographic systems. In public key schemes, a traditional method is to digitally sign a message then followed by an encryption (signature-then-encryption) that can have two problems: Low efficiency and high cost of such summation, and the case that any arbitrary scheme cannot guarantee security. Signcryption is a relatively new cryptographic technique that is supposed to perform the functions of digital signature and encryption in a single logical step and can effectively decrease the computational costs and communication overheads in comparison with the traditional signature-then-encryption schemes.\nSigncryption provides the properties of both digital signatures and encryption schemes in a way that is more efficient than signing and encrypting separately. This means that at least some aspect of its efficiency (for example the computation time) is better than any hybrid of digital signature and encryption schemes, under a particular model of security. Note that sometimes  hybrid encryption can be employed instead of simple encryption, and a single session-key reused for several encryptions to achieve better overall efficiency across many signature-encryptions than a signcryption scheme but the session-key reuse causes the system to lose security under even the relatively weak CPA model.

This ensures that the sender cannot deny his previously signcrypted texts.\nIntegrity: The recipient should be able to verify that the received message is the original one that was sent by the sender.\nPublic verifiability: Any third party without any need for the private key of sender or recipient can verify that the signcrypted text is the valid signcryption of its corresponding message.\nForward secrecy of message confidentiality: If the long-term private key of the sender is compromised, no one should be able to extract the plaintext of previously signcrypted texts. In a regular signcryption scheme, when the long-term private key is compromised, all the previously issued signatures will not be trustworthy any more.

      "context": "Signcryption\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, signcryption is a public-key primitive that simultaneously performs the functions of both digital signature and encryption.\nEncryption and digital signature are two fundamental cryptographic tools that can guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation. Until 1997, they were viewed as important but distinct building blocks of various cryptographic systems. In public key schemes, a traditional method is to digitally sign a message then followed by an encryption (signature-then-encryption) that can have two problems: Low efficiency and high cost of such summation, and the case that any arbitrary scheme cannot guarantee security. Signcryption is a relatively new cryptographic technique that is supposed to perform the functions of digital signature and encryption in a single logical step and can effectively decrease the computational costs and communication overheads in comparison with the traditional signature-then-encryption schemes.\nSigncryption provides the properties of both digital signatures and encryption schemes in a way that is more efficient than signing and encrypting separately.

It operates mainly in Central and Latin America and to date has hacked major corporations and the governments of Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru.\n\n\n\n== Motivation ==\nThe group says they're motivated by anti-imperialism and environmentalism, and that they fight against transnational corporations and external intervention in Latin America, singling out extractivism and the armed forces and the defense of natural resources and native communities.The group said they wanted to expose companies and governments, \"so that everyone knows their way of operating, their actions, their profits and the interest that is clearly to profit no matter the damage they cause.\" Guacamaya told Motherboard in an email. \"These hacks are another form of struggle and resistance, they are the continuation of an ancestral legacy; taking care of life. We hope to cause more people to join, to leak, sabotage, and hack these sources of oppression and injustice, so that the truth be known and that it is the people who decide to end it.\" They told Cyberscoop that they target \"anything that represents oppressive states, multinational corporations and, in short, anything that supports this system of death.\"\n\n== Hacks ==\n\n\n*** Attacks on transnational companies ***\nIn 2022, the group said they were responsible for a series of cyberattacks aimed at large mining companies in Latin America, including the Colombian oil company New Granada Energy Corporation, the Brazilian mining company Tejucana, the Venezuelan oil company Oryx Resources, the Ecuadorian state-owned mining company ENAMI EP, and the Chilean boric acid producer Quiborax.\n\n\n**** 2022 Guatemalan Nickel Company Hack ****\nIn March 2022, Guacamaya first became known by hacking the mining company Compa\u00f1\u00eda Guatemalteca de N\u00edquel (CGN), a subsidiary of Solway Investment Group.

It operates mainly in Central and Latin America and to date has hacked major corporations and the governments of Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru.\n\n\n\n== Motivation ==\nThe group says they're motivated by anti-imperialism and environmentalism, and that they fight against transnational corporations and external intervention in Latin America, singling out extractivism and the armed forces and the defense of natural resources and native communities.The group said they wanted to expose companies and governments, \"so that everyone knows their way of operating, their actions, their profits and the interest that is clearly to profit no matter the damage they cause.\" Guacamaya told Motherboard in an email. \"These hacks are another form of struggle and resistance, they are the continuation of an ancestral legacy; taking care of life. We hope to cause more people to join, to leak, sabotage, and hack these sources of oppression and injustice, so that the truth be known and that it is the people who decide to end it.\" They told Cyberscoop that they target \"anything that represents oppressive states, multinational corporations and, in short, anything that supports this system of death.\"\n\n== Hacks ==\n\n\n*** Attacks on transnational companies ***\nIn 2022, the group said they were responsible for a series of cyberattacks aimed at large mining companies in Latin America, including the Colombian oil company New Granada Energy Corporation, the Brazilian mining company Tejucana, the Venezuelan oil company Oryx Resources, the Ecuadorian state-owned mining company ENAMI EP, and the Chilean boric acid producer Quiborax.\n\n\n**** 2022 Guatemalan Nickel Company Hack ****\nIn March 2022, Guacamaya first became known by hacking the mining company Compa\u00f1\u00eda Guatemalteca de N\u00edquel (CGN), a subsidiary of Solway Investment Group.

    "instruction": "Read this text below and answer the questions File-system permissions\n\n==Introduction==\nMost file systems include attributes of files and directories that control the ability of users to read, change, navigate, and execute the contents of the file system. In some cases, menu options or functions may be made visible or hidden depending on a user's permission level; this kind of user interface is referred to as permission-driven.\nTwo types of permissions are widely available: POSIX file system permissions and access-control lists (ACLs) which are capable of more specific control.\n\n\n\n== File system variations ==\nThe original File Allocation Table file system has a per-file all-user read-only attribute. \nNTFS implemented in Microsoft Windows NT and its derivatives, use ACLs to provide a complex set of permissions. \nOpenVMS uses a permission scheme similar to that of Unix. There are four categories (system, owner, group, and world) and four types of access permissions (Read, Write, Execute and Delete). The categories are not mutually disjoint: World includes Group, which in turn includes Owner. The System category independently includes system users.HFS, and its successor HFS+, implemented in the Classic Mac OS operating systems, do not support permissions.\nmacOS uses POSIX-compliant permissions. Beginning with version 10.4 (\"Tiger\"), it also supports the use of NFSv4 ACLs in addition to POSIX-compliant permissions. The Apple Mac OS X Server version 10.4+ File Services Administration Manual recommends using only traditional Unix permissions if possible. macOS also still supports the Classic Mac OS's \"Protected\" attribute.\nSolaris ACL support depends on the filesystem being used; older UFS filesystem supports POSIX.1e ACLs, while ZFS supports only NFSv4 ACLs.Linux supports ext2, ext3, ext4, Btrfs and other file systems many of which include POSIX.1e ACLs. There is experimental support for NFSv4 ACLs for ext3 and ext4 filesystems.\nFreeBSD supports POSIX.1e ACLs on UFS, and NFSv4 ACLs on UFS and ZFS.IBM z/OS implements file security using RACF (Resource Access Control Facility)The AmigaOS Filesystem, AmigaDOS supports a permissions system relatively advanced for a single-user OS. In AmigaOS 1.x, files had Archive, Read, Write, Execute and Delete (collectively known as ARWED) permissions/flags. In AmigaOS 2.x and higher, additional Hold, Script, and Pure permissions/flags were added.\n\n== POSIX permissions ==\n\nPermissions on Unix-like file systems are defined in the POSIX.1-2017 standard, which uses three scopes or classes known as user, group, and others. When a file is created its permissions are restricted by the umask of the process that created it.\n\n\n*** Classes ***\nFiles and directories are owned by a user. The owner determines the file's user class. Distinct permissions apply to the owner.\nFiles and directories are assigned a group, which define the file's group class. Distinct permissions apply to members of the file's group. The owner may be a member of the file's group.\nUsers who are not the owner, nor a member of the group, comprise a file's others class. Distinct permissions apply to others.\nThe effective permissions are determined based on the first class the user falls within in the order of user, group then others. For example, the user who is the owner of the file will have the permissions given to the user class regardless of the permissions assigned to the group class or others class.\n\n\n*** Permissions ***\nUnix-like systems implement three specific permissions that apply to each class:\n\nThe read permission grants the ability to read a file. When set for a directory, this permission grants the ability to read the names of files in the directory, but not to find out any further information about them such as contents, file type, size, ownership, permissions.\nThe write permission grants the ability to modify a file. When set for a directory, this permission grants the ability to modify entries in the directory, which includes creating files, deleting files, and renaming files. This requires that execute is also set; without it, the write permission is meaningless for directories.\nThe execute permission grants the ability to execute a file. This permission must be set for executable programs, in order to allow the operating system to run them. When set for a directory, the execute permission is interpreted as the search permission: it grants the ability to access file contents and meta-information if its name is known, but not list files inside the directory, unless read is set also.The effect of setting the permissions on a directory, rather than a file, is \"one of the most frequently misunderstood file permission issues\".When a permission is not set, the corresponding rights are denied. Unlike ACL-based systems, permissions on Unix-like systems are not inherited. Files created within a directory do not necessarily have the same permissions as that directory.\n\n\n*** Changing permission behavior with setuid, setgid, and sticky bits ***\nUnix-like systems typically employ three additional modes. These are actually attributes but are referred to as permissions or modes.  These special modes are for a file or directory overall, not by a class, though in the symbolic notation (see below) the setuid bit is set in the triad for the user, the setgid bit is set in the triad for the group and the sticky bit is set in the triad for others.\n\nThe set user ID, setuid, or SUID mode. When a file with setuid is executed, the resulting process will assume the effective user ID given to the owner class. This enables users to be treated temporarily as root (or another user).\nThe set group ID, setgid, or SGID permission. When a file with setgid is executed, the resulting process will assume the group ID given to the group class. When setgid is applied to a directory, new files and directories created under that directory will inherit their group from that directory. (Default behaviour is to use the primary group of the effective user when setting the group of new files and directories, except on BSD-derived systems which behave as though the setgid bit is always set on all directories (see Setuid).)\nThe sticky mode (also known as the Text mode). The classical behaviour of the sticky bit on executable files has been to encourage the kernel to retain the resulting process image in memory beyond termination; however, such use of the sticky bit is now restricted to only a minority of unix-like operating systems (HP-UX and UnixWare). On a directory, the sticky permission prevents users from renaming, moving or deleting contained files owned by users other than themselves, even if they have write permission to the directory. Only the directory owner and superuser are exempt from this.These additional modes are also referred to as setuid bit, setgid bit, and sticky bit, due to the fact that they each occupy only one bit.\n\n== Notation of traditional Unix permissions ==\n\n\n*** Symbolic notation ***\nUnix permissions are represented either in symbolic notation or in octal notation.\nThe most common form, as used by the command ls -l, is symbolic notation.\n\nThe first character of the ls display indicates the file type and is not related to permissions. The remaining nine characters are in three sets, each representing a class of permissions as three characters. The first set represents the user class. The second set represents the group class. The third  set represents the others class.\nEach of the three characters represent the read, write, and execute permissions:\n\nr if reading is permitted, - if it is not.\nw if writing is permitted, - if it is not.\nx if execution is permitted, - if it is not.The following are some examples of symbolic notation:\n\n-rwxr-xr-x: a regular file whose user class has full permissions and whose group and others classes have only the read and execute permissions.\ncrw-rw-r--: a character special file whose user and group classes have the read and write permissions and whose others class has only the read permission.\ndr-x------: a directory whose user class has read and execute permissions and whose group and others classes have no permissions.In some permission systems additional symbols in the ls -l display represent additional permission features:\n\n+ (plus) suffix indicates an access control list that can control additional permissions.\n. (dot) suffix indicates an SELinux context is present.  Details may be listed with the command ls -Z.\n@ suffix indicates extended file attributes are present.To represent the  setuid, setgid and sticky or text attributes, the executable character (x or -) is modified. Though these attributes affect the overall file, not only users in one class, the setuid attribute modifies the executable character in the triad for the user, the setgid attribute modifies the executable character in the triad for the group and the sticky or text attribute modifies the executable character in the triad for others. For the setuid or setgid attributes, in the first or second triad, the x becomes s and the - becomes S.  For the sticky or text attribute, in the third triad, the x becomes t and the - becomes T. Here is an example:\n\n-rwsr-Sr-t: a file whose user class has read, write and execute permissions; whose group class has read permission; whose others class has read and execute permissions; and which has setuid, setgid and sticky attributes set.\n\n\n*** Numeric notation ***\nAnother method for representing Unix permissions is an octal (base-8) notation as shown by stat -c %a. This notation consists of at least three digits. Each of the three rightmost digits represents a different component of the permissions: owner, group, and others.  (If a fourth digit is present, the leftmost (high-order) digit addresses three additional attributes, the setuid bit, the setgid bit and the sticky bit.)\nEach of these digits is the sum of its component bits in the binary numeral system. As a result, specific bits add to the sum as it is represented by a numeral:\n\nThe read bit adds 4 to its total (in binary 100),\nThe write bit adds 2 to its total (in binary 010), and\nThe execute bit adds 1 to its total (in binary 001).These values never produce ambiguous combinations; each sum represents a specific set of permissions. More technically, this is an octal representation of a bit field \u2013 each bit references a separate permission, and grouping 3 bits at a time in octal corresponds to grouping these permissions by user, group, and others.\nThese are the examples from the symbolic notation section given in octal notation:\n\n== User private group ==\nSome systems diverge from the traditional POSIX model of users and groups by creating a new group \u2013 a \"user private group\" \u2013 for each user. Assuming that each user is the only member of its user private group, this scheme allows an umask of 002 to be used without allowing other users to write to newly created files in normal directories because such files are assigned to the creating user's private group. However, when sharing files is desirable, the administrator can create a group containing the desired users, create a group-writable directory assigned to the new group, and, most importantly, make the directory setgid. Making it setgid will cause files created in it to be assigned to the same group as the directory and the 002 umask (enabled by using user private groups) will ensure that other members of the group will be able to write to those files.\nHow does the original File Allocation Table file system manage file permissions?q: What types of permissions does NTFS implemented in Microsoft Windows NT and its derivatives use?q: Does HFS, and its successor HFS+, implemented in the Classic Mac OS operating systems support permissions?q: Which permission types does macOS use?q: What is the recommended way to use permissions in macOS Server version 10.4+?q: What is the AmigaOS Filesystem, AmigaDOS permissions system like?q: What are the three classes of permissions on Unix-like file systems defined in the POSIX.1-2017 standard?q: How do Unix-like systems determine the effective permissions for a user?q: What are the three specific permissions implemented by Unix-like systems?q: What does the setuid mode do on Unix-like systems?q: What does the sticky mode do on a directory?q: How do Unix permissions are represented in symbolic notation?q: How does the octal notation of Unix permissions work?q: What is the user private group scheme in some systems?q: How to make the directory setgid to share files among group members?",

      "context": "File-system permissions\n\n==Introduction==\nMost file systems include attributes of files and directories that control the ability of users to read, change, navigate, and execute the contents of the file system. In some cases, menu options or functions may be made visible or hidden depending on a user's permission level; this kind of user interface is referred to as permission-driven.\nTwo types of permissions are widely available: POSIX file system permissions and access-control lists (ACLs) which are capable of more specific control.\n\n\n\n== File system variations ==\nThe original File Allocation Table file system has a per-file all-user read-only attribute. \nNTFS implemented in Microsoft Windows NT and its derivatives, use ACLs to provide a complex set of permissions. \nOpenVMS uses a permission scheme similar to that of Unix. There are four categories (system, owner, group, and world) and four types of access permissions (Read, Write, Execute and Delete). The categories are not mutually disjoint: World includes Group, which in turn includes Owner. The System category independently includes system users.HFS, and its successor HFS+, implemented in the Classic Mac OS operating systems, do not support permissions.\nmacOS uses POSIX-compliant permissions. Beginning with version 10.4 (\"Tiger\"), it also supports the use of NFSv4 ACLs in addition to POSIX-compliant permissions. The Apple Mac OS X Server version 10.4+ File Services Administration Manual recommends using only traditional Unix permissions if possible. macOS also still supports the Classic Mac OS's \"Protected\" attribute.\nSolaris ACL support depends on the filesystem being used; older UFS filesystem supports POSIX.1e ACLs, while ZFS supports only NFSv4 ACLs.Linux supports ext2, ext3, ext4, Btrfs and other file systems many of which include POSIX.1e ACLs. There is experimental support for NFSv4 ACLs for ext3 and ext4 filesystems.\nFreeBSD supports POSIX.1e ACLs on UFS, and NFSv4 ACLs on UFS and ZFS.IBM z/OS implements file security using RACF (Resource Access Control Facility)The AmigaOS Filesystem, AmigaDOS supports a permissions system relatively advanced for a single-user OS. In AmigaOS 1.x, files had Archive, Read, Write, Execute and Delete (collectively known as ARWED) permissions/flags. In AmigaOS 2.x and higher, additional Hold, Script, and Pure permissions/flags were added.\n\n== POSIX permissions ==\n\nPermissions on Unix-like file systems are defined in the POSIX.1-2017 standard, which uses three scopes or classes known as user, group, and others. When a file is created its permissions are restricted by the umask of the process that created it.\n\n\n*** Classes ***\nFiles and directories are owned by a user. The owner determines the file's user class. Distinct permissions apply to the owner.\nFiles and directories are assigned a group, which define the file's group class. Distinct permissions apply to members of the file's group. The owner may be a member of the file's group.\nUsers who are not the owner, nor a member of the group, comprise a file's others class. Distinct permissions apply to others.\nThe effective permissions are determined based on the first class the user falls within in the order of user, group then others. For example, the user who is the owner of the file will have the permissions given to the user class regardless of the permissions assigned to the group class or others class.\n\n\n*** Permissions ***\nUnix-like systems implement three specific permissions that apply to each class:\n\nThe read permission grants the ability to read a file. When set for a directory, this permission grants the ability to read the names of files in the directory, but not to find out any further information about them such as contents, file type, size, ownership, permissions.\nThe write permission grants the ability to modify a file. When set for a directory, this permission grants the ability to modify entries in the directory, which includes creating files, deleting files, and renaming files. This requires that execute is also set; without it, the write permission is meaningless for directories.\nThe execute permission grants the ability to execute a file. This permission must be set for executable programs, in order to allow the operating system to run them. When set for a directory, the execute permission is interpreted as the search permission: it grants the ability to access file contents and meta-information if its name is known, but not list files inside the directory, unless read is set also.The effect of setting the permissions on a directory, rather than a file, is \"one of the most frequently misunderstood file permission issues\".When a permission is not set, the corresponding rights are denied. Unlike ACL-based systems, permissions on Unix-like systems are not inherited. Files created within a directory do not necessarily have the same permissions as that directory.\n\n\n*** Changing permission behavior with setuid, setgid, and sticky bits ***\nUnix-like systems typically employ three additional modes. These are actually attributes but are referred to as permissions or modes.  These special modes are for a file or directory overall, not by a class, though in the symbolic notation (see below) the setuid bit is set in the triad for the user, the setgid bit is set in the triad for the group and the sticky bit is set in the triad for others.\n\nThe set user ID, setuid, or SUID mode. When a file with setuid is executed, the resulting process will assume the effective user ID given to the owner class. This enables users to be treated temporarily as root (or another user).\nThe set group ID, setgid, or SGID permission. When a file with setgid is executed, the resulting process will assume the group ID given to the group class. When setgid is applied to a directory, new files and directories created under that directory will inherit their group from that directory. (Default behaviour is to use the primary group of the effective user when setting the group of new files and directories, except on BSD-derived systems which behave as though the setgid bit is always set on all directories (see Setuid).)\nThe sticky mode (also known as the Text mode). The classical behaviour of the sticky bit on executable files has been to encourage the kernel to retain the resulting process image in memory beyond termination; however, such use of the sticky bit is now restricted to only a minority of unix-like operating systems (HP-UX and UnixWare).

It is named after its three authors, Michael A. Harrison, Walter L. Ruzzo and Jeffrey D. Ullman.Along with presenting the model, Harrison, Ruzzo and Ullman also discussed the possibilities and limitations of proving the safety of systems using an algorithm.\n\n\n\n== Description of the model ==\nThe HRU model defines a protection system consisting of a set of generic rights R and a set of commands C. An instantaneous description of the system is called a configuration and is defined as a tuple \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        S\n        ,\n        O\n        ,\n        P\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (S,O,P)}\n   of current subjects \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n  , current objects \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O}\n   and an access matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P}\n  . Since the subjects are required to be part of the objects, the access matrix contains one row for each subject and one column for each subject and object. An entry for subject \n  \n    \n      \n        s\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle s}\n   and object \n  \n    \n      \n        o\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle o}\n   is a subset of the generic rights \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R}\n  .\nThe commands are composed of primitive operations and can additionally have a list of pre-conditions that require certain rights to be present for a pair \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        s\n        ,\n        o\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (s,o)}\n   of subjects and objects.\nThe primitive requests can modify the access matrix by adding or removing access rights for a pair of subjects and objects and by adding or removing subjects or objects. Creation of a subject or object requires the subject or object not to exist in the current configuration, while deletion of a subject or object requires it to have existed prior to deletion. In a complex command, a sequence of operations is executed only as a whole. A failing operation in a sequence makes the whole sequence fail, a form of database transaction.\n\n== Discussion of safety ==\nHarrison, Ruzzo and Ullman discussed whether there is an algorithm that takes an arbitrary initial configuration and answers the following question: is there an arbitrary sequence of commands that adds a generic right into a cell of the access matrix where it has not been in the initial configuration?\nThey showed that there is no such algorithm, thus the problem is undecidable in the general case. They also showed a limitation of the model to commands with only one primitive operation to render the problem decidable.\nCan you explain what the HRU security model is and who it is named after?question: What is the purpose of the HRU model's protection system?question: What is an entry in the access matrix of the HRU model?question: What are the primitive operations that can be performed on the access matrix in the HRU model?question: What are the pre-conditions for a command in the HRU model?question: What is a complex command in the HRU model and how does it differ from a simple command?question: Why is the problem of determining whether there is an algorithm that can add a generic right into a cell of the access matrix undecidable in the general case?question: What limitation of the HRU model makes the problem of determining whether there is an algorithm that can add a generic right into a cell of the access matrix decidable?question: What is the purpose of the introduction of the HRU model in the given text?question: What is the role of the access matrix in the HRU model?question: How does the HRU model handle the creation and deletion of subjects and objects?question: What is the significance of the undecidability of the problem of determining whether there is an algorithm that can add a generic right into a cell of the access matrix?question: How does the HRU model ensure the integrity of access rights in an operating system?question: What are the primitive requests that can be made on the access matrix in the HRU model?question: How does the HRU model handle the execution of commands?",

Ullman.Along with presenting the model, Harrison, Ruzzo and Ullman also discussed the possibilities and limitations of proving the safety of systems using an algorithm.\n\n\n\n== Description of the model ==\nThe HRU model defines a protection system consisting of a set of generic rights R and a set of commands C. An instantaneous description of the system is called a configuration and is defined as a tuple \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        S\n        ,\n        O\n        ,\n        P\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (S,O,P)}\n   of current subjects \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n  , current objects \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O}\n   and an access matrix \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P}\n  . Since the subjects are required to be part of the objects, the access matrix contains one row for each subject and one column for each subject and object. An entry for subject \n  \n    \n      \n        s\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle s}\n   and object \n  \n    \n      \n        o\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle o}\n   is a subset of the generic rights \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R}\n  .\nThe commands are composed of primitive operations and can additionally have a list of pre-conditions that require certain rights to be present for a pair \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        s\n        ,\n        o\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (s,o)}\n   of subjects and objects.\nThe primitive requests can modify the access matrix by adding or removing access rights for a pair of subjects and objects and by adding or removing subjects or objects. Creation of a subject or object requires the subject or object not to exist in the current configuration, while deletion of a subject or object requires it to have existed prior to deletion. In a complex command, a sequence of operations is executed only as a whole. A failing operation in a sequence makes the whole sequence fail, a form of database transaction.\n\n== Discussion of safety ==\nHarrison, Ruzzo and Ullman discussed whether there is an algorithm that takes an arbitrary initial configuration and answers the following question: is there an arbitrary sequence of commands that adds a generic right into a cell of the access matrix where it has not been in the initial configuration?\nThey showed that there is no such algorithm, thus the problem is undecidable in the general case. They also showed a limitation of the model to commands with only one primitive operation to render the problem decidable.",

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nWebAuthn\n\n==Introduction==\nWeb Authentication (WebAuthn) is a web standard published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). WebAuthn is a core component of the FIDO2 Project under the guidance of the FIDO Alliance. The goal of the project is to standardize an interface for authenticating users to web-based applications and services using public-key cryptography.\nOn the client side, support for WebAuthn can be implemented in a variety of ways. The underlying cryptographic operations are performed by an authenticator, which is an abstract functional model that is mostly agnostic with respect to how the key material is managed. This makes it possible to implement support for WebAuthn purely in software, making use of a processor's trusted execution environment or a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Sensitive cryptographic operations can also be offloaded to a roaming hardware authenticator that can in turn be accessed via USB, Bluetooth Low Energy, or near-field communications (NFC). A roaming hardware authenticator conforms to the FIDO Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP), making WebAuthn effectively backward compatible with the FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) standard.Similar to legacy U2F, Web Authentication is resilient to verifier impersonation, that is, it is resistant to phishing attacks, but unlike U2F, WebAuthn does not require a traditional password. Moreover, a roaming hardware authenticator is resistant to malware since the private key material is at no time accessible to software running on the host machine.\nThe WebAuthn Level 1 and 2 standards were published as W3C Recommendations on 4 March 2019 and 8 April 2021 respectively. A Level 3 specification is currently a First Public Working Draft (FPWD).\n\n== Background ==\nFIDO2 is the successor to FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F). Whereas U2F only supports multi-factor mode, having been designed to strengthen existing username/password-based login flows, FIDO2 adds support for single-factor mode. In single-factor mode, the authenticator is activated by a test of user presence, which usually consists of a simple button push; no password is required. In multi-factor mode, the authenticator (something you have) performs user verification. Depending on the authenticator capabilities, this can be:\nsomething you know: a secret such as a PIN, passcode or swipe pattern\nsomething you are: a biometric such as fingerprint, iris or voiceRegardless of mode, the authenticator never shares its secrets or biometric data with the website. Moreover, a single secret or biometric works with all websites, as the authenticator will select the correct cryptographic key material to use for the service requesting authentication after user verification was completed successfully.\nA secret and biometric on the authenticator can be used together, similarly to how they would be used on a smartphone. For example, a fingerprint is used to provide convenient access to your smartphone but occasionally fingerprint access fails, in which case a PIN can be used.\n\n== Overview ==\nLike its predecessor FIDO U2F, W3C Web Authentication (WebAuthn) involves a website, a web browser, and an authenticator:\nThe website is a conforming WebAuthn Relying Party\nThe browser is a conforming WebAuthn Client\nThe authenticator is a FIDO2 authenticator, that is, it is assumed to be compatible with the WebAuthn ClientWebAuthn specifies how a claimant demonstrates possession and control of a FIDO2 authenticator to a verifier called the WebAuthn Relying Party. The authentication process is mediated by an entity called the WebAuthn Client, which is little more than a conforming web browser.\n\n\n*** Authentication ***\n\nFor the purposes of illustration, we assume the authenticator is a roaming hardware authenticator (see below for other options). In any case, the authenticator is a multi-factor cryptographic authenticator that uses public-key cryptography to sign an authentication assertion targeted at the WebAuthn Relying Party. Assuming the authenticator uses a PIN for user verification, the authenticator itself is something you have while the PIN is something you know.\nTo initiate the WebAuthn authentication flow, the WebAuthn Relying Party indicates its intentions to the WebAuthn Client (i.e., the browser) via JavaScript. The WebAuthn Client communicates with the authenticator using a JavaScript API implemented in the browser. A roaming authenticator conforms to the FIDO Client to Authenticator Protocol.\nWebAuthn does not strictly require a roaming hardware authenticator. Alternatively, a software authenticator (e.g., implemented on a smartphone) or a platform authenticator (i.e., an authenticator implemented directly on the WebAuthn Client Device) may be used. Relevant examples of platform authenticators include Windows Hello and the Android operating system.The illustrated flow relies on PIN-based user verification, which, in terms of usability, is only a modest improvement over ordinary password authentication. In practice, the use of biometrics for user verification can improve the usability of WebAuthn. The logistics behind biometrics are still poorly understood, however. There is a lingering misunderstanding among users that biometric data is transmitted over the network in the same manner as passwords, which is not the case.\n\n\n*** Registration ***\nWhen the WebAuthn Relying Party receives the signed authentication assertion from the browser, the digital signature on the assertion is verified using a trusted public key for the user. How does the WebAuthn Relying Party obtain that trusted public key in the first place?\nTo obtain a public key for the user, the WebAuthn Relying Party initiates a WebAuthn registration flow that is very similar to the authentication flow illustrated above. The primary difference is that the authenticator now signs an attestation statement with its attestation private key. The signed attestation statement contains a copy of the public key that the WebAuthn Relying Party ultimately uses to verify a signed authentication assertion. The attestation statement also contains metadata describing the authenticator itself.\nThe digital signature on the attestation statement is verified with the trusted attestation public key for that particular model of authenticator. How the WebAuthn Relying Party obtains its store of trusted attestation public keys is unspecified. One option is to use the FIDO metadata service.The attestation type specified in the JavaScript determines the trust model. For instance, an attestation type called self-attestation may be desired, for which the trust model is essentially trust on first use.\n\n== Support ==\nThe WebAuthn Level 1 standard was published as a W3C Recommendation by the Web Authentication Working Group on 4 March 2019. WebAuthn is supported by Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari and Opera.The desktop version of Google Chrome has supported WebAuthn since version 67. Firefox, which had not fully supported the previous FIDO U2F standard, included and enabled WebAuthn in Firefox version 60, released on May 9, 2018. An early Windows Insider release of Microsoft Edge (Build 17682) implemented a version of WebAuthn that works with both Windows Hello as well as external security keys.Existing FIDO U2F security keys are largely compatible with the WebAuthn standard, though WebAuthn added the ability to reference a unique per-account \"user handle\" identifier, which older authenticators are unable to store.One of the first FIDO2-compatible authenticators was the second-generation Security Key by Yubico, announced on April 10, 2018. The first FIDO2-compatible authenticators with a display was Trezor Model T by SatoshiLabs, announced on November 6, 2019. Trezor Model T was also the first authenticator that allowed users to select which FIDO2 resident credential should be used directly on a device.\nThe first Security Level 2 certified FIDO2 key, called \"Goldengate\" was announced one year later by eWBM on April 8, 2019. andDropbox announced support for WebAuthn logins (as a 2nd factor) on May 8, 2018.Apple announced that Face ID or Touch ID could be used as a WebAuthn platform authenticator with Safari on June 24, 2020.\n\n== API ==\nWebAuthn implements an extension of the W3C's more general Credential Management API, which is an attempt to formalize the interaction between websites and web browsers when exchanging user credentials. The Web Authentication API extends the Credential Management navigator.credentials.create() and navigator.credentials.get() JavaScript methods so they accept a publicKey parameter. The create() method is used for registering public key authenticators as part of associating them with user accounts (possibly at initial account creation time but more likely when adding a new security device to an existing account) while the get() method is used for authenticating (such as when logging in).\nTo check if a browser supports WebAuthn, scripts should check if the window.PublicKeyCredential interface is defined. In addition to PublicKeyCredential, the standard also defines the AuthenticatorResponse, AuthenticatorAttestationResponse, and AuthenticatorAssertionResponse interfaces in addition to a variety of dictionaries and other datatypes.\nThe API does not allow direct access to or manipulation of private keys, beyond requesting their initial creation.\n\nHow does WebAuthn improve usability compared to ordinary password authentication?Q: What is the role of the WebAuthn Client in the authentication process?Q: How does a roaming hardware authenticator communicate with the WebAuthn Client?Q: What is the difference between single-factor and multi-factor mode in FIDO2?Q: What is the role of the attestation statement in the registration flow of WebAuthn?Q: What is the function of the trusted attestation public key in the registration flow of WebAuthn?Q: What is the difference between a roaming authenticator and a platform authenticator in WebAuthn?Q: What is the trust model for the self-attestation attestation type in WebAuthn?Q: What is the role of the FIDO metadata service in WebAuthn?Q: What is the purpose of the Credential Management API in WebAuthn?Q: What is the purpose of the publicKey parameter in the Credential Management API's create() and get() methods in WebAuthn?Q: How can scripts check if a browser supports WebAuthn?Q: What is the role of the AuthenticatorResponse, AuthenticatorAttestationResponse, and AuthenticatorAssertionResponse interfaces in WebAuthn?Q: Does the WebAuthn API allow direct access to or manipulation of private keys?Q: What is the difference between WebAuthn and the previous FIDO U2F standard in terms of support by web browsers?",

The term combines the notions of 'branding' and 'hijacking', and has been used since at least 2007 when it appeared in Business Week referencing the term used in a publication by the firm MarkMonitor (MarkMonitor and its PR firm, the Zeno Group, coined the phrase; MarkMonitor registered \"BrandJacking Index\" as a trademark, but not the term \"brandjacking\" on its own). The tactic is often associated with use of individual and corporate identities on social media or Web 2.0 sites, as described in Quentin Langley's 2014 book Brandjack, and may be used alongside more conventional (offline) campaign activities.\nWhile similar to cybersquatting, identity theft or phishing in nature and in possible tactics, brandjacking is usually particular to a politician, celebrity or business and more indirect in its nature. A brandjacker may attempt to use the reputation of its target for selfish reasons or seek to damage the reputation of its target for hostile, malicious or for political or campaigning reasons. These reasons may not be directly financial, but the effects on the original brand-holder may often include financial loss - for example, negative publicity may result in the termination of a celebrity's sponsorship deal, or, for a corporation, potentially lead to lost sales or a reduced share price.\n\n== Brandjacking examples ==\nCoca-Cola - in 2013, a commercial, \"The Bitter Taste of Sugar\", for Oxfam (Oxfam Novib Netherlands) parodied a Coca-Cola Zero commercial, drawing attention to its unsustainable business practices.\nStarbucks - in 2006, a YouTube-hosted video presented a spoof advert for a Starbucks Frappuccino underlining the contrast between consumption and poverty.\nNestle - in March 2010, Greenpeace campaigners used a YouTube video that parodied Nestl\u00e9's KitKat 'Take a Break' advertising, to draw attention to the multinational's use of palm oil from unsustainable operations in Indonesia and the consequent impact on Orangutan habitats. Protesters outside Nestl\u00e9's UK head office in Croydon carried signs with the words 'Give me a break' and 'Killer' printed in the distinctive red and white Gill Sans.\nExxon Mobil - in 2008, a Twitter account (@ExxonMobilCorp) was set up purporting to be the views of an official spokesperson for the oil company, only for it later to be exposed as fake.\nAlso on Twitter, @BPglobalPR is not an official voice for BP, but a satirical account that has grown in popularity during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, attracting more followers than the official BP Twitter account.\nPoliticians - fake Facebook pages were created for US President Barack Obama and US Republican governor Sarah Palin (among other politicians). Major corporations have also been the subject of brandjack-based protests on Facebook.\nFake blogs - may be considered a form of brandjacking if created by a critic or opponent of the person or brand supposed to be behind the blog.\nAffiliate Brand Bidding - This is a tactic used by some affiliate marketers. Some consider such tactics unethical or Black Hat. The method is to bid on keywords related to your site / product, but to do so seemingly as a competitor.\nColleges and Universities - In 2008, college guidebook company College Prowler created hundreds of Facebook groups purporting to consist of actual incoming first-year students of various universities in order to surreptitiously gather their personal data and promote the business.\nIn June 2011, Greenpeace activists launched a campaign against Mattel's use of a packaging supplier, APP, said to be desecrating Indonesian rainforests, using images of Mattel dolls Barbie and Ken. A Greenpeace video showed Ken dumping Barbie (\"I don't date girls who are into deforestation\"), the group created a mock Twitter feud and a stunt involving Barbie in a pink bulldozer, and unfurled a banner on the wall of Mattel\u2019s Los Angeles headquarters; some  500,000 people sent protest emails to Mattel. In October 2011, Mattel announced a global policy to keep rainforest destruction out of its supply chains. Brandjack author Quentin Langley praised Greenpeace for its integration of online (YouTube, Twitter) and offline (stunts, etc.).\n\n== Brandjacking avoidance ==\nBrandjacking avoidance may include:\n\nPre-emptive registration of brand names and sub-brands as screen names on social media sites.\nStaying vigilant \nUse of social media and general media monitoring tools to seek evidence of infringement\nLegal action against those seen as responsible for the infringement.However, action against the brandjackers and their supporters can actually draw attention to the problem (the Streisand effect). For example, following Greenpeace's KitKat campaign, Nestl\u00e9 had the video removed from YouTube, but Greenpeace quickly re-posted it to video-sharing site Vimeo.com and highlighted the attempted censorship using Twitter and other social media. Attempts by Nestl\u00e9 to constrain user activity on its Facebook fan page further fanned the controversy.\n\nWhat is brandjacking and how is it related to brand equity acquisition?question: How is brandjacking different from cybersquatting, identity theft, or phishing?question: Can brandjacking occur on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter?question: How have organizations like Greenpeace and Oxfam utilized brandjacking as a form of protest?question: What are the potential consequences of brandjacking for the original brand-holder?question: How can colleges and universities protect themselves from brandjacking?question: What is the Streisand effect and how has it played a role in brandjacking incidents?question: Can brandjacking involve the use of fake blogs?question: How has Greenpeace effectively integrated online and offline tactics in their brandjacking campaigns?question: How can affiliate marketers engage in tactics that could be considered brandjacking?question: How can pre-emptive registration of brand names on social media sites help prevent brandjacking?question: How can social media monitoring tools aid in the detection and prevention of brandjacking?question: What role does vigilance play in preventing brandjacking?question: How can legal action be used in response to brandjacking incidents?question: What is the significance of the term \"brandjacking\" and its origins in the context of cybersecurity and reputation management?",

While cybersquatting involves registering domain names similar to existing trademarks, identity theft targets personal information, and phishing aims to deceive individuals into providing sensitive data, brandjacking exploits the reputation of a target, possibly for non-financial reasons, causing financial harm through negative publicity, lost sales, or reduced share price.answer: Yes, brandjacking often occurs on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Fake pages or accounts can be created to impersonate politicians, celebrities, or businesses, potentially damaging their reputations or causing financial loss. Examples include fake Facebook pages for US President Barack Obama and US Republican governor Sarah Palin, as well as a fake Twitter account for ExxonMobilCorp.answer: Organizations like Greenpeace and Oxfam have employed brandjacking techniques as a means of raising awareness about unsustainable business practices, environmental issues, and other social concerns. Examples include the Oxfam \"Bitter Taste of Sugar\" commercial parodying Coca-Cola and the Greenpeace campaign against Nestl\u00e9's use of palm oil from unsustainable sources.answer: Brandjacking can result in various negative consequences for the original brand-holder, including financial loss due to decreased sales or reduced share price, as well as damaged reputation from negative publicity. For celebrities, this could mean termination of sponsorship deals, while for corporations, it could lead to lost sales and decreased consumer trust.answer: Colleges and universities can take several measures to protect themselves from brandjacking, such as pre-emptive registration of brand names and sub-brands as screen names on social media sites, staying vigilant, using social media and general media monitoring tools, and taking legal action against those responsible for infringement.answer: The Streisand effect refers to the phenomenon where attempting to suppress or censor information online often results in increased publicity and awareness.

This tactic, known as affiliate brand bidding, is sometimes considered unethical or Black Hat, as it involves exploiting the reputation and brand equity of another entity for personal financial gain.answer: Pre-emptive registration of brand names and sub-brands as screen names on social media sites can help prevent brandjacking by ensuring that the genuine entity controls the online identity, reducing the likelihood of impersonation or misrepresentation.answer: Social media monitoring tools can help detect brandjacking by seeking evidence of infringement, such as impersonation accounts or misuse of brand names and logos. By identifying these instances early on, organizations can take swift action to prevent further damage to their reputation or financial loss.answer: Staying vigilant involves continuously monitoring the organization's online presence and being aware of potential threats to the brand's reputation and equity. Regularly checking for impersonation accounts, misuse of brand names, and other forms of brandjacking can enable the organization to take quick action and mitigate potential harm.answer: Legal action can be taken against those responsible for brandjacking infringements to protect the organization's brand equity, reputation, and financial interests.

Outpost also monitors application behavior in an attempt to stop malicious software covertly infecting Windows systems. Agnitum called this technology \"Component Control\" and \"Anti-Leak Control\" (included into HIPS-based \"Host Protection\" module). The product also includes a spyware scanner and monitor, along with a pop-up blocker and spyware filter for Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox. (Outpost's web surfing security tools had included black-lists for IPs and URLs, unwanted web page element filters and ad-blocking. The technology altogether is known as \"Web control\".)\nVersion 7.5 adds new techniques to help PC users block unknown new threats before their activation:\n\nRemovable media protection (so-called \"USB Virus Protection\", part of the Proactive Protection module) blocks unsigned programs set to run automatically upon the connection of a removable media.\nSmartDecision technology (so-called \"Personal Virus Adviser\", basis of the Proactive Protection module) facilitates decision-making process.Version 8 introduces further improvements as well as Windows 8 compatibility and a redesigned user interface; version 8 also has extends x64 host-based intrusion-prevention system (HIPS) support.\nOutpost Firewall Pro allows the user to specifically define how a PC application connects to the Internet. This is known as the \"Rules Wizard\" mode, or policy, and is the default behavior for the program. In this mode, Outpost Firewall Pro displays a prompt each time a new process attempts network access or when a process requests a connection that was not covered by its pre-validated rules. The idea is to let the user decide whether an application should be allowed a network connection to a specific address, port or protocol. Outpost Firewall includes pre-set rules for many popular applications. Users could optionally submit rules they had created.\nFirst versions for Outpost Firewall Pro (1.0\u20134.0) allow users to create their own plugins and add other third-party plugins to meet specific needs. Later versions do not have the plugin programming interface.\n\n== Online assistance ==\nOutpost Firewall Pro users developed an unofficial web forum fed by Agnitum since 2002 to discuss product features and support.  The forum is moderated by experienced senior users of Outpost Firewall Pro and offers help and support for technical advice and program assistance.\n\n== Achievements ==\nOutpost Firewall Pro's self-protection technology aims at detecting attempts to modify or disable its services or hinder program protection, and received accolades by Comparison Testers as being capable and sophisticated at detecting all known methods of disabling it without user permission. The testing site Matousec.com (performing a test-set of leak-tests to all known software including PC firewalls), consistently gives Outpost Firewall Pro its highest ratings in PC firewalls independent comparisons. Outpost Firewall Pro has more than 30 awards in 15 countries in computer media and test labs since 2002.The product was also licensed by several security software publishers in 2003\u20132010: Sophos (UK, USA), Lavasoft (Sweden), Canon (Japan), Bullguard (UK), CAT-QuickHeal (India), Novell (USA), AVG (Czech Republic), Avast (Czech Republic), Proland Software (India), and others.\n\n== Editions ==\nOutpost Firewall Pro: A shareware personal firewall with inbound-outbound PC program actions control and port stealthing plus anti-spyware and web surfing security plus HIPS engine.\nOutpost Firewall Free: A freeware version which includes a web and local PC firewall with access control and port stealthing, plus HIPS engine.\nOutpost Security Suite Pro: Includes personal firewall, anti-virus, anti-spam, web surfing security tools and HIPS. Anti-spam has been dropped from version 8 onwards as it duplicates functions built into the most popular web and PC mail clients and is thus redundant.\nOutpost Security Suite Free: Free but limited edition for Internet Security Suite features (PC firewall, anti-virus, anti-spyware, anti-spam and host intrusion prevention system HIPS).\n\n== Criticism ==\nOutpost can generate a large number of security alerts, which some experts believe will lead to an inexperienced end-user habitually dismissing all alerts, even important ones. This firewall is preferred by experienced users as Agnitum's direction is to give the end user complete control to all aspects of their system to avoid unwanted changes by malicious software, disclosure of personal information and malware. In advanced security mode, Outpost's Component Control will notify the user every time a network enabled application has a changed component and Anti-Leak Control will notify the user whenever an application performs a potentially dangerous operation such as overwriting another application's memory space. In practice this can result in such a high number of alerts that they can quickly become intrusive.

    "instruction": "OCSP stapling\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) stapling, formally known as the TLS Certificate Status Request extension, is a standard for checking the revocation status of X.509 digital certificates. It allows the presenter of a certificate to bear the resource cost involved in providing Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responses by appending (\"stapling\") a time-stamped OCSP response signed by the CA to the initial TLS handshake, eliminating the need for clients to contact the CA, with the aim of improving both security and performance.\n\n== Motivation ==\nThe original OCSP implementation has a number of issues.\nFirstly, it can introduce a significant cost for the certificate authorities (CA) because it requires them to provide responses to every client of a given certificate in real time. For example, when a certificate is issued to a high traffic website, the servers of CAs are likely to be hit by enormous volumes of OCSP requests querying the validity of the certificate.Also, OCSP checking potentially impairs users' privacy and slows down browsing, since it requires the client to contact a third party (the CA) to confirm the validity of each certificate that it encounters.Moreover, if the client fails to connect to the CA for an OCSP response, then it is forced to decide between: (a) continuing the connection anyway; defeating the purpose of OCSP or (b) terminating the connection based on the assumption that there is an attack; but which could result in excessive false warnings and blocks.OCSP stapling is aimed at addressing these issues with the original OCSP implementation.\n\n== Solution ==\nOCSP stapling resolves both problems in a fashion reminiscent of the Kerberos ticket.  In a stapling scenario, the certificate holder itself queries the OCSP server at regular intervals, obtaining a signed time-stamped OCSP response.  When the site's visitors attempt to connect to the site, this response is included (\"stapled\") with the TLS/SSL handshake via the Certificate Status Request extension response (note: the TLS client must explicitly include a Certificate Status Request extension in its ClientHello TLS/SSL handshake message).While it may appear that allowing the site operator to control verification responses would allow a fraudulent site to issue false verification for a revoked certificate, the stapled responses can't be forged as they need to be directly signed by the certificate authority, not the server. If the client does not receive a stapled response, it will just contact the OCSP server by itself.  However, if the client receives an invalid stapled response, it will abort the connection. The only increased risk of OCSP stapling is that the notification of revocation for a certificate may be delayed until the last-signed OCSP response expires.\nAs a result, clients continue to have verifiable assurance from the certificate authority that the certificate is presently valid (or was quite recently), but no longer need to individually contact the OCSP server. This means that the brunt of the resource burden is now placed back on the certificate holder.  It also means that the client software no longer needs to disclose users' browsing habits to any third party.Overall performance is also improved: When the client fetches the OCSP response directly from the CA, it usually involves the lookup of the domain name of the CA's OCSP server in the DNS as well as establishing a connection to the OCSP server. When OCSP stapling is used, the certificate status information is delivered to the client through an already established channel, reducing overhead and improving performance.\n\n== Specification ==\nThe TLS Certificate Status Request extension is specified in RFC 6066, Section 8.\nRFC 6961 defines a Multiple Certificate Status Request extension, which allows a server to send multiple OCSP responses in the TLS handshake.\nA draft proposal for an X509v3 extension field, which expired in April 2013, specified that a compliant server presenting a certificate carrying the extension must return a valid OCSP token in its response if the status_request extension is specified in the TLS client hello. The current version of the proposal has been extended to support additional TLS extensions. TLS developer Adam Langley discussed the extension in an April 2014 article following the repair of the Heartbleed OpenSSL bug.\n\n== Deployment ==\nOCSP stapling support is being progressively implemented.  The OpenSSL project included support in their 0.9.8g release with the assistance of a grant from the Mozilla Foundation.\nApache HTTP Server supports OCSP stapling since version 2.3.3, the nginx web server since version 1.3.7, LiteSpeed Web Server since version 4.2.4, Microsoft's IIS since Windows Server 2008, HAProxy since version 1.5.0,  F5 Networks BIG-IP since version 11.6.0, KEMP LoadMasters since Version 7.2.37.1, and lighttpd since version 1.4.56.While many web servers advertise support for OCSP stapling, implementations are not always reliable. For example, when Apache queries the OCSP server, in the event of a temporary failure, it will discard the cached good response from the previous request, and start serving bad response. Nginx performs lazy loading of OCSP responses, which means that for the first few web requests it is unable to add the OCSP response.On the browser side, OCSP stapling was implemented in Firefox 26,  in Internet Explorer since Windows Vista, and Google Chrome in Linux, ChromeOS, and Windows since Vista.For SMTP the Exim message transfer agent supports OCSP stapling in both\nclient \nand server  modes.\n\n== Limitations ==\nOCSP stapling is designed to reduce the cost of an OCSP validation, both for the client and the OCSP responder, especially for large sites serving many simultaneous users.  However, OCSP stapling supports only one OCSP response at a time, which is insufficient for certificate chains with intermediate CA certs.This limitation has been addressed by Multiple Certificate Status Request Extension, specified in RFC 6961. It adds the support for sending multiple OCSP responses.TLSv1.3 automatically removes this limitation, making browser support for RFC 6961 moot, as more and more web servers drop support for TLS 1.2. Under TLS 1.2 only one stapled response can be sent by a server, the OCSP response associated with the end-certificate. Under TLS 1.3 a server can send multiple OCSP responses, typically one for each certificate in the certificate chain.\nHow does OCSP stapling improve the performance of certificate validity checks compared to the original OCSP implementation?Q: What resource burden does OCSP stapling shift from certificate authorities to certificate holders?Q: How does OCSP stapling address users' privacy concerns compared to the original OCSP implementation?Q: Why can't a fraudulent site forge stapled OCSP responses in a stapling scenario?Q: What are the risks associated with the notification of revocation for a certificate in OCSP stapling?Q: How does the TLS Certificate Status Request extension specify OCSP stapling in RFC 6066, Section 8?Q: What is the difference between OCSP stapling and the original OCSP implementation in terms of contacting the CA?Q: What is the purpose of the Multiple Certificate Status Request extension, as specified in RFC 6961?Q: How does TLSv1.3 remove the limitation of only one stapled response under TLS 1.2 in OCSP stapling?Q: What are the benefits of OCSP stapling support in the OpenSSL project, including version and grant details?Q: How does Apache HTTP Server handle OCSP stapling when it encounters a temporary failure in querying the OCSP server?Q: Which web servers support OCSP stapling, including version details and specific functionalities?Q: How does the Exim message transfer agent support OCSP stapling in both client and server modes for SMTP?Q: Why do many web server implementations of OCSP stapling have issues with reliability?Q: How does OCSP stapling address the issue of enormous volumes of OCSP requests querying the validity of a certificate for high traffic websites?",

Nginx performs lazy loading of OCSP responses, which means that for the first few web requests it is unable to add the OCSP response.On the browser side, OCSP stapling was implemented in Firefox 26,  in Internet Explorer since Windows Vista, and Google Chrome in Linux, ChromeOS, and Windows since Vista.For SMTP the Exim message transfer agent supports OCSP stapling in both\nclient \nand server  modes.\n\n== Limitations ==\nOCSP stapling is designed to reduce the cost of an OCSP validation, both for the client and the OCSP responder, especially for large sites serving many simultaneous users.  However, OCSP stapling supports only one OCSP response at a time, which is insufficient for certificate chains with intermediate CA certs.This limitation has been addressed by Multiple Certificate Status Request Extension, specified in RFC 6961. It adds the support for sending multiple OCSP responses.TLSv1.3 automatically removes this limitation, making browser support for RFC 6961 moot, as more and more web servers drop support for TLS 1.2. Under TLS 1.2 only one stapled response can be sent by a server, the OCSP response associated with the end-certificate. Under TLS 1.3 a server can send multiple OCSP responses, typically one for each certificate in the certificate chain.",
      "questions": "How does OCSP stapling improve the performance of certificate validity checks compared to the original OCSP implementation?Q: What resource burden does OCSP stapling shift from certificate authorities to certificate holders?Q: How does OCSP stapling address users' privacy concerns compared to the original OCSP implementation?Q: Why can't a fraudulent site forge stapled OCSP responses in a stapling scenario?Q: What are the risks associated with the notification of revocation for a certificate in OCSP stapling?Q: How does the TLS Certificate Status Request extension specify OCSP stapling in RFC 6066, Section 8?Q: What is the difference between OCSP stapling and the original OCSP implementation in terms of contacting the CA?Q: What is the purpose of the Multiple Certificate Status Request extension, as specified in RFC 6961?Q: How does TLSv1.3 remove the limitation of only one stapled response under TLS 1.2 in OCSP stapling?Q: What are the benefits of OCSP stapling support in the OpenSSL project, including version and grant details?Q: How does Apache HTTP Server handle OCSP stapling when it encounters a temporary failure in querying the OCSP server?Q: Which web servers support OCSP stapling, including version details and specific functionalities?Q: How does the Exim message transfer agent support OCSP stapling in both client and server modes for SMTP?Q: Why do many web server implementations of OCSP stapling have issues with reliability?Q: How does OCSP stapling address the issue of enormous volumes of OCSP requests querying the validity of a certificate for high traffic websites?",
      "answers": "OCSP stapling improves performance by delivering certificate status information to the client through an already established channel, reducing overhead from DNS lookups and establishing new connections to the OCSP server.A: OCSP stapling places the resource burden of providing OCSP responses back on the certificate holder, as they are now responsible for querying the OCSP server at regular intervals and stapling the responses.A: OCSP stapling addresses privacy concerns by eliminating the need for clients to contact a third-party CA for each certificate validity check, preventing disclosure of users' browsing habits.A: Stapled OCSP responses can't be forged because they need to be directly signed by the certificate authority, not the server, making it impossible for a fraudulent site to issue false verification for a revoked certificate.A: The only increased risk of OCSP stapling is that the notification of revocation for a certificate may be delayed until the last-signed OCSP response expires.A: The TLS Certificate Status Request extension specifies OCSP stapling in RFC 6066, Section 8, allowing a server to send an OCSP response in the TLS handshake, signed by the CA.A: In OCSP stapling, clients no longer need to individually contact the OCSP server for each certificate validity check, as the certificate holder now queries the OCSP server at regular intervals and staples the responses.A: The Multiple Certificate Status Request extension, specified in RFC 6961, adds support for sending multiple OCSP responses, addressing the limitation of OCSP stapling supporting only one OCSP response at a time.A: TLSv1.3 removes the limitation by allowing a server to send multiple OCSP responses, typically one for each certificate in the certificate chain, under TLS 1.3.A: The OpenSSL project included OCSP stapling support in their 0.9.8g release with the assistance of a grant from the Mozilla Foundation, providing more secure and efficient certificate revocation checks.A: Apache HTTP Server discards the cached good response from the previous request and starts serving bad responses when it encounters a temporary failure in querying the OCSP server.A: Web servers such as Apache HTTP Server (version 2.3.3 and later), nginx (version 1.3.7 and later), LiteSpeed Web Server (version 4.2.4 and later), Microsoft's IIS (Windows Server 2008 and later), HAProxy (version 1.5.0 and later), F5 Networks BIG-IP (version 11.6.0 and later), KEMP LoadMasters (Version 7.2.37.1 and later), and lighttpd (version 1.4.56 and later) support OCSP stapling with various features and functionalities.A: The Exim message transfer agent supports OCSP stapling in both client and server modes for SMTP, enhancing security and efficiency in certificate revocation checks.A: Many web server implementations of OCSP stapling have issues with reliability due to factors such as discarding cached good responses in Apache or performing lazy loading of OCSP responses in nginx.A: OCSP stapling addresses this issue by allowing the certificate holder to query the OCSP server at regular intervals and staple the responses, reducing the resource cost involved in providing real-time OCSP responses for certificate authorities."

    "instruction": "OpenVPN\n\n==Introduction==\nOpenVPN is a virtual private network (VPN) system that implements techniques to create secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities. It implements both client and server applications.\nOpenVPN allows peers to authenticate each other using pre-shared secret keys, certificates or username/password. When used in a multiclient-server configuration, it allows the server to release an authentication certificate for every client, using signatures and certificate authority.\nIt uses the OpenSSL encryption library extensively, as well as the TLS protocol, and contains many security and control features. It uses a custom security protocol that utilizes SSL/TLS for key exchange. It is capable of traversing network address translators (NATs) and firewalls.OpenVPN has been ported and embedded to several systems. For example, DD-WRT has the OpenVPN server function. SoftEther VPN, a multi-protocol VPN server, also has an implementation of OpenVPN protocol.It was written by James Yonan and is free software, released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2). Additionally, commercial licenses are available.\n\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n*** Encryption ***\nOpenVPN uses the OpenSSL library to provide encryption of both the data and control channels. It lets OpenSSL do all the encryption and authentication work, allowing OpenVPN to use all the ciphers available in the OpenSSL package. It can also use the HMAC packet authentication feature to add an additional layer of security to the connection (referred to as an \"HMAC Firewall\" by the creator). It can also use hardware acceleration to get better encryption performance. Support for mbed TLS is available starting from version 2.3.\n\n\n*** Authentication ***\nOpenVPN has several ways to authenticate peers with each other. OpenVPN offers pre-shared keys, certificate-based, and username/password-based authentication. Preshared secret key is the easiest, and certificate-based is the most robust and feature-rich. In version 2.0 username/password authentications can be enabled, both with or without certificates. However, to make use of username/password authentications, OpenVPN depends on third-party modules.\n\n\n*** Networking ***\nOpenVPN can run over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) transports, multiplexing created SSL tunnels on a single TCP/UDP port (RFC 3948 for UDP).From 2.3.x series on, OpenVPN fully supports IPv6 as protocol of the virtual network inside a tunnel and the OpenVPN applications can also establish connections via IPv6.\nIt has the ability to work through most proxy servers (including HTTP) and is good at working through network address translation (NAT) and getting out through firewalls. The server configuration has the ability to \"push\" certain network configuration options to the clients. These include IP addresses, routing commands, and a few connection options. OpenVPN offers two types of interfaces for networking via the Universal TUN/TAP driver. It can create either a layer-3 based IP tunnel (TUN), or a layer-2 based Ethernet TAP that can carry any type of Ethernet traffic. OpenVPN can optionally use the LZO compression library to compress the data stream. Port 1194 is the official IANA assigned port number for OpenVPN. Newer versions of the program now default to that port. A feature in the 2.0 version allows for one process to manage several simultaneous tunnels, as opposed to the original \"one tunnel per process\" restriction on the 1.x series.\nOpenVPN's use of common network protocols (TCP and UDP) makes it a desirable alternative to IPsec in situations where an ISP may block specific VPN protocols in order to force users to subscribe to a higher-priced, \"business grade\" service tier. For example, Comcast previously declared that their @Home product was, and had always been, designated as a residential service and did not allow the use of commercial applications. Their argument was that conducting remote work via a VPN can adversely affect the network performance of their regular residential subscribers. They offered an alternative, @Home Professional, this would cost more than @Home product. So, anyone wishing to use VPN would have to subscribe to higher-priced, business-grade service tier.When OpenVPN uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) transports to establish a tunnel, performance will be acceptable only as long as there is sufficient excess bandwidth on the un-tunneled network link to guarantee that the tunneled TCP timers do not expire. If this becomes untrue, performance falls off dramatically. This is known as the \"TCP meltdown problem\".\n\n\n*** Security ***\nOpenVPN offers various internal security features. It has up to 256-bit encryption through the OpenSSL library, although some service providers may offer lower rates, effectively providing some of the fastest VPN available to consumers. It runs in userspace instead of requiring IP stack (therefore kernel) operation. OpenVPN has the ability to drop root privileges, use mlockall to prevent swapping sensitive data to disk, enter a chroot jail after initialization, and apply a SELinux context after initialization.\nOpenVPN runs a custom security protocol based on SSL and TLS, rather than supporting IKE, IPsec, L2TP or PPTP.\nOpenVPN offers support of smart cards via PKCS#11-based cryptographic tokens.\n\n\n*** Extensibility ***\nOpenVPN can be extended with third-party plug-ins or scripts, which can be called at defined entry points. The purpose of this is often to extend OpenVPN with more advanced logging, enhanced authentication with username and passwords, dynamic firewall updates, RADIUS integration and so on. The plug-ins are dynamically loadable modules, usually written in C, while the scripts interface can execute any scripts or binaries available to OpenVPN. In the OpenVPN source code there are some examples of such plug-ins, including a PAM authentication plug-in. Several third-party plug-ins also exist to authenticate against LDAP or SQL databases such as SQLite and MySQL.\n\n\n*** Header ***\n\n== Platforms ==\nIt is available on Solaris, Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, QNX, macOS and Windows XP and later. OpenVPN is available for mobile operating systems including Maemo, Windows Mobile 6.5 and below, iOS 3GS+ devices, jailbroken iOS 3.1.2+ devices, Android 4.0+ devices, and Android devices that have had the Cyanogenmod aftermarket firmware flashed or have the correct kernel module installed. It is not compatible with some mobile phone OSes, including Palm OS. It is not a \"web-based\" VPN shown as a web page such as Citrix or Terminal Services Web access; the program is installed independently and configured by editing text files manually, rather than through a GUI-based wizard. OpenVPN is not compatible with VPN clients that use the IPsec over L2TP or PPTP protocols. The entire package consists of one binary for both client and server connections, an optional configuration file, and one or more key files depending on the authentication method used.\n\n\n*** Firmware implementations ***\nOpenVPN has been integrated into several router firmware packages allowing users to run OpenVPN in client or server mode from their network routers. A router running OpenVPN in client mode, for example, allows any device on a network to access a VPN without needing the capability to install OpenVPN.\nNotable firmware packages with OpenVPN integration include:\n\nOpenVPN has also been implemented in some manufacturer router firmware.\n\n\n*** Software implementations ***\nOpenVPN has been integrated into SoftEther VPN, an open-source multi-protocol VPN server, to allow users to connect to the VPN server from existing OpenVPN clients.\nOpenVPN is also integrated into Vyos, an open-source routing operating system forked from the Vyatta software router.\n\n== Licensing ==\nOpenVPN is available in two versions:\n\nOpenVPN Community Edition, which is a free and open-source version\nOpenVPN Access Server (OpenVPN-AS) is based on the Community Edition, but provides additional paid and proprietary features like LDAP integration, SMB server, Web UI management and provides a set of installation and configuration tools that are reported to simplify the rapid deployment of a VPN remote-access solution. The Access Server edition relies heavily on iptables for load balancing and it has never been available on Windows for this reason. This version is also able to dynamically create client (\"OpenVPN Connect\") installers, which include a client profile for connecting to a particular Access Server instance. However, the user does not need to have an Access Server client in order to connect to the Access Server instance; the client from the OpenVPN Community Edition can be used.\n\nAnswer these questions based on the above context: What encryption library does OpenVPN use for providing encryption of both data and control channels?Q: How does OpenVPN authenticate peers with each other?Q: What protocols does OpenVPN support for networking?Q: Does OpenVPN support IPv6?Q: How does OpenVPN handle network address translation (NAT) and firewalls?Q: What security features does OpenVPN offer to prevent sensitive data from being swapped to disk?Q: Does OpenVPN support IKE, IPsec, L2TP or PPTP?Q: Can OpenVPN be extended with third-party plug-ins or scripts?Q: What operating systems is OpenVPN available on?Q: Is OpenVPN compatible with mobile phone OSes?Q: How many binary files does OpenVPN consist of?Q: Does OpenVPN support IPSec over L2TP or PPTP protocols?Q: What are the two versions of OpenVPN available?Q: What are some features of the OpenVPN Access Server (OpenVPN-AS) edition?Q: What is the official IANA assigned port number for OpenVPN?",

    "instruction": "Context: Credential Management\n\n==Introduction==\nCredential Management, also referred to as a Credential Management System (CMS), is an established form of software that is used for issuing and managing credentials as part of public key infrastructure (PKI). \nCMS software is used by governments and enterprises issuing strong two-factor authentication (2FA) to employees and citizens. The CMS integrates with the components of PKI to provide one joined-up solution for IT departments to issue and manage credentials to a wide selection of devices, including smart cards, USB keys, smartphones, laptops and desktop computers.Credential Management is also a proposed application programming interface (API) under development by the World Wide Web Consortium for standardizing aspects of how password managers used by web user agents (web browsers and other applications) create, store, use, and modify username and password combinations for logins, in addition to the management of \"federated\" credentials (such as single sign-on tokens) by user agents. The API is being developed by the W3C's Web Application Security Working Group, and has been in Working Draft status since April 2016. It is a Recommendation-track proposal, expected to become an accepted standard, but may undergo significant changes before that occurs. The Credential Management API has already been extended by the WebAuthn (Web Authentication) proposal, which reached Candidate Recommendation status in April 2018 and adds the ability to handle public-key authentication.It is common for modern web browsers to be able store and automatically enter usernames and passwords for website logins, though they have often used suboptimal heuristics for guessing which form fields and data are supposed to be filled/stored, resulting in inconsistent and sometimes faulty behavior. Browsers can also have trouble filling in login forms for federated identities, such as when a user connecting to a website uses an account for a third-party web service (like Facebook, Google, or Twitter) to authenticate and provide identity information. The Credential Management specification also aims to streamline the process of changing passwords so that the locally stored password on the client can be updated at the same time it is modified on the server.\nGoogle Chrome has included some support for Credential Management since version 51, released in May 2016, and Opera has included support since version 44, released in April 2017. Mozilla Firefox includes a subset of the API to support WebAuthn since version 60, released in May 2018.\n\n\n\n== API ==\nAs of the August 2017 working draft, user agents supporting the Credential Management API must implement a \"credential store\" for persistent storage of credential objects, and should also include a \"credential chooser\" to allow users to interact with the objects and allow or deny their use for logins. Credentials will ideally have a name and favicon associated with them, perhaps along with other related information, to help distinguish which website or service they are used for, as well as the ability to differentiate credentials for multiple accounts on the same site.\nThe API defines four main JavaScript methods, which expose the CredentialsContainer interface: navigator.credentials.create(), navigator.credentials.store(), navigator.credentials.get(), and navigator.credentials.preventSilentAccess(). It also specifies the top-level Credential interface object, with descendant PasswordCredential and FederatedCredential object types. (WebAuthn also defines a PublicKeyCredential interface object.) The API is only available when a user agent is connected to a secure (HTTPS) website. Browsers can still implement auto-filling of login information on non-secure sites, but must not allow such sites to benefit from the automation that the API provides, since it could lead to accidental exposure of passwords or other credentials. In addition, API access is only allowed in top-level windows, and not within <iframe> elements or other nested browsing contexts.\nThe navigator.credentials.create() method is used for constructing credential objects in memory, and store() triggers writing an object to the credential store following a successful login. get() requests potentially relevant credentials from storage, which may be presented to the user in a credential chooser. When retrieval requests are made, user agents are required to prompt the user for authorization by default, though the user interface can allow a flag to be set that allows \"silent\" authorization without presenting a prompt. A website can reset that flag with the preventSilentAccess() method, recommended for use when logging out.\n\nQuestions:\nHow does Credential Management software integrate with public key infrastructure (PKI)?Question: What is the role of the Credential Management API in managing password managers used by web user agents?Question: How does the Credential Management specification aim to streamline the process of changing passwords?Question: What are some of the limitations of modern web browsers in storing and automatically entering usernames and passwords for website logins?Question: What are the main JavaScript methods defined in the Credential Management API?Question: What is the purpose of the \"credential store\" in the Credential Management API?Question: What is the purpose of the \"credential chooser\" in the Credential Management API?Question: What is the top-level Credential interface object defined in the Credential Management API?Question: Under what conditions is the Credential Management API available for use in web browsers?Question: How do user agents handle retrieval requests for potentially relevant credentials from storage in the Credential Management API?Question: What is the purpose of the navigator.credentials.create() method in the Credential Management API?Question: What is the purpose of the store() method in the Credential Management API?Question: What is the purpose of the preventSilentAccess() method in the Credential Management API?Question: How does the Credential Management API handle the management of federated credentials such as single sign-on tokens?Question: How does the Credential Management API handle the management of username and password combinations for logins?Question: How does the Credential Management API handle the management of public-key authentication?Question: How does the Credential Management API handle the management of credentials for multiple accounts on the same site?Question: How does the Credential Management API handle the management of credentials for different types of devices?\n\nAnswers:\n",

    "instruction": "Cyclops Blink\n\n==Introduction==\nCyclops Blink is malware that targets routers and firewall devices from WatchGuard and ASUS and adds them to a botnet for command and control (C&C).  \nInfection is through an exploit with the code CVE-2022-23176, which allows a privilege escalation to obtain management ability on the device.  After a device has been infected, it acts as a command and control server, and its software design allows for further modules to be installed and be resilient to firmware upgrades. \nCyclops Blink was first reported on in February of 2022 after security advisories published by the United Kingdom's National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC) and the United States' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) detailed its presence in the wild. According to those agencies, the malware originates from the hacker group Sandworm, a team within the GRU, a military intelligence unit of the Russian Federation. \nThe malware has drawn comparison to the earlier VPNFilter based on the shared origin and its similar operation of attacking network devices.

After a device has been infected, it acts as a command and control server, and its software design allows for further modules to be installed and be resilient to firmware upgrades. \nCyclops Blink was first reported on in February of 2022 after security advisories published by the United Kingdom's National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC) and the United States' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) detailed its presence in the wild. According to those agencies, the malware originates from the hacker group Sandworm, a team within the GRU, a military intelligence unit of the Russian Federation. \nThe malware has drawn comparison to the earlier VPNFilter based on the shared origin and its similar operation of attacking network devices. According to the cyber security firm Trend Micro Inc., the malware has been around since at least June 2019. Thousands of routers were cleaned.

    "instruction": "YubiKey\n\n==Introduction==\nThe YubiKey is a hardware authentication device manufactured by Yubico to protect access to computers, networks, and online services that supports one-time passwords (OTP), public-key cryptography, and authentication, and the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) and FIDO2 protocols developed by the FIDO Alliance. It allows users to securely log into their accounts by emitting one-time passwords or using a FIDO-based public/private key pair generated by the device. YubiKey also allows for storing static passwords for use at sites that do not support one-time passwords. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Twitter, and Facebook use YubiKey devices to secure employee accounts as well as end user accounts.  Some password managers support YubiKey. Yubico also manufactures the Security Key, a similar lower cost device with only FIDO2/WebAuthn and FIDO/U2F support.The YubiKey implements the HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm (HOTP) and the Time-based One-time Password Algorithm (TOTP), and identifies itself as a keyboard that delivers the one-time password over the USB HID protocol. A YubiKey can also present itself as an OpenPGP card using 1024, 2048, 3072 and 4096-bit RSA (for key sizes over 2048 bits, GnuPG version 2.0 or higher is required) and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) p256, p384 and more depending on version, allowing users to sign, encrypt and decrypt messages without exposing the private keys to the outside world. Also supported is the PKCS#11 standard to emulate a PIV smart card. This feature allows for code signing of Docker images as well as certificate-based authentication for Microsoft Active Directory and SSH.Founded in 2007 by CEO Stina Ehrensv\u00e4rd, Yubico is a private company with offices in Palo Alto, Seattle, and Stockholm. Yubico CTO, Jakob Ehrensv\u00e4rd, is the lead author of the original strong authentication specification that became known as Universal 2nd Factor (U2F).YubiKey released the YubiKey 5 series in 2018 which adds support for FIDO2.\n\n\n\n== Product features ==\nA list of the primary features and capabilities of the YubiKey products.\n\n== ModHex ==\nWhen being used for one-time passwords and stored static passwords, the YubiKey emits characters using a modified hexadecimal alphabet which is intended to be as independent of system keyboard settings as possible. This alphabet is referred to as ModHex and consists of the characters \"cbdefghijklnrtuv\", corresponding to the hexadecimal digits \"0123456789abcdef\".Since YubiKeys use raw keyboard scan codes in USB HID mode, there can be problems when using the devices on computers that are set up with different keyboard layouts, such as Dvorak. This issue can be addressed by using operating system features to temporarily switch to a standard US keyboard layout (or similar) when using one-time passwords.  However, YubiKey Neo and later devices can be configured with alternate scan codes to match layouts that aren't compatible with the ModHex character set.U2F authentication in YubiKeys and Security Keys bypasses this problem by using the alternate U2FHID protocol, which sends and receives raw binary messages instead of keyboard scan codes. CCID mode acts as a smart card reader, which does not use HID protocols at all.\n\n== Security issues ==\n\n\n*** YubiKey 4 closed-sourcing concerns ***\nMost of the code that runs on a YubiKey is closed source. While Yubico has released some code for industry standard functionality like PGP and HOTP it was disclosed that as of the 4th generation of the product this is not the same code that the new units ship with. Because new units are permanently firmware locked at the factory it is not possible to compile the open source code and load it on the device manually, a user must trust that the code on a new key is authentic and secure.\nCode for other functionality such as U2F, PIV and Modhex is entirely closed source.\nOn May 16, 2016, Yubico CTO Jakob Ehrensv\u00e4rd responded to the open-source community's concerns with a blog post saying that \"we, as a product company, have taken a clear stand against implementations based on off-the-shelf components and further believe that something like a commercial-grade AVR or ARM controller is unfit to be used in a security product.\"Techdirt founder Mike Masnick strongly criticized this decision, saying \"Encryption is tricky. There are almost always vulnerabilities and bugs -- a point we've been making a lot lately. But the best way to fix those tends to be getting as many knowledgeable eyes on the code as possible. And that's not possible when it's closed source.\"\n\n\n*** ROCA vulnerability in certain YubiKey 4, 4C, and 4 Nano devices ***\nIn October 2017, security researchers found a vulnerability (known as ROCA) in the implementation of RSA keypair generation in a cryptographic library used by a large number of Infineon security chips, as used in a wide range of security keys and security token products (including YubiKey). The vulnerability allows an attacker to reconstruct the private key by using the public key. All YubiKey 4, YubiKey 4C, and YubiKey 4 Nano devices within the revisions 4.2.6 to 4.3.4 were affected by this vulnerability. Yubico remedied this issue in all shipping YubiKey 4 devices by switching to a different key generation function and offered free replacements for any affected keys. The replacement offer ended on March 31, 2019. In some cases the issue can be bypassed by generating new keys outside of the YubiKey and importing them onto the device.\n\n\n*** OTP Password Protection on YubiKey NEO ***\nIn January 2018, Yubico disclosed a moderate vulnerability where password protection for the OTP functionality on the YubiKey NEO could be bypassed under certain conditions. The issue was corrected as of firmware version 3.5.0 and Yubico offered free replacement keys to any user claiming to be affected.\n\n\n*** Reduced initial randomness on certain FIPS series devices ***\nIn June 2019, Yubico released a security advisory reporting reduced randomness in FIPS-certified devices with firmware version 4.4.2 and 4.4.4 (there is no version 4.4.3), shortly after power-up. Security keys with reduced randomness may leave keys more easily discovered and compromised than expected. The issue affected the FIPS series only, and then only certain scenarios, although FIPS ECDSA usage was \"at higher risk\". The company offered free replacements for any affected keys.\n\n== Social activism ==\nYubico provided 500 YubiKeys to protesters during the 2019\u20132020 Hong Kong protests. The company states the decision is based on their mission to protect vulnerable Internet users, and works with free speech supporters.\n\nAnswer these questions based on the above context: How does the YubiKey protect access to online services and networks?Question: What is the difference between a YubiKey and a Security Key?Question: How does the YubiKey implement the ModHex character set?Question: How does Yubico address the issue of using the YubiKey on computers with different keyboard layouts?Question: What is the commercial-grade AVR or ARM controller that Yubico refers to in their blog post?Question: How did the ROCA vulnerability affect certain YubiKey 4 devices?Question: How did Yubico remedy the ROCA vulnerability?Question: What is the moderate vulnerability that was disclosed on the YubiKey NEO in January 2018?Question: How did Yubico address the moderate vulnerability on the YubiKey NEO?Question: What is the security advisory that Yubico released in June 2019?Question: How did Yubico address the reduced randomness in FIPS-certified devices?Question: Why did Yubico provide 500 YubiKeys to protesters during the 2019-2020 Hong Kong protests?Question: What is the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) protocol?Question: What is FIDO2?Question: What is the HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm (HOTP)?",

    "instruction": "Scrambler\n\n==Introduction==\nIn telecommunications, a scrambler is a device that transposes or inverts signals or otherwise encodes a message at the sender's side to make the message unintelligible at a receiver not equipped with an appropriately set descrambling device. Whereas encryption usually refers to operations carried out in the digital domain, scrambling usually refers to operations carried out in the analog domain. Scrambling is accomplished by the addition of components to the original signal or the changing of some important component of the original signal in order to make extraction of the original signal difficult. Examples of the latter might include removing or changing vertical or horizontal sync pulses in television signals; televisions will not be able to display a picture from such a signal.  Some modern scramblers are actually encryption devices, the name remaining due to the similarities in use, as opposed to internal operation.\nIn telecommunications and recording, a scrambler (also referred to as a randomizer) is a device that manipulates a data stream before transmitting. The manipulations are reversed by a descrambler at the receiving side. Scrambling is widely used in satellite, radio relay communications and PSTN modems. A scrambler can be placed just before a FEC coder, or it can be placed after the FEC, just before the modulation or line code. A scrambler in this context has nothing to do with encrypting, as the intent is not to render the message unintelligible, but to give the transmitted data useful engineering properties.\nA scrambler replaces sequences (referred to as whitening sequences) with other sequences without removing undesirable sequences, and as a result it changes the probability of occurrence of vexatious sequences. Clearly it is not foolproof as there are input sequences that yield all-zeros, all-ones, or other undesirable periodic output sequences. A scrambler is therefore not a good substitute for a line code, which, through a coding step, removes unwanted sequences.\n\n== Purposes of scrambling ==\nA scrambler (or randomizer) can be either:\n\nAn algorithm that converts an input string into a seemingly random output string of the same length (e.g., by pseudo-randomly selecting bits to invert), thus avoiding long sequences of bits of the same value; in this context, a randomizer is also referred to as a scrambler.\nAn analog or digital source of unpredictable (i.e., high entropy), unbiased, and usually independent (i.e., random) output bits. A \"truly\" random generator may be used to feed a (more practical) deterministic pseudo-random random number generator, which extends the random seed value.There are two main reasons why scrambling is used:\n\nTo enable accurate timing recovery on receiver equipment without resorting to redundant line coding.  It facilitates the work of a timing recovery circuit (see also clock recovery), an automatic gain control and other adaptive circuits of the receiver (eliminating long sequences consisting of '0' or '1' only).\nFor energy dispersal on the carrier, reducing inter-carrier signal interference.  It eliminates the dependence of a signal's power spectrum upon the actual transmitted data, making it more dispersed to meet maximum power spectral density requirements (because if the power is concentrated in a narrow frequency band, it can interfere with adjacent channels due to the intermodulation (also known as cross-modulation) caused by non-linearities of the receiving tract).Scramblers are essential components of physical layer system standards besides interleaved coding and modulation. They are usually defined based on linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs) due to their good statistical properties and ease of implementation in hardware.\nIt is common for physical layer standards bodies to refer to lower-layer (physical layer and link layer) encryption as scrambling as well. This may well be because (traditional) mechanisms employed are based on feedback shift registers as well.\nSome standards for digital television, such as DVB-CA and MPE, refer to encryption at the link layer as scrambling.\n\n== Types of scramblers ==\n\n\n*** Additive (synchronous) scramblers ***\n\nAdditive scramblers (they are also referred to as synchronous) transform the input data stream by applying a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) (by modulo-two addition). Sometimes a pre-calculated PRBS stored in the read-only memory is used, but more often it is generated by a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR).\nIn order to assure a synchronous operation of the transmitting and receiving LFSR (that is, scrambler and descrambler), a sync-word must be used.\nA sync-word is a pattern that is placed in the data stream through equal intervals (that is, in each frame). A receiver searches for a few sync-words in adjacent frames and hence determines the place when its LFSR must be reloaded with a pre-defined initial state.\nThe additive descrambler is just the same device as the additive scrambler.\nAdditive scrambler/descrambler is defined by the polynomial of its LFSR (for the scrambler on the picture above, it is \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        +\n        \n          z\n          \n            \u2212\n            14\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          z\n          \n            \u2212\n            15\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1+z^{-14}+z^{-15}}\n  ) and its initial state.\n\n\n*** Multiplicative (self-synchronizing) scramblers ***\n\nMultiplicative scramblers (also known as feed-through) are called so because they perform a multiplication of the input signal by the scrambler's transfer function in Z-space. They are discrete linear time-invariant systems.\nA multiplicative scrambler is recursive, and a multiplicative descrambler is non-recursive. Unlike additive scramblers, multiplicative scramblers do not need the frame synchronization, that is why they are also called self-synchronizing. Multiplicative scrambler/descrambler is defined similarly by a polynomial (for the scrambler on the picture it is \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        +\n        \n          z\n          \n            \u2212\n            18\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          z\n          \n            \u2212\n            23\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1+z^{-18}+z^{-23}}\n  ), which is also a transfer function of the descrambler.\n\n\n*** Comparison of scramblers ***\nScramblers have certain drawbacks: \n\nBoth types may fail to generate random sequences under worst-case input conditions.\nMultiplicative scramblers lead to error multiplication during descrambling (i.e. a single-bit error at the descrambler's input will result in w errors at its output, where w equals the number of the scrambler's feedback taps).\nAdditive scramblers must be reset by the frame sync; if this fails, massive error propagation will result, as a complete frame cannot be descrambled. (Alternatively if you know what was sent, the scrambler can be synchronized)\nThe effective length of the random sequence of an additive scrambler is limited by the frame length, which is normally much shorter than the period of the PRBS. By adding frame numbers to the frame sync, it is possible to extend the length of the random sequence, by varying the random sequence in accordance with the frame number.\n\n== Noise ==\nThe first voice scramblers were invented at Bell Labs in the period just before World War II. These sets consisted of electronics that could mix two signals or alternatively \"subtract\" one signal back out again. The two signals were provided by a telephone and a record player. A matching pair of records was produced, each containing the same recording of noise. The recording was played into the telephone, and the mixed signal was sent over the wire. The noise was then subtracted out at the far end using the matching record, leaving the original voice signal intact. Eavesdroppers would hear only the noisy signal, unable to understand the voice.\nOne of those, used (among other duties) for telephone conversations between Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt was intercepted and unscrambled by the Germans. At least one German engineer had worked at Bell Labs before the war and came up with a way to break them. Later versions were sufficiently different that the German team was unable to unscramble them. Early versions were known as \"A-3\" (from AT&T Corporation). An unrelated device called SIGSALY was used for higher-level voice communications.\nThe noise was provided on large shellac phonograph records made in pairs, shipped as needed, and destroyed after use. This worked, but was enormously awkward. Just achieving synchronization of the two records proved difficult. Post-war electronics made such systems much easier to work with by creating pseudo-random noise based on a short input tone. In use, the caller would play a tone into the phone, and both scrambler units would then listen to the signal and synchronize to it. This provided limited security, however, as any listener with a basic knowledge of the electronic circuitry could often produce a machine of similar-enough settings to break into the communications.\n\n== Cryptographic ==\nIt was the need to synchronize the scramblers that suggested to James H. Ellis the idea for non-secret encryption, which ultimately led to the invention of both the RSA encryption algorithm and Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange well before either was reinvented publicly by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, or by Diffie and Hellman.\nThe latest scramblers are not scramblers in the truest sense of the word, but rather digitizers combined with encryption machines. In these systems the original signal is first converted into digital form, and then the digital data is encrypted and sent. Using modern public-key systems, these \"scramblers\" are much more secure than their earlier analog counterparts. Only these types of systems are considered secure enough for sensitive data.\nVoice inversion scrambling can be as simple as inverting the frequency bands around a static point to various complex methods of changing the inversion point randomly and in real time and using multiple bands.\nThe \"scramblers\" used in cable television are designed to prevent casual signal theft, not to provide any real security. Early versions of these devices simply \"inverted\" one important component of the TV signal, re-inverting it at the client end for display.

      "context": "Scrambler\n\n==Introduction==\nIn telecommunications, a scrambler is a device that transposes or inverts signals or otherwise encodes a message at the sender's side to make the message unintelligible at a receiver not equipped with an appropriately set descrambling device. Whereas encryption usually refers to operations carried out in the digital domain, scrambling usually refers to operations carried out in the analog domain. Scrambling is accomplished by the addition of components to the original signal or the changing of some important component of the original signal in order to make extraction of the original signal difficult. Examples of the latter might include removing or changing vertical or horizontal sync pulses in television signals; televisions will not be able to display a picture from such a signal.  Some modern scramblers are actually encryption devices, the name remaining due to the similarities in use, as opposed to internal operation.\nIn telecommunications and recording, a scrambler (also referred to as a randomizer) is a device that manipulates a data stream before transmitting. The manipulations are reversed by a descrambler at the receiving side. Scrambling is widely used in satellite, radio relay communications and PSTN modems. A scrambler can be placed just before a FEC coder, or it can be placed after the FEC, just before the modulation or line code. A scrambler in this context has nothing to do with encrypting, as the intent is not to render the message unintelligible, but to give the transmitted data useful engineering properties.\nA scrambler replaces sequences (referred to as whitening sequences) with other sequences without removing undesirable sequences, and as a result it changes the probability of occurrence of vexatious sequences. Clearly it is not foolproof as there are input sequences that yield all-zeros, all-ones, or other undesirable periodic output sequences. A scrambler is therefore not a good substitute for a line code, which, through a coding step, removes unwanted sequences.\n\n== Purposes of scrambling ==\nA scrambler (or randomizer) can be either:\n\nAn algorithm that converts an input string into a seemingly random output string of the same length (e.g., by pseudo-randomly selecting bits to invert), thus avoiding long sequences of bits of the same value; in this context, a randomizer is also referred to as a scrambler.\nAn analog or digital source of unpredictable (i.e., high entropy), unbiased, and usually independent (i.e., random) output bits. A \"truly\" random generator may be used to feed a (more practical) deterministic pseudo-random random number generator, which extends the random seed value.There are two main reasons why scrambling is used:\n\nTo enable accurate timing recovery on receiver equipment without resorting to redundant line coding.  It facilitates the work of a timing recovery circuit (see also clock recovery), an automatic gain control and other adaptive circuits of the receiver (eliminating long sequences consisting of '0' or '1' only).\nFor energy dispersal on the carrier, reducing inter-carrier signal interference.  It eliminates the dependence of a signal's power spectrum upon the actual transmitted data, making it more dispersed to meet maximum power spectral density requirements (because if the power is concentrated in a narrow frequency band, it can interfere with adjacent channels due to the intermodulation (also known as cross-modulation) caused by non-linearities of the receiving tract).Scramblers are essential components of physical layer system standards besides interleaved coding and modulation. They are usually defined based on linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs) due to their good statistical properties and ease of implementation in hardware.\nIt is common for physical layer standards bodies to refer to lower-layer (physical layer and link layer) encryption as scrambling as well. This may well be because (traditional) mechanisms employed are based on feedback shift registers as well.\nSome standards for digital television, such as DVB-CA and MPE, refer to encryption at the link layer as scrambling.\n\n== Types of scramblers ==\n\n\n*** Additive (synchronous) scramblers ***\n\nAdditive scramblers (they are also referred to as synchronous) transform the input data stream by applying a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) (by modulo-two addition). Sometimes a pre-calculated PRBS stored in the read-only memory is used, but more often it is generated by a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR).\nIn order to assure a synchronous operation of the transmitting and receiving LFSR (that is, scrambler and descrambler), a sync-word must be used.\nA sync-word is a pattern that is placed in the data stream through equal intervals (that is, in each frame). A receiver searches for a few sync-words in adjacent frames and hence determines the place when its LFSR must be reloaded with a pre-defined initial state.\nThe additive descrambler is just the same device as the additive scrambler.\nAdditive scrambler/descrambler is defined by the polynomial of its LFSR (for the scrambler on the picture above, it is \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        +\n        \n          z\n          \n            \u2212\n            14\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          z\n          \n            \u2212\n            15\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1+z^{-14}+z^{-15}}\n  ) and its initial state.\n\n\n*** Multiplicative (self-synchronizing) scramblers ***\n\nMultiplicative scramblers (also known as feed-through) are called so because they perform a multiplication of the input signal by the scrambler's transfer function in Z-space. They are discrete linear time-invariant systems.\nA multiplicative scrambler is recursive, and a multiplicative descrambler is non-recursive. Unlike additive scramblers, multiplicative scramblers do not need the frame synchronization, that is why they are also called self-synchronizing. Multiplicative scrambler/descrambler is defined similarly by a polynomial (for the scrambler on the picture it is \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        +\n        \n          z\n          \n            \u2212\n            18\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          z\n          \n            \u2212\n            23\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1+z^{-18}+z^{-23}}\n  ), which is also a transfer function of the descrambler.\n\n\n*** Comparison of scramblers ***\nScramblers have certain drawbacks: \n\nBoth types may fail to generate random sequences under worst-case input conditions.\nMultiplicative scramblers lead to error multiplication during descrambling (i.e. a single-bit error at the descrambler's input will result in w errors at its output, where w equals the number of the scrambler's feedback taps).\nAdditive scramblers must be reset by the frame sync; if this fails, massive error propagation will result, as a complete frame cannot be descrambled.

    "instruction": "Comparison of privilege authorization features\n\n==Introduction==\nA number of computer operating systems employ security features to help prevent malicious software from gaining sufficient privileges to compromise the computer system. Operating systems lacking such features, such as DOS, Windows implementations prior to Windows NT (and its descendants), CP/M-80, and all Mac operating systems prior to Mac OS X, had only one category of user who was allowed to do anything. With separate execution contexts it is possible for multiple users to store private files, for multiple users to use a computer at the same time, to protect the system against malicious users, and to protect the system against malicious programs. The first multi-user secure system was Multics, which began development in the 1960s; it wasn't until UNIX, BSD, Linux, and NT in the late 80s and early 90s that multi-tasking security contexts were brought to x86 consumer machines.\n\n== Introduction to implementations ==\nMicrosoft WindowsMac OSUnix and Unix-like\n\n== Security considerations ==\n\n\n*** Falsified/intercepted user input ***\nA major security consideration is the ability of malicious applications to simulate keystrokes or mouse clicks, thus tricking or spoofing the security feature into granting malicious applications higher privileges.\n\nUsing a terminal based client (standalone or within a desktop/GUI): su and sudo run in the terminal, where they are vulnerable to spoofed input. Of course, if the user was not running a multitasking environment (i.e. a single user in the shell only), this would not be a problem. Terminal windows are usually rendered as ordinary windows to the user, therefore on an intelligent client or desktop system used as a client, the user must take responsibility for preventing other malware on their desktop from manipulating, simulating, or capturing input.\nUsing a GUI/desktop tightly integrated to the operating system: Commonly, the desktop system locks or secures all common means of input, before requesting passwords or other authentication, so that they cannot be intercepted, manipulated, or simulated:PolicyKit (GNOME - directs the X server to capture all keyboard and mouse input. Other desktop environments using PolicyKit may use their own mechanisms.\ngksudo - by default \"locks\" the keyboard, mouse, and window focus, preventing anything but the actual user from inputting the password or otherwise interfering with the confirmation dialog.\nUAC (Windows) - by default runs in the Secure Desktop, preventing malicious applications from simulating clicking the \"Allow\" button or otherwise interfering with the confirmation dialog.  In this mode, the user's desktop appears dimmed and cannot be interacted with.\nIf either gksudo's \"lock\" feature or UAC's Secure Desktop were compromised or disabled, malicious applications could gain administrator privileges by using keystroke logging to record the administrator's password; or, in the case of UAC if running as an administrator, spoofing a mouse click on the \"Allow\" button. For this reason, voice recognition is also prohibited from interacting with the dialog. Note that since gksu password prompt runs without special privileges, malicious applications can still do keystroke logging using e.g. the strace tool. (ptrace was restricted in later kernel versions)\n\n\n*** Fake authentication dialogs ***\nAnother security consideration is the ability of malicious software to spoof dialogs that look like legitimate security confirmation requests. If the user were to input credentials into a fake dialog, thinking the dialog was legitimate, the malicious software would then know the user's password. If the Secure Desktop or similar feature were disabled, the malicious software could use that password to gain higher privileges.\n\nThough it is not the default behavior for usability reasons, UAC may be configured to require the user to press Ctrl+Alt+Del (known as the secure attention sequence) as part of the authentication process. Because only Windows can detect this key combination, requiring this additional security measure would prevent spoofed dialogs from behaving the same way as a legitimate dialog. For example, a spoofed dialog might not ask the user to press Ctrl+Alt+Del, and the user could realize that the dialog was fake. Or, when the user did press Ctrl+Alt+Del, the user would be brought to the screen Ctrl+Alt+Del normally brings them to instead of a UAC confirmation dialog. Thus the user could tell whether the dialog was an attempt to trick them into providing their password to a piece of malicious software.\nIn GNOME, PolicyKit uses different dialogs, depending on the configuration of the system. For example, the authentication dialog for a system equipped with a fingerprint reader might look different from an authentication dialog for a system without one. Applications do not have access to the configuration of PolicyKit, so they have no way of knowing which dialog will appear and thus how to spoof it.\n\n== Usability considerations ==\nAnother consideration that has gone into these implementations is usability.\n\n\n*** Separate administrator account ***\nsu require the user to know the password to at least two accounts: the regular-use account, and an account with higher privileges such as root.\nsudo, kdesu and gksudo use a simpler approach. With these programs, the user is pre-configured to be granted access to specific administrative tasks, but must explicitly authorize applications to run with those privileges.  The user enters their own password instead of that of the superuser or some another account.\nUAC and Authenticate combine these two ideas into one. With these programs, administrators explicitly authorize programs to run with higher privileges. Non-administrators are prompted for an administrator username and password.\nPolicyKit can be configured to adopt any of these approaches. In practice, the distribution will choose one.\n\n\n*** Simplicity of dialog ***\nIn order to grant an application administrative privileges, sudo, gksudo, and Authenticate prompt administrators to re-enter their password.\nWith UAC, when logged in as a standard user, the user must enter an administrator's name and password each time they need to grant an application elevated privileges; but when logged in as a member of the Administrators group, they (by default) simply confirm or deny, instead of re-entering their password each time (though that is an option). While the default approach is simpler, it is also less secure, since if the user physically walks away from the computer without locking it, another person could walk up and have administrator privileges over the system.\nPolicyKit requires the user to re-enter his or her password or provide some other means of authentication (e.g. fingerprint).\n\n\n*** Saving credentials ***\nUAC prompts for authorization each time it is called to elevate a program.\nsudo, gksudo, and kdesu do not ask the user to re-enter their password every time it is called to elevate a program. Rather, the user is asked for their password once at the start. If the user has not used their administrative privileges for a certain period of time (sudo's default is 5 minutes), the user is once again restricted to standard user privileges until they enter their password again.sudo's approach is a trade-off between security and usability. On one hand, a user only has to enter their password once to perform a series of administrator tasks, rather than having to enter their password for each task. But at the same time, the surface area for attack is larger because all programs that run in that tty (for sudo) or all programs not running in a terminal (for gksudo and kdesu) prefixed by either of those commands before the timeout receive administrator privileges. Security-conscious users may remove the temporary administrator privileges upon completing the tasks requiring them by using the sudo -k command when from each tty or pts in which sudo was used (in the case of pts's, closing the terminal emulator is not sufficient).  The equivalent command for kdesu is kdesu -s.  There is no gksudo option to do the same; however, running sudo -k not within a terminal instance (e.g. through the Alt + F2 \"Run Application\" dialogue box, unticking \"Run in terminal\") will have the desired effect.Authenticate does not save passwords. If the user is a standard user, they must enter a username and a password. If the user is an administrator, the current user's name is already filled in, and only needs to enter their password. The name can still be modified to run as another user.The application only requires authentication once, and is requested at the time the application needs the privilege. Once \"elevated\", the application does not need to authenticate again until the application has been Quit and relaunched.However, there are varying levels of authentication, known as Rights. The right that is requested can be shown by expanding the triangle next to \"details\", underneath the password. Normally, applications use system.privilege.admin, but another may be used, such as a lower right for security, or a higher right if higher access is needed. If the right the application has is not suitable for a task, the application may need to authenticate again to increase the privilege level.PolicyKit can be configured to adopt either of these approaches.\n\n== Identifying when administrative rights are needed ==\nIn order for an operating system to know when to prompt the user for authorization, an application or action needs to identify itself as requiring elevated privileges. While it is technically possible for the user to be prompted at the exact moment that an operation requiring such privileges is executed, it is often not ideal to ask for privileges partway through completing a task.  If the user were unable to provide proper credentials, the work done before requiring administrator privileges would have to be undone because the task could not be seen through to the end.\nIn the case of user interfaces such as the Control Panel in Microsoft Windows, and the Preferences panels in Mac OS X, the exact privilege requirements are hard-coded into the system so that the user is presented with an authorization dialog at an appropriate time (for example, before displaying information that only administrators should see). Different operating systems offer distinct methods for applications to identify their security requirements:\n\nsudo centralizes all privilege authorization information in a single configuration file, /etc/sudoers, which contains a list of users and the privileged applications and actions that those users are permitted to use.  The grammar of the sudoers file is intended to be flexible enough to cover many different scenarios, such as placing restrictions on command-line parameters.  For example, a user can be granted access to change anybody's password except for the root account, as follows: pete    ALL\n\nBased on the above text, answer the questions.

      "context": "Comparison of privilege authorization features\n\n==Introduction==\nA number of computer operating systems employ security features to help prevent malicious software from gaining sufficient privileges to compromise the computer system. Operating systems lacking such features, such as DOS, Windows implementations prior to Windows NT (and its descendants), CP/M-80, and all Mac operating systems prior to Mac OS X, had only one category of user who was allowed to do anything. With separate execution contexts it is possible for multiple users to store private files, for multiple users to use a computer at the same time, to protect the system against malicious users, and to protect the system against malicious programs. The first multi-user secure system was Multics, which began development in the 1960s; it wasn't until UNIX, BSD, Linux, and NT in the late 80s and early 90s that multi-tasking security contexts were brought to x86 consumer machines.\n\n== Introduction to implementations ==\nMicrosoft WindowsMac OSUnix and Unix-like\n\n== Security considerations ==\n\n\n*** Falsified/intercepted user input ***\nA major security consideration is the ability of malicious applications to simulate keystrokes or mouse clicks, thus tricking or spoofing the security feature into granting malicious applications higher privileges.\n\nUsing a terminal based client (standalone or within a desktop/GUI): su and sudo run in the terminal, where they are vulnerable to spoofed input. Of course, if the user was not running a multitasking environment (i.e. a single user in the shell only), this would not be a problem. Terminal windows are usually rendered as ordinary windows to the user, therefore on an intelligent client or desktop system used as a client, the user must take responsibility for preventing other malware on their desktop from manipulating, simulating, or capturing input.\nUsing a GUI/desktop tightly integrated to the operating system: Commonly, the desktop system locks or secures all common means of input, before requesting passwords or other authentication, so that they cannot be intercepted, manipulated, or simulated:PolicyKit (GNOME - directs the X server to capture all keyboard and mouse input. Other desktop environments using PolicyKit may use their own mechanisms.\ngksudo - by default \"locks\" the keyboard, mouse, and window focus, preventing anything but the actual user from inputting the password or otherwise interfering with the confirmation dialog.\nUAC (Windows) - by default runs in the Secure Desktop, preventing malicious applications from simulating clicking the \"Allow\" button or otherwise interfering with the confirmation dialog.  In this mode, the user's desktop appears dimmed and cannot be interacted with.\nIf either gksudo's \"lock\" feature or UAC's Secure Desktop were compromised or disabled, malicious applications could gain administrator privileges by using keystroke logging to record the administrator's password; or, in the case of UAC if running as an administrator, spoofing a mouse click on the \"Allow\" button. For this reason, voice recognition is also prohibited from interacting with the dialog. Note that since gksu password prompt runs without special privileges, malicious applications can still do keystroke logging using e.g. the strace tool. (ptrace was restricted in later kernel versions)\n\n\n*** Fake authentication dialogs ***\nAnother security consideration is the ability of malicious software to spoof dialogs that look like legitimate security confirmation requests. If the user were to input credentials into a fake dialog, thinking the dialog was legitimate, the malicious software would then know the user's password. If the Secure Desktop or similar feature were disabled, the malicious software could use that password to gain higher privileges.\n\nThough it is not the default behavior for usability reasons, UAC may be configured to require the user to press Ctrl+Alt+Del (known as the secure attention sequence) as part of the authentication process. Because only Windows can detect this key combination, requiring this additional security measure would prevent spoofed dialogs from behaving the same way as a legitimate dialog. For example, a spoofed dialog might not ask the user to press Ctrl+Alt+Del, and the user could realize that the dialog was fake. Or, when the user did press Ctrl+Alt+Del, the user would be brought to the screen Ctrl+Alt+Del normally brings them to instead of a UAC confirmation dialog. Thus the user could tell whether the dialog was an attempt to trick them into providing their password to a piece of malicious software.\nIn GNOME, PolicyKit uses different dialogs, depending on the configuration of the system. For example, the authentication dialog for a system equipped with a fingerprint reader might look different from an authentication dialog for a system without one. Applications do not have access to the configuration of PolicyKit, so they have no way of knowing which dialog will appear and thus how to spoof it.\n\n== Usability considerations ==\nAnother consideration that has gone into these implementations is usability.\n\n\n*** Separate administrator account ***\nsu require the user to know the password to at least two accounts: the regular-use account, and an account with higher privileges such as root.\nsudo, kdesu and gksudo use a simpler approach. With these programs, the user is pre-configured to be granted access to specific administrative tasks, but must explicitly authorize applications to run with those privileges.  The user enters their own password instead of that of the superuser or some another account.\nUAC and Authenticate combine these two ideas into one. With these programs, administrators explicitly authorize programs to run with higher privileges. Non-administrators are prompted for an administrator username and password.\nPolicyKit can be configured to adopt any of these approaches. In practice, the distribution will choose one.\n\n\n*** Simplicity of dialog ***\nIn order to grant an application administrative privileges, sudo, gksudo, and Authenticate prompt administrators to re-enter their password.\nWith UAC, when logged in as a standard user, the user must enter an administrator's name and password each time they need to grant an application elevated privileges; but when logged in as a member of the Administrators group, they (by default) simply confirm or deny, instead of re-entering their password each time (though that is an option). While the default approach is simpler, it is also less secure, since if the user physically walks away from the computer without locking it, another person could walk up and have administrator privileges over the system.\nPolicyKit requires the user to re-enter his or her password or provide some other means of authentication (e.g. fingerprint).\n\n\n*** Saving credentials ***\nUAC prompts for authorization each time it is called to elevate a program.\nsudo, gksudo, and kdesu do not ask the user to re-enter their password every time it is called to elevate a program. Rather, the user is asked for their password once at the start. If the user has not used their administrative privileges for a certain period of time (sudo's default is 5 minutes), the user is once again restricted to standard user privileges until they enter their password again.sudo's approach is a trade-off between security and usability. On one hand, a user only has to enter their password once to perform a series of administrator tasks, rather than having to enter their password for each task. But at the same time, the surface area for attack is larger because all programs that run in that tty (for sudo) or all programs not running in a terminal (for gksudo and kdesu) prefixed by either of those commands before the timeout receive administrator privileges. Security-conscious users may remove the temporary administrator privileges upon completing the tasks requiring them by using the sudo -k command when from each tty or pts in which sudo was used (in the case of pts's, closing the terminal emulator is not sufficient).  The equivalent command for kdesu is kdesu -s.  There is no gksudo option to do the same; however, running sudo -k not within a terminal instance (e.g. through the Alt + F2 \"Run Application\" dialogue box, unticking \"Run in terminal\") will have the desired effect.Authenticate does not save passwords. If the user is a standard user, they must enter a username and a password. If the user is an administrator, the current user's name is already filled in, and only needs to enter their password. The name can still be modified to run as another user.The application only requires authentication once, and is requested at the time the application needs the privilege. Once \"elevated\", the application does not need to authenticate again until the application has been Quit and relaunched.However, there are varying levels of authentication, known as Rights. The right that is requested can be shown by expanding the triangle next to \"details\", underneath the password. Normally, applications use system.privilege.admin, but another may be used, such as a lower right for security, or a higher right if higher access is needed. If the right the application has is not suitable for a task, the application may need to authenticate again to increase the privilege level.PolicyKit can be configured to adopt either of these approaches.\n\n== Identifying when administrative rights are needed ==\nIn order for an operating system to know when to prompt the user for authorization, an application or action needs to identify itself as requiring elevated privileges.

      "answers": "Disk encryption provides confidentiality of data on the disk by ensuring that the only information an adversary can determine over time is whether the data in a sector has or has not changed since the last time they looked. This is achieved through the use of cryptographic techniques that prevent the adversary from gaining any other information about the data.a: The three properties that disk encryption methods aim to provide are confidentiality of data on the disk, fast data retrieval and storage operations, and efficient use of disk space.a: The strongest adversaries studied in the field of disk encryption are those who can read the raw contents of the disk at any time, request the disk to encrypt and store arbitrary files of their choosing, and modify unused sectors on the disk and then request their decryption.a: To provide good confidentiality, the encryption method used in disk encryption must ensure that the only information an adversary can determine over time is whether the data in a sector has or has not changed since the last time they looked.a: Disk encryption divides the disk into several sectors, usually 512 bytes (4096 bits) long, which are encrypted and decrypted independently of each other. The encryption method must also be tweakable, so that no two sectors are processed in exactly the same way.a: Stream ciphers are unsuitable for disk encryption because they require that the same initial state not be used twice, which would be the case if a sector is updated with different data. This would require the encryption method to store separate initial states for every sector on disk, which is seen as a waste of space.a: Chaining modes are used in disk encryption to expand the encryption block length to cover a whole disk sector. This is because block ciphers, which are commonly used in disk encryption, are limited to a certain block size.a: Some chaining modes, such as ECB mode and modes that turn block ciphers into stream ciphers, are unsuitable for disk encryption. ECB mode cannot be tweaked, while modes that turn block ciphers into stream ciphers, such as CTR mode, are not suitable for disk encryption.a: Disk encryption does not provide any assurance of disk integrity. This is because an absolute assurance of disk integrity is impossible, as an adversary could always revert the entire disk to a prior state. However, if some non-absolute level of disk integrity is desired, it can be achieved within the encrypted disk on a file-by-file basis using message authentication codes.a: In disk encryption, modes of operation are used to allow encrypting larger amounts of data than the ciphers' block-size (typically 128 bits). They are rules on how to repeatedly apply the ciphers' single-block operations.a: In Cipher-block chaining (CBC), the previous block's ciphertext is xored with the current block's plaintext before encryption.a: The authenticated encryption scheme IAPM provides encryption as well as an authentication tag. The encryption component of the IAPM mode completely describes the LRW and XEX schemes above, and hence XTS without the ciphertext stealing aspect.a: Yes, the encryption component of the IAPM mode is patented. It is described in detail in Figures 8 and 5 of the US patent 6,963,976.a: Chaining modes expand the encryption block length in disk encryption by repeatedly applying the ciphers' single-block operations. This allows encrypting larger amounts of data than the ciphers' block-size.a: Disk encryption provides fast data retrieval and storage operations by dividing the disk into several sectors, usually 512 bytes (4096 bits) long, which are encrypted and decrypted independently of each other. This allows for efficient processing of data, as each sector can be encrypted or decrypted without affecting the other sectors on the disk."

    "output": "The Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI) enables secure communication in a grid computing environment by using asymmetric encryption, which ensures secure and authenticatable communication.A: Digital signature technology is used for authentication in GSI. This technology uses a pair of keys, one public and one private, to verify the identity of a user. The user signs a message with their private key, and the recipient can verify the signature using the user's public key, thus confirming the user's identity.A: Delegation is necessary in GSI because services often need to access resources on behalf of users. This is achieved by creating a new key, marking it as a delegated, and having the user sign it. The service can then use this delegated key to act on behalf of the user and access the required resources.A: GSI ensures the confidentiality of communications in a grid computing environment by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect the communication channel from eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.A: Yes, message-level security can be used in GSI. However, it is currently much slower than TLS. The advantage of message-level security is that it provides an additional layer of security for the message itself, beyond just the communication channel. The disadvantage is that it can have a significant impact on performance.A: GSI prevents unauthorized access to protected resources by using digital signature technology to securely authenticate the identity of users. This allows resources to be locked to only those who should have access to them, ensuring that unauthorized users are unable to access the protected resources.A: The problem of privilege retrieval is addressed in GSI through the use of delegated privileges. A new key is created, marked as a delegated, and signed by the user. This delegated key can then be used by a service to act on behalf of the user and fetch data from the resource, even if the user is not directly involved in the communication.A: Asymmetric encryption is used in GSI to enable secure and authenticatable communication. It uses a pair of keys, one public and one private, to encrypt and decrypt messages. This ensures that only authorized users can access the protected resources, and that all communication is secure and confidential.A: GSI protects against man-in-the-middle attacks by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure the communication channel. TLS uses a combination of public and private key encryption and digital certificate verification to ensure that the communication channel is secure and that the identity of the communicating parties can be verified.A: The integrity of messages is ensured in GSI through the use of digital signatures. A digital signature is a cryptographic technique that verifies both the authenticity and integrity of a message. By signing a message with their private key, a user can ensure that the message has not been tampered with and that it originated from the claimed sender.A: GSI enables secure communication between services in a grid computing environment by using digital signature technology to authenticate the identity of users and by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect the communication channel from eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.A: GSI ensures that only authorized services can access protected resources by using digital signature technology to securely authenticate the identity of users. This allows resources to be locked to only those who should have access to them, ensuring that unauthorized services are unable to access the protected resources.A: GSI enables secure delegation of privileges to services in a grid computing environment by creating a new key, marking it as a delegated, and having the user sign it. The service can then use this delegated key to act on behalf of the user and access the required resources, even if the user is not directly involved in the communication.A: GSI balances security and performance in a grid computing environment by providing a choice of security mechanisms. Transport Layer Security (TLS) can be used to protect the communication channel from eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks, while message-level security provides an additional layer of security for the message itself. However, message-level security can have a significant impact on performance, so it is typically used only when additional security is required.A: GSI prevents unauthorized modification of messages in a grid computing environment by using digital signatures. A digital signature is a cryptographic technique that verifies both the authenticity and integrity of a message. By signing a message with their private key, a user can ensure that the message has not been tampered with and that it originated from the claimed sender.",

      "answers": "The Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI) enables secure communication in a grid computing environment by using asymmetric encryption, which ensures secure and authenticatable communication.A: Digital signature technology is used for authentication in GSI. This technology uses a pair of keys, one public and one private, to verify the identity of a user. The user signs a message with their private key, and the recipient can verify the signature using the user's public key, thus confirming the user's identity.A: Delegation is necessary in GSI because services often need to access resources on behalf of users. This is achieved by creating a new key, marking it as a delegated, and having the user sign it. The service can then use this delegated key to act on behalf of the user and access the required resources.A: GSI ensures the confidentiality of communications in a grid computing environment by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect the communication channel from eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.A: Yes, message-level security can be used in GSI. However, it is currently much slower than TLS. The advantage of message-level security is that it provides an additional layer of security for the message itself, beyond just the communication channel. The disadvantage is that it can have a significant impact on performance.A: GSI prevents unauthorized access to protected resources by using digital signature technology to securely authenticate the identity of users. This allows resources to be locked to only those who should have access to them, ensuring that unauthorized users are unable to access the protected resources.A: The problem of privilege retrieval is addressed in GSI through the use of delegated privileges. A new key is created, marked as a delegated, and signed by the user. This delegated key can then be used by a service to act on behalf of the user and fetch data from the resource, even if the user is not directly involved in the communication.A: Asymmetric encryption is used in GSI to enable secure and authenticatable communication. It uses a pair of keys, one public and one private, to encrypt and decrypt messages. This ensures that only authorized users can access the protected resources, and that all communication is secure and confidential.A: GSI protects against man-in-the-middle attacks by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure the communication channel. TLS uses a combination of public and private key encryption and digital certificate verification to ensure that the communication channel is secure and that the identity of the communicating parties can be verified.A: The integrity of messages is ensured in GSI through the use of digital signatures. A digital signature is a cryptographic technique that verifies both the authenticity and integrity of a message. By signing a message with their private key, a user can ensure that the message has not been tampered with and that it originated from the claimed sender.A: GSI enables secure communication between services in a grid computing environment by using digital signature technology to authenticate the identity of users and by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to protect the communication channel from eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.A: GSI ensures that only authorized services can access protected resources by using digital signature technology to securely authenticate the identity of users. This allows resources to be locked to only those who should have access to them, ensuring that unauthorized services are unable to access the protected resources.A: GSI enables secure delegation of privileges to services in a grid computing environment by creating a new key, marking it as a delegated, and having the user sign it. The service can then use this delegated key to act on behalf of the user and access the required resources, even if the user is not directly involved in the communication.A: GSI balances security and performance in a grid computing environment by providing a choice of security mechanisms. Transport Layer Security (TLS) can be used to protect the communication channel from eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks, while message-level security provides an additional layer of security for the message itself. However, message-level security can have a significant impact on performance, so it is typically used only when additional security is required.A: GSI prevents unauthorized modification of messages in a grid computing environment by using digital signatures. A digital signature is a cryptographic technique that verifies both the authenticity and integrity of a message. By signing a message with their private key, a user can ensure that the message has not been tampered with and that it originated from the claimed sender."

    "instruction": "Privacy-invasive software\n\n==Introduction==\nPrivacy-invasive software is software that violates the user's privacy, ranging from legitimate software to malware.\n\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn a digital setting, such as the Internet, there are a wide variety of privacy threats. These vary from the tracking of user activity (sites visited, items purchased etc.), to mass marketing based on the retrieval of personal information (spam offers and telemarketing calls are more common than ever), to the distribution of information on lethal technologies used for, e.g., acts of terror.\nSpyware and identity theft are two related topics whereby individuals could use spyware to change the identity or spy on a potential victim. Spyware allows the aggressor and hacker to extract the victim's personal information and behaviours, thus making it easier for them to steal the identity of a victim.Today, software-based privacy-invasions occur in numerous aspects of Internet usage. Spyware programs set to collect and distribute user information secretly download and execute on users\u2019 workstations. Adware displays advertisements and other commercial content often based on personal information retrieved by spyware programs. System monitors record various actions on computer systems. Keyloggers record users\u2019 keystrokes in order to monitor user behaviour. Self-replicating malware downloads and spreads disorder in systems and networks. Data-harvesting software programmed to gather e-mail addresses have become conventional features of the Internet, which among other things results in spam e-mail messages filling networks and computers with unsolicited commercial content. With those threats in mind, privacy-invasive software may be defined as:\n\n== Definition ==\nPrivacy-invasive software is a category of software that ignores its users\u2019 right to be left alone and that is distributed with a specific intent, often of a commercial nature, which negatively affects its users.\nIn this context, ignoring its users\u2019 right to be left alone means that the software is unsolicited and that it does not permit users to determine for themselves when, how and to what extent personally identifiable data is gathered, stored or processed by the software. Distributed means that it has entered the computer systems of users from (often unknown) servers placed on the Internet infrastructure. Often of a commercial nature means that the software (regardless of type or quality) is used as a tool in some sort of a commercial plan to gain revenue.\n\n== Problem with the spyware concept ==\nIn early 2000, Steve Gibson formulated the first description of spyware after realizing software that stole his personal information had been installed on his computer. His definition reads as follows:\n\nSpyware is any software which employs a user\u2019s Internet connection in the background (the so-called \"backchannel\") without their knowledge or explicit permission.\nThis definition was valid in the beginning of the spyware evolution. However, as the spyware concept evolved over the years it attracted new kinds of behaviours. As these behaviours grew both in number and in diversity, the term spyware became hollowed out. This evolution resulted in that a great number of synonyms sprang up, e.g. thiefware, scumware, trackware, and badware. It is believed that the lack of a single standard definition of spyware depends on the diversity in all these different views on what really should be included, or as Aaron Weiss put it:\"What the old-school intruders have going for them is that they are relatively straightforward to define. Spyware, in its broadest sense, is harder to pin down.\"Despite this vague comprehension of the essence in spyware, all descriptions include two central aspects. The degree of associated user consent, and the level of negative impact they impair on the user and their computer system (further discussed in Section 2.3 and Section 2.5 in (Boldt 2007a)). Because of the diffuse understanding in the spyware concept, recent attempts to define it have been forced into compromises. The Anti-Spyware Coalition (ASC) which is constituted by public interest groups, trade associations, and anti-spyware companies, have come to the conclusion that the term spyware should be used at two different abstraction levels. At the low level they use the following definition, which is similar to Steve Gibson's original one:\n\nIn its narrow sense, Spyware is a term for tracking software deployed without adequate notice, consent, or control for the user.\nHowever, since this definition does not capture all the different types of spyware available they also provide a wider definition, which is more abstract in its appearance:\n\nDifficulties in defining spyware, forced the ASC to define what they call Spyware (and Other Potentially Unwanted Technologies) instead. This includes any software that does not have the users\u2019 appropriate consent for running on their computers. Another group that has tried to define spyware is a group called StopBadware.org, which consists of actors such as Harvard Law School, Oxford University, Google, Lenovo, and Sun Microsystems. Their result is that they do not use the term spyware at all, but instead introduce the term badware. Their definition thereof span over seven pages, but the essence looks as follows:\n\nBoth definitions from ASC and StopBadware.org show the difficulty with defining spyware. We therefore regard the term spyware at two different abstraction levels. On the lower level it can be defined according to Steve Gibsons original definition. However, in its broader and in a more abstract sense the term spyware is hard to properly define, as concluded above.\n\n== Introducing the term \"privacy-invasive software\" ==\nA joint conclusion is that it is important, for both software vendors and users, that a clear separation between acceptable and unacceptable software behaviour is established. The reason for this is the subjective nature of many spyware programs included, which result in inconsistencies between different users' beliefs, as what one user regards as legitimate software could be regarded as a spyware by others. As the term \"spyware\" came to include increasingly more programs, the term got hollowed out, resulting in several synonyms, such as trackware, evilware and badware, all negatively emotive. We therefore choose to introduce the term privacy-invasive software to encapsulate all such software. We believe this term to be more descriptive than other synonyms without having as negative connotation. Even if we use the word invasive to describe such software, we believe that an invasion of privacy can be both desired and beneficial for the user as long as it is fully transparent, e.g. when implementing specially user-tailored services or when including personalization features in software. \nThe work by Warkentins et al. (described in Section 7.3.1 in (Boldt 2007a)) can be used as a starting point when developing a classification of privacy-invasive software, where we classify privacy-invasive software as a combination between user consent and direct negative consequences. User consent is specified as either low, medium or high, while the degree of direct negative consequences span between tolerable, moderate, and severe. This classification allows us to first make a distinction between legitimate software and spyware, and secondly between spyware and malicious software. All software that has a low user consent, or which impairs severe direct negative consequences should be regarded as malware. While, on the other hand, any software that has high user consent, and which results in tolerable direct negative consequences should be regarded as legitimate software. By this follows that spyware constitutes the remaining group of software, i.e. those that have medium user consent or which impair moderate direct negative consequences. This classification is described in further detail in Chapter 7 in (Boldt 2007a).\nIn addition to the direct negative consequences, we also introduce indirect negative consequences. By doing so our classification distinguishes between any negative behaviour a program has been designed to carry out (direct negative consequences) and security threats introduced by just having that software executing on the system (indirect negative consequences). One example of an indirect negative consequence is the exploitation risk of software vulnerabilities in programs that execute on users\u2019 systems without their knowledge.\n\n== Comparison to malware ==\nThe term privacy-invasive software is motivated in that software types such as adware and spyware are essentially often defined according to their actions instead of their distribution mechanisms (as with most malware definitions, which also rarely correspond to motives of, e.g., business and commerce). The overall intention with the concept of privacy-invasive software is consequently to convey the commercial aspect of unwanted software contamination. The threats of privacy-invasive software consequently do not find their roots in totalitarianism, malice or political ideas, but rather in the free market, advanced technology and the unbridled exchange of electronic information. By the inclusion of purpose in its definition, the term privacy-invasive software is a contribution to the research community of privacy and security.\n\n== Predicted future development ==\nThere are several trends integrating computers and software into people's daily lives. One example is traditional media-oriented products which are being integrated into a single device, called media centres. These media centres include the same functionality as conventional television, DVD-players, and stereo equipment, but combined with an Internet connected computer. In a foreseeable future these media centres are anticipated to reach vast consumer impact. In this setting, spyware could monitor and surveillance for instance what television channels are being watched, when/why users change channel or what DVD movies users have purchased and watch. This is information that is highly attractive for any advertising or media-oriented corporation to obtain. This presents us with a probable scenario where spyware is tailored towards these new platforms; the technology needed is to a large extent the same as is used in spyware today.\nAnother interesting area for spyware vendors is the increasing amount of mobile devices being shipped. Distributors of advertisements have already turned their eyes to these devices. So far this development have not utilized the geographic position data stored in these devices. However, during the time of this writing companies are working on GPS-guided ads and coupons destined for mobile phones and hand-held devices. In other words, development of location-based marketing that allow advertising companies to get access to personal geographical data so that they can serve geographically dependent ads and coupons to their customers. Once such geographic data is being harvested and correlated with already accumulated personal information, another privacy barrier has been crossed.\n\nBased on the above text, answer the questions.

      "context": "Privacy-invasive software\n\n==Introduction==\nPrivacy-invasive software is software that violates the user's privacy, ranging from legitimate software to malware.\n\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn a digital setting, such as the Internet, there are a wide variety of privacy threats. These vary from the tracking of user activity (sites visited, items purchased etc.), to mass marketing based on the retrieval of personal information (spam offers and telemarketing calls are more common than ever), to the distribution of information on lethal technologies used for, e.g., acts of terror.\nSpyware and identity theft are two related topics whereby individuals could use spyware to change the identity or spy on a potential victim. Spyware allows the aggressor and hacker to extract the victim's personal information and behaviours, thus making it easier for them to steal the identity of a victim.Today, software-based privacy-invasions occur in numerous aspects of Internet usage. Spyware programs set to collect and distribute user information secretly download and execute on users\u2019 workstations. Adware displays advertisements and other commercial content often based on personal information retrieved by spyware programs. System monitors record various actions on computer systems. Keyloggers record users\u2019 keystrokes in order to monitor user behaviour. Self-replicating malware downloads and spreads disorder in systems and networks. Data-harvesting software programmed to gather e-mail addresses have become conventional features of the Internet, which among other things results in spam e-mail messages filling networks and computers with unsolicited commercial content. With those threats in mind, privacy-invasive software may be defined as:\n\n== Definition ==\nPrivacy-invasive software is a category of software that ignores its users\u2019 right to be left alone and that is distributed with a specific intent, often of a commercial nature, which negatively affects its users.\nIn this context, ignoring its users\u2019 right to be left alone means that the software is unsolicited and that it does not permit users to determine for themselves when, how and to what extent personally identifiable data is gathered, stored or processed by the software. Distributed means that it has entered the computer systems of users from (often unknown) servers placed on the Internet infrastructure. Often of a commercial nature means that the software (regardless of type or quality) is used as a tool in some sort of a commercial plan to gain revenue.\n\n== Problem with the spyware concept ==\nIn early 2000, Steve Gibson formulated the first description of spyware after realizing software that stole his personal information had been installed on his computer. His definition reads as follows:\n\nSpyware is any software which employs a user\u2019s Internet connection in the background (the so-called \"backchannel\") without their knowledge or explicit permission.\nThis definition was valid in the beginning of the spyware evolution. However, as the spyware concept evolved over the years it attracted new kinds of behaviours. As these behaviours grew both in number and in diversity, the term spyware became hollowed out. This evolution resulted in that a great number of synonyms sprang up, e.g. thiefware, scumware, trackware, and badware. It is believed that the lack of a single standard definition of spyware depends on the diversity in all these different views on what really should be included, or as Aaron Weiss put it:\"What the old-school intruders have going for them is that they are relatively straightforward to define. Spyware, in its broadest sense, is harder to pin down.\"Despite this vague comprehension of the essence in spyware, all descriptions include two central aspects. The degree of associated user consent, and the level of negative impact they impair on the user and their computer system (further discussed in Section 2.3 and Section 2.5 in (Boldt 2007a)). Because of the diffuse understanding in the spyware concept, recent attempts to define it have been forced into compromises. The Anti-Spyware Coalition (ASC) which is constituted by public interest groups, trade associations, and anti-spyware companies, have come to the conclusion that the term spyware should be used at two different abstraction levels. At the low level they use the following definition, which is similar to Steve Gibson's original one:\n\nIn its narrow sense, Spyware is a term for tracking software deployed without adequate notice, consent, or control for the user.\nHowever, since this definition does not capture all the different types of spyware available they also provide a wider definition, which is more abstract in its appearance:\n\nDifficulties in defining spyware, forced the ASC to define what they call Spyware (and Other Potentially Unwanted Technologies) instead. This includes any software that does not have the users\u2019 appropriate consent for running on their computers. Another group that has tried to define spyware is a group called StopBadware.org, which consists of actors such as Harvard Law School, Oxford University, Google, Lenovo, and Sun Microsystems. Their result is that they do not use the term spyware at all, but instead introduce the term badware. Their definition thereof span over seven pages, but the essence looks as follows:\n\nBoth definitions from ASC and StopBadware.org show the difficulty with defining spyware. We therefore regard the term spyware at two different abstraction levels. On the lower level it can be defined according to Steve Gibsons original definition. However, in its broader and in a more abstract sense the term spyware is hard to properly define, as concluded above.\n\n== Introducing the term \"privacy-invasive software\" ==\nA joint conclusion is that it is important, for both software vendors and users, that a clear separation between acceptable and unacceptable software behaviour is established. The reason for this is the subjective nature of many spyware programs included, which result in inconsistencies between different users' beliefs, as what one user regards as legitimate software could be regarded as a spyware by others. As the term \"spyware\" came to include increasingly more programs, the term got hollowed out, resulting in several synonyms, such as trackware, evilware and badware, all negatively emotive. We therefore choose to introduce the term privacy-invasive software to encapsulate all such software. We believe this term to be more descriptive than other synonyms without having as negative connotation. Even if we use the word invasive to describe such software, we believe that an invasion of privacy can be both desired and beneficial for the user as long as it is fully transparent, e.g. when implementing specially user-tailored services or when including personalization features in software. \nThe work by Warkentins et al. (described in Section 7.3.1 in (Boldt 2007a)) can be used as a starting point when developing a classification of privacy-invasive software, where we classify privacy-invasive software as a combination between user consent and direct negative consequences. User consent is specified as either low, medium or high, while the degree of direct negative consequences span between tolerable, moderate, and severe. This classification allows us to first make a distinction between legitimate software and spyware, and secondly between spyware and malicious software. All software that has a low user consent, or which impairs severe direct negative consequences should be regarded as malware. While, on the other hand, any software that has high user consent, and which results in tolerable direct negative consequences should be regarded as legitimate software. By this follows that spyware constitutes the remaining group of software, i.e. those that have medium user consent or which impair moderate direct negative consequences. This classification is described in further detail in Chapter 7 in (Boldt 2007a).\nIn addition to the direct negative consequences, we also introduce indirect negative consequences. By doing so our classification distinguishes between any negative behaviour a program has been designed to carry out (direct negative consequences) and security threats introduced by just having that software executing on the system (indirect negative consequences). One example of an indirect negative consequence is the exploitation risk of software vulnerabilities in programs that execute on users\u2019 systems without their knowledge.\n\n== Comparison to malware ==\nThe term privacy-invasive software is motivated in that software types such as adware and spyware are essentially often defined according to their actions instead of their distribution mechanisms (as with most malware definitions, which also rarely correspond to motives of, e.g., business and commerce). The overall intention with the concept of privacy-invasive software is consequently to convey the commercial aspect of unwanted software contamination. The threats of privacy-invasive software consequently do not find their roots in totalitarianism, malice or political ideas, but rather in the free market, advanced technology and the unbridled exchange of electronic information.

    "instruction": "Central Authentication Service\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Central Authentication Service (CAS) is a single sign-on protocol for the web. Its purpose is to permit a user to access multiple applications while providing their credentials (such as user ID and password) only once. It also allows web applications to authenticate users without gaining access to a user's security credentials, such as a password. The name CAS also refers to a software package that implements this protocol.\n\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe CAS protocol involves at least three parties: a client web browser, the web application requesting authentication, and the CAS server. It may also involve a back-end service, such as a database server, that does not have its own HTTP interface but communicates with a web application.\nWhen the client visits an application requiring authentication, the application redirects it to CAS. CAS validates the client's authenticity, usually by checking a username and password against a database (such as Kerberos, LDAP or Active Directory).\nIf the authentication succeeds, CAS returns the client to the application, passing along a service ticket. The application then validates the ticket by contacting CAS over a secure connection and providing its own service identifier and the ticket. CAS then gives the application trusted information about whether a particular user has successfully authenticated.\nCAS allows multi-tier authentication via proxy address. A cooperating back-end service, like a database or mail server, can participate in CAS, validating the authenticity of users via information it receives from web applications. Thus, a webmail client and a webmail server can all implement CAS.\n\n== Implementations ==\n\n\n*** Apereo CAS Implementation ***\nThe Apereo CAS server that is the reference implementation of the CAS protocol today supports the following features:\n\nCAS v1, v2 and v3 Protocol\nSAML v1 and v2 Protocol\nOAuth Protocol\nOpenID & OpenID Connect Protocol\nWS-Federation Passive Requestor Protocol\nAuthentication via JAAS, LDAP, RDBMS, X.509, Radius, SPNEGO, JWT, Remote, Trusted, BASIC, Apache Shiro, MongoDB, Pac4J and more.\nDelegated authentication to WS-FED, Facebook, Twitter, SAML IdP, OpenID, OpenID Connect, CAS and more.\nAuthorization via ABAC, Time/Date, REST, Internet2's Grouper and more.\nHA clustered deployments via Hazelcast, Ehcache, JPA, Memcached, Apache Ignite, MongoDB, Redis, Couchbase and more.\nApplication registration backed by JSON, LDAP, YAML, JPA, Couchbase, MongoDB and more.\nMultifactor authentication via Duo Security, SAASPASS, YubiKey, RSA, Google Authenticator (TOTP) and more.\nAdministrative UIs to manage logging, monitoring, statistics, configuration, client registration and more.\nGlobal and per-application user interface theme and branding.\nPassword management and password policy enforcement.\n\n\n*** Django Implementation ***\n\n\n**** Django CAS Server ****\ndjango-mama-cas: A Django Central Authentication Service (CAS) single sign-on server\n\n\n**** Django CAS Client ****\ndjango-cas-ng: Django CAS 1.0/2.0/3.0 client authentication library, support Django 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0 and Python 3.5+\n\nAnswer these questions based on the above context: What is the purpose of the Central Authentication Service (CAS) protocol and how does it work?Q: What are the benefits of using CAS for web applications?Q: What is the role of the CAS server in the CAS protocol?Q: What are some features of the Apereo CAS implementation of the CAS protocol?Q: What is the difference between the Django CAS Server and the Django CAS Client?Q: What is the purpose of the django-mama-cas package?Q: What is the purpose of the django-cas-ng package?Q: What are some features of the Django CAS Server implementation?Q: How does CAS enable multi-tier authentication via proxy address?Q: What is the role of the service ticket in the CAS protocol?Q: What is the difference between delegated authentication and authentication via JAAS, LDAP, RDBMS, X.509, Radius, SPNEGO, and JWT?Q: What are some features of the Django CAS Client implementation?Q: What are some benefits of using CAS for users?Q: What is the role of the back-end service in the CAS protocol?Q: What is the role of the service identifier in the CAS protocol?Q: How does CAS ensure the security of user credentials?Q: What is the role of the database in the CAS protocol?Q: What is the purpose of authorization in the CAS protocol?Q: What is the role of the administrative UIs in the Django CAS Server implementation?Q: What is the role of the password management and password policy enforcement in the Django CAS Server implementation?",

Its purpose is to permit a user to access multiple applications while providing their credentials (such as user ID and password) only once. It also allows web applications to authenticate users without gaining access to a user's security credentials, such as a password. The name CAS also refers to a software package that implements this protocol.\n\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe CAS protocol involves at least three parties: a client web browser, the web application requesting authentication, and the CAS server. It may also involve a back-end service, such as a database server, that does not have its own HTTP interface but communicates with a web application.\nWhen the client visits an application requiring authentication, the application redirects it to CAS. CAS validates the client's authenticity, usually by checking a username and password against a database (such as Kerberos, LDAP or Active Directory).\nIf the authentication succeeds, CAS returns the client to the application, passing along a service ticket. The application then validates the ticket by contacting CAS over a secure connection and providing its own service identifier and the ticket. CAS then gives the application trusted information about whether a particular user has successfully authenticated.\nCAS allows multi-tier authentication via proxy address. A cooperating back-end service, like a database or mail server, can participate in CAS, validating the authenticity of users via information it receives from web applications. Thus, a webmail client and a webmail server can all implement CAS.\n\n== Implementations ==\n\n\n*** Apereo CAS Implementation ***\nThe Apereo CAS server that is the reference implementation of the CAS protocol today supports the following features:\n\nCAS v1, v2 and v3 Protocol\nSAML v1 and v2 Protocol\nOAuth Protocol\nOpenID & OpenID Connect Protocol\nWS-Federation Passive Requestor Protocol\nAuthentication via JAAS, LDAP, RDBMS, X.509, Radius, SPNEGO, JWT, Remote, Trusted, BASIC, Apache Shiro, MongoDB, Pac4J and more.\nDelegated authentication to WS-FED, Facebook, Twitter, SAML IdP, OpenID, OpenID Connect, CAS and more.\nAuthorization via ABAC, Time/Date, REST, Internet2's Grouper and more.\nHA clustered deployments via Hazelcast, Ehcache, JPA, Memcached, Apache Ignite, MongoDB, Redis, Couchbase and more.\nApplication registration backed by JSON, LDAP, YAML, JPA, Couchbase, MongoDB and more.\nMultifactor authentication via Duo Security, SAASPASS, YubiKey, RSA, Google Authenticator (TOTP) and more.\nAdministrative UIs to manage logging, monitoring, statistics, configuration, client registration and more.\nGlobal and per-application user interface theme and branding.\nPassword management and password policy enforcement.\n\n\n*** Django Implementation ***\n\n\n**** Django CAS Server ****\ndjango-mama-cas: A Django Central Authentication Service (CAS) single sign-on server\n\n\n**** Django CAS Client ****\ndjango-cas-ng: Django CAS 1.0/2.0/3.0 client authentication library, support Django 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0 and Python 3.5+",

    "instruction": "Disk encryption\n\n==Introduction==\nDisk encryption is a technology which protects information by converting it into code that cannot be deciphered easily by unauthorized people or processes. Disk encryption uses disk encryption software or hardware to encrypt every bit of data that goes on a disk or disk volume. It is used to prevent unauthorized access to data storage.The expression full disk encryption (FDE) (or whole disk encryption) signifies that everything on the disk is encrypted, but the master boot record (MBR), or similar area of a bootable disk, with code that starts the operating system loading sequence, is not encrypted. Some hardware-based full disk encryption systems can truly encrypt an entire boot disk, including the MBR.\n\n== Transparent encryption ==\nTransparent encryption, also known as real-time encryption and on-the-fly encryption (OTFE), is a method used by some disk encryption software. \"Transparent\" refers to the fact that data is automatically encrypted or decrypted as it is loaded or saved.\nWith transparent encryption, the files are accessible immediately after the key is provided, and the entire volume is typically mounted as if it were a physical drive, making the files just as accessible as any unencrypted ones. No data stored on an encrypted volume can be read (decrypted) without using the correct password/keyfile(s) or correct encryption keys. The entire file system within the volume is encrypted (including file names, folder names, file contents, and other meta-data).To be transparent to the end-user, transparent encryption usually requires the use of device drivers to enable the encryption process. Although administrator access rights are normally required to install such drivers, encrypted volumes can typically be used by normal users without these rights.In general, every method in which data is seamlessly encrypted on write and decrypted on read, in such a way that the user and/or application software remains unaware of the process, can be called transparent encryption.\n\n== Disk encryption vs. filesystem-level encryption ==\nDisk encryption does not replace file encryption in all situations. Disk encryption is sometimes used in conjunction with filesystem-level encryption with the intention of providing a more secure implementation. Since disk encryption generally uses the same key for encrypting the whole drive, all of the data can be decrypted when the system runs. However, some disk encryption solutions use multiple keys for encrypting different volumes. If an attacker gains access to the computer at run-time, the attacker has access to all files. Conventional file and folder encryption instead allows different keys for different portions of the disk. Thus an attacker cannot extract information from still-encrypted files and folders.\nUnlike disk encryption, filesystem-level encryption does not typically encrypt filesystem metadata, such as the directory structure, file names, modification timestamps or sizes.\n\n== Disk encryption and Trusted Platform Module ==\nTrusted Platform Module (TPM) is a secure cryptoprocessor embedded in the motherboard that can be used to authenticate a hardware device. Since each TPM chip is unique to a particular device, it is capable of performing platform authentication. It can be used to verify that the system seeking the access is the expected system.A limited number of disk encryption solutions have support for TPM. These implementations can wrap the decryption key using the TPM, thus tying the hard disk drive (HDD) to a particular device. If the HDD is removed from that particular device and placed in another, the decryption process will fail. Recovery is  possible with the decryption password or token.\nAlthough this has the advantage that the disk cannot be removed from the device, it might create a single point of failure in the encryption. For example, if something happens to the TPM or the motherboard, a user would not be able to access the data by connecting the hard drive to another computer, unless that user has a separate recovery key.\n\n== Implementations ==\n\nThere are multiple tools available in the market that allow for disk encryption. However, they vary greatly in features and security. They are divided into three main categories: software-based, hardware-based within the storage device, and hardware-based elsewhere (such as CPU or host bus adaptor).  Hardware-based full disk encryption within the storage device are called self-encrypting drives and have no impact on performance whatsoever. Furthermore, the media-encryption key never leaves the device itself and is therefore not available to any virus in the operating system.\nThe Trusted Computing Group Opal Storage Specification provides industry accepted standardization for self-encrypting drives.  External hardware is considerably faster than the software-based solutions, although CPU versions may still have a performance impact, and the media encryption keys are not as well protected.\nAll solutions for the boot drive require a pre-boot authentication component which is available for all types of solutions from a number of vendors. It is important in all cases that the authentication credentials are usually a major potential weakness since the symmetric cryptography is usually strong.\n\n== Password/data recovery mechanism ==\nSecure and safe recovery mechanisms are essential to the large-scale deployment of any disk encryption solutions in an enterprise. The solution must provide an easy but secure way to recover passwords (most importantly data) in case the user leaves the company without notice or forgets the password.\n\n\n*** Challenge\u2013response password recovery mechanism ***\nChallenge\u2013response password recovery mechanism allows the password to be recovered in a secure manner. It is offered by a limited number of disk encryption solutions.\nSome benefits of challenge\u2013response password recovery:\n\nNo need for the user to carry a disc with recovery encryption key.\nNo secret data is exchanged during the recovery process.\nNo information can be sniffed.\nDoes not require a network connection, i.e. it works for users that are at a remote location.\n\n\n*** Emergency recovery information (ERI)-file password recovery mechanism ***\nAn emergency recovery information (ERI) file provides an alternative for recovery if a challenge\u2013response mechanism is unfeasible due to the cost of helpdesk operatives for small companies or implementation challenges.\nSome benefits of ERI-file recovery:\n\nSmall companies can use it without implementation difficulties.\nNo secret data is exchanged during the recovery process.\nNo information can be sniffed.\nDoes not require a network connection, i.e. it works for users that are at a remote location.\n\n== Security concerns ==\nMost full disk encryption schemes are vulnerable to a cold boot attack, whereby encryption keys can be stolen by cold-booting a machine already running an operating system, then dumping the contents of memory before the data disappears.  The attack relies on the data remanence property of computer memory, whereby data bits can take up to several minutes to degrade after power has been removed. Even a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is not effective against the attack, as the operating system needs to hold the decryption keys in memory in order to access the disk.Full disk encryption is also vulnerable when a computer is stolen when suspended. As wake-up does not involve a BIOS boot sequence, it typically does not ask for the FDE password. Hibernation, in contrast goes via a BIOS boot sequence, and is safe.\nAll software-based encryption systems are vulnerable to various side channel attacks such as acoustic cryptanalysis and hardware keyloggers. In contrast, self-encrypting drives are not vulnerable to these attacks since the hardware encryption key never leaves the disk controller.\nAlso, most full disk encryption schemes don't protect from data tampering (or silent data corruption, i.e. bitrot). That means they only provide privacy, but not integrity. Block cipher-based encryption modes used for full disk encryption are not authenticated encryption themselves because of concerns of the storage overhead needed for authentication tags. Thus, if tampering would be done to data on the disk, the data would be decrypted to garbled random data when read and hopefully errors may be indicated depending on which data is tampered with (for the case of OS metadata \u2013 by the file system; and for the case of file data \u2013 by the corresponding program that would process the file). One of the ways to mitigate these concerns, is to use file systems with full data integrity checks via checksums (like Btrfs or ZFS) on top of full disk encryption. However, cryptsetup started experimentally to support authenticated encryption\n\n== Full disk encryption ==\n\n\n*** Benefits ***\nFull disk encryption has several benefits compared to regular file or folder encryption, or encrypted vaults. The following are some benefits of disk encryption:\n\nNearly everything including the swap space and the temporary files is encrypted. Encrypting these files is important, as they can reveal important confidential data. With a software implementation, the bootstrapping code cannot be encrypted however. For example, BitLocker Drive Encryption leaves an unencrypted volume to boot from, while the volume containing the operating system is fully encrypted.\nWith full disk encryption, the decision of which individual files to encrypt is not left up to users' discretion. This is important for situations in which users might not want or might forget to encrypt sensitive files.\nImmediate data destruction, such as simply destroying the cryptographic keys (crypto-shredding), renders the contained data useless. However, if security towards future attacks is a concern, purging or physical destruction is advised.\n\n\n*** The boot key problem ***\nOne issue to address in full disk encryption is that the blocks where the operating system is stored must be decrypted before the OS can boot, meaning that the key has to be available before there is a user interface to ask for a password. Most Full Disk Encryption solutions utilize Pre-Boot Authentication by loading a small, highly secure operating system which is strictly locked down and hashed versus system variables to check for the integrity of the Pre-Boot kernel. Some implementations such as BitLocker Drive Encryption can make use of hardware such as a Trusted Platform Module to ensure the integrity of the boot environment, and thereby frustrate attacks that target the boot loader by replacing it with a modified version. This ensures that authentication can take place in a controlled environment without the possibility of a bootkit being used to subvert the pre-boot decryption.\nWith a pre-boot authentication environment, the key used to encrypt the data is not decrypted until an external key is input into the system.\nSolutions for storing the external key include:\n\nUsername / password\nUsing a smartcard in combination with a PIN\nUsing a biometric authentication method such as a fingerprint\nUsing a dongle to store the key, assuming that the user will not allow the dongle to be stolen with the laptop or that the dongle is encrypted as well\nUsing a boot-time driver that can ask for a password from the user\nUsing a network interchange to recover the key, for instance as part of a PXE boot\nUsing a TPM to store the decryption key, preventing unauthorized access of the decryption key or subversion of the boot loader\nUsing a combination of the aboveAll these possibilities have varying degrees of security; however, most are better than an unencrypted disk.\nHow does transparent encryption work without requiring user awareness?question: What is the difference between disk encryption and filesystem-level encryption?question: How does the use of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) affect disk encryption?question: What are the main categories of disk encryption tools?question: How do self-encrypting drives differ from other types of disk encryption?question: What is the purpose of a pre-boot authentication component in disk encryption?question: What is the difference between a challenge-response password recovery mechanism and an ERI-file password recovery mechanism?question: How are most full disk encryption schemes vulnerable to cold boot attacks?question: How do self-encrypting drives protect against side channel attacks?question: How do full disk encryption schemes protect against data tampering?question: What is the benefit of nearly everything being encrypted with full disk encryption?question: Why is it important that the decision of which individual files to encrypt is not left up to users' discretion with full disk encryption?question: What is the benefit of immediate data destruction with full disk encryption?question: What is the boot key problem in full disk encryption?question: What are some solutions for storing the external key used to encrypt the data with full disk encryption?",

      "context": "Disk encryption\n\n==Introduction==\nDisk encryption is a technology which protects information by converting it into code that cannot be deciphered easily by unauthorized people or processes. Disk encryption uses disk encryption software or hardware to encrypt every bit of data that goes on a disk or disk volume. It is used to prevent unauthorized access to data storage.The expression full disk encryption (FDE) (or whole disk encryption) signifies that everything on the disk is encrypted, but the master boot record (MBR), or similar area of a bootable disk, with code that starts the operating system loading sequence, is not encrypted. Some hardware-based full disk encryption systems can truly encrypt an entire boot disk, including the MBR.\n\n== Transparent encryption ==\nTransparent encryption, also known as real-time encryption and on-the-fly encryption (OTFE), is a method used by some disk encryption software. \"Transparent\" refers to the fact that data is automatically encrypted or decrypted as it is loaded or saved.\nWith transparent encryption, the files are accessible immediately after the key is provided, and the entire volume is typically mounted as if it were a physical drive, making the files just as accessible as any unencrypted ones. No data stored on an encrypted volume can be read (decrypted) without using the correct password/keyfile(s) or correct encryption keys. The entire file system within the volume is encrypted (including file names, folder names, file contents, and other meta-data).To be transparent to the end-user, transparent encryption usually requires the use of device drivers to enable the encryption process. Although administrator access rights are normally required to install such drivers, encrypted volumes can typically be used by normal users without these rights.In general, every method in which data is seamlessly encrypted on write and decrypted on read, in such a way that the user and/or application software remains unaware of the process, can be called transparent encryption.\n\n== Disk encryption vs. filesystem-level encryption ==\nDisk encryption does not replace file encryption in all situations. Disk encryption is sometimes used in conjunction with filesystem-level encryption with the intention of providing a more secure implementation. Since disk encryption generally uses the same key for encrypting the whole drive, all of the data can be decrypted when the system runs. However, some disk encryption solutions use multiple keys for encrypting different volumes. If an attacker gains access to the computer at run-time, the attacker has access to all files. Conventional file and folder encryption instead allows different keys for different portions of the disk. Thus an attacker cannot extract information from still-encrypted files and folders.\nUnlike disk encryption, filesystem-level encryption does not typically encrypt filesystem metadata, such as the directory structure, file names, modification timestamps or sizes.\n\n== Disk encryption and Trusted Platform Module ==\nTrusted Platform Module (TPM) is a secure cryptoprocessor embedded in the motherboard that can be used to authenticate a hardware device. Since each TPM chip is unique to a particular device, it is capable of performing platform authentication. It can be used to verify that the system seeking the access is the expected system.A limited number of disk encryption solutions have support for TPM. These implementations can wrap the decryption key using the TPM, thus tying the hard disk drive (HDD) to a particular device. If the HDD is removed from that particular device and placed in another, the decryption process will fail. Recovery is  possible with the decryption password or token.\nAlthough this has the advantage that the disk cannot be removed from the device, it might create a single point of failure in the encryption. For example, if something happens to the TPM or the motherboard, a user would not be able to access the data by connecting the hard drive to another computer, unless that user has a separate recovery key.\n\n== Implementations ==\n\nThere are multiple tools available in the market that allow for disk encryption. However, they vary greatly in features and security. They are divided into three main categories: software-based, hardware-based within the storage device, and hardware-based elsewhere (such as CPU or host bus adaptor).  Hardware-based full disk encryption within the storage device are called self-encrypting drives and have no impact on performance whatsoever. Furthermore, the media-encryption key never leaves the device itself and is therefore not available to any virus in the operating system.\nThe Trusted Computing Group Opal Storage Specification provides industry accepted standardization for self-encrypting drives.  External hardware is considerably faster than the software-based solutions, although CPU versions may still have a performance impact, and the media encryption keys are not as well protected.\nAll solutions for the boot drive require a pre-boot authentication component which is available for all types of solutions from a number of vendors. It is important in all cases that the authentication credentials are usually a major potential weakness since the symmetric cryptography is usually strong.\n\n== Password/data recovery mechanism ==\nSecure and safe recovery mechanisms are essential to the large-scale deployment of any disk encryption solutions in an enterprise. The solution must provide an easy but secure way to recover passwords (most importantly data) in case the user leaves the company without notice or forgets the password.\n\n\n*** Challenge\u2013response password recovery mechanism ***\nChallenge\u2013response password recovery mechanism allows the password to be recovered in a secure manner. It is offered by a limited number of disk encryption solutions.\nSome benefits of challenge\u2013response password recovery:\n\nNo need for the user to carry a disc with recovery encryption key.\nNo secret data is exchanged during the recovery process.\nNo information can be sniffed.\nDoes not require a network connection, i.e. it works for users that are at a remote location.\n\n\n*** Emergency recovery information (ERI)-file password recovery mechanism ***\nAn emergency recovery information (ERI) file provides an alternative for recovery if a challenge\u2013response mechanism is unfeasible due to the cost of helpdesk operatives for small companies or implementation challenges.\nSome benefits of ERI-file recovery:\n\nSmall companies can use it without implementation difficulties.\nNo secret data is exchanged during the recovery process.\nNo information can be sniffed.\nDoes not require a network connection, i.e. it works for users that are at a remote location.\n\n== Security concerns ==\nMost full disk encryption schemes are vulnerable to a cold boot attack, whereby encryption keys can be stolen by cold-booting a machine already running an operating system, then dumping the contents of memory before the data disappears.  The attack relies on the data remanence property of computer memory, whereby data bits can take up to several minutes to degrade after power has been removed. Even a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is not effective against the attack, as the operating system needs to hold the decryption keys in memory in order to access the disk.Full disk encryption is also vulnerable when a computer is stolen when suspended. As wake-up does not involve a BIOS boot sequence, it typically does not ask for the FDE password. Hibernation, in contrast goes via a BIOS boot sequence, and is safe.\nAll software-based encryption systems are vulnerable to various side channel attacks such as acoustic cryptanalysis and hardware keyloggers. In contrast, self-encrypting drives are not vulnerable to these attacks since the hardware encryption key never leaves the disk controller.\nAlso, most full disk encryption schemes don't protect from data tampering (or silent data corruption, i.e. bitrot). That means they only provide privacy, but not integrity. Block cipher-based encryption modes used for full disk encryption are not authenticated encryption themselves because of concerns of the storage overhead needed for authentication tags. Thus, if tampering would be done to data on the disk, the data would be decrypted to garbled random data when read and hopefully errors may be indicated depending on which data is tampered with (for the case of OS metadata \u2013 by the file system; and for the case of file data \u2013 by the corresponding program that would process the file). One of the ways to mitigate these concerns, is to use file systems with full data integrity checks via checksums (like Btrfs or ZFS) on top of full disk encryption. However, cryptsetup started experimentally to support authenticated encryption\n\n== Full disk encryption ==\n\n\n*** Benefits ***\nFull disk encryption has several benefits compared to regular file or folder encryption, or encrypted vaults. The following are some benefits of disk encryption:\n\nNearly everything including the swap space and the temporary files is encrypted. Encrypting these files is important, as they can reveal important confidential data. With a software implementation, the bootstrapping code cannot be encrypted however. For example, BitLocker Drive Encryption leaves an unencrypted volume to boot from, while the volume containing the operating system is fully encrypted.\nWith full disk encryption, the decision of which individual files to encrypt is not left up to users' discretion. This is important for situations in which users might not want or might forget to encrypt sensitive files.\nImmediate data destruction, such as simply destroying the cryptographic keys (crypto-shredding), renders the contained data useless. However, if security towards future attacks is a concern, purging or physical destruction is advised.\n\n\n*** The boot key problem ***\nOne issue to address in full disk encryption is that the blocks where the operating system is stored must be decrypted before the OS can boot, meaning that the key has to be available before there is a user interface to ask for a password. Most Full Disk Encryption solutions utilize Pre-Boot Authentication by loading a small, highly secure operating system which is strictly locked down and hashed versus system variables to check for the integrity of the Pre-Boot kernel. Some implementations such as BitLocker Drive Encryption can make use of hardware such as a Trusted Platform Module to ensure the integrity of the boot environment, and thereby frustrate attacks that target the boot loader by replacing it with a modified version. This ensures that authentication can take place in a controlled environment without the possibility of a bootkit being used to subvert the pre-boot decryption.\nWith a pre-boot authentication environment, the key used to encrypt the data is not decrypted until an external key is input into the system.\nSolutions for storing the external key include:\n\nUsername / password\nUsing a smartcard in combination with a PIN\nUsing a biometric authentication method such as a fingerprint\nUsing a dongle to store the key, assuming that the user will not allow the dongle to be stolen with the laptop or that the dongle is encrypted as well\nUsing a boot-time driver that can ask for a password from the user\nUsing a network interchange to recover the key, for instance as part of a PXE boot\nUsing a TPM to store the decryption key, preventing unauthorized access of the decryption key or subversion of the boot loader\nUsing a combination of the aboveAll these possibilities have varying degrees of security; however, most are better than an unencrypted disk.",

The operation is likely associated with an advanced persistent threat, or a network actor that spies undetected. Its command and control infrastructure is based mainly in the People's Republic of China and GhostNet has infiltrated high-value political, economic and media locations in 103 countries. Computer systems belonging to embassies, foreign ministries and other government offices, and the Dalai Lama's Tibetan exile centers in India, London and New York City were compromised.\n\n== Discovery ==\nGhostNet was discovered and named following a 10-month investigation by the Infowar Monitor (IWM), carried out after IWM researchers approached the Dalai Lama's representative in Geneva suspecting that their computer network had been infiltrated. The IWM is composed of researchers from The SecDev Group and Canadian consultancy and the Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto; the research findings were published in the Infowar Monitor, an affiliated publication. Researchers from the University of Cambridge's Computer Laboratory, supported by the Institute for Information Infrastructure Protection, also contributed to the investigation at one of the three locations in Dharamshala, where the Tibetan government-in-exile is located.  The discovery of the 'GhostNet', and details of its operations, were reported by The New York Times on March 29, 2009. Investigators focused initially on allegations of Chinese cyber-espionage against the Tibetan exile community, such as instances where email correspondence and other data were extracted.Compromised systems were discovered in the embassies of India, South Korea, Indonesia, Romania, Cyprus, Malta, Thailand, Taiwan, Portugal, Germany and Pakistan and the office of the Prime Minister of Laos. The foreign ministries of Iran, Bangladesh, Latvia, Indonesia, Philippines, Brunei, Barbados and Bhutan were also targeted. No evidence was found that U.S. or UK government offices were infiltrated, although a NATO computer was monitored for half a day and the computers of the Indian embassy in Washington, D.C., were infiltrated.Since its discovery, GhostNet has attacked other government networks, for example Canadian official financial departments in early 2011, forcing them off-line. Governments commonly do not admit such attacks, which must be verified by official but anonymous sources.\n\n== Technical functionality ==\nEmails are sent to target organizations that contain contextually relevant information. These emails contain malicious attachments, that when opened, enable a trojan horse to access the system. This Trojan connects back to a control server, usually located in China, to receive commands. The infected computer will then execute the command specified by the control server. Occasionally, the command specified by the control server will cause the infected computer to download and install a trojan known as Gh0st Rat that allows attackers to gain complete, real-time control of computers running Microsoft Windows. Such a computer can be controlled or inspected by attackers, and the software even has the ability to turn on camera and audio-recording functions of infected computers, enabling attackers to perform surveillance.\n\n== Origin ==\nThe researchers from the IWM stated they could not conclude that the Chinese government was responsible for the spy network.

The Chinese government has stated that China \"strictly forbids any cyber crime.\"The \"Ghostnet Report\" documents several unrelated infections at Tibetan-related organizations in addition to the Ghostnet infections. By using the email addresses provided by the IWM report, Scott J. Henderson had managed to trace one of the operators of one of the infections (non-Ghostnet) to Chengdu. He identifies the hacker as a 27-year-old man who had attended the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, and currently connected with the Chinese hacker underground.Despite the lack of evidence to pinpoint the Chinese government as responsible for intrusions against Tibetan-related targets, researchers at Cambridge have found actions taken by Chinese government officials that corresponded with the information obtained via computer intrusions. One such incident involved a diplomat who was pressured by Beijing after receiving an email invitation to a visit with the Dalai Lama from his representatives.Another incident involved a Tibetan woman who was interrogated by Chinese intelligence officers and was shown transcripts of her online conversations. However, there are other possible explanations for this event. Drelwa uses QQ and other instant messengers to communicate with Chinese Internet users. In 2008, IWM found that TOM-Skype, the Chinese version of Skype, was logging and storing text messages exchanged between users. It is possible that the Chinese authorities acquired the chat transcripts through these means.IWM researchers have also found that when detected, GhostNet is consistently controlled from IP addresses located on the island of Hainan, China, and have pointed out that Hainan is home to the Lingshui signals intelligence facility and the Third Technical Department of the People's Liberation Army.

    "instruction": "2010 Japan\u2013South Korea cyberwarfare\n\n==Introduction==\nOn February 23, 2010, members of DC Inside, Humoruniversity, Ruliweb, Daum Truepicture, todayhumor, and various other Korean online communities formed the Terror Action Association (TAA) (Korean: \ud14c\ub7ec\ub300\uc751\uc5f0\ud569). On March 1, 2010, TAA attacked the Japanese website 2channel, coinciding with the 91st anniversary of the March 1st Movement. Since 2004, DC Inside and 2chan have had numerous conflicts, both large and small.\n\n\n\n== Summary ==\nOn February 23, 2010, users on 2chan (2channers) made offensive comments about a Korean international student that was beaten to death in Russia in the winter of 2009. \"Dog died, why is it on the news?\", \"Kill more!\", and other remarks were made. A few days prior, the Korean figure skater Yuna Kim won the gold medal in the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, and 2channers asserted that officials must have been bribed. \nThese expressions from 2chan flowed into DC Inside's Humor Program Gallery. Netizens from DC Inside and HumorUniversity (Korean web communities) agreed that the date of the attack should be March 1, 2010, and began recruiting from other online communities such as Today's Humor, Ruliweb, Daum.net. They formed the Terror Action Association, amassing more than 102,000 participants in a day.On 1 pm of March 1 (GMT+9), the TAA vandalized 2chan's galleries and executed a massive DDoS attack by paralyzing 2chan's servers.According to Pacific Internet Exchange, which was hosting 2chan's servers, Japanese servers were already experiencing an increased volume of requests from Korea facilitated by bots since 11:40 am. Other websites affiliated with 2chan were also affected by the attack.\nOn the evening of March 1, 2chan servers were suspended and IP addresses from all sources of attacks were blocked.\nOn March 2, damages were estimated to be above $2.5 million. Mainly 2chan's \"Korea Slander Gallery\", \"VIP Gallery\", \"Breaking News Gallery\" were targeted.\n\n== Timeline and the aftermath ==\nOn February 24, Korean online communities noticed a series of posts on the Japanese website 2chan regarding Yuna Kim, a Korean figure skater, and the Korean international student who was murdered in Russia. Korean online communities claimed that 2chan members were accusing Yuna Kim of bribery and finding delight in the murder of the Korean student in Russia. An internet community, Terror Action Association was formed with the objective of carrying out a cyberattack on 2chan on March 1, 2010. Although the TAA prohibited the distribution or the use of illegal software, members continuously distributed illegal software leading up to the day of the attack.\nOn February 25, around midnight, Japanese posts appeared on DC Inside's comedy gallery and its users claimed that the servers had slowed down, and interpreted these as signs of a preemptive attack from 2chan. Korean appeared on 2chan's Korean threads as well, however Japanese did not appear on 2chan's Korean galleries.  In a few minutes, the DC Inside servers returned to their usual speeds. \nOn February 26, attacks were carried out on 2chan's Yaoi forum. During the figure skating short program of the Vancouver Olympics that took place a few days before the attack, Yuna Kim took the lead over Mao Asada by meager 5 points and won the gold medal. 2channers suggested that Yuna Kim won the gold medal through bribery. However, whether this attack really originated from Korean users is unclear because the vandalism that appeared on 2chan's website did not contain any Korean but only English phrases such as \"I'm Korean.\" \nOn February 28, a committee of 2channers scheduled two rounds of attacks on DC Inside at 8 pm and 9 pm within 30-minute windows. These attacks proved to be ineffective. The upcoming cyber war began attracting attention from the press.\n1 pm on March 1, the TAA began the attack in two teams \u2013 one team vandalized the website, the other team carried out a DDoS attack. At 1:03 pm, only three minutes after the initiation of the attack, 2chan's VIP gallery was paralyzed. 1:13 pm, five servers were paralyzed. 1:16 pm, the main channel's login requests started to get affected. 1:22 pm, all but two of the thirty-three 2chan servers were paralyzed. At 1:44 pm, the entire server was down. At 2:13 pm, 2chan's main page was hacked and replaced with a page containing the Korean flag. At 2:43 pm, naver.com blocked Japanese IPs. At 3:35 pm, 2chan blocked Korean IPs, but the servers were not yet restored. \nA Korean student in Japan spied on the Japanese plans for retribution. At 6 pm, it was discovered that a website had plans for attacking the Blue House website. However, some Koreans who disliked Lee Myung Bak (Korean president at the time of the attack) participated in this attack. The Blue House shortly blocked Japanese IPs. At 6:11 pm, the Voluntary Agency Network of Korea (VANK) homepage started receiving attacks and was paralyzed for about 1 hour but was soon restored. It has been rumored that some of VANK's routers exploded from the attack. At 6:38 pm, attacks on Comedy Program Gallery began, but the attacks were deflected in four minutes. At 8:43 pm, organizers from 2chan declared the end of the attacks. At 9:35 pm, 2chan had been effectively downed for 8 hours, and MBC reported on the outcome.Around 6 pm of the following day, the servers began to be restored (At 8 pm, most of the servers were running normally). At 7 pm, another attack on VANK was made without success, and prompted a retribution attack from TAA, downing the control server of 2chan. Around 8 pm, attacks were again initiated by 2chan, but failed. At 10 pm, VANK blocked all Japanese IPs.\nOn March 5, 2chan provisionally suspended attacks and promised to strike on August 15. On August 15, the attacks were announced but the day passed by without offense from either side. A Korean gaming portal was downed this day but it was confirmed this was not an attack from Japan. A lot of fingers were pointed, including at China, at business establishments, and some speculated that it was an inside job by DC Inside. The Japanese Wiki article on this topic claims that VANK had a main role in this attack.\n\n== Outcome ==\nConnecting to 2chan was impossible in the morning of March 1 until the evening of March 2 when the attacks shrank and a portion of the servers partially recovered. The next day, about a third of the servers were restored, and by the evening all but the Dubai server were completely restored. The Dubai server was never completely restored due to damage, and according to 2chan administrators, the recovery of data on the Dubai server was difficult and it was stated that the gallery would be opening on a different server.The webpages of VANK and the Blue House were slowed down due to the attacks. There were reports that routers at VANK exploded, however, VANK had merely blocked Japanese IPs.\n\n== Reactions and responses ==\nPacific Internet Exchange, the managing company of 2chan's servers, declared on March 2 that they were preparing to investigate this event as a cyber-terrorism attack in collaboration with the US's Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), by collecting and analyzing data related to this attack. However, the investigation was not actually carried out. This cyber warfare collaterally impacted some US agencies. Management of Big-server.com stated that a German who enforced cyber-attacks was arrested in the US and sentenced to two years. However, it was later confirmed that this scenario was fantasized by 2chan users, and a US journalist had picked up on this and published an article without checking the details. Because the FBI investigates activity that occurs within the United States, it is unlikely that they have actually investigated this cyber war. CIA, on the other hand, may investigate this incident in collaboration with South Korean or Japanese intelligence agencies, police forces, etc., with the approval of ministries on both ends (Japan has no official collective intelligence agency, instead there are intelligence clusters such as the Chief Cabinet Secretary's intelligence investigators, the Ministry of Justice's Public Inspection Agency, National Police Agency Security Bureau, and the Defense Agency).\nThe head of Voluntary Agency Network of Korea (VANK) stated, \"Japan has hurt their own reputation in the eyes of the international society\", \"Inflicting F5 attacks is no different than what Japan did. We must ignore them.\"\nJoongAng Daily\u2013 Editorials criticized both the way that Japanese netizens reacted to not winning the gold medal, as well as the way Korean netizens similarly reacted to the Japanese netizens.\nKorea Communications Commission stated that they are obtaining a holistic profile of this case and preparing measures. They stated, \"We are worried about how to protect [Korean] netizens if this case evolves into a dispute between the two countries.\"\nMatsumoto Tetsujo, representative of the SoftBank Group, recorded on his blog that \"If Japanese right-wing truly has the ability and the sense of duty for the country, and if there is a site with anti-Japanese sentiments, whether it is Korean or Chinese, why don't they also try gathering total power and launching a multi-scale assault just like the Koreans?\"\n\nWhat was the reason behind the formation of the Terror Action Association (TAA) on February 23, 2010?Q: What was the main objective of the TAA's cyberattack on 2chan on March 1, 2010?Q: What type of attack did the TAA carry out on 2chan on March 1, 2010?Q: How many participants did the TAA amass in a day for their cyberattack on 2chan?Q: What was the estimated damage caused by the TAA's cyberattack on 2chan on March 1, 2010?Q: What was the response of 2chan's hosting company, Pacific Internet Exchange, to the TAA's cyberattack on 2chan on March 1, 2010?Q: What was the response of the Voluntary Agency Network of Korea (VANK) to the TAA's cyberattack on 2chan on March 1, 2010?Q: What was the response of the Blue House to the TAA's cyberattack on 2chan on March 1, 2010?Q: What was the response of the Korean student in Japan to the TAA's cyberattack on 2chan on March 1, 2010?Q: What was the response of Pacific Internet Exchange to the TAA's cyberattack on 2chan on March 1, 2010 in terms of investigating the attack?Q: What was the response of Matsumoto Tetsujo, representative of the SoftBank Group, to the TAA's cyberattack on 2chan on March 1, 2010?Q: What was the response of the head of Voluntary Agency Network of Korea (VANK) to the TAA's cyberattack on 2chan on March 1, 2010?Q: What was the response of JoongAng Daily\u2013 Editorials to the TAA's cyberattack on 2chan on March 1, 2010?Q: What was the response of the Korea Communications Commission to the TAA's cyberattack on 2chan on March 1, 2010?Q: What was the outcome of the TAA's cyberattack on 2chan on March 1, 2010?",

During the figure skating short program of the Vancouver Olympics that took place a few days before the attack, Yuna Kim took the lead over Mao Asada by meager 5 points and won the gold medal. 2channers suggested that Yuna Kim won the gold medal through bribery. However, whether this attack really originated from Korean users is unclear because the vandalism that appeared on 2chan's website did not contain any Korean but only English phrases such as \"I'm Korean.\" \nOn February 28, a committee of 2channers scheduled two rounds of attacks on DC Inside at 8 pm and 9 pm within 30-minute windows. These attacks proved to be ineffective. The upcoming cyber war began attracting attention from the press.\n1 pm on March 1, the TAA began the attack in two teams \u2013 one team vandalized the website, the other team carried out a DDoS attack. At 1:03 pm, only three minutes after the initiation of the attack, 2chan's VIP gallery was paralyzed. 1:13 pm, five servers were paralyzed. 1:16 pm, the main channel's login requests started to get affected. 1:22 pm, all but two of the thirty-three 2chan servers were paralyzed. At 1:44 pm, the entire server was down. At 2:13 pm, 2chan's main page was hacked and replaced with a page containing the Korean flag. At 2:43 pm, naver.com blocked Japanese IPs. At 3:35 pm, 2chan blocked Korean IPs, but the servers were not yet restored. \nA Korean student in Japan spied on the Japanese plans for retribution. At 6 pm, it was discovered that a website had plans for attacking the Blue House website. However, some Koreans who disliked Lee Myung Bak (Korean president at the time of the attack) participated in this attack. The Blue House shortly blocked Japanese IPs. At 6:11 pm, the Voluntary Agency Network of Korea (VANK) homepage started receiving attacks and was paralyzed for about 1 hour but was soon restored. It has been rumored that some of VANK's routers exploded from the attack. At 6:38 pm, attacks on Comedy Program Gallery began, but the attacks were deflected in four minutes. At 8:43 pm, organizers from 2chan declared the end of the attacks. At 9:35 pm, 2chan had been effectively downed for 8 hours, and MBC reported on the outcome.Around 6 pm of the following day, the servers began to be restored (At 8 pm, most of the servers were running normally). At 7 pm, another attack on VANK was made without success, and prompted a retribution attack from TAA, downing the control server of 2chan. Around 8 pm, attacks were again initiated by 2chan, but failed. At 10 pm, VANK blocked all Japanese IPs.\nOn March 5, 2chan provisionally suspended attacks and promised to strike on August 15. On August 15, the attacks were announced but the day passed by without offense from either side. A Korean gaming portal was downed this day but it was confirmed this was not an attack from Japan. A lot of fingers were pointed, including at China, at business establishments, and some speculated that it was an inside job by DC Inside. The Japanese Wiki article on this topic claims that VANK had a main role in this attack.\n\n== Outcome ==\nConnecting to 2chan was impossible in the morning of March 1 until the evening of March 2 when the attacks shrank and a portion of the servers partially recovered. The next day, about a third of the servers were restored, and by the evening all but the Dubai server were completely restored. The Dubai server was never completely restored due to damage, and according to 2chan administrators, the recovery of data on the Dubai server was difficult and it was stated that the gallery would be opening on a different server.The webpages of VANK and the Blue House were slowed down due to the attacks. There were reports that routers at VANK exploded, however, VANK had merely blocked Japanese IPs.\n\n== Reactions and responses ==\nPacific Internet Exchange, the managing company of 2chan's servers, declared on March 2 that they were preparing to investigate this event as a cyber-terrorism attack in collaboration with the US's Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), by collecting and analyzing data related to this attack. However, the investigation was not actually carried out. This cyber warfare collaterally impacted some US agencies. Management of Big-server.com stated that a German who enforced cyber-attacks was arrested in the US and sentenced to two years. However, it was later confirmed that this scenario was fantasized by 2chan users, and a US journalist had picked up on this and published an article without checking the details. Because the FBI investigates activity that occurs within the United States, it is unlikely that they have actually investigated this cyber war. CIA, on the other hand, may investigate this incident in collaboration with South Korean or Japanese intelligence agencies, police forces, etc., with the approval of ministries on both ends (Japan has no official collective intelligence agency, instead there are intelligence clusters such as the Chief Cabinet Secretary's intelligence investigators, the Ministry of Justice's Public Inspection Agency, National Police Agency Security Bureau, and the Defense Agency).\nThe head of Voluntary Agency Network of Korea (VANK) stated, \"Japan has hurt their own reputation in the eyes of the international society\", \"Inflicting F5 attacks is no different than what Japan did. We must ignore them.\"\nJoongAng Daily\u2013 Editorials criticized both the way that Japanese netizens reacted to not winning the gold medal, as well as the way Korean netizens similarly reacted to the Japanese netizens.\nKorea Communications Commission stated that they are obtaining a holistic profile of this case and preparing measures. They stated, \"We are worried about how to protect [Korean] netizens if this case evolves into a dispute between the two countries.\"\nMatsumoto Tetsujo, representative of the SoftBank Group, recorded on his blog that \"If Japanese right-wing truly has the ability and the sense of duty for the country, and if there is a site with anti-Japanese sentiments, whether it is Korean or Chinese, why don't they also try gathering total power and launching a multi-scale assault just like the Koreans?\"",

    "instruction": "Logic bomb\n\n==Introduction==\nA logic bomb is a piece of code intentionally inserted into a software system that will set off a malicious function when specified conditions are met. For example, a programmer may hide a piece of code that starts deleting files (such as a salary database trigger), should they ever be terminated from the company.\nSoftware that is inherently malicious, such as viruses and worms, often contain logic bombs that execute a certain payload at a pre-defined time or when some other condition is met. This technique can be used by a virus or worm to gain momentum and spread before being noticed. Some viruses attack their host systems on specific dates, such as Friday the 13th or April Fools' Day. Trojans and other computer viruses that activate on certain dates are often called \"time bombs\".\nTo be considered a logic bomb, the payload should be unwanted and unknown to the user of the software. As an example, trial programs with code that disables certain functionality after a set time are not normally regarded as logic bombs.\n\n== Successful ==\nIn June 2006 Roger Duronio, a system administrator for UBS, was charged with using a logic bomb to damage the company's computer network, and with securities fraud for his failed plan to drive down the company's stock with activation of the logic bomb. Duronio was later convicted and sentenced to 8 years and 1 month in prison, as well as a $3.1 million restitution to UBS.\nOn 20 March 2013, in an attack launched against South Korea, a logic bomb struck machines and \"wiped the hard drives and master boot records of at least three banks and two media companies simultaneously.\" Symantec reported that the malware also contained a component that was capable of wiping Linux machines.\nOn 19 July 2019, David Tinley, a contract employee, pleaded guilty for programming logic bombs within the software he created for Siemens Corporation. The software was intentionally made to malfunction after a certain amount of time, requiring the company to hire him to fix it for a fee. The logic bombs went undetected for two years, but was then discovered while he was out of town and had to hand over the administrative password to his software.\n\n== Attempted ==\nIn February 2000, Tony Xiaotong Yu, indicted before a grand jury, was accused of planting a logic bomb during his employment as a programmer and securities trader at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. The bomb, planted in 1996, had a trigger date of 20 July 2000, but was discovered by other programmers in the company. Removing and cleaning up after the bomb allegedly took several months.\nOn 2 October 2003 Yung-Hsun Lin, also known as Andy Lin, changed code on a server at Medco Health Solutions Inc.'s Fair Lawn, New Jersey headquarters, where he was employed as a Unix administrator, creating a logic bomb set to go off on his birthday in 2004. It failed to work due to a programming error, so Lin corrected the error and reset it to go off on his next birthday, but it was discovered and disabled by a Medco computer systems administrator a few months before the trigger date. Lin pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 months in jail in a federal prison in addition to $81,200 in restitution. The charges held a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of US$250,000.\nOn 29 October 2008 a logic bomb was discovered at American mortgage giant Fannie Mae.  The bomb was planted by Rajendrasinh Babubhai Makwana, an IT contractor who worked at Fannie Mae's Urbana, Maryland facility.  The bomb was set to activate on 31 January 2009 and could have wiped all of Fannie Mae's 4000 servers. Makwana had been terminated around 1:00 p.m. on 24 October 2008 and managed to plant the bomb before his network access was revoked. Makwana was indicted in a Maryland court on 27 January 2009 for unauthorized computer access, convicted on 4 October 2010, and sentenced to 41 months in prison on 17 December 2010.\nIn October 2009, Douglas Duchak was terminated from his job as data analyst at the Colorado Springs Operations Center (CSOC) of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration.  Surveillance cameras captured images of Duchak entering the facility after hours and loading a logic bomb onto a CSOC server that stored data from the U.S. Marshals.  In January 2011, Duchak was sentenced to two years in prison, $60,587 in fines, and three years on probation.  At his sentencing, Duchak tearfully apologized as his lawyer noted that at the time of the incident, Duchak's wife was pregnant with their second child.  The judge at the sentencing mentioned that this logic bomb planting \"incident was an anomaly in an otherwise untarnished work history.\"\n\n== Alleged ==\nThomas C. Reed wrote in his 2004 book At the Abyss: An Insider's History of the Cold War that in 1982, a sabotage occurred on the Trans-Siberian Pipeline because of a logic bomb. According to Reed, a KGB operative stole the plans for a sophisticated control system and its software from a Canadian firm, for use on its Siberian pipeline. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was tipped off by documents in the Farewell Dossier, and had the company insert a logic bomb in the program for sabotage purposes. Critics have contested the authenticity of this account, and it was reported that the story may be a hoax.\n\n== Fictional ==\nIn \"Moffett's Ghost\", an episode of the Airwolf television series, Hawke loses control of the onboard computer, which was programmed on a timer by Airwolf's creator, Doctor Charles Henry Moffett. Once activated, Airwolf is set to destroy any aircraft in its range.\nIn Michael Crichton's book Jurassic Park, computer technician Dennis Nedry inserted an object into the mainframe coding for the park that would shut off the entire island's power (including the supply to the electric fences) in order to steal several dinosaur embryos in the chaos. The logic bomb object was named \"White Rabbit\".\nThe Tom Clancy book Debt of Honor features a logic bomb installed in the code of various stock market computers.\nHugh Jackman's character in Swordfish, Stanley Jobson, claims to have \"dropped a logic bomb through the trapdoor\" while hacking into a Department of Defense network.\nIn the episode \"Scattered\" of the 2004 re-imagining of Battlestar Galactica, the Cylons leave a logic bomb in the ship's computers after briefly gaining access to them.

It is activated by a phone call to a certain number.\nIn Season 6, Episode 8 of Spooks, the Yalta organization sets off a logic bomb planted within the American defense network to shut down all US controlled satellites. It is activated by the entry of a code into a game which causes the logic bomb to copy a virus to all the satellites and shut them down.\nIn Series 6, Episode 2 of NCIS, Abby and McGee have a conversation about logic that gives them the idea of using a logic bomb to hack into computers on a US Naval Carrier to access certain files.

They deploy one or more network taps or enable switch SPAN ports for port mirroring to gain access to traffic. They deploy Zeek on servers with access to those visibility points. The Zeek software on the server deciphers network traffic as logs, writing them to local disk or remote storage.\n\n== Zeek application architecture and analyzers ==\nZeek's event engine analyzes live or recorded network traffic to generate neutral event logs. Zeek uses common ports and dynamic protocol detection (involving signatures as well as behavioral analysis) to identify network protocols.Developers write Zeek policy scripts in the Turing complete Zeek scripting language. By default Zeek logs information about events to files, but analysts can also configure Zeek to take other actions, such as sending an email, raising an alert, executing a system command, updating an internal metric, or calling another Zeek script. \nZeek analyzers perform application layer decoding, anomaly detection, signature matching and connection analysis.  Zeek's developers designed the software to incorporate additional analyzers. The latest method for creating new protocol analyzers relies on the Spicy framework.",

    "instruction": "Context: Reverse domain hijacking\n\n==Introduction==\nReverse domain name hijacking (also known as reverse cybersquatting or commonly abbreviated as 'RDNH'), occurs where a rightful trademark owner attempts to secure a domain name by making cybersquatting claims against a domain name\u2019s \"cybersquatter\" owner.   This often intimidates domain name owners into transferring ownership of their domain names to trademark owners to avoid legal action, particularly when the domain names belong to smaller organizations or individuals.   Reverse domain name hijacking is most commonly enacted by larger corporations and famous individuals, in defense of their rightful trademark or to prevent libel or slander.Reverse domain name \"hijacking\" is a legal remedy to counter the practice of domain squatting, wherein individuals hold many registered domain names containing famous third party trademarks with the intent of profiting by selling the domain names back to trademark owners.   Trademark owners initially responded by filing cybersquatting lawsuits against registrants to enforce their trademark rights.   However, as the number of cybersquatting incidents grew, trademark owners noticed that registrants would often settle their cases rather than litigate.   Cybersquatting lawsuits are a defensive strategy to combat cybersquatting, however such lawsuits may also be used as a way of strongarming innocent domain name registrants into giving up domain names that the trademark owner is not, in fact, entitled to.\n\n\n\n== UDRP restrictions on reverse domain name hijacking ==\nParagraph 15(e) of the UDRP Rules defines reverse domain name hijacking as the filing of a complaint in bad faith, resulting in the abuse of the UDRP administrative process.   It becomes difficult to objectively quantify what constitutes subjective \u201cbad faith,\u201d resulting in panels often viewing parties\u2019 factual discrepancies as indeterminable or immaterial at best.   Therefore, despite its express recognition in the UDRP, reverse domain name hijacking findings are rare and based heavily on the factual circumstances surrounding each case.Circumstances which have been cited by WIPO panels as justification for a finding of reverse domain name hijacking includes:\n\nWhen the registration of the domain predates any trademark rights of the Complainant.\nWhen the complaint has provided no evidence of bad faith registration or use directed towards the Complainant.\nWhere the Complainant has used the UDRP as a Plan \"B\" option to attempt to secure the domain after commercial negotiations have broken off.\nWhere the Complainant has attempted to deceive the domain owner or makes misrepresentations or fails to disclose material information to the panel.Examples of such findings include the following WIPO cases: Gregory Ricks vs. RVK, Inc. (Formally RVKuhns and Associates) (2015), Ron Paul vs. RonPaul.org (2013), Webpass, Inc. v. Paul Breitenbach (2010), Urban Logic, Inc. v. Urban Logic, Peter Holland (2009), David Robinson v.

In attempting to define \u201cexceptional,\u201d Circuit courts are split as to what objectively constitutes malicious, fraudulent, or deliberate misconduct.   Some courts award such fees where bad faith or baseless litigation is involved while other courts look for economic coercion or failure to reference controlling law.

    "instruction": "Context: Lords of Dharmaraja\n\n==Introduction==\nLords of Dharmaraja is the name of a hacker group, allegedly operating in India. This group came into the limelight for threatening to release the source code of Symantec's product Norton Antivirus, and for allegations on Government of India \"arm-twisting\" international mobile manufacturers to spy on United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission(USCC). Symantec has confirmed that the Symantec Endpoint Protection 11.0 and Symantec Antivirus 10.2 version source code has been compromised and obtained by the group, while United States authorities are still investigating allegations suspecting India's hand in spying.This group is alleged, to have hacked and posted a threat by uploading the secret documents, memos, and source code of Symantec's product on Pastebin - a website renowned for source code snippets upload by several users, for public viewing. The group, it seems, has uploaded some secret documents, revealing Indian government arm-twisting international mobile manufacturers like RIM, Apple, and Nokia to assist in spying USCC. In addition to these, the group seems to have claimed in discovering source code related to dozen software companies, which have signed agreements with the Indian TANCS programme and \nCBI.After the hacker's posted their threats, Christopher Soghojan, a security and privacy researcher in USA, tweeted: \"Hackers leak Indian Military Intel memo suggesting Apple has provided intercept backdoor to govs\". He also provided the links to the gallery of images and documents. The documents appear to be related to Tactical Network for Cellular Surveillance (TANCS), technical agreement with mobile manufacturers, and email communication stuff associated with members of USCC.\n\n\n\n== Their claims ==\nAs reported in The Times of India article, the group posted a statement on Pastebin website saying, \"As of now, we start sharing with all our brothers and followers information from the Indian Militaty [sic] Intelligence servers, so far, we have discovered within the Indian Spy Programme source codes of a dozen software companies which have signed agreements with Indian TANCS programme and CBI.\"The group also said, \"Now we release confidential documentation we encountered of Symantec corporation and it's Norton AntiVirus source code which we are going to publish later on, we are working out mirrors as of now since we experience extreme pressure and censorship from US and India government agencies.\"When a correspondent of The Times of India tried to reach an alleged member of the Lords of Dharamraja with the name \"YamaTough,\" he did not reply. YamaTough also has a Twitter account; wherein, he described himself as an \"anonymous [avenger] of Indian independence frontier.\"\n\n== Allegations ==\n\n\n*** Cyber spying ***\nAs reported in The Times of India article, based on uploaded secret memos dated October 6, 2011, international mobile manufacturers like RIM, Apple, and Nokia along with domestic Micromax have given \"backdoor access\" for digital surveillance to Indian military intelligence officials in exchange for doing business in Indian market. In the memo, a decision was also made to sign an agreement with mobile manufacturers in exchange for \"business presence\" in the Indian market because military intelligence has no access to United States Chamber of Commerce's LAN due to VPN and communication gateways like POP servers, etc. The memos further reveal that this \"backdoor\" was allegedly used by Indian intelligence to spy on USCC.As reported in Rediff.com article based on leaked documents, Indian Army's intelligence arm Military intelligence along with Central Bureau of Investigation(CBI) were performing bilateral cellular and Internet surveillance operations right from April 2011. Later, in July 2011, during a meeting of the sub-committee of Military Intelligence, a detailed Cyber Defence Plan for 2011 was prepared and subsequently Military intelligence-Central Bureau of Investigation \"joint operations\" are being conducted daily.Another article on The Register based on uploaded documents says, \"CYCADA\" data intercept team are in operation on the networks using backdoors provided by mobile manufacturers. It also says that the leaked memos elicit conversations between members of USCC on currency issues and discussions on the western firms actions in assisting Chinese aircraft industry to improve its \"avionics\" and engine manufacturing too.As reported by the news agency Reuters, USCC officials have asked the \"concerned authorities to investigate the matter\" and didn't dispute the authenticity of intercepted mails pointing the \"backdoor channel\" as evident in the leaked documents. Also reported on Hindustan Times, Jonathan Weston, a spokesman for USCC, said \"We are aware of these reports and have contacted relevant authorities to investigate the matter.\" Apparently, US authorities are investigating the allegations pointing Indian government's spy-unit hacking into emails of US official panel - that monitors economic and security relations between United States and China.Mobile manufacturer officials, more or less, refused to comment on the issue, when The Times of India contacted the relevant spokesmen or authorities. Alan Hely, a senior director of Corporate Communications at Apple Inc., refused to comment on the leaked documents, but he denied any backdoor access been provided. RIM too, refused to comment on the leaked memos as rumors or speculations, when The Register contacted them; besides, RIM countered them saying, \"it does not do deals with specific countries and has no ability to provide its customer's encryption keys.\" A spokesman for Nokia was quoted as saying, \"The company takes the privacy of customers and their data seriously and is committed to comply with all applicable data protection and privacy laws.\"Speaking to Rediff.com on phone, Indian Army denied the reports of spying on USCC through mobile companies; however, military spokesman said that the uploaded documents were in fact forged with malicious intent.\n\n\n*** Symantec's Anti-virus source code ***\nThe hacker's group threatened to publish the entire source code of Norton Antivirus, a Symantec's product, allegedly stolen after the group has discovered it, while hacking the servers associated with India's Military Intelligence. To add weight to its threats, the group posted some of the hacked source code to Pastebin.\nImperva, a data security company, commented on the hacker group's claims and threats as that would potentially be an embarrassment on Symantec's part. Rob Rachwald from Imperva speculated that the hacker group might have retrieved the files as because the files probably resided on a \"test server\" or were posted to FTP; consequently, exposing them mistakenly and became public unintentionally through negligence. He further said that, \"governments do require source code of vendor products to prove that product is not spyware\".Symantec initially, tried to douse the fears saying that the documentation and preview code is nothing special; accordingly, Chris Paden from Symantec said that the published data and documents are no more than Symantec's API documentation which every software vendor, including Symantec will share with any client, including governments. Eventually, Symantec has confirmed that the source code of Symantec Endpoint Protection 11.0 and Symantec Antivirus 10.2 has been compromised to the hacker group.\n\nQuestions:\nWhat is the name of the hacker group that has allegedly obtained the source code of Symantec's product Norton Antivirus?question: What is the significance of the Symantec's API documentation that was published by the hacker group?question: How did the hacker group Lords of Dharmaraja obtain the Symantec's product source code?question: What is the response of Symantec regarding the hacker group's claims and threats?question: What is the reaction of the mobile manufacturers regarding the allegations of providing \"backdoor access\" for digital surveillance to Indian military intelligence officials?question: What is the purpose of the \"backdoor access\" provided by the international mobile manufacturers to Indian military intelligence officials?question: What is the role of Military intelligence-Central Bureau of Investigation joint operations in the alleged cyber spying?question: What is the response of the Indian Army regarding the allegations of spying on USCC through mobile companies?question: What is the significance of the Tactical Network for Cellular Surveillance (TANCS) in the alleged cyber spying?question: What is the role of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the alleged cyber spying?question: What is the impact of the hacker group's threats on Symantec's reputation?question: What is the significance of the VPN and communication gateways like POP servers in the alleged cyber spying?question: What is the role of the USCC in the alleged cyber spying?question: What is the significance of the intercepted mails pointing to the \"backdoor channel\" in the alleged cyber spying?question: What is the impact of the alleged cyber spying on the relationship between the United States and India?\n\nAnswers:\n",

      "context": "Lords of Dharmaraja\n\n==Introduction==\nLords of Dharmaraja is the name of a hacker group, allegedly operating in India. This group came into the limelight for threatening to release the source code of Symantec's product Norton Antivirus, and for allegations on Government of India \"arm-twisting\" international mobile manufacturers to spy on United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission(USCC). Symantec has confirmed that the Symantec Endpoint Protection 11.0 and Symantec Antivirus 10.2 version source code has been compromised and obtained by the group, while United States authorities are still investigating allegations suspecting India's hand in spying.This group is alleged, to have hacked and posted a threat by uploading the secret documents, memos, and source code of Symantec's product on Pastebin - a website renowned for source code snippets upload by several users, for public viewing. The group, it seems, has uploaded some secret documents, revealing Indian government arm-twisting international mobile manufacturers like RIM, Apple, and Nokia to assist in spying USCC. In addition to these, the group seems to have claimed in discovering source code related to dozen software companies, which have signed agreements with the Indian TANCS programme and \nCBI.After the hacker's posted their threats, Christopher Soghojan, a security and privacy researcher in USA, tweeted: \"Hackers leak Indian Military Intel memo suggesting Apple has provided intercept backdoor to govs\". He also provided the links to the gallery of images and documents. The documents appear to be related to Tactical Network for Cellular Surveillance (TANCS), technical agreement with mobile manufacturers, and email communication stuff associated with members of USCC.\n\n\n\n== Their claims ==\nAs reported in The Times of India article, the group posted a statement on Pastebin website saying, \"As of now, we start sharing with all our brothers and followers information from the Indian Militaty [sic] Intelligence servers, so far, we have discovered within the Indian Spy Programme source codes of a dozen software companies which have signed agreements with Indian TANCS programme and CBI.\"The group also said, \"Now we release confidential documentation we encountered of Symantec corporation and it's Norton AntiVirus source code which we are going to publish later on, we are working out mirrors as of now since we experience extreme pressure and censorship from US and India government agencies.\"When a correspondent of The Times of India tried to reach an alleged member of the Lords of Dharamraja with the name \"YamaTough,\" he did not reply. YamaTough also has a Twitter account; wherein, he described himself as an \"anonymous [avenger] of Indian independence frontier.\"\n\n== Allegations ==\n\n\n*** Cyber spying ***\nAs reported in The Times of India article, based on uploaded secret memos dated October 6, 2011, international mobile manufacturers like RIM, Apple, and Nokia along with domestic Micromax have given \"backdoor access\" for digital surveillance to Indian military intelligence officials in exchange for doing business in Indian market. In the memo, a decision was also made to sign an agreement with mobile manufacturers in exchange for \"business presence\" in the Indian market because military intelligence has no access to United States Chamber of Commerce's LAN due to VPN and communication gateways like POP servers, etc. The memos further reveal that this \"backdoor\" was allegedly used by Indian intelligence to spy on USCC.As reported in Rediff.com article based on leaked documents, Indian Army's intelligence arm Military intelligence along with Central Bureau of Investigation(CBI) were performing bilateral cellular and Internet surveillance operations right from April 2011. Later, in July 2011, during a meeting of the sub-committee of Military Intelligence, a detailed Cyber Defence Plan for 2011 was prepared and subsequently Military intelligence-Central Bureau of Investigation \"joint operations\" are being conducted daily.Another article on The Register based on uploaded documents says, \"CYCADA\" data intercept team are in operation on the networks using backdoors provided by mobile manufacturers. It also says that the leaked memos elicit conversations between members of USCC on currency issues and discussions on the western firms actions in assisting Chinese aircraft industry to improve its \"avionics\" and engine manufacturing too.As reported by the news agency Reuters, USCC officials have asked the \"concerned authorities to investigate the matter\" and didn't dispute the authenticity of intercepted mails pointing the \"backdoor channel\" as evident in the leaked documents. Also reported on Hindustan Times, Jonathan Weston, a spokesman for USCC, said \"We are aware of these reports and have contacted relevant authorities to investigate the matter.\" Apparently, US authorities are investigating the allegations pointing Indian government's spy-unit hacking into emails of US official panel - that monitors economic and security relations between United States and China.Mobile manufacturer officials, more or less, refused to comment on the issue, when The Times of India contacted the relevant spokesmen or authorities. Alan Hely, a senior director of Corporate Communications at Apple Inc., refused to comment on the leaked documents, but he denied any backdoor access been provided. RIM too, refused to comment on the leaked memos as rumors or speculations, when The Register contacted them; besides, RIM countered them saying, \"it does not do deals with specific countries and has no ability to provide its customer's encryption keys.\" A spokesman for Nokia was quoted as saying, \"The company takes the privacy of customers and their data seriously and is committed to comply with all applicable data protection and privacy laws.\"Speaking to Rediff.com on phone, Indian Army denied the reports of spying on USCC through mobile companies; however, military spokesman said that the uploaded documents were in fact forged with malicious intent.\n\n\n*** Symantec's Anti-virus source code ***\nThe hacker's group threatened to publish the entire source code of Norton Antivirus, a Symantec's product, allegedly stolen after the group has discovered it, while hacking the servers associated with India's Military Intelligence. To add weight to its threats, the group posted some of the hacked source code to Pastebin.\nImperva, a data security company, commented on the hacker group's claims and threats as that would potentially be an embarrassment on Symantec's part. Rob Rachwald from Imperva speculated that the hacker group might have retrieved the files as because the files probably resided on a \"test server\" or were posted to FTP; consequently, exposing them mistakenly and became public unintentionally through negligence. He further said that, \"governments do require source code of vendor products to prove that product is not spyware\".Symantec initially, tried to douse the fears saying that the documentation and preview code is nothing special; accordingly, Chris Paden from Symantec said that the published data and documents are no more than Symantec's API documentation which every software vendor, including Symantec will share with any client, including governments. Eventually, Symantec has confirmed that the source code of Symantec Endpoint Protection 11.0 and Symantec Antivirus 10.2 has been compromised to the hacker group.",

    "instruction": "ISO/IEC 5230\n\n==Introduction==\nOpenChain ISO/IEC 5230:2020 is an international standard on the key requirements for a high-quality open source license compliance program. The standard was published jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in late 2020. The standard is based on the Linux Foundation OpenChain Specification 2.1. It focuses on software supply chains, easier procurement and license compliance. Organizations that meet the requirements of the standard can self-certify to ISO/IEC 17021, from an accredited certification body or after successfully completing an audit.\n\n== How the standard works ==\nMost organizations and software products rely on numerous open source components made by third parties, such as frameworks, libraries and containers, coming from diverse and often unaffiliated sources. This is akin to a supply chain in a brick-and-mortar environment and making sure the supply chain is as reliable as possible is considered important from an operational, legal and security standpoint. Upon this premise, a number of players have decided to establish the ground rules for an organization to deal with open source software at whichever level of the supply chain they operate. A working group under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, the OpenChain project. Later, when reaching the 2.0 version, the norms were presented for approval as an ISO/IEC standard.\nAccording to the standard, in order to use open source components effectively, organization must be aware of and comply with all the components involved, the associated open source licenses, and obligations such as copyleft. ISO/IEC 5230 aims to establish a non-prescriptive common understanding of what needs to be addressed within a quality open source compliance program. This makes ISO/IEC 5230 applicable across many industries and organizations and provides benefits to procurement and software supply chains, as open source software tends to be very cumbersome in legal contracts and procurement.\nThe main topics covered by ISO/IEC 5230 and OpenChain-2.1 are:\n\nExistence of an open source policy\nCompetencies of program participants (e.g., legal training for specific tasks).\nAwareness of open source risks among all program participants\nA clearly defined scope, e.g. only specified areas and product lines\nUnderstand and collect licensing obligations for relevant use cases.\nAccess for external open source requests (e.g. to the OSS authors).\nCompliance offices equipped with sufficient resources\nGenerate a Bill of Material\nLicense compliance process (e.g., documents meeting obligations)\nArchiving and provision of compliance artifacts\nA guideline for community engagement and contributionsISO/IEC 5230 does not define how exactly most of the tasks are to be performed, such as whether snippet scanning, revalidation of declared open source licenses is required, and what the compliance artifacts should look like. However, SPDX is now an ISO standard (ISO/IEC 5962) and is mentioned in ISO/IEC 5230 as an example of compliance artifacts.\n\n== Certification ==\nThe OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 Specification identifies the key requirements of a quality open source compliance program. OpenChain Conformance allows organizations to show they meet these requirements. Certification of compliance with ISO/IEC 5230 can be reached in three ways providing a path for organizations of all sizes and program maturity.\n\n\n*** Self-certification ***\nThe OpenChain community provides a free online self-assessment checklist that organizations can use to assess their compliance with the OpenChain Specification. The questionnaire covers various aspects of an organization's software supply chain management practices, including policies, procedures, and documentation related to open source compliance.\nUsing the OpenChain self-assessment questionnaire, an organization can evaluate the effectiveness and completeness of its open source compliance program, identify areas for improvement, and take corrective actions. The questionnaire can also be used as a tool for internal health checks to regularly assess and maintain the organization's compliance program.\nOnce an organization completes the self-assessment questionnaire, it can choose to inform the OpenChain Project and be listed in the OpenChain Project website. However, the progress and results of the assessment are private until the organization decides to submit them for publication. This allows organizations to conduct a thorough self-assessment of their open source compliance program without publicizing any potential issues or gaps in their compliance efforts.\n\n\n*** Independent assessment ***\nAn independent assessment of a high-quality open source compliance program may be performed for additional assurance, accountability, separation of duty, and alignment with enterprise risk management.\nAn independent assessment is typically conducted by individuals within the organization or company but independent from the open source program under evaluation, or by individuals from an external organization or company. Components of an independent assessment may include the following:\n\nSelf-Assessment Questionnaire: The self-assessment questionnaire is a set of questions that helps an organization assess its compliance with the OpenChain Specification. The questionnaire covers various aspects of the organization's software supply chain management processes and practices.\nDocumentation Review: The assessor will review the documentation that the organization has prepared to support its self-certification. This includes policies, procedures, guidelines, and other documentation related to the organization's software supply chain management practices.\nInterview: The assessor will conduct interviews with key personnel within the organization to gain a better understanding of the organization's software supply chain management practices. This helps the assessor to identify any gaps or weaknesses in the organization's compliance with the OpenChain Specification.\nAssessment Report: The assessor will prepare a report that documents the findings of the assessment. The report will identify any non-compliances with the OpenChain Specification and provide recommendations for addressing these non-compliances.\nCertification: If the organization has successfully demonstrated compliance with the OpenChain Specification, the assessor will issue a certificate of compliance. The certificate indicates that the organization has met the requirements of the OpenChain Specification and is authorized to use the OpenChain Conformance Mark.\n\n\n*** Third-party certification ***\nThird-Party Certification for OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 can be carried out by an OpenChain Third-Party Certifier listed on the OpenChain Partners website. Optionally, third parties may be accredited certifiers by numerous registrars worldwide. These organizations may be referred to as certification bodies, registration bodies, assessment and registration bodies, certification/registration bodies, or registrars, depending on the country.\nThe certification process involves an external audit of an organization's open source compliance program against the requirements set out in ISO/IEC 5230. The initial certification is carried out in two stages, as defined in ISO/IEC 17021. The first stage is a review of the documentation of the open source compliance program, which evaluates the existence, design, and completeness of key documents such as the organization's open source policy, clearing process, and staffing. The second stage is an audit, where the open source compliance program is independently audited for evidence that it has been properly implemented, and is in operation. Passing this phase results in receiving a certificate from the external certification body which can be shared with interested parties and displayed on the company's websites.\nAfter certification, the organization is required to maintain compliance with the standard set forth by applicable registration bodies, by undergoing periodic surveillance audits and recertification audits to confirm that the quality open source compliance program continues to function as specified and intended. These follow-up reviews or audits help the organization to identify areas for improvement and ensure that they continue to meet the requirements of the standard.\nOverall, certification of compliance with ISO/IEC 5230 provides independent verification that an organization has implemented a high-quality open source compliance program and is committed to ongoing compliance with the standard. The certification process helps organizations to identify gaps in their compliance program and take corrective actions to improve their open source compliance practices.\n\n== Dissemination ==\nOn October 19, 2020, the Eclipse Foundation announced that it is the first open source foundation to be certified to ISO/IEC 5230. Several companies, including SAP, Toshiba, Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics have publicly announced their conformance to OpenChain.\n\n== Source ==\nFirst version of this article was translated from the article on German Wikipedia.\n\nAnswer these questions based on the above context: What is the purpose of ISO/IEC 5230 and how does it help organizations in managing open source components?question: How does ISO/IEC 5230 enable easier procurement and license compliance in software supply chains?question: How can organizations demonstrate compliance with ISO/IEC 5230?question: What is the role of the OpenChain project in establishing the ground rules for open source software management?question: What are the main topics covered by ISO/IEC 5230 and OpenChain-2.1?question: How does SPDX relate to ISO/IEC 5230 and OpenChain-2.1, and what is its role in compliance artifacts?question: What is the purpose of the OpenChain self-assessment questionnaire in demonstrating compliance?question: What are the components of an independent assessment for OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 certification?question: What are the benefits of undergoing periodic surveillance audits and recertification audits for OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 certification?question: How does the Eclipse Foundation contribute to the promotion and implementation of ISO/IEC 5230?question: How does compliance with ISO/IEC 5230 impact the relationship between organizations and third-party open source contributors?question: How does the existence of an open source policy contribute to a quality open source compliance program?question: How can competencies of program participants, such as legal training, improve open source compliance?question: How does raising awareness of open source risks among all program participants benefit an organization's open source compliance efforts?question: How does having a clearly defined scope for open source compliance contribute to the success of an organization's open source compliance program?",

      "answers": "ISO/IEC 5230 is an international standard that outlines the key requirements for a high-quality open source license compliance program. It helps organizations in managing open source components by establishing a non-prescriptive common understanding of what needs to be addressed within a quality open source compliance program. This includes being aware of and complying with all the components involved, the associated open source licenses, and obligations such as copyleft. The standard is applicable across various industries and organizations, providing benefits to procurement and software supply chains, as open source software tends to have complex legal contracts and procurement processes.answer: ISO/IEC 5230 focuses on software supply chains, making it easier for organizations to manage and comply with open source licenses. By establishing a common understanding of open source compliance, it simplifies procurement processes and helps organizations ensure compliance with open source licenses, reducing potential legal and security risks associated with non-compliance.answer: Organizations can demonstrate compliance with ISO/IEC 5230 by meeting the requirements of the standard and self-certifying through an accredited certification body or after successfully completing an audit. Additionally, organizations can show compliance by using OpenChain Conformance, which allows them to demonstrate that they meet the key requirements of a quality open source compliance program.answer: The OpenChain project, under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, is responsible for establishing the ground rules for organizations to deal with open source software at any level of the supply chain. They developed the OpenChain Specification, which was later presented for approval as an ISO/IEC standard, focusing on ensuring the reliability of open source software supply chains.answer: The main topics covered by ISO/IEC 5230 and OpenChain-2.1 include the existence of an open source policy, competencies of program participants, awareness of open source risks, a clearly defined scope, understanding and collecting licensing obligations, access for external open source requests, compliance offices equipped with sufficient resources, generating a Bill of Material, license compliance processes, archiving and provision of compliance artifacts, and a guideline for community engagement and contributions.answer: SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange) is now an ISO standard (ISO/IEC 5962) and is mentioned in ISO/IEC 5230 as an example of compliance artifacts. SPDX provides a standard format for communicating software bill of materials (SBOM) information, making it easier for organizations to share and understand the open source components used in their products.answer: The OpenChain self-assessment questionnaire is a tool for organizations to assess their compliance with the OpenChain Specification. It covers various aspects of an organization's software supply chain management practices, including policies, procedures, and documentation related to open source compliance. The questionnaire helps organizations evaluate the effectiveness and completeness of their open source compliance program, identify areas for improvement, and take corrective actions.answer: An independent assessment for OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 certification includes a self-assessment questionnaire, documentation review, interviews with key personnel, an assessment report, and certification. The assessment report documents the findings of the assessment, identifies any non-compliances, and provides recommendations for addressing these non-compliances.answer: Periodic surveillance audits and recertification audits help organizations identify areas for improvement, ensure continued compliance with the standard, and maintain the quality open source compliance program. These follow-up reviews provide independent verification that an organization is committed to ongoing compliance with the standard and has a properly implemented open source compliance program.answer: The Eclipse Foundation was the first open source foundation to be certified to ISO/IEC 5230, demonstrating its commitment to implementing high-quality open source license compliance programs. This certification helps promote the adoption and implementation of ISO/IEC 5230 in the open source community, encouraging other organizations to follow best practices in open source compliance.answer: Compliance with ISO/IEC 5230 and the use of a quality open source compliance program help organizations build trust with third-party open source contributors. By demonstrating a commitment to open source best practices, organizations can foster stronger relationships with the open source community, encouraging collaboration and contributions to their projects.answer: The existence of an open source policy provides a clear framework for managing open source components within an organization. It ensures that all stakeholders are aware of the organization's expectations and guidelines for using open source software, promoting compliance with open source licenses and reducing legal and security risks.answer: Competent program participants, especially those with legal training, can significantly improve open source compliance by understanding the complexities of open source licenses and obligations. They can help ensure that the organization complies with all relevant legal requirements, reducing the risk of legal disputes and potential intellectual property issues.answer: Raising awareness of open source risks, such as security vulnerabilities and licensing issues, among all program participants promotes a culture of compliance within the organization. This helps ensure that everyone involved in the software supply chain understands the importance of open source compliance and is vigilant in identifying and addressing potential risks, ultimately reducing the organization's overall risk exposure.answer: A clearly defined scope for open source compliance helps organizations focus their efforts on specific areas and product lines, ensuring that their compliance program is manageable and effective. This enables organizations to allocate resources more efficiently, prioritize high-risk areas, and maintain a consistent level of compliance across their software supply chain."

A security model is implemented through a computer security policy.answer: An access control list (ACL) is a list of permissions associated with a particular object, specifying which users or system processes are granted access to that object. On the other hand, attribute-based access control (ABAC) is a more flexible approach that uses policies to evaluate a multitude of attributes, including user, resource, and environment attributes, to determine access control.answer: The Bell-LaPadula model is a mathematical model of computer security that aims to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

This model is significant as it was one of the first formal models of computer security and is still widely used today.answer: The Biba model is a complementary model to the Bell-LaPadula model, focusing on the integrity of data rather than its confidentiality. The Biba model ensures that data cannot be modified by users who should not have access to it, and it introduces the concepts of \"integrity levels\" and \"write-up rules\" to prevent unauthorized data modifications.answer: The Brewer and Nash model, also known as the Chinese Wall model, is a security model designed to prevent conflicts of interest in a distributed system. It achieves this by ensuring that users who have access to sensitive information in one part of the system cannot access related information in another part, thus preventing any potential conflicts of interest.answer: Capability-based security is a security model that grants access based on the possession of a capability, which is a token that represents the ability to perform a specific action. Discretionary access control (DAC), on the other hand, is a security model that grants access based on the identity and permissions of the user or system process requesting access. Capability-based security is more flexible and less prone to security vulnerabilities than DAC.answer: The Clark-Wilson model is a security model that enforces separation of duties and access control through the use of well-defined interfaces and access control matrices. It introduces the concepts of \"constrained data items\" and \"unconstrained data items\" to ensure that sensitive data can only be accessed through well-defined and controlled interfaces.answer: Context-based access control (CBAC) is a security model that uses contextual information, such as the time of day or the location of the user, to determine access control.

    "instruction": "Billboard hacking\n\n==Introduction==\nBillboard hacking or billboard hijacking is the illegal practice of altering a billboard without the consent of the owner. It may involve physically pasting new media over the existing image, or hacking into the system used to control electronic billboard displays. The aim is to replace the programmed video with a different video or image. The replaced media may be displayed for various reasons, including culture jamming, shock value, promotion, activism, political propaganda, or simply to amuse viewers.\n\n== Self-promotion ==\nA Russian daredevil group called Ontheroofs hacked into a billboard atop a skyscraper in Hong Kong, causing it to display the name of their organization, a video of a previous climb up the then unfinished Shanghai Tower, and the words \"What's Up Hong Kong\".Two college students in Belgrade, Serbia hacked into a billboard and then contacted the owner describing the vulnerability. The hack allowed them to play Space Invaders and then display \"Hacked4Fun\". The students were thanked by the owner for pointing out the vulnerability and each given an iPad Mini.In Republic Square, Belgrade, Serbia, hackers caused a billboard to display an advertisement for The Pirate Bay which read \"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.\"\n\n== Activism ==\n\nA group named \"Brandalism\" has been hacking European billboards since 2012. Around November 2015, just prior to the Paris climate talks (COP21), street artists joined with this group and gained control of around 600 billboards around Paris making display the message \"We'll keep on bribing politicians and emitting greenhouse gases\" and a Volkswagen promotion reading \"We're sorry that we got caught.\"In London, students recreated film posters with black leads and installed them in bus shelter advertising spaces. These posters sought to highlight the lack of black representation in popular culture.\n\n== Legal response ==\nDepending on the circumstances, billboard hacking may be illegal.

    "instruction": "Scrypt\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, scrypt (pronounced \"ess crypt\") is a password-based key derivation function created by Colin Percival in March 2009, originally for the Tarsnap online backup service. The algorithm was specifically designed to make it costly to perform large-scale custom hardware attacks by requiring large amounts of memory. In 2016, the scrypt algorithm was published by IETF as RFC 7914. A simplified version of scrypt is used as a proof-of-work scheme by a number of cryptocurrencies, first implemented by an anonymous programmer called ArtForz in Tenebrix and followed by Fairbrix and Litecoin soon after.\n\n== Introduction ==\nA password-based key derivation function (password-based KDF) is generally designed to be computationally intensive, so that it takes a relatively long time to compute (say on the order of several hundred milliseconds). Legitimate users only need to perform the function once per operation (e.g., authentication), and so the time required is negligible. However, a brute-force attack would likely need to perform the operation billions of times, at which point the time requirements become significant and, ideally, prohibitive.\nPrevious password-based KDFs (such as the popular PBKDF2 from RSA Laboratories) have relatively low resource demands, meaning they do not require elaborate hardware or very much memory to perform. They are therefore easily and cheaply implemented in hardware (for instance on an ASIC or even an FPGA). This allows an attacker with sufficient resources to launch a large-scale parallel attack by building hundreds or even thousands of implementations of the algorithm in hardware and having each search a different subset of the key space. This divides the amount of time needed to complete a brute-force attack by the number of implementations available, very possibly bringing it down to a reasonable time frame.\nThe scrypt function is designed to hinder such attempts by raising the resource demands of the algorithm. Specifically, the algorithm is designed to use a large amount of memory compared to other password-based KDFs, making the size and the cost of a hardware implementation much more expensive, and therefore limiting the amount of parallelism an attacker can use, for a given amount of financial resources.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe large memory requirements of scrypt come from a large vector of pseudorandom bit strings that are generated as part of the algorithm. Once the vector is generated, the elements of it are accessed in a pseudo-random order and combined to produce the derived key. A straightforward implementation would need to keep the entire vector in RAM so that it can be accessed as needed.\nBecause the elements of the vector are generated algorithmically, each element could be generated on the fly as needed, only storing one element in memory at a time and therefore cutting the memory requirements significantly. However, the generation of each element is intended to be computationally expensive, and the elements are expected to be accessed many times throughout the execution of the function. Thus there is a significant trade-off in speed to get rid of the large memory requirements.\nThis sort of time\u2013memory trade-off often exists in computer algorithms: speed can be increased at the cost of using more memory, or memory requirements decreased at the cost of performing more operations and taking longer. The idea behind scrypt is to deliberately make this trade-off costly in either direction. Thus an attacker could use an implementation that doesn't require many resources (and can therefore be massively parallelized with limited expense) but runs very slowly, or use an implementation that runs more quickly but has very large memory requirements and is therefore more expensive to parallelize.\n\n== Algorithm ==\nFunction scrypt\n   Inputs: This algorithm includes the following parameters:\n      Passphrase:                Bytes    string of characters to be hashed\n      Salt:                      Bytes    string of random characters that modifies the hash to protect against Rainbow table attacks\n      CostFactor (N):            Integer  CPU/memory cost parameter \u2013 Must be a power of 2 (e.g. 1024)\n      BlockSizeFactor (r):       Integer  blocksize parameter, which fine-tunes sequential memory read size and performance. (8 is commonly used)\n      ParallelizationFactor (p): Integer  Parallelization parameter. (1 .. 232-1 * hLen/MFlen)\n      DesiredKeyLen (dkLen):     Integer  Desired key length in bytes (Intended output length in octets of the derived key; a positive integer satisfying dkLen \u2264 (232\u2212 1) * hLen.)\n      hLen:                      Integer  The length in octets of the hash function (32 for SHA256).\n      MFlen:                     Integer  The length in octets of the output of the mixing function (SMix below). Defined as r * 128 in RFC7914.\n   Output:\n      DerivedKey:                Bytes    array of bytes, DesiredKeyLen long\n\n   Step 1. Generate expensive salt\n   blockSize \u2190 128*BlockSizeFactor  // Length (in bytes) of the SMix mixing function output (e.g. 128*8\n\n== Cryptocurrency uses ==\nScrypt is used in many cryptocurrencies as a proof-of-work algorithm (more precisely, as the hash function in the Hashcash proof-of-work algorithm). It was first implemented for Tenebrix (released in September 2011) and served as the basis for Litecoin and Dogecoin, which also adopted its scrypt algorithm. Mining of cryptocurrencies that use scrypt is often performed on graphics processing units (GPUs) since GPUs tend to have significantly more processing power (for some algorithms) compared to the CPU. This led to shortages of high end GPUs due to the rising price of these currencies in the months of November and December 2013.As of May 2014, specialized ASIC mining hardware is available for scrypt-based cryptocurrencies.\n\n== Utility ==\nThe scrypt utility was written in May 2009 by Colin Percival as a demonstration of the scrypt key derivation function. It's available in most Linux and BSD distributions.\nHere are some questions you should answer: How does scrypt differ from other password-based KDFs in terms of memory requirements?Question: What is the purpose of the large vector of pseudorandom bit strings generated by scrypt?Question: What is the trade-off between speed and memory in scrypt?Question: What is the purpose of the CostFactor parameter in scrypt?Question: What is the purpose of the BlockSizeFactor parameter in scrypt?Question: What is the purpose of the ParallelizationFactor parameter in scrypt?Question: What is the purpose of the DesiredKeyLen parameter in scrypt?Question: How does scrypt protect against Rainbow table attacks?Question: What is the utility of the scrypt utility written by Colin Percival?Question: How is scrypt used in cryptocurrencies?Question: Which hardware is commonly used for mining cryptocurrencies that use scrypt?Question: What led to shortages of high end GPUs in the months of November and December 2013?Question: When was the scrypt utility written by Colin Percival available in most Linux and BSD distributions?Question: What is the purpose of the hLen parameter in scrypt?Question: What is the purpose of the MFlen parameter in scrypt?",

Thus an attacker could use an implementation that doesn't require many resources (and can therefore be massively parallelized with limited expense) but runs very slowly, or use an implementation that runs more quickly but has very large memory requirements and is therefore more expensive to parallelize.\n\n== Algorithm ==\nFunction scrypt\n   Inputs: This algorithm includes the following parameters:\n      Passphrase:                Bytes    string of characters to be hashed\n      Salt:                      Bytes    string of random characters that modifies the hash to protect against Rainbow table attacks\n      CostFactor (N):            Integer  CPU/memory cost parameter \u2013 Must be a power of 2 (e.g. 1024)\n      BlockSizeFactor (r):       Integer  blocksize parameter, which fine-tunes sequential memory read size and performance. (8 is commonly used)\n      ParallelizationFactor (p): Integer  Parallelization parameter. (1 .. 232-1 * hLen/MFlen)\n      DesiredKeyLen (dkLen):     Integer  Desired key length in bytes (Intended output length in octets of the derived key; a positive integer satisfying dkLen \u2264 (232\u2212 1) * hLen.)\n      hLen:                      Integer  The length in octets of the hash function (32 for SHA256).\n      MFlen:                     Integer  The length in octets of the output of the mixing function (SMix below). Defined as r * 128 in RFC7914.\n   Output:\n      DerivedKey:                Bytes    array of bytes, DesiredKeyLen long\n\n   Step 1. Generate expensive salt\n   blockSize \u2190 128*BlockSizeFactor  // Length (in bytes) of the SMix mixing function output (e.g. 128*8\n\n== Cryptocurrency uses ==\nScrypt is used in many cryptocurrencies as a proof-of-work algorithm (more precisely, as the hash function in the Hashcash proof-of-work algorithm). It was first implemented for Tenebrix (released in September 2011) and served as the basis for Litecoin and Dogecoin, which also adopted its scrypt algorithm. Mining of cryptocurrencies that use scrypt is often performed on graphics processing units (GPUs) since GPUs tend to have significantly more processing power (for some algorithms) compared to the CPU. This led to shortages of high end GPUs due to the rising price of these currencies in the months of November and December 2013.As of May 2014, specialized ASIC mining hardware is available for scrypt-based cryptocurrencies.\n\n== Utility ==\nThe scrypt utility was written in May 2009 by Colin Percival as a demonstration of the scrypt key derivation function. It's available in most Linux and BSD distributions.",

    "instruction": "Rogue security software\n\n==Introduction==\nRogue security software is a form of malicious software and internet fraud that misleads users into believing there is a virus on their computer and aims to convince them to pay for a fake malware removal tool that actually installs malware on their computer. It is a form of scareware that manipulates users through fear, and a form of ransomware. Rogue security software has been a serious security threat in desktop computing since 2008. An early example that gained infamy was SpySheriff and its clones, such as Nava Shield.\n\n\n\n== Propagation ==\nRogue security software mainly relies on social engineering (fraud) to defeat the security built into modern operating system and browser software and install itself onto victims' computers.  A website may, for example, display a fictitious warning dialog stating that someone's machine is infected with a computer virus, and encourage them through manipulation to install or purchase scareware in the belief that they are purchasing genuine antivirus software.\nMost have a Trojan horse component, which users are misled into installing.  The Trojan may be disguised as:\n\nA browser plug-in or extension (typically toolbar)\nAn image, screensaver or archive file attached to an e-mail message\nMultimedia codec required to play a certain video clip\nSoftware shared on peer-to-peer networks\nA free online malware-scanning serviceSome rogue security software, however, propagate onto users' computers as drive-by downloads which exploit security vulnerabilities in web browsers, PDF viewers, or email clients to install themselves without any manual interaction.More recently, malware distributors have been utilizing SEO poisoning techniques by pushing infected URLs to the top of search engine results about recent news events. People looking for articles on such events on a search engine may encounter results that, upon being clicked, are instead redirected through a series of sites before arriving at a landing page that says that their machine is infected and pushes a download to a \"trial\" of the rogue program.  A 2010 study by Google found 11,000 domains hosting fake anti-virus software, accounting for 50% of all malware delivered via internet advertising.Cold-calling has also become a vector for distribution of this type of malware, with callers often claiming to be from \"Microsoft Support\" or another legitimate organization.\n\n== Common infection vectors ==\n\n\n*** Black Hat SEO ***\nBlack Hat search engine optimization (SEO) is a technique used to trick search engines into displaying malicious URLs in search results. The malicious webpages are filled with popular keywords in order to achieve a higher ranking in the search results. When the end user searches the web, one of these infected webpages is returned. Usually the most popular keywords from services such as Google Trends are used to generate webpages via PHP scripts placed on the compromised website. These PHP scripts will then monitor for search engine crawlers and feed them with specially crafted webpages that are then listed in the search results. Then, when the user searches for their keyword or images and clicks on the malicious link, they will be redirected to the Rogue security software payload.\n\n\n*** Malvertising ***\nMost websites usually employ third-party services for advertising on their webpages. If one of these advertising services is compromised, they may end up inadvertently infecting all of the websites using their service by advertising rogue security software.\n\n\n*** Spam campaigns ***\nSpam messages that include malicious attachments, links to binaries and drive-by download sites are another common mechanism for distributing rogue security software. Spam emails are often sent with content associated with typical day-to-day activities such as parcel deliveries, or taxation documents, designed to entice users to click on links or run attachments. When users succumb to these kinds of social engineering tricks they are quickly infected either directly via the attachment, or indirectly via a malicious website. This is known as a drive-by download. Usually in drive-by download attacks the malware is installed on the victim's machine without any interaction or awareness and occurs simply by visiting the website.\n\n== Operation ==\nOnce installed, the rogue security software may then attempt to entice the user into purchasing a service or additional software by:\n\nAlerting the user with the fake or simulated detection of malware or pornography.\nDisplaying an animation simulating a system crash and reboot.\nSelectively disabling parts of the system to prevent the user from uninstalling the malware.  Some may also prevent anti-malware programs from running, disable automatic system software updates and block access to websites of anti-malware vendors.\nInstalling actual malware onto the computer, then alerting the user after \"detecting\" them.  This method is less common as the malware is likely to be detected by legitimate anti-malware programs.\nAltering system registries and security settings, then \"alerting\" the user.Developers of rogue security software may also entice people into purchasing their product by claiming to give a portion of their sales to a charitable cause. The rogue Green antivirus, for example, claims to donate $2 to an environmental care program for each sale made.\nSome rogue security software overlaps in function with scareware by also:\n\nPresenting offers to fix urgent performance problems or perform essential housekeeping on the computer.\nScaring the user by presenting authentic-looking pop-up warnings and security alerts, which may mimic actual system notices.  These are intended to use the trust that the user has in vendors of legitimate security software.Sanction by the FTC and the increasing effectiveness of anti-malware tools since 2006 have made it difficult for spyware and adware distribution networks\u2014already complex to begin with\u2014to operate profitably.  Malware vendors have turned instead to the simpler, more profitable business model of rogue security software, which is targeted directly at users of desktop computers.Rogue security software is often distributed through highly lucrative affiliate networks, in which affiliates supplied with Trojan kits for the software are paid a fee for every successful installation, and a commission from any resulting purchases.  The affiliates then become responsible for setting up infection vectors and distribution infrastructure for the software.  An investigation by security researchers into the Antivirus XP 2008 rogue security software found just such an affiliate network, in which members were grossing commissions upwards of $USD150,000 over 10 days, from tens of thousands of successful installations.\n\n== Countermeasures ==\n\n\n*** Private efforts ***\nLaw enforcement and legislation in all countries are slow to react to the appearance of rogue security software. In contrast, several private initiatives providing discussion forums and lists of dangerous products were founded soon after the appearance of the first rogue security software. Some reputable vendors, such as Kaspersky, also began to provide lists of rogue security software. In 2005, the Anti-Spyware Coalition was founded, a coalition of anti-spyware software companies, academics, and consumer groups.\nMany of the private initiatives were initially informal discussions on general Internet forums, but some were started or even entirely carried out by individual people. The perhaps most famous and extensive one is the Spyware Warrior list of rogue/suspect antispyware products and websites by Eric Howes, which has however not been updated since May 2007. The website recommends checking the following websites for new rogue anti-spyware programs, most of which are not really new and are \"simply re-branded clones and knockoffs of the same rogue applications that have been around for years.\"\n\n\n*** Government efforts ***\nIn December 2008, the US District Court for Maryland\u2014at the request of the FTC\u2014issued a restraining order against Innovative Marketing Inc, a Kyiv-based firm producing and marketing the rogue security software products WinFixer, WinAntivirus, DriveCleaner, ErrorSafe, and XP Antivirus.  The company and its US-based web host, ByteHosting Internet Hosting Services LLC, had their assets frozen, were barred from using domain names associated with those products and any further advertisement or false representation.Law enforcement has also exerted pressure on banks to shut down merchant gateways involved in processing rogue security software purchases.  In some cases, the high volume of credit card chargebacks generated by such purchases has also prompted processors to take action against rogue security software vendors.\n\nWhat is rogue security software and how does it mislead users into installing it on their computers?Q: What is the Trojan horse component of rogue security software and how does it get installed on a user's computer?Q: How do rogue security software distributors exploit security vulnerabilities in web browsers to install the software on users' computers?Q: How do rogue security software distributors utilize SEO poisoning techniques to propagate the software?Q: How do spam campaigns contribute to the distribution of rogue security software?Q: What is Black Hat SEO and how is it used to distribute rogue security software?Q: How do rogue security software developers entice users into purchasing their products?Q: How do rogue security software vendors make money from their business model?Q: What is the Anti-Spyware Coalition and what was its role in addressing rogue security software?Q: How has law enforcement taken action against rogue security software vendors?Q: How has legislation reacted to the appearance of rogue security software?Q: How do rogue security software affiliates get paid for their work?Q: How do rogue security software developers claim to give a portion of their sales to charitable causes?Q: How do rogue security software distributors use social engineering to defeat security built into modern operating systems and browser software?Q: How do rogue security software distributors exploit search engine optimization to distribute their products?",

      "context": "Rogue security software\n\n==Introduction==\nRogue security software is a form of malicious software and internet fraud that misleads users into believing there is a virus on their computer and aims to convince them to pay for a fake malware removal tool that actually installs malware on their computer. It is a form of scareware that manipulates users through fear, and a form of ransomware. Rogue security software has been a serious security threat in desktop computing since 2008. An early example that gained infamy was SpySheriff and its clones, such as Nava Shield.\n\n\n\n== Propagation ==\nRogue security software mainly relies on social engineering (fraud) to defeat the security built into modern operating system and browser software and install itself onto victims' computers.  A website may, for example, display a fictitious warning dialog stating that someone's machine is infected with a computer virus, and encourage them through manipulation to install or purchase scareware in the belief that they are purchasing genuine antivirus software.\nMost have a Trojan horse component, which users are misled into installing.  The Trojan may be disguised as:\n\nA browser plug-in or extension (typically toolbar)\nAn image, screensaver or archive file attached to an e-mail message\nMultimedia codec required to play a certain video clip\nSoftware shared on peer-to-peer networks\nA free online malware-scanning serviceSome rogue security software, however, propagate onto users' computers as drive-by downloads which exploit security vulnerabilities in web browsers, PDF viewers, or email clients to install themselves without any manual interaction.More recently, malware distributors have been utilizing SEO poisoning techniques by pushing infected URLs to the top of search engine results about recent news events. People looking for articles on such events on a search engine may encounter results that, upon being clicked, are instead redirected through a series of sites before arriving at a landing page that says that their machine is infected and pushes a download to a \"trial\" of the rogue program.  A 2010 study by Google found 11,000 domains hosting fake anti-virus software, accounting for 50% of all malware delivered via internet advertising.Cold-calling has also become a vector for distribution of this type of malware, with callers often claiming to be from \"Microsoft Support\" or another legitimate organization.\n\n== Common infection vectors ==\n\n\n*** Black Hat SEO ***\nBlack Hat search engine optimization (SEO) is a technique used to trick search engines into displaying malicious URLs in search results. The malicious webpages are filled with popular keywords in order to achieve a higher ranking in the search results. When the end user searches the web, one of these infected webpages is returned. Usually the most popular keywords from services such as Google Trends are used to generate webpages via PHP scripts placed on the compromised website. These PHP scripts will then monitor for search engine crawlers and feed them with specially crafted webpages that are then listed in the search results. Then, when the user searches for their keyword or images and clicks on the malicious link, they will be redirected to the Rogue security software payload.\n\n\n*** Malvertising ***\nMost websites usually employ third-party services for advertising on their webpages. If one of these advertising services is compromised, they may end up inadvertently infecting all of the websites using their service by advertising rogue security software.\n\n\n*** Spam campaigns ***\nSpam messages that include malicious attachments, links to binaries and drive-by download sites are another common mechanism for distributing rogue security software. Spam emails are often sent with content associated with typical day-to-day activities such as parcel deliveries, or taxation documents, designed to entice users to click on links or run attachments. When users succumb to these kinds of social engineering tricks they are quickly infected either directly via the attachment, or indirectly via a malicious website. This is known as a drive-by download. Usually in drive-by download attacks the malware is installed on the victim's machine without any interaction or awareness and occurs simply by visiting the website.\n\n== Operation ==\nOnce installed, the rogue security software may then attempt to entice the user into purchasing a service or additional software by:\n\nAlerting the user with the fake or simulated detection of malware or pornography.\nDisplaying an animation simulating a system crash and reboot.\nSelectively disabling parts of the system to prevent the user from uninstalling the malware.  Some may also prevent anti-malware programs from running, disable automatic system software updates and block access to websites of anti-malware vendors.\nInstalling actual malware onto the computer, then alerting the user after \"detecting\" them.  This method is less common as the malware is likely to be detected by legitimate anti-malware programs.\nAltering system registries and security settings, then \"alerting\" the user.Developers of rogue security software may also entice people into purchasing their product by claiming to give a portion of their sales to a charitable cause. The rogue Green antivirus, for example, claims to donate $2 to an environmental care program for each sale made.\nSome rogue security software overlaps in function with scareware by also:\n\nPresenting offers to fix urgent performance problems or perform essential housekeeping on the computer.\nScaring the user by presenting authentic-looking pop-up warnings and security alerts, which may mimic actual system notices.  These are intended to use the trust that the user has in vendors of legitimate security software.Sanction by the FTC and the increasing effectiveness of anti-malware tools since 2006 have made it difficult for spyware and adware distribution networks\u2014already complex to begin with\u2014to operate profitably.  Malware vendors have turned instead to the simpler, more profitable business model of rogue security software, which is targeted directly at users of desktop computers.Rogue security software is often distributed through highly lucrative affiliate networks, in which affiliates supplied with Trojan kits for the software are paid a fee for every successful installation, and a commission from any resulting purchases.  The affiliates then become responsible for setting up infection vectors and distribution infrastructure for the software.  An investigation by security researchers into the Antivirus XP 2008 rogue security software found just such an affiliate network, in which members were grossing commissions upwards of $USD150,000 over 10 days, from tens of thousands of successful installations.\n\n== Countermeasures ==\n\n\n*** Private efforts ***\nLaw enforcement and legislation in all countries are slow to react to the appearance of rogue security software. In contrast, several private initiatives providing discussion forums and lists of dangerous products were founded soon after the appearance of the first rogue security software. Some reputable vendors, such as Kaspersky, also began to provide lists of rogue security software. In 2005, the Anti-Spyware Coalition was founded, a coalition of anti-spyware software companies, academics, and consumer groups.\nMany of the private initiatives were initially informal discussions on general Internet forums, but some were started or even entirely carried out by individual people. The perhaps most famous and extensive one is the Spyware Warrior list of rogue/suspect antispyware products and websites by Eric Howes, which has however not been updated since May 2007. The website recommends checking the following websites for new rogue anti-spyware programs, most of which are not really new and are \"simply re-branded clones and knockoffs of the same rogue applications that have been around for years.\"\n\n\n*** Government efforts ***\nIn December 2008, the US District Court for Maryland\u2014at the request of the FTC\u2014issued a restraining order against Innovative Marketing Inc, a Kyiv-based firm producing and marketing the rogue security software products WinFixer, WinAntivirus, DriveCleaner, ErrorSafe, and XP Antivirus.  The company and its US-based web host, ByteHosting Internet Hosting Services LLC, had their assets frozen, were barred from using domain names associated with those products and any further advertisement or false representation.Law enforcement has also exerted pressure on banks to shut down merchant gateways involved in processing rogue security software purchases.  In some cases, the high volume of credit card chargebacks generated by such purchases has also prompted processors to take action against rogue security software vendors.",

    "instruction": "Private biometrics\n\n==Introduction==\nPrivate biometrics is a form of encrypted biometrics, also called privacy-preserving biometric authentication methods, in which the biometric payload is a one-way, homomorphically encrypted feature vector that is 0.05% the size of the original biometric template and can be searched with full accuracy, speed and privacy. The feature vector's homomorphic encryption allows search and match to be conducted in polynomial time on an encrypted dataset and the search result is returned as an encrypted match. One or more computing devices may use an encrypted feature vector to verify an individual person (1:1 verify) or identify an individual in a datastore (1:many identify) without storing, sending or receiving plaintext biometric data within or between computing devices or any other entity.  The purpose of private biometrics is to allow a person to be identified or authenticated while guaranteeing individual privacy and fundamental human rights by only operating on biometric data in the encrypted space. Some private biometrics including fingerprint authentication methods, face authentication methods, and identity-matching algorithms according to bodily features. Private biometrics are constantly evolving based on the changing nature of privacy needs, identity theft, and biotechnology.   \n\n\n\n== Background ==\nBiometric security strengthens user authentication but, until recently, also implied important risks to personal privacy.  Indeed, while compromised passwords can be easily replaced and are not personally identifiable information(PII), biometric data is considered highly sensitive due to its personal nature, unique association with users, and the fact that compromised biometrics (biometric templates) cannot be revoked or replaced. Private biometrics have been developed to address this challenge. Private Biometrics provide the necessary biometric authentication while simultaneously minimizing user's privacy exposure through the use of one-way, fully homomorphic encryption.\nThe Biometric Open Protocol Standard, IEEE 2410-2018, was updated in 2018 to include private biometrics and stated that the one-way fully homomorphic encrypted feature vectors, \u201c...bring a new level of consumer privacy assurance by keeping biometric data encrypted both at rest and in transit.\u201d  The Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS III) also noted a key benefit of private biometrics was the new standard allowed for simplification of the API since the biometric payload was always one-way encrypted and therefore had no need for key management.\n\n== Fully homomorphic cryptosystems for biometrics ==\nHistorically, biometric matching techniques have been unable to operate in the encrypted space and have required the biometric to be visible (unencrypted) at specific points during search and match operations. This decrypt requirement made large-scale search across encrypted biometrics (\u201c1:many identify\u201d) infeasible due to both significant overhead issues (e.g. complex key management and significant data storage and processing requirements) and the substantial risk that the biometrics were vulnerable to loss when processed in plaintext within the application or operating system (see FIDO Alliance, for example).\nBiometric security vendors complying with data privacy laws and regulations (including Apple FaceID, Samsung, Google) therefore focused their efforts on the simpler 1:1 verify problem and were unable to overcome the large computational demands required for linear scan to solve the 1:many identify problem.Today, private biometric cryptosystems overcome these limitations and risks through the use of one-way, fully homomorphic encryption. This form of encryption allows computations to be carried out on ciphertext, allows the match to be conducted on an encrypted dataset without decrypting the reference biometric, and returns an encrypted match result. Matching in the encrypted space offers the highest levels of accuracy, speed and privacy and eliminates the risks associated with decrypting biometrics.\n\n\n*** Accuracy: same as plaintext (99%) ***\nThe private biometric feature vector is much smaller (0.05% the size of the original biometric template) but yet maintains the same accuracy as the original plaintext reference biometric.  In testing using Google's unified embedding for face recognition and clustering CNN (\u201cFacenet\u201d), Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) (source), and other open source faces, private biometric feature vectors returned the same accuracy as plaintext facial recognition. Using an 8MB facial biometric, one vendor reported an accuracy rate of 98.7%. The same vendor reported accuracy increased to 99.99% when using three 8MB facial biometrics and a vote algorithm (best two out of 3) to predict.As the quality of the facial biometric image declined, accuracy degraded very slowly. For 256kB facial images (3% the quality of an 8MB picture), the same vendor reported 96.3% accuracy and that the neural network was able to maintain similar accuracy through boundary conditions including extreme cases of light or background.\n\n\n*** Speed: polynomial search (same as plaintext) ***\nThe private biometric feature vector is 4kB and contains 128 floating point numbers. In contrast, plaintext biometric security instances (including Apple Face ID) currently use 7MB to 8MB reference facial biometrics (templates). By using the much smaller feature vector, the resulting search performance is less than one second per prediction using a datastore of 100 million open source faces (\u201cpolynomial search\u201d). The private biometric test model used for these results was Google's unified embedding for face recognition and clustering CNN (\u201cFacenet\u201d), Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) (source), and other open source faces.\n\n\n*** Privacy: full compliance with privacy regulations worldwide ***\nAs with all ideal one-way cryptographic hash functions, decrypt keys do not exist for private biometrics so it is infeasible to generate the original biometric message from the private biometric feature vector (its hash value) except by trying all possible messages. Unlike passwords, however, no two instances of a biometric are exactly the same or, stated in another way, there is no constant biometric value, so a brute force attack using all possible faces would only produce an approximate (fuzzy) match. Privacy and fundamental human rights are therefore guaranteed.\nSpecifically, the private biometric feature vector is produced by a one-way cryptographic hash algorithm that maps plaintext biometric data of arbitrary size to a small feature vector of a fixed size (4kB) that is mathematically impossible to invert. The one-way encryption algorithm is typically achieved using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), which takes a vector of arbitrary real-valued scores and squashes it to a 4kB vector of values between zero and one that sum to one. It is mathematically impossible to reconstruct the original plaintext image from a private biometric feature vector of 128 floating point numbers.\n\n== One-way encryption, history and modern use ==\nOne-way encryptions offer unlimited privacy by containing no mechanism to reverse the encryption and disclose the original data. Once a value is processed through a one-way hash, it is not possible to discover to the original value (hence the name \u201cone-way\u201d).\n\n\n*** History ***\nThe first one-way encryptions were likely developed by James H. Ellis, Clifford Cocks, and Malcolm Williamson at the UK intelligence agency GCHQ during the 1960s and 1970s and were published independently by Diffie and Hellman in 1976 (History of cryptography). Common modern one-way encryption algorithms, including MD5 (message digest) and SHA-512 (secure hash algorithm) are similar to the first such algorithms in that they also contain no mechanism to disclose the original data. The output of these modern one-way encryptions offer high privacy but are not homomorphic, meaning that the results of the one-way encryptions do not allow high order math operations (such as match). For example, we cannot use two SHA-512 sums to compare the closeness of two encrypted documents. This limitation makes it impossible for these one-way encryptions to be used to support classifying models in machine learning\u2014or nearly anything else.\n\n\n*** Modern use ***\nThe first one-way, homomorphically encrypted, Euclidean-measurable feature vector for biometric processing was proposed in a paper by Streit, Streit and Suffian in 2017.\n  \nIn this paper, the authors theorized and also demonstrated using a small sample size (n\n\nHow does private biometrics differ from traditional biometric methods in terms of data privacy?question: What is the purpose of homomorphic encryption in private biometrics?question: How do private biometrics address the challenge of biometric templates being highly sensitive and irrevocable?question: How does the Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS III) simplify the API for private biometrics?question: What limitations did historical biometric matching techniques face in operating in the encrypted space?question: How does the use of one-way, fully homomorphic encryption in private biometric cryptosystems enhance accuracy and speed?question: How does the private biometric feature vector maintain high accuracy despite being much smaller than the original biometric template?question: How does the smaller size of the private biometric feature vector impact search performance?question: How does the one-way cryptographic hash algorithm used in private biometrics protect user privacy?question: What is the difference between traditional one-way encryptions and one-way, homomorphically encrypted feature vectors for biometric processing?question: Who developed the first one-way encryptions and when were they published?question: What is the significance of the first one-way, homomorphically encrypted, Euclidean-measurable feature vector for biometric processing?question: How does the proposed feature vector in the 2017 paper enhance biometric processing?question: What advantages does the use of pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN) offer in private biometrics?question: How does private biometrics ensure compliance with privacy regulations worldwide?",

    "instruction": "Ciphertext stealing\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, ciphertext stealing (CTS) is a general method of using a block cipher mode of operation that allows for processing of messages that are not evenly divisible into blocks without resulting in any expansion of the ciphertext, at the cost of slightly increased complexity.\n\n== General characteristics ==\nCiphertext stealing is a technique for encrypting plaintext using a block cipher, without padding the message to a multiple of the block size, so the ciphertext is the same size as the plaintext.\nIt does this by altering processing of the last two blocks of the message.  The processing of all but the last two blocks is unchanged, but a portion of the second-to-last block's ciphertext is \"stolen\" to pad the last plaintext block.  The padded final block is then encrypted as usual.\nThe final ciphertext, for the last two blocks, consists of the partial penultimate block (with the \"stolen\" portion omitted) plus the full final block, which are the same size as the original plaintext.\nDecryption requires decrypting the final block first, then restoring the stolen ciphertext to the penultimate block, which can\nthen be decrypted as usual.\nIn principle any block-oriented block cipher mode of operation can be used, but stream-cipher-like modes can already be applied to messages of arbitrary length without padding, so they do not benefit from this technique.  The common modes of operation that are coupled with ciphertext stealing are Electronic Codebook (ECB) and Cipher Block Chaining (CBC).\nCiphertext stealing for ECB mode requires the plaintext to be longer than one block.  A possible workaround is to use a stream cipher-like block cipher mode of operation when the plaintext length is one block or less, such as the CTR, CFB or OFB modes.\nCiphertext stealing for CBC mode doesn't necessarily require the plaintext to be longer than one block. In the case where the plaintext is one block long or less, the Initialization vector (IV) can act as the prior block of ciphertext.  In this case a modified IV must be sent to the receiver.  This may not be possible in situations where the IV can not be freely chosen by the sender when the ciphertext is sent (e.g., when the IV is a derived or pre-established value), and in this case ciphertext stealing for CBC mode can only occur in plaintexts longer than one block.  \nTo implement CTS encryption or decryption for data of unknown length, the implementation must delay processing (and buffer) the two most recent blocks of data, so that they can be properly processed at the end of the data stream.\n\n== Ciphertext format ==\nThere are several different ways to arrange the ciphertext for transmission.  The ciphertext bits are the same in all cases, just transmitted in a different order, so the choice has no security implications; it is purely one of implementation convenience.\nThe numbering here is taken from Dworkin, who describes them all.  The third is the most popular, and described by Daemen and Schneier; Meyer describes a related, but incompatible scheme (with respect to bit ordering and key use).\n\n\n*** CS1 ***\nArguably the most obvious way to arrange the ciphertext is to transmit the truncated penultimate block, followed by the full final block.  This is not convenient for the receiver for two reasons:\n\nThe receiver must decrypt the final block first in any case, and\nThis results in the final block not being aligned on a natural boundary, complicating hardware implementations.This does have the advantage that, if the final plaintext block happens to be a multiple of the block size, the ciphertext is identical to that of the original mode of operation without ciphertext stealing.\n\n\n*** CS2 ***\nIt is often more convenient to swap the final two ciphertext blocks, so the ciphertext ends with the full final block, followed by the truncated penultimate block.  This results in naturally aligned ciphertext blocks.\nIn order to maintain compatibility with the non-stealing modes, option CS2 performs this swap only if the amount of stolen ciphertext is non-zero, i.e. the original message was not a multiple of the block size.\nThis maintains natural alignment, and compatibility with the non-stealing modes, but requires treating the cases of aligned and unaligned message size differently.\n\n\n*** CS3 ***\nThe most popular alternative swaps the final two ciphertext blocks unconditionally.  This is the ordering used in the descriptions below.\n\n== Ciphertext stealing mode description ==\nIn order to encrypt or decrypt data, use the standard block cipher mode of operation on all but the last two blocks of data.\nThe following steps describe how to handle the last two blocks of the plaintext, called Pn\u22121 and Pn, where the length of Pn\u22121 equals the block size of the cipher in bits, B; the length of the last block, Pn, is M bits; and K is the key that is in use.  M can range from 1 to B, inclusive, so Pn could possibly be a complete block.  The CBC mode description also makes use of the ciphertext block just previous to the blocks concerned, Cn\u22122, which may in fact be the IV if the plaintext fits within two blocks.\nFor this description, the following functions and operators are used:\n\nHead (data, a): returns the first a bits of the 'data' string.\nTail (data, a): returns the last a bits of the 'data' string.\nEncrypt (K, data): use the underlying block cipher in encrypt mode on the 'data' string using the key K.\nDecrypt (K, data): use the underlying block cipher in decrypt mode on the 'data' string using the key K.\nXOR: Bitwise Exclusive-OR.  Equivalent to bitwise addition without use of a carry bit.\n||: Concatenation operator.  Combine the strings on either side of the operator.\n0a: a string of a 0 bits.\n\n\n*** ECB ciphertext stealing ***\nCiphertext stealing in ECB mode introduces an inter-block dependency within the last two blocks, resulting in altered error propagation behavior for the last two blocks.\n\n\n**** ECB encryption steps (see figure) ****\n\nEn\u22121\n\nAnswer these questions based on the above context: How does ciphertext stealing allow for the encryption of messages that are not evenly divisible into blocks without expanding the ciphertext?Q: What are the general characteristics of ciphertext stealing in the context of block cipher modes of operation?Q: How does ciphertext stealing alter the processing of the last two blocks in a message during encryption?Q: What is the format of the final ciphertext in ciphertext stealing?Q: How is decryption performed in ciphertext stealing?Q: Which block-oriented block cipher modes of operation can be used with ciphertext stealing?Q: What are the common modes of operation that are coupled with ciphertext stealing?Q: How does ciphertext stealing for ECB mode differ when the plaintext is longer than one block versus when it is one block or less?Q: How does ciphertext stealing for CBC mode handle plaintexts that are one block long or less?Q: When is ciphertext stealing for CBC mode not possible?Q: How does an implementation of ciphertext stealing for data of unknown length handle the two most recent blocks of data?Q: What are the different ways to arrange the ciphertext for transmission in ciphertext stealing?Q: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the different ways to arrange the ciphertext for transmission in ciphertext stealing?Q: How does ciphertext stealing in ECB mode introduce an inter-block dependency within the last two blocks, resulting in altered error propagation behavior for the last two blocks?Q: How does ciphertext stealing affect the size of the ciphertext?",

This ensures that if one part of the network is compromised, the data is still available in other parts of the network, providing data protection.a: Cryptographic splitting can be used to effectively manage sensitive information within a company by entrusting different individuals within the company (trustees) with different parts of the information. This ensures that the information is protected, as an intruder would need to access the information from multiple trustees in order to access the original data.a: Cryptographic splitting provides data security in cloud computing by storing the encrypted data subsets on different clouds, with the information required to restore the data being held on a private cloud for additional security. This ensures that the data is protected from security breaches, as an intruder would need to access and decrypt the data from multiple clouds in order to access the original data.a: In cryptographic splitting, after the data is encrypted using a strong encryption algorithm, such as AES-256, the encrypted bits are then split into different shares and each share is hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm. The SHA-256 algorithm provides additional data protection by further encrypting the smaller, encrypted data units, making it more difficult for an intruder to access the original data.a: Cryptographic splitting provides data redundancy and security in storage area networks by splitting the data into different parts of the network. This ensures that if one part of the network is compromised, the data is still available in other parts of the network, providing data redundancy. Additionally, the data is protected as it is encrypted, split into smaller data units, distributed to different storage locations, and further encrypted at its new location.a: Cryptographic splitting protects sensitive corporate information by entrusting different individuals within a company (trustees) with different parts of the information. This ensures that the information is protected, as an intruder would need to access the information from multiple trustees in order to access the original data.a: Cryptographic splitting provides data protection in a distributed storage environment by encrypting the data, splitting the encrypted data into smaller data units, distributing those smaller units to different storage locations, and then further encrypting the data at its new location. This process ensures that the data is protected from security breaches, as an intruder would need to retrieve and decrypt all of the data units from the different locations in order to access the original data.a: Cryptographic splitting can be used in a multi-cloud environment to secure data by storing the encrypted data subsets on different clouds, with the information required to restore the data being held on a private cloud for additional security. This ensures that the data is protected from security breaches, as an intruder would need to access and decrypt the data from multiple clouds in order to access the original data.a: Cryptographic splitting protects data in a private cloud environment by storing the encrypted data subsets on the private cloud, with the information required to restore the data being held on the private cloud for additional security. This ensures that the data is protected from security breaches, as an intruder would need to access and decrypt the data from the private cloud in order to access the original data.a: Cryptographic splitting provides data protection in a hybrid cloud environment by storing the encrypted data subsets on different clouds, with the information required to restore the data being held on a private cloud for additional security. This ensures that the data is protected from security breaches, as an intruder would need to access and decrypt the data from multiple clouds in order to access the original data.a: Cryptographic splitting protects data in a public cloud environment by storing the encrypted data subsets on the public cloud, with the information required to restore the data being held on a private cloud for additional security. This ensures that the data is protected from security breaches, as an intruder would need to access and decrypt the data from the public cloud in order to access the original data."

Boyd applied the concept to the combat operations process, often at the operational level during military campaigns.  It is now also often applied to understand commercial operations and learning processes.  The approach explains how agility can overcome raw power in dealing with human opponents. It is especially applicable to cyber security and cyberwarfare.The OODA loop has become an important concept in litigation, business, law enforcement, management education, and military strategy.

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nRuntime application self-protection\n\n==Introduction==\nRuntime application self-protection (RASP) is a security technology that uses runtime instrumentation to detect and block computer attacks by taking advantage of information from inside the running software. The technology differs from perimeter-based protections such as firewalls, that can only detect and block attacks by using network information without contextual awareness. RASP technology is said to improve the security of software by monitoring its inputs, and blocking those that could allow attacks, while protecting the runtime environment from unwanted changes and tampering. RASP-protected applications rely less on external devices like firewalls to provide runtime security protection. When a threat is detected RASP can prevent exploitation and possibly take other actions, including terminating a user's session, shutting the application down, alerting security personnel and sending a warning to the user. RASP aims to close the gap left by application security testing and network perimeter controls, neither of which have enough insight into real-time data and event flows to either prevent vulnerabilities slipping through the review process or block new threats that were unforeseen during development.\n\n\n\n== Implementation ==\nRASP can be integrated as a framework or module that runs in conjunction with a program's codes, libraries and system calls. The technology can also be implemented as a virtualization. RASP is similar to interactive application security testing (IAST), the key difference is that IAST is focused on identifying vulnerabilities within the applications and RASPs are focused protecting against cybersecurity attacks that may take advantages of those vulnerabilities or other attack vectors.\n\n== Deployment options ==\nRASP solutions can be deployed in two different ways:  monitor or protection mode.  In monitor mode, the RASP solution reports on web application attacks but does not block any attack.  In protection mode, the RASP solution reports and blocks web application attacks.\n\nHow does runtime application self-protection (RASP) technology differ from perimeter-based protections like firewalls?Question: What is the role of runtime environment in RASP-protected applications?Question: What actions can RASP technology take when a threat is detected?Question: How does RASP technology aim to improve software security?Question: What is the main focus of interactive application security testing (IAST) compared to RASP?Question: How can RASP solutions be deployed?Question: What is the role of RASP technology in monitoring inputs in a running software?Question: How does RASP technology differ from traditional firewalls in terms of contextual awareness?Question: What are the two modes of deployment for RASP solutions?Question: How does RASP technology protect the runtime environment of a software?Question: How does RASP technology differ from IAST in terms of focus?Question: What happens when a threat is detected by RASP technology?Question: How does RASP technology improve the security of software in comparison to application security testing and network perimeter controls?Question: Can RASP technology be integrated as a framework or module that runs in conjunction with a program's codes, libraries and system calls?Question: Can RASP technology be implemented as a virtualization?",

    "instruction": "Read this text below and answer the questions Windows CardSpace\n\n==Introduction==\nWindows CardSpace (codenamed InfoCard) is a discontinued identity selector app by Microsoft. It stores references to digital identities of the users, presenting them as visual information cards. CardSpace provides a consistent UI designed to help people to easily and securely use these identities in applications and web sites where they are accepted.  Resistance to phishing attacks and adherence to Kim Cameron's \"7 Laws of Identity\" were goals in its design.CardSpace is a built-in component of Windows 7, and has been made available for Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista as part of the .NET Framework 3.x package.\n\n== Overview ==\nWhen an information card-enabled application or website wishes to obtain information about the user, it requests a particular set of claims. The CardSpace UI then appears, switching the display to the CardSpace service, which displays the user's stored identities as visual cards. The user selects a card to use, and the CardSpace software contacts the issuer of the identity to obtain a digitally signed XML token that contains the requested information. CardSpace also allows users to create personal (also known as self-issued) information cards, which can contain one or more of 14 fields of identity information such as full name and address. Other transactions may require a managed information card; these are issued by a third-party identity provider that makes the claims on the person's behalf, such as a bank, employer, or a government agency.\nWindows CardSpace is built on top of the Web services protocol stack, an open set of XML-based protocols, including WS-Security, WS-Trust, WS-MetadataExchange and WS-SecurityPolicy. This means that any technology or platform that supports these protocols can integrate with CardSpace. To accept information cards, a web developer needs to declare an HTML <OBJECT> tag that specifies the claims the website is demanding and implement code to decrypt the returned token and extract the claim values. If an identity provider wants to issue tokens, it must provide a means by which a user can obtain a managed card and provide a Security Token Service (STS) which handles WS-Trust requests and returns an appropriate encrypted and signed token. During the 2000s, identity providers that didn't wish to build STS could obtain one from a variety of vendors, including PingIdentity, BMC, Sun Microsystems, Microsoft, or Siemens.\nBecause CardSpace and the identity metasystem upon which it is based are token-format-agnostic, CardSpace did not compete directly with other Internet identity architectures like OpenID and SAML. These three approaches to identity can be seen as complementary, because during the 2000s, information cards could be used today for signing into OpenID providers, Windows Live ID accounts, and SAML identity providers.\nIBM and Novell planned to support the Higgins trust framework to provide a development framework that includes support for information cards and the Web services protocol stack, thus including CardSpace within a broader, extensible framework also supporting other identity-related technologies, such as SAML and OpenID.\n\n== Release ==\nMicrosoft initially shipped Windows CardSpace with the .NET Framework 3.0, which runs on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista.  It is installed by default on Windows Vista as well as Windows 7 and is available as a free download for XP and Server 2003 via Windows Update.

      "context": "Windows CardSpace\n\n==Introduction==\nWindows CardSpace (codenamed InfoCard) is a discontinued identity selector app by Microsoft. It stores references to digital identities of the users, presenting them as visual information cards. CardSpace provides a consistent UI designed to help people to easily and securely use these identities in applications and web sites where they are accepted.  Resistance to phishing attacks and adherence to Kim Cameron's \"7 Laws of Identity\" were goals in its design.CardSpace is a built-in component of Windows 7, and has been made available for Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista as part of the .NET Framework 3.x package.\n\n== Overview ==\nWhen an information card-enabled application or website wishes to obtain information about the user, it requests a particular set of claims. The CardSpace UI then appears, switching the display to the CardSpace service, which displays the user's stored identities as visual cards. The user selects a card to use, and the CardSpace software contacts the issuer of the identity to obtain a digitally signed XML token that contains the requested information. CardSpace also allows users to create personal (also known as self-issued) information cards, which can contain one or more of 14 fields of identity information such as full name and address. Other transactions may require a managed information card; these are issued by a third-party identity provider that makes the claims on the person's behalf, such as a bank, employer, or a government agency.\nWindows CardSpace is built on top of the Web services protocol stack, an open set of XML-based protocols, including WS-Security, WS-Trust, WS-MetadataExchange and WS-SecurityPolicy. This means that any technology or platform that supports these protocols can integrate with CardSpace. To accept information cards, a web developer needs to declare an HTML <OBJECT> tag that specifies the claims the website is demanding and implement code to decrypt the returned token and extract the claim values. If an identity provider wants to issue tokens, it must provide a means by which a user can obtain a managed card and provide a Security Token Service (STS) which handles WS-Trust requests and returns an appropriate encrypted and signed token. During the 2000s, identity providers that didn't wish to build STS could obtain one from a variety of vendors, including PingIdentity, BMC, Sun Microsystems, Microsoft, or Siemens.\nBecause CardSpace and the identity metasystem upon which it is based are token-format-agnostic, CardSpace did not compete directly with other Internet identity architectures like OpenID and SAML. These three approaches to identity can be seen as complementary, because during the 2000s, information cards could be used today for signing into OpenID providers, Windows Live ID accounts, and SAML identity providers.\nIBM and Novell planned to support the Higgins trust framework to provide a development framework that includes support for information cards and the Web services protocol stack, thus including CardSpace within a broader, extensible framework also supporting other identity-related technologies, such as SAML and OpenID.\n\n== Release ==\nMicrosoft initially shipped Windows CardSpace with the .NET Framework 3.0, which runs on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista.

    "instruction": "Context: Speck (cipher)\n\n==Introduction==\nSpeck is a family of lightweight block ciphers publicly released by the National Security Agency (NSA) in June 2013. Speck has been optimized for performance in software implementations, while its sister algorithm, Simon, has been optimized for hardware implementations. Speck is an add\u2013rotate\u2013xor (ARX) cipher.\nThe NSA began working on the Simon and Speck ciphers in 2011. The agency anticipated some agencies in the US federal government would need a cipher that would operate well on a diverse collection of Internet of Things devices while maintaining an acceptable level of security.\n\n== Cipher description ==\nSpeck supports a variety of block and key sizes.  A block is always two words, but the words may be 16, 24, 32, 48 or 64 bits in size.  The corresponding key is 2, 3 or 4 words.  The round function consists of two rotations, adding the right word to the left word, xoring the key into the left word, then xoring the left word into the right word.  The number of rounds depends on the parameters selected, as follows:\nThe key schedule uses the same round function as the main block cipher.\n\n== Reference code ==\nThe following is the designers' reference implementation, written in C, of the Speck variant with a 128-bit block size and key, where key\n\n== Performance ==\nAccording to ECRYPT's stream cipher benchmarks (eBASC), Speck is one of the fastest ciphers available, both for long as well as short messages. Some median performances for long messages (128-bit, 128-block size version) are: 1.99 cycles per byte (cpb) on an AMD Ryzen 7 1700; 1.27 cpb on an Intel Core i5-6600; 15.96 cpb on a Broadcom BCM2836 Cortex A7. For example, on the ARMv7 platform, Speck is about 3 times faster than AES.When implemented on 8-bit AVR microcontroller, Speck encryption with 64-bit blocks and 128-bit key consumes 192 bytes of flash memory, temporary variables consume 112 bytes of RAM, and takes 164 cycles to encrypt each byte in the block.Salsa20 is a stream cipher with comparable performance, but it is difficult to use stream ciphers securely in some applications where block ciphers like Speck work well. This led Google to add an implementation of Speck in Linux kernel version 4.17, planning to offer it as an option for disk encryption on low-end Android devices that would otherwise be unencrypted due to slow AES performance on processors that lack AES instructions. Speck was later dropped from the Linux kernel due to backlash and concerns, and Google switched to the Adiantum algorithm instead.\n\n== Security ==\n\n\n*** Cryptanalysis ***\nThe designers claim that Speck, though a \"lightweight\" cipher, is designed to have the full security possible for each block and key size, against standard chosen-plaintext (CPA) and chosen-ciphertext (CCA) attacks.  Resistance against related-key attacks was also stated as a goal, though a less crucial one as attacks in that model are not relevant for typical use cases.:\u200a2\u200a  No effort was made to resist attacks in the known-key distinguishing attack model, nor did the designers evaluate Speck for use as a hash function.:\u200a8\u200aAs of 2018, no successful attack on full-round Speck of any variant is known.  Due to interest in Simon and Speck, about 70 cryptanalysis papers have been published on them.:\u200a10\u200a  As is typical for iterated ciphers, reduced-round variants have been successfully attacked.  The best published attacks on Speck in the standard attack model (CPA/CCA with unknown key) are differential cryptanalysis attacks; these make it through about 70\u201375% of the rounds of most variants, though these best attacks are only marginally faster than brute-force.:\u200a12\u200a  The design team states that while designing Speck, they found differential attacks to be the limiting attacks, i.e. the type of attack that makes it through the most rounds; they then set the number of rounds to leave a security margin similar to AES-128's at approximately 30%.:\u200a12\u201313\u200a\nSpeck has been criticized for having too small a security margin, i.e. too few rounds between the best attacks and the full cipher, in comparison to more conservative ciphers such as ChaCha20.\nCiphers with small security margins are more likely to be broken by future advances in cryptanalysis.  Speck's design team counters that there is a real-world cost to unnecessarily large security margins, especially on lightweight devices, that cryptanalysis during the design phase allowed the number of rounds to be set appropriately, and that they targeted AES's security margin.:\u200a17\u200aSpeck includes a round counter in the key schedule.  The designers state this was included to block slide and rotational cryptanalysis attacks.:\u200a16\u200a  Still, rotational-XOR cryptanalysis has been used to find distinguishers against reduced-round versions of Speck. Though the authors don't describe standard key-recovery attacks based on their distinguishers, their best distinguishers on Speck32 and Speck48 in the known-key distinguishing attack model for certain weak key classes make it through slightly more rounds than the best differential distinguishers.  One of the authors has said that his research was resource-constrained and that rotational-XOR distinguishers on more rounds are probably possible. However, this type of cryptanalysis assumes the related-key or even the known-key attack models, which are not a concern in typical cryptographic protocols and solutions.:\u200a8\u200a  The designers also state that Speck was not designed to resist known-key distinguishing attacks (which do not directly compromise the confidentiality of ciphers).:\u200a8\u200aThe designers state that NSA cryptanalysis found the algorithms to have no weaknesses, and security commensurate with their key lengths.:\u200a2\u200a  The design team says that their cryptanalysis included linear and differential cryptanalysis using standard techniques such as Matsui's algorithm and SAT/SMT solvers, though a full list of techniques used is not given.:\u200a10\u200a  Speck's designers have been criticized for not providing more details on NSA cryptanalysis of the ciphers.The NSA has approved Simon128/256 and Speck128/256 for use in U.S. National Security Systems, though AES-256 is still recommended for non-constrained applications.\n\n\n*** Side-channel attacks ***\nBeing an ARX cipher, Speck does not use S-boxes or other lookup tables; it is therefore naturally immune to cache-timing attacks.:\u200a12\u200a This contrasts with ciphers that use lookup tables such as AES, which have been shown to be vulnerable to such attacks.  However, like most block ciphers (including AES) Speck is vulnerable to power analysis attacks unless hardware countermeasures are taken.:\u200a12\u200a\n\n\n*** Block and key sizes ***\nAlthough the Speck family of ciphers includes variants with the same block and key sizes as AES (Speck128/128, Speck128/192, and Speck128/256), it also includes variants with block size as low as 32 bits and key size as low as 64 bits.  These small block and key sizes are insecure for general use, as they can allow birthday attacks and brute-force attacks, regardless of the formal security of the cipher.  The designers state that these block and key sizes were included for highly resource-constrained devices where nothing better is possible, or where only very small amounts of data are ever encrypted, e.g. in RFID protocols.:\u200a2\u20133\u200a  Only the variant with a 128-bit block size and 256-bit key size is approved for use in U.S. National Security Systems.\n\n== Standardization efforts and controversies ==\nInitial attempts to standardise Simon and Speck failed to meet International Organization for Standardization super-majority required by the process and the ciphers were not adopted. Expert delegates to the ISO from several countries including Germany, Japan and Israel opposed the efforts by the NSA to standardise the Simon and Speck ciphers, citing concerns that the NSA is pushing for their standardisation with knowledge of exploitable weaknesses in the ciphers.

As of October 2018, the Simon and Speck ciphers have been standardized by ISO as a part of the RFID air interface standard, International Standard ISO/29167-21 (for Simon) and International Standard ISO/29167-22 (for Speck), making them available for use by commercial entities.On August 7, 2018, Speck was removed from the Linux kernel 4.20 release completely.\n\nQuestions:\nWhat is Speck, and what was its primary purpose when it was developed?Question: What kind of cipher is Speck, and what is its structure?Question: What are the supported block and key sizes for Speck, and how do they affect the round function?Question: What is the reference implementation of Speck, and what hardware platforms is it optimized for?Question: How does Speck compare to other ciphers such as Salsa20 and AES in terms of performance?Question: What are the cryptanalysis efforts on Speck, and what is the current state of its security?Question: What are the side-channel attack vulnerabilities of Speck, and how does it compare to other block ciphers?Question: What are the block and key sizes included in the Speck family of ciphers, and what are their intended use cases?Question: What are the standardization efforts and controversies surrounding Speck, and how have they affected its adoption?Question: What is the relationship between Speck and the Simon algorithm, and how do they differ in terms of hardware optimization?Question: How does Speck ensure security against related-key attacks, and what is the relevance of such attacks in typical use cases?Question: How does the key schedule of Speck work, and what is its purpose?Question: What are the criticisms of Speck's small security margin, and how does the design team defend their decision?Question: What was the NSA's involvement in the creation and promotion of the backdoored Dual\\_EC\\_DRBG cryptographic algorithm, and how did it affect the standardization of Speck?Question: What are the potential implications of having a small security margin in Speck, and what are the potential risks of using Speck in U.S. National Security Systems?\n\nAnswers:\n",

      "context": "Speck (cipher)\n\n==Introduction==\nSpeck is a family of lightweight block ciphers publicly released by the National Security Agency (NSA) in June 2013. Speck has been optimized for performance in software implementations, while its sister algorithm, Simon, has been optimized for hardware implementations. Speck is an add\u2013rotate\u2013xor (ARX) cipher.\nThe NSA began working on the Simon and Speck ciphers in 2011. The agency anticipated some agencies in the US federal government would need a cipher that would operate well on a diverse collection of Internet of Things devices while maintaining an acceptable level of security.\n\n== Cipher description ==\nSpeck supports a variety of block and key sizes.  A block is always two words, but the words may be 16, 24, 32, 48 or 64 bits in size.  The corresponding key is 2, 3 or 4 words.  The round function consists of two rotations, adding the right word to the left word, xoring the key into the left word, then xoring the left word into the right word.  The number of rounds depends on the parameters selected, as follows:\nThe key schedule uses the same round function as the main block cipher.\n\n== Reference code ==\nThe following is the designers' reference implementation, written in C, of the Speck variant with a 128-bit block size and key, where key\n\n== Performance ==\nAccording to ECRYPT's stream cipher benchmarks (eBASC), Speck is one of the fastest ciphers available, both for long as well as short messages. Some median performances for long messages (128-bit, 128-block size version) are: 1.99 cycles per byte (cpb) on an AMD Ryzen 7 1700; 1.27 cpb on an Intel Core i5-6600; 15.96 cpb on a Broadcom BCM2836 Cortex A7. For example, on the ARMv7 platform, Speck is about 3 times faster than AES.When implemented on 8-bit AVR microcontroller, Speck encryption with 64-bit blocks and 128-bit key consumes 192 bytes of flash memory, temporary variables consume 112 bytes of RAM, and takes 164 cycles to encrypt each byte in the block.Salsa20 is a stream cipher with comparable performance, but it is difficult to use stream ciphers securely in some applications where block ciphers like Speck work well. This led Google to add an implementation of Speck in Linux kernel version 4.17, planning to offer it as an option for disk encryption on low-end Android devices that would otherwise be unencrypted due to slow AES performance on processors that lack AES instructions. Speck was later dropped from the Linux kernel due to backlash and concerns, and Google switched to the Adiantum algorithm instead.\n\n== Security ==\n\n\n*** Cryptanalysis ***\nThe designers claim that Speck, though a \"lightweight\" cipher, is designed to have the full security possible for each block and key size, against standard chosen-plaintext (CPA) and chosen-ciphertext (CCA) attacks.  Resistance against related-key attacks was also stated as a goal, though a less crucial one as attacks in that model are not relevant for typical use cases.:\u200a2\u200a  No effort was made to resist attacks in the known-key distinguishing attack model, nor did the designers evaluate Speck for use as a hash function.:\u200a8\u200aAs of 2018, no successful attack on full-round Speck of any variant is known.  Due to interest in Simon and Speck, about 70 cryptanalysis papers have been published on them.:\u200a10\u200a  As is typical for iterated ciphers, reduced-round variants have been successfully attacked.  The best published attacks on Speck in the standard attack model (CPA/CCA with unknown key) are differential cryptanalysis attacks; these make it through about 70\u201375% of the rounds of most variants, though these best attacks are only marginally faster than brute-force.:\u200a12\u200a  The design team states that while designing Speck, they found differential attacks to be the limiting attacks, i.e. the type of attack that makes it through the most rounds; they then set the number of rounds to leave a security margin similar to AES-128's at approximately 30%.:\u200a12\u201313\u200a\nSpeck has been criticized for having too small a security margin, i.e. too few rounds between the best attacks and the full cipher, in comparison to more conservative ciphers such as ChaCha20.\nCiphers with small security margins are more likely to be broken by future advances in cryptanalysis.  Speck's design team counters that there is a real-world cost to unnecessarily large security margins, especially on lightweight devices, that cryptanalysis during the design phase allowed the number of rounds to be set appropriately, and that they targeted AES's security margin.:\u200a17\u200aSpeck includes a round counter in the key schedule.  The designers state this was included to block slide and rotational cryptanalysis attacks.:\u200a16\u200a  Still, rotational-XOR cryptanalysis has been used to find distinguishers against reduced-round versions of Speck. Though the authors don't describe standard key-recovery attacks based on their distinguishers, their best distinguishers on Speck32 and Speck48 in the known-key distinguishing attack model for certain weak key classes make it through slightly more rounds than the best differential distinguishers.  One of the authors has said that his research was resource-constrained and that rotational-XOR distinguishers on more rounds are probably possible.

    "instruction": "Read this text below and answer the questions XKeyscore\n\n==Introduction==\nXKeyscore (XKEYSCORE or XKS) is a secret computer system used by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) for searching and analyzing global Internet data, which it collects in real time. The NSA has shared XKeyscore with other intelligence agencies, including the Australian Signals Directorate, Canada's Communications Security Establishment, New Zealand's Government Communications Security Bureau, Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, Japan's Defense Intelligence Headquarters, and Germany's Bundesnachrichtendienst.In July 2013, Edward Snowden publicly revealed the program's purpose and use by the NSA in The Sydney Morning Herald and O Globo newspapers. The code name was already public knowledge because it was mentioned in earlier articles, and, like many other code names, it appears in job postings and online r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of employees.On July 3, 2014, German public broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk, a member of ARD, published  excerpts of XKeyscore's source code. A team of experts analyzed the source code.\n\n== Scope and functioning ==\nXKeyscore is a complicated system, and various authors have different interpretations of its actual capabilities. Edward Snowden and Glenn Greenwald explained XKeyscore as being a system which enables almost unlimited surveillance of anyone anywhere in the world, while the NSA has said that usage of the system is limited and restricted.\nAccording to The Washington Post and national security reporter Marc Ambinder, XKeyscore is an NSA data-retrieval system which consists of a series of user interfaces, backend databases, servers and software that selects certain types of data and metadata that the NSA has already collected using other methods.\n\n\n*** According to Snowden and Greenwald ***\nOn January 26, 2014, the German broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk asked Edward Snowden in its TV interview: \"What could you do if you would use XKeyscore?\" and he answered:\nYou could read anyone's email in the world, anybody you've got an email address for. Any website: You can watch traffic to and from it. Any computer that an individual sits at: You can watch it. Any laptop that you're tracking: you can follow it as it moves from place to place throughout the world. It's a one-stop-shop for access to the NSA's information.\n... You can tag individuals ... Let's say you work at a major German corporation and I want access to that network, I can track your username on a website on a forum somewhere, I can track your real name, I can track associations with your friends and I can build what's called a fingerprint, which is network activity unique to you, which means anywhere you go in the world, anywhere you try to sort of hide your online presence, your identity.\nAccording to The Guardian's Glenn Greenwald, low-level NSA analysts can, via systems like XKeyscore, \"listen to whatever emails they want, whatever telephone calls, browsing histories, Microsoft Word documents. And it's all done with no need to go to a court, with no need to even get supervisor approval on the part of the analyst.\"He added that the NSA's database of collected communications allows its analysts to listen \"to the calls or read the emails of everything that the NSA has stored, or look at the browsing histories or Google search terms that you've entered, and it also alerts them to any further activity that people connected to that email address or that IP address do in the future\".\n\n\n*** According to the NSA ***\n\nIn an official statement from July 30, 2013, the NSA said \"XKeyscore is used as a part of NSA's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system. ...\" to legally obtain information about \"legitimate foreign intelligence targets in response to requirements that our leaders need for information necessary to protect our nation and its interests. ... to collect the information, that enables us to perform our missions successfully \u2013 to defend the nation and to protect U.S. and allied troops abroad.\"\nIn terms of access, an NSA press statement reads that there is no \"unchecked analyst access to NSA collection data. Access to XKeyscore, as well as all of NSA's analytic tools, is limited to only those personnel who require access for their assigned tasks.\" and that there are \"...stringent oversight and compliance mechanisms built in at several levels. One feature is the system's ability to limit what an analyst can do with a tool, based on the source of the collection and each analyst's defined responsibilities.\"\n\n== Workings ==\n\nAccording to an NSA slide presentation about XKeyscore from 2013, it is a \"DNI Exploitation System/Analytic Framework\". DNI stands for Digital Network Intelligence, which means intelligence derived from internet traffic.Edward Snowden said about XKeyscore: \"It's a front end search engine\" in an interview with the German Norddeutscher Rundfunk.XKeyscore is a \"piece of Linux software that is typically deployed on Red Hat servers. It uses the Apache web server and stores collected data in MySQL databases\".XKeyscore is considered a \"passive\" program, in that it listens, but does not transmit anything on the networks that it targets. But it can trigger other systems, which perform \"active\" attacks through Tailored Access Operations which are \"tipping\", for example, the QUANTUM family of programs, including QUANTUMINSERT, QUANTUMHAND, QUANTUMTHEORY, QUANTUMBOT and QUANTUMCOPPER and Turbulence. These run at so-called \"defensive sites\" including the Ramstein Air Force base in Germany, Yokota Air Base in Japan, and numerous military and non-military locations within the US. Trafficthief, a core program of Turbulence, can alert NSA analysts when their targets communicate, and trigger other software programs, so select data is \"promoted\" from the local XKeyscore data store to the NSA's \"corporate repositories\" for long term storage.\n\n\n*** Data sources ***\nXKeyscore consists of over 700 servers at approximately 150 sites where the NSA collects data, like \"US and allied military and other facilities as well as US embassies and consulates\" in many countries around the world. Among the facilities involved in the program are four bases in Australia and one in New Zealand.According to an NSA presentation from 2008, these XKeyscore servers are fed with data from the following collection systems:\nF6 (Special Collection Service) \u2013  joint operation of the CIA and NSA that carries out clandestine operations including espionage on foreign diplomats and leaders\nFORNSAT \u2013  which stands for \"foreign satellite collection\", and refers to intercepts from satellites\nSSO (Special Source Operations) \u2013  a division of the NSA that cooperates with telecommunication providersIn a single, undated slide published by Swedish media in December 2013, the following additional data sources for XKeyscore are mentioned:\nOverhead \u2013  intelligence derived from American spy planes, drones and satellites\nTailored Access Operations \u2013  a division of the NSA that deals with hacking and cyberwarfare\nFISA \u2013  all types of surveillance approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\nThird party \u2013  foreign partners of the NSA such as the (signals) intelligence agencies of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, etc. However the Netherlands is out of any cooperation concerning intelligence gathering and sharing for illegal spying.From these sources, XKeyscore stores \"full-take data\", which are indexed by plug-ins that extract certain types of metadata (like phone numbers, e-mail addresses, log-ins, and user activity) and index them in metadata tables, which can be queried by analysts. XKeyscore has been integrated with MARINA, which is NSA's database for internet metadata.However, the system continuously gets so much Internet data that it can be stored only for short periods of time. Content data remain on the system for only three to five days, while metadata is stored for up to thirty days. A detailed commentary on an NSA presentation published in The Guardian in July 2013 cites a document published in 2008 declaring that \"At some sites, the amount of data we receive per day (20+ terabytes) can only be stored for as little as 24 hours.\"\n\n\n*** Types of XKeyscore ***\nAccording to a document from an internal GCHQ website which was disclosed by the German magazine Der Spiegel in June 2014, there are three different types of the Xkeyscore system:\nTraditional: The initial version of XKeyscore is fed with data from low-rate data signals, after being processed by the WEALTHYCLUSTER system. This traditional version is not only used by NSA but also at many intercept sites of GCHQ.\nStage 2: This version of XKeyscore is used for higher data rates. The data are first processed by the TURMOIL system, which sends 5% of the internet data packets to XKeyscore. GCHQ only uses this version for its collection under the MUSCULAR program.\nDeep Dive: This latest version can process internet traffic at data rates of 10 gigabits per second. Data that could be useful for intelligence purposes are then selected and forwarded by using the \"GENESIS selection language\". GCHQ also operates a number of Deep Dive versions of XKeyscore at three locations under the codename TEMPORA.\n\n\n*** Capabilities ***\n\nFor analysts, XKeyscore provides a \"series of viewers for common data types\", which allows them to query terabytes of raw data gathered at the aforementioned collection sites. This enables them to find targets that cannot be found by searching only the metadata, and also to do this against data sets that otherwise would have been dropped by the front-end data processing systems. According to a slide from an XKeyscore presentation, NSA collection sites select and forward less than 5% of the internet traffic to the PINWALE database for internet content.Because XKeyscore holds raw and unselected communications traffic, analysts can not only perform queries using \"strong selectors\" like e-mail addresses, but also using \"soft selectors\", like keywords, against the body texts of e-mail and chat messages and digital documents and spreadsheets in English, Arabic and Chinese.This is useful because \"a large amount of time spent on the web is performing actions that are anonymous\" and therefore those activities can't be found by just looking for e-mail addresses of a target. When content has been found, the analyst might be able to find new intelligence or a strong selector, which can then be used for starting a traditional search.Besides using soft selectors, analysts can also use the following other XKeyscore capabilities:\nLook for the usage of Google Maps and terms entered into a search engine by known targets looking for suspicious things or places.\nLook for \"anomalies\" without any specific person attached, like detecting the nationality of foreigners by analyzing the language used within intercepted emails. An example would be a German speaker in Pakistan. The Brazilian paper O Globo claims that this has been applied to Latin America and specifically to Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Venezuela.\nDetect people who use encryption by doing searches like \"all PGP usage in Iran\". The caveat given is that very broad queries can result in too much data to transmit back to the analyst.\nShowing the usage of virtual private networks (VPNs) and machines that can potentially be hacked via TAO.\nTrack the source and authorship of a document that has passed through many hands.\nOn July 3, 2014 ARD revealed that XKeyscore is used to closely monitor users of the Tor anonymity network, people who search for privacy-enhancing software on the web, and readers of Linux Journal.The Guardian revealed in 2013 that most of these things cannot be detected by other NSA tools, because they operate with strong selectors (like e-mail and IP addresses and phone numbers) and the raw data volumes are too high to be forwarded to other NSA databases.In 2008, NSA planned to add a number of new capabilities in the future, like VoIP, more networking protocols, Exif tags, which often include geolocation (GPS) data.\n\n== Contribution to U.S. security ==\nThe NSA slides published in The Guardian during 2013 claimed that XKeyscore had played a role in capturing 300 terrorists by 2008, which could not be substantiated as the redacted documents do not cite instances of terrorist interventions.\nA 2011 report from the NSA unit in the Dagger Complex (close to Griesheim in Germany) said that XKeyscore made it easier and more efficient to target surveillance. Previously, analysis often accessed data NSA was not interested in. XKeyscore allowed them to focus on the intended topics, while ignoring unrelated data. XKeyscore also proved to be outstanding for tracking active groups associated with the Anonymous movement in Germany, because it allows for searching on patterns, rather than particular individuals. An analyst is able to determine when targets research new topics, or develop new behaviors.To create additional motivation, the NSA incorporated various gamification features. For instance, analysts who were especially good at using XKeyscore could acquire \"skilz\" points and \"unlock achievements.\" The training units in Griesheim were apparently successful and analysts there had achieved the \"highest average of skilz points\" compared with all other NSA departments participating in the training program.\n\n== Usage by foreign partners of the NSA ==\n\n\n*** Germany ***\n\nAccording to documents Der Spiegel acquired from Snowden, the German intelligence agencies BND (foreign intelligence) and BfV (domestic intelligence) were also allowed to use the XKeyscore system. In those documents the BND agency was described as the NSA's most prolific partner in information gathering. This led to political confrontations, after which the directors of the German intelligence agencies briefed members of the German parliamentary intelligence oversight committee on July 25, 2013. They declared that XKeyscore has been used by the BND since 2007 and that the BfV has been using a test version since 2012. The directors also explained that the program is not for collecting data, but rather only for the analysis of collected data.\n\n\n*** Sweden ***\nAs part of the UKUSA Agreement, a secret treaty was signed in 1954 by Sweden with the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand (called the Five Eyes) for the purpose of intelligence collaboration and data sharing. According to documents leaked by Snowden, the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) has been granted access to XKeyscore.\n\n\n*** Denmark ***\nIn an ongoing scandal, where it has been revealed that NSA helped FE (Danish Military Intelligence Service) build a new Spy datacenter at Sandagerg\u00e5rd, Amager, Xkeyscore has been made available for FE to use on the collected data.\n\n\n*** Japan ***\nThe classified documents leaked by Snowden also indicate that in April 2013, NSA had secretly provided the XKeyscore system to the Japanese government.\nWhat is the primary function of XKeyscore according to the NSA?question: How does XKeyscore enable surveillance according to Edward Snowden and Glenn Greenwald?question: What limitations does the NSA claim on the usage of XKeyscore?question: How is XKeyscore deployed in terms of hardware and software?question: What are the different versions of XKeyscore according to a GCHQ document?question: What is the significance of XKeyscore's ability to use soft selectors?question: How does XKeyscore contribute to U.S. security according to the NSA?question: Which countries have been granted access to XKeyscore according to the documents leaked by Snowden?question: How does XKeyscore help in analyzing collected data according to German intelligence agencies?question: What is the role of XKeyscore in the NSA's foreign signals intelligence collection system?question: What is the XKeyscore's contribution to the NSA's targeting and surveillance capabilities?question: What is the significance of XKeyscore's data storage limitations?question: How does XKeyscore integrate with other NSA systems?question: What are the potential consequences of XKeyscore's overuse or misuse?question: How does XKeyscore's ability to detect encryption usage impact privacy and security?",

      "context": "XKeyscore\n\n==Introduction==\nXKeyscore (XKEYSCORE or XKS) is a secret computer system used by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) for searching and analyzing global Internet data, which it collects in real time. The NSA has shared XKeyscore with other intelligence agencies, including the Australian Signals Directorate, Canada's Communications Security Establishment, New Zealand's Government Communications Security Bureau, Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, Japan's Defense Intelligence Headquarters, and Germany's Bundesnachrichtendienst.In July 2013, Edward Snowden publicly revealed the program's purpose and use by the NSA in The Sydney Morning Herald and O Globo newspapers. The code name was already public knowledge because it was mentioned in earlier articles, and, like many other code names, it appears in job postings and online r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of employees.On July 3, 2014, German public broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk, a member of ARD, published  excerpts of XKeyscore's source code. A team of experts analyzed the source code.\n\n== Scope and functioning ==\nXKeyscore is a complicated system, and various authors have different interpretations of its actual capabilities. Edward Snowden and Glenn Greenwald explained XKeyscore as being a system which enables almost unlimited surveillance of anyone anywhere in the world, while the NSA has said that usage of the system is limited and restricted.\nAccording to The Washington Post and national security reporter Marc Ambinder, XKeyscore is an NSA data-retrieval system which consists of a series of user interfaces, backend databases, servers and software that selects certain types of data and metadata that the NSA has already collected using other methods.\n\n\n*** According to Snowden and Greenwald ***\nOn January 26, 2014, the German broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk asked Edward Snowden in its TV interview: \"What could you do if you would use XKeyscore?\" and he answered:\nYou could read anyone's email in the world, anybody you've got an email address for. Any website: You can watch traffic to and from it. Any computer that an individual sits at: You can watch it. Any laptop that you're tracking: you can follow it as it moves from place to place throughout the world. It's a one-stop-shop for access to the NSA's information.\n... You can tag individuals ... Let's say you work at a major German corporation and I want access to that network, I can track your username on a website on a forum somewhere, I can track your real name, I can track associations with your friends and I can build what's called a fingerprint, which is network activity unique to you, which means anywhere you go in the world, anywhere you try to sort of hide your online presence, your identity.\nAccording to The Guardian's Glenn Greenwald, low-level NSA analysts can, via systems like XKeyscore, \"listen to whatever emails they want, whatever telephone calls, browsing histories, Microsoft Word documents. And it's all done with no need to go to a court, with no need to even get supervisor approval on the part of the analyst.\"He added that the NSA's database of collected communications allows its analysts to listen \"to the calls or read the emails of everything that the NSA has stored, or look at the browsing histories or Google search terms that you've entered, and it also alerts them to any further activity that people connected to that email address or that IP address do in the future\".\n\n\n*** According to the NSA ***\n\nIn an official statement from July 30, 2013, the NSA said \"XKeyscore is used as a part of NSA's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system. ...\" to legally obtain information about \"legitimate foreign intelligence targets in response to requirements that our leaders need for information necessary to protect our nation and its interests. ... to collect the information, that enables us to perform our missions successfully \u2013 to defend the nation and to protect U.S. and allied troops abroad.\"\nIn terms of access, an NSA press statement reads that there is no \"unchecked analyst access to NSA collection data. Access to XKeyscore, as well as all of NSA's analytic tools, is limited to only those personnel who require access for their assigned tasks.\" and that there are \"...stringent oversight and compliance mechanisms built in at several levels. One feature is the system's ability to limit what an analyst can do with a tool, based on the source of the collection and each analyst's defined responsibilities.\"\n\n== Workings ==\n\nAccording to an NSA slide presentation about XKeyscore from 2013, it is a \"DNI Exploitation System/Analytic Framework\". DNI stands for Digital Network Intelligence, which means intelligence derived from internet traffic.Edward Snowden said about XKeyscore: \"It's a front end search engine\" in an interview with the German Norddeutscher Rundfunk.XKeyscore is a \"piece of Linux software that is typically deployed on Red Hat servers. It uses the Apache web server and stores collected data in MySQL databases\".XKeyscore is considered a \"passive\" program, in that it listens, but does not transmit anything on the networks that it targets. But it can trigger other systems, which perform \"active\" attacks through Tailored Access Operations which are \"tipping\", for example, the QUANTUM family of programs, including QUANTUMINSERT, QUANTUMHAND, QUANTUMTHEORY, QUANTUMBOT and QUANTUMCOPPER and Turbulence. These run at so-called \"defensive sites\" including the Ramstein Air Force base in Germany, Yokota Air Base in Japan, and numerous military and non-military locations within the US. Trafficthief, a core program of Turbulence, can alert NSA analysts when their targets communicate, and trigger other software programs, so select data is \"promoted\" from the local XKeyscore data store to the NSA's \"corporate repositories\" for long term storage.\n\n\n*** Data sources ***\nXKeyscore consists of over 700 servers at approximately 150 sites where the NSA collects data, like \"US and allied military and other facilities as well as US embassies and consulates\" in many countries around the world. Among the facilities involved in the program are four bases in Australia and one in New Zealand.According to an NSA presentation from 2008, these XKeyscore servers are fed with data from the following collection systems:\nF6 (Special Collection Service) \u2013  joint operation of the CIA and NSA that carries out clandestine operations including espionage on foreign diplomats and leaders\nFORNSAT \u2013  which stands for \"foreign satellite collection\", and refers to intercepts from satellites\nSSO (Special Source Operations) \u2013  a division of the NSA that cooperates with telecommunication providersIn a single, undated slide published by Swedish media in December 2013, the following additional data sources for XKeyscore are mentioned:\nOverhead \u2013  intelligence derived from American spy planes, drones and satellites\nTailored Access Operations \u2013  a division of the NSA that deals with hacking and cyberwarfare\nFISA \u2013  all types of surveillance approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\nThird party \u2013  foreign partners of the NSA such as the (signals) intelligence agencies of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, etc. However the Netherlands is out of any cooperation concerning intelligence gathering and sharing for illegal spying.From these sources, XKeyscore stores \"full-take data\", which are indexed by plug-ins that extract certain types of metadata (like phone numbers, e-mail addresses, log-ins, and user activity) and index them in metadata tables, which can be queried by analysts. XKeyscore has been integrated with MARINA, which is NSA's database for internet metadata.However, the system continuously gets so much Internet data that it can be stored only for short periods of time. Content data remain on the system for only three to five days, while metadata is stored for up to thirty days. A detailed commentary on an NSA presentation published in The Guardian in July 2013 cites a document published in 2008 declaring that \"At some sites, the amount of data we receive per day (20+ terabytes) can only be stored for as little as 24 hours.\"\n\n\n*** Types of XKeyscore ***\nAccording to a document from an internal GCHQ website which was disclosed by the German magazine Der Spiegel in June 2014, there are three different types of the Xkeyscore system:\nTraditional: The initial version of XKeyscore is fed with data from low-rate data signals, after being processed by the WEALTHYCLUSTER system. This traditional version is not only used by NSA but also at many intercept sites of GCHQ.\nStage 2: This version of XKeyscore is used for higher data rates. The data are first processed by the TURMOIL system, which sends 5% of the internet data packets to XKeyscore. GCHQ only uses this version for its collection under the MUSCULAR program.\nDeep Dive: This latest version can process internet traffic at data rates of 10 gigabits per second. Data that could be useful for intelligence purposes are then selected and forwarded by using the \"GENESIS selection language\". GCHQ also operates a number of Deep Dive versions of XKeyscore at three locations under the codename TEMPORA.\n\n\n*** Capabilities ***\n\nFor analysts, XKeyscore provides a \"series of viewers for common data types\", which allows them to query terabytes of raw data gathered at the aforementioned collection sites. This enables them to find targets that cannot be found by searching only the metadata, and also to do this against data sets that otherwise would have been dropped by the front-end data processing systems. According to a slide from an XKeyscore presentation, NSA collection sites select and forward less than 5% of the internet traffic to the PINWALE database for internet content.Because XKeyscore holds raw and unselected communications traffic, analysts can not only perform queries using \"strong selectors\" like e-mail addresses, but also using \"soft selectors\", like keywords, against the body texts of e-mail and chat messages and digital documents and spreadsheets in English, Arabic and Chinese.This is useful because \"a large amount of time spent on the web is performing actions that are anonymous\" and therefore those activities can't be found by just looking for e-mail addresses of a target. When content has been found, the analyst might be able to find new intelligence or a strong selector, which can then be used for starting a traditional search.Besides using soft selectors, analysts can also use the following other XKeyscore capabilities:\nLook for the usage of Google Maps and terms entered into a search engine by known targets looking for suspicious things or places.\nLook for \"anomalies\" without any specific person attached, like detecting the nationality of foreigners by analyzing the language used within intercepted emails. An example would be a German speaker in Pakistan. The Brazilian paper O Globo claims that this has been applied to Latin America and specifically to Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Venezuela.\nDetect people who use encryption by doing searches like \"all PGP usage in Iran\". The caveat given is that very broad queries can result in too much data to transmit back to the analyst.\nShowing the usage of virtual private networks (VPNs) and machines that can potentially be hacked via TAO.\nTrack the source and authorship of a document that has passed through many hands.\nOn July 3, 2014 ARD revealed that XKeyscore is used to closely monitor users of the Tor anonymity network, people who search for privacy-enhancing software on the web, and readers of Linux Journal.The Guardian revealed in 2013 that most of these things cannot be detected by other NSA tools, because they operate with strong selectors (like e-mail and IP addresses and phone numbers) and the raw data volumes are too high to be forwarded to other NSA databases.In 2008, NSA planned to add a number of new capabilities in the future, like VoIP, more networking protocols, Exif tags, which often include geolocation (GPS) data.\n\n== Contribution to U.S. security ==\nThe NSA slides published in The Guardian during 2013 claimed that XKeyscore had played a role in capturing 300 terrorists by 2008, which could not be substantiated as the redacted documents do not cite instances of terrorist interventions.\nA 2011 report from the NSA unit in the Dagger Complex (close to Griesheim in Germany) said that XKeyscore made it easier and more efficient to target surveillance.

An analyst is able to determine when targets research new topics, or develop new behaviors.To create additional motivation, the NSA incorporated various gamification features. For instance, analysts who were especially good at using XKeyscore could acquire \"skilz\" points and \"unlock achievements.\" The training units in Griesheim were apparently successful and analysts there had achieved the \"highest average of skilz points\" compared with all other NSA departments participating in the training program.\n\n== Usage by foreign partners of the NSA ==\n\n\n*** Germany ***\n\nAccording to documents Der Spiegel acquired from Snowden, the German intelligence agencies BND (foreign intelligence) and BfV (domestic intelligence) were also allowed to use the XKeyscore system.

    "instruction": "Fawkes (image cloaking software)\n\n==Introduction==\nFawkes is a facial image cloaking software created by the SAND (Security, Algorithms, Networking and Data) Laboratory of the University of Chicago. It is a free tool that is available as a standalone executable. The software creates small alterations in images using artificial intelligence to protect the images from being recognized and matched by facial recognition software. The goal of the Fawkes program is to enable individuals to protect their own privacy from large data collection. As of May 2022 Fawkes v1.0 has surpassed 840,000 downloads. Eventually the SAND Laboratory hopes to implement the software on a larger scale to combat unwarranted facial recognition software.\n\n\n\n== Techniques ==\nThe methods that Fawkes uses can be identified as similar to adversarial machine learning. This method trains a facial recognition software using already altered images. This results in the software not being able to match the altered image with the actual image as it does not recognize them as the same image. Fawkes also uses data poisoning attacks, which change the data set used to train certain deep learning models. Fawkes utilizes two types of data poisoning techniques: clean label attacks and model corruption attacks. The creators of Fawkes identifies that using sybil images can increase the effectiveness of their software against recognition softwares. Sybil images are images that do not match the person they are attributed to. This confuses the facial recognition software and leads to misidientification which also helps the efficacy of image cloaking. Privacy preserving machine learning uses techniques similar to the Fawkes software but opts for differentially private model training which helps to keep information in the data set private.\n\n== Applications ==\nFawkes image cloaking can be used on images and apps that we use everyday. However, the efficacy of the software wanes if there are cloaked and uncloaked images that the facial recognition software can utilize. The image cloaking software has been tested on high-powered facial recognition software with varied results. A similar facial cloaking software to Fawkes is called LowKey. LowKey also alters images on a visual level, but these alterations are much more noticeable compared to the Fawkes software.\n\nBased on the above text, answer the questions.

This results in the software not being able to match the altered image with the actual image as it does not recognize them as the same image. Fawkes also uses data poisoning attacks, which change the data set used to train certain deep learning models. Fawkes utilizes two types of data poisoning techniques: clean label attacks and model corruption attacks. The creators of Fawkes identifies that using sybil images can increase the effectiveness of their software against recognition softwares. Sybil images are images that do not match the person they are attributed to. This confuses the facial recognition software and leads to misidientification which also helps the efficacy of image cloaking. Privacy preserving machine learning uses techniques similar to the Fawkes software but opts for differentially private model training which helps to keep information in the data set private.\n\n== Applications ==\nFawkes image cloaking can be used on images and apps that we use everyday. However, the efficacy of the software wanes if there are cloaked and uncloaked images that the facial recognition software can utilize. The image cloaking software has been tested on high-powered facial recognition software with varied results. A similar facial cloaking software to Fawkes is called LowKey. LowKey also alters images on a visual level, but these alterations are much more noticeable compared to the Fawkes software.",

      "answers": "A dirtbox, also known as DRT box, is a cell site simulator that mimics a cell phone tower by emitting a pilot signal stronger than that of the nearest cell tower. This causes nearby dormant mobile phones to switch to it, allowing the device to collect information from cell phones believed to be connected with criminal activity. It utilizes IMSI-catcher (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) technology to identify individual subscribers and retrieve their IMSI numbers and electronic serial numbers (ESN). Encryption does not prevent this process, as the devices can retrieve a phone's encryption session keys in less than one second. A dirtbox can locate a phone within 10 feet or as few as two feet by triangulating flights.a: The dirtbox was developed by Digital Receiver Technology, Inc. (DRT), which is owned by the Boeing company. The name \"dirtbox\" comes from the company that developed it, DRT.a: People with knowledge of the program can determine which phones belong to suspects and which to non-suspects. For non-suspect phones, such as those belonging to prison personnel or commercial users in the area, the dirtbox can return them to their local network.a: A dirtbox can selectively interrupt or prevent calls on certain phones. It has been used to block unauthorized phone use by prison inmates.a: A dirtbox can retrieve data from phones by bypassing phone companies in its operations. Boeing describes its technology as \"unobtrusive to legitimate wireless communications\".a: Dirtboxes are used by the U.S. Marshals Service, the U.S. Special Operations Command, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Navy, and the Pentagon Washington Headquarters Services. They are used for various purposes, including tracking fugitives, research and development, and signal intelligence.a: The U.S. Navy has bought dirtboxes to mount on drones at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, its research and development facility in Southern California.a: The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has known of dirtboxes since at least 2010. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), responsible for licensing and regulating cell-service providers, was not aware of dirtbox activity prior to The Wall Street Journal expos\u00e9.a: Privacy advocates and U.S. lawmakers, including U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Florida), Brian Owsley, a law professor at Indiana Institute of Technology and former United States magistrate, Michael German, a professor at New York University Law School and former FBI agent, Senator Edward Markey (D-Massachusetts), and former Senator Al Franken (D-Minnesota), have criticized dirtbox use as a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and have warned that Americans' privacy rights must be assured.a: The U.S. Department of Justice has refused to confirm or deny that government agencies used dirtboxes, but an official said that it would be utterly false to conflate the law-enforcement program with the collection of bulk telephone records by the National Security Agency.a: In January 2015, the US Senate Judiciary Committee asked the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security which law enforcement agencies used DRTboxes, and to specify the legal processes and policies that existed to protect the privacy of those whose information was collected.a: Dirtboxes have been used by the U.S. Marshals Service in the Mexican Drug War, tracking fugitives in coordination with Mexico's Naval Infantry Force and flights in Guatemala.a: A dirtbox is described as 2-square-foot (0.19 m2) in size, while the StingRay phone tracker has a smaller range.a: Encryption does not prevent the dirtbox from retrieving a phone's IMSI number and electronic serial number (ESN) as it can retrieve a phone's encryption session keys in less than one second.a: Based on references to \"DRTBox\" in NSA's Boundless informant screenshots leaked by Edward Snowden, dirtboxes are probably used by the NSA. In 2013, the French newspaper LeMonde wrote, \"Thanks to DRTBOX, 62.5 million phone data were collected in France\". This collection of phone data by dirtboxes raised concerns about privacy rights in France."

    "instruction": "Context: Secure voice\n\n==Introduction==\nSecure voice (alternatively secure speech or ciphony) is a term in cryptography for the encryption of voice communication over a range of communication types such as radio, telephone or IP.\n\n== Digital ==\nA digital secure voice usually includes two components, a digitizer to convert between speech and digital signals and an encryption system to provide confidentiality. It is difficult in practice to send the encrypted signal over the same voiceband communication circuits used to transmit unencrypted voice, e.g. analog telephone lines or mobile radios, due to bandwidth expansion.\nThis has led to the use of Voice Coders (vocoders) to achieve tight bandwidth compression of the speech signals. NSA's STU-III, KY-57 and SCIP are examples of systems that operate over existing voice circuits. The STE system, by contrast, requires wide bandwidth ISDN lines for its normal mode of operation. For encrypting GSM and VoIP, which are natively digital, the standard protocol ZRTP could be used as an end-to-end encryption technology.\nSecure voice's robustness greatly benefits from having the voice data compressed into very low bit-rates by special component called speech coding, voice compression or voice coder (also known as vocoder).  The old secure voice compression standards include (CVSD, CELP, LPC-10e and MELP, where the latest standard is the state of the art MELPe algorithm.\n\n== Digital methods using voice compression: MELP or MELPe ==\nThe MELPe or enhanced-MELP (Mixed Excitation Linear Prediction) is a United States Department of Defense speech coding standard used mainly in military applications and satellite communications, secure voice, and secure radio devices. Its development was led and supported by NSA, and NATO.  The US government's MELPe secure voice standard is also known as MIL-STD-3005, and the NATO's MELPe secure voice standard is also known as STANAG-4591.\nThe initial MELP was invented by Alan McCree around 1995. That initial speech coder was standardized in 1997 and was known as MIL-STD-3005. It surpassed other candidate vocoders in the US DoD competition, including: (a) Frequency Selective Harmonic Coder (FSHC), (b) Advanced Multi-Band Excitation (AMBE), (c) Enhanced Multiband Excitation (EMBE), (d) Sinusoid Transform Coder (STC), and (e) Subband LPC Coder (SBC). Due to its lower complexity than Waveform Interpolative (WI) coder, the MELP vocoder won the DoD competition and was selected for MIL-STD-3005.\nBetween 1998 and 2001, a new MELP-based vocoder was created at half the rate (i.e. 1200 bit/s) and substantial enhancements were added to the MIL-STD-3005 by SignalCom (later acquired by Microsoft), AT&T Corporation, and Compandent which included (a) additional new vocoder at half the rate (i.e. 1200 bit/s), (b) substantially improved encoding (analysis), (c) substantially improved decoding (synthesis), (d) Noise-Preprocessing for removing background noise, (e) transcoding between the 2400 bit/s and 1200 bit/s bitstreams, and (f) new postfilter. This fairly significant development was aimed to create a new coder at half the rate and have it interoperable with the old MELP standard. This enhanced-MELP (also known as MELPe) was adopted as the new MIL-STD-3005 in 2001 in form of annexes and supplements made to the original MIL-STD-3005, enabling the same quality as the old 2400 bit/s MELP's at half the rate. One of the greatest advantages of the new 2400 bit/s MELPe is that it shares the same bit format as MELP, and hence can interoperate with legacy MELP systems, but would deliver better quality at both ends. MELPe provides much better quality than all older military standards, especially in noisy environments such as battlefield and vehicles and aircraft.\nIn 2002, following extensive competition and testing, the 2400 and 1200 bit/s US DoD MELPe was adopted also as NATO standard, known as STANAG-4591. As part of NATO testing for new NATO standard, MELPe was tested against other candidates such as France's HSX (Harmonic Stochastic eXcitation) and Turkey's SB-LPC (Split-Band Linear Predictive Coding), as well as the old secure voice standards such as FS1015 LPC-10e (2.4 kbit/s), FS1016 CELP (4.8 kbit/s) and CVSD (16 kbit/s). Subsequently, the MELPe won also the NATO competition, surpassing the quality of all other candidates as well as the quality of all old secure voice standards (CVSD, CELP and LPC-10e). The NATO competition concluded that MELPe substantially improved performance (in terms of speech quality, intelligibility, and noise immunity), while reducing throughput requirements. The NATO testing also included interoperability tests, used over 200 hours of speech data, and was conducted by 3 test laboratories worldwide.  Compandent Inc, as a part of MELPe-based projects performed for NSA and NATO, provided NSA and NATO with special test-bed platform known as MELCODER device that provided the golden reference for real-time implementation of MELPe.

      "context": "Secure voice\n\n==Introduction==\nSecure voice (alternatively secure speech or ciphony) is a term in cryptography for the encryption of voice communication over a range of communication types such as radio, telephone or IP.\n\n== Digital ==\nA digital secure voice usually includes two components, a digitizer to convert between speech and digital signals and an encryption system to provide confidentiality. It is difficult in practice to send the encrypted signal over the same voiceband communication circuits used to transmit unencrypted voice, e.g. analog telephone lines or mobile radios, due to bandwidth expansion.\nThis has led to the use of Voice Coders (vocoders) to achieve tight bandwidth compression of the speech signals. NSA's STU-III, KY-57 and SCIP are examples of systems that operate over existing voice circuits. The STE system, by contrast, requires wide bandwidth ISDN lines for its normal mode of operation. For encrypting GSM and VoIP, which are natively digital, the standard protocol ZRTP could be used as an end-to-end encryption technology.\nSecure voice's robustness greatly benefits from having the voice data compressed into very low bit-rates by special component called speech coding, voice compression or voice coder (also known as vocoder).  The old secure voice compression standards include (CVSD, CELP, LPC-10e and MELP, where the latest standard is the state of the art MELPe algorithm.\n\n== Digital methods using voice compression: MELP or MELPe ==\nThe MELPe or enhanced-MELP (Mixed Excitation Linear Prediction) is a United States Department of Defense speech coding standard used mainly in military applications and satellite communications, secure voice, and secure radio devices.

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nBulletproof hosting\n\n==Introduction==\nBulletproof hosting (BPH) is technical infrastructure service provided by an Internet hosting service that is resilient to complaints of illicit activities, which serves criminal actors as a basic building block for streamlining various cyberattacks. BPH providers allow online gambling, illegal pornography, botnet command and control servers, spam, copyrighted materials, hate speech and misinformation, despite takedown court orders and law enforcement subpoenas, allowing such material in their acceptable use policies.BPH providers usually operate in jurisdictions which have lenient laws against such conduct. Most non-BPH service providers prohibit transferring materials over their network that would be in violation of their terms of service and the local laws of the incorporated jurisdiction, and oftentimes any abuse reports would result in takedowns to avoid their autonomous system's IP address block being blacklisted by other providers and by Spamhaus.\n\n== Difficulties ==\nSince any abuse reports to the BPH will be disregarded, in most cases, the whole IP block (\"netblock\") assigned to the BPH's autonomous system will be blacklisted by other providers and third party spam filters. Additionally, BPH also have difficulty in finding network peering points for establishing Border Gateway Protocol sessions, since routing a BPH provider's network can affect the reputation of upstream autonomous systems and transit provider. This makes it difficult for BPH services to provide stable network connectivity, and in extreme cases, they can be completely de-peered; therefore BPH providers evade AS's reputation based fortification such as BGP Ranking and ASwatch through unconventional methodologies.\n\n\n*** Web hosting reseller ***\nAccording to a report, due to their mounting difficulties, BPH providers engage in establishing reseller relationships with lower-end hosting providers; although these providers are not complicit in supporting the illegitimate activities, they tend to be lenient on abuse reports and do not actively engage in fraud detection. Therefore, BPH conceals itself behind lower-end hosting providers, leveraging their better reputation and simultaneously operating both bulletproof and legitimate resells through the sub-allocated network blocks. However, if the BPH services are caught, providers of BPH migrate their clients to a newer internet infrastructure\u2014newer lower-end AS, or IP space\u2014effectively making the blacklisted IP addresses of the previous AS ephemeral; thus continuing to engage in criminal conduct by modifying the DNS server's resource records of the listening services and making it point to the newer IP addresses belonging to the current AS's IP space. Due to privacy concerns, the customary modes of contact for BPH providers include ICQ, Skype, and XMPP (or Jabber).\n\n== Admissible abuses ==\nMost BPH providers promise immunity against copyright infringement and court order takedown notices, notably Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), Electronic Commerce Directive (ECD) and law enforcement subpoenas. They also allow users to operate phishing, scams (such as high-yield investment program), botnet masters and unlicensed online pharmacy websites. In these cases, the BPH providers (known as \"offshore providers\") operate in jurisdictions which do not have any extradition treaty or mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) signed with the five eye countries, particularly the United States. However, most BPH providers have a zero-tolerance policy towards child pornography and terrorism, although a few allow cold storage of such material given forbidden open-accessibility via the public internet.Prevalent jurisdictions for incorporation and location of the data centers for BPH providers include Russia (being more permissive), Ukraine, China, Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria, Belize, Panama and the Seychelles.\n\n== Impacts ==\nBPH services act as vital network infrastructure providers for activities such as cybercrime and online illicit economies, and the well-established working model of the cybercrime economies surrounds upon tool development and skill-sharing among peers. The development of exploits, such as zero-day vulnerabilities, are done by a very small community of highly-skilled actors, who encase them in convenient tools which are usually bought by low-skilled actors (known as script kiddies), who make use of BPH providers for carry out cyberattacks, usually targeting low-profile unpretentious network services and individuals. According to a report produced by Carnegie Mellon University for the United States Department of Defense, low-profile amateur actors are also potent in causing harmful consequences, especially to small businesses, inexperienced internet users, and miniature servers.Criminal actors also run specialized computer programs on BPH providers knowns as port scanners which scan the entire IPv4 address space for open ports, services run on those open ports, and the version of their service daemons, searching for vulnerable versions for exploitation. One such notable vulnerability scanned by the port scanners is Heartbleed, which affected millions of internet servers. Furthermore, BPH clients also host click fraud, adware (such as DollarRevenue), and money laundering recruitment sites, which lure untried internet users into honey trapping and causing financial losses to the individuals while unrestrictedly keeping their illicit sites online, despite court orders and takedown attempts by law enforcement.\n\n\n*** Counterinitiatives against BPH ***\nThe Spamhaus Project is an international nonprofit organization that monitors cyber threats and provides realtime blacklist reports (known as the \"Badness Index\") on malicious ASs, netblocks, and registrars that are involved in spam, phishing, or cybercrime activities. The Spamhaus team works closely with law enforcement agencies such as National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the data compiled by Spamhaus is used by the majority of the ISPs, email service providers, corporations, educational institutes, governments and uplink gateways of military networks. Spamhaus publishes various data feeds that list netblocks of the criminal actors, and is designed for use by gateways, firewalls and routing equipments to filter out (or \"nullroute\") traffic originating from these netblocks:\nSpamhaus Don't Route Or Peer List (DROP) lists netblocks allocated by an established Regional Internet Registry (RIR) or National Internet Registry (NIR) that are used by criminal actors, and doesn't include abused IP address spaces sub-allocated netblocks of a reputable AS.\nSpamhaus Domain Block List (DBL) lists domain names with poor reputation in DNSBL format.\nSpamhaus Botnet Controller List (BCL) lists single IPv4 addresses of botnet masters.\n\n== Notable closed services ==\nThe following are some of the notable defunct BPH providers:\n\nCyberBunker, taken down in September 2019.\nMcColo, taken down in November 2008.\nRussian Business Network (RBN), taken down in November 2007.\nAtrivo, taken down in September 2008.\n3FN, taken down by FTC in June 2009.\nProxiez, taken down in May 2010.\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMcCoy, Damon; Mi, Xianghang; Wang, Xiofeng (26 June 2017). \"Under the Shadow of Sunshine: Understanding and Detecting Bulletproof Hosting on Legitimate Service Provider Networks\".

      "context": "Bulletproof hosting\n\n==Introduction==\nBulletproof hosting (BPH) is technical infrastructure service provided by an Internet hosting service that is resilient to complaints of illicit activities, which serves criminal actors as a basic building block for streamlining various cyberattacks. BPH providers allow online gambling, illegal pornography, botnet command and control servers, spam, copyrighted materials, hate speech and misinformation, despite takedown court orders and law enforcement subpoenas, allowing such material in their acceptable use policies.BPH providers usually operate in jurisdictions which have lenient laws against such conduct. Most non-BPH service providers prohibit transferring materials over their network that would be in violation of their terms of service and the local laws of the incorporated jurisdiction, and oftentimes any abuse reports would result in takedowns to avoid their autonomous system's IP address block being blacklisted by other providers and by Spamhaus.\n\n== Difficulties ==\nSince any abuse reports to the BPH will be disregarded, in most cases, the whole IP block (\"netblock\") assigned to the BPH's autonomous system will be blacklisted by other providers and third party spam filters. Additionally, BPH also have difficulty in finding network peering points for establishing Border Gateway Protocol sessions, since routing a BPH provider's network can affect the reputation of upstream autonomous systems and transit provider. This makes it difficult for BPH services to provide stable network connectivity, and in extreme cases, they can be completely de-peered; therefore BPH providers evade AS's reputation based fortification such as BGP Ranking and ASwatch through unconventional methodologies.\n\n\n*** Web hosting reseller ***\nAccording to a report, due to their mounting difficulties, BPH providers engage in establishing reseller relationships with lower-end hosting providers; although these providers are not complicit in supporting the illegitimate activities, they tend to be lenient on abuse reports and do not actively engage in fraud detection. Therefore, BPH conceals itself behind lower-end hosting providers, leveraging their better reputation and simultaneously operating both bulletproof and legitimate resells through the sub-allocated network blocks. However, if the BPH services are caught, providers of BPH migrate their clients to a newer internet infrastructure\u2014newer lower-end AS, or IP space\u2014effectively making the blacklisted IP addresses of the previous AS ephemeral; thus continuing to engage in criminal conduct by modifying the DNS server's resource records of the listening services and making it point to the newer IP addresses belonging to the current AS's IP space. Due to privacy concerns, the customary modes of contact for BPH providers include ICQ, Skype, and XMPP (or Jabber).\n\n== Admissible abuses ==\nMost BPH providers promise immunity against copyright infringement and court order takedown notices, notably Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), Electronic Commerce Directive (ECD) and law enforcement subpoenas. They also allow users to operate phishing, scams (such as high-yield investment program), botnet masters and unlicensed online pharmacy websites. In these cases, the BPH providers (known as \"offshore providers\") operate in jurisdictions which do not have any extradition treaty or mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) signed with the five eye countries, particularly the United States. However, most BPH providers have a zero-tolerance policy towards child pornography and terrorism, although a few allow cold storage of such material given forbidden open-accessibility via the public internet.Prevalent jurisdictions for incorporation and location of the data centers for BPH providers include Russia (being more permissive), Ukraine, China, Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria, Belize, Panama and the Seychelles.\n\n== Impacts ==\nBPH services act as vital network infrastructure providers for activities such as cybercrime and online illicit economies, and the well-established working model of the cybercrime economies surrounds upon tool development and skill-sharing among peers. The development of exploits, such as zero-day vulnerabilities, are done by a very small community of highly-skilled actors, who encase them in convenient tools which are usually bought by low-skilled actors (known as script kiddies), who make use of BPH providers for carry out cyberattacks, usually targeting low-profile unpretentious network services and individuals. According to a report produced by Carnegie Mellon University for the United States Department of Defense, low-profile amateur actors are also potent in causing harmful consequences, especially to small businesses, inexperienced internet users, and miniature servers.Criminal actors also run specialized computer programs on BPH providers knowns as port scanners which scan the entire IPv4 address space for open ports, services run on those open ports, and the version of their service daemons, searching for vulnerable versions for exploitation. One such notable vulnerability scanned by the port scanners is Heartbleed, which affected millions of internet servers. Furthermore, BPH clients also host click fraud, adware (such as DollarRevenue), and money laundering recruitment sites, which lure untried internet users into honey trapping and causing financial losses to the individuals while unrestrictedly keeping their illicit sites online, despite court orders and takedown attempts by law enforcement.\n\n\n*** Counterinitiatives against BPH ***\nThe Spamhaus Project is an international nonprofit organization that monitors cyber threats and provides realtime blacklist reports (known as the \"Badness Index\") on malicious ASs, netblocks, and registrars that are involved in spam, phishing, or cybercrime activities. The Spamhaus team works closely with law enforcement agencies such as National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the data compiled by Spamhaus is used by the majority of the ISPs, email service providers, corporations, educational institutes, governments and uplink gateways of military networks. Spamhaus publishes various data feeds that list netblocks of the criminal actors, and is designed for use by gateways, firewalls and routing equipments to filter out (or \"nullroute\") traffic originating from these netblocks:\nSpamhaus Don't Route Or Peer List (DROP) lists netblocks allocated by an established Regional Internet Registry (RIR) or National Internet Registry (NIR) that are used by criminal actors, and doesn't include abused IP address spaces sub-allocated netblocks of a reputable AS.\nSpamhaus Domain Block List (DBL) lists domain names with poor reputation in DNSBL format.\nSpamhaus Botnet Controller List (BCL) lists single IPv4 addresses of botnet masters.\n\n== Notable closed services ==\nThe following are some of the notable defunct BPH providers:\n\nCyberBunker, taken down in September 2019.\nMcColo, taken down in November 2008.\nRussian Business Network (RBN), taken down in November 2007.\nAtrivo, taken down in September 2008.\n3FN, taken down by FTC in June 2009.\nProxiez, taken down in May 2010.\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMcCoy, Damon; Mi, Xianghang; Wang, Xiofeng (26 June 2017). \"Under the Shadow of Sunshine: Understanding and Detecting Bulletproof Hosting on Legitimate Service Provider Networks\".

    "instruction": "Context: Salt (cryptography)\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password or passphrase. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. Historically, only the output from an invocation of a cryptographic hash function on the password was stored on a system, but, over time, additional safeguards were developed to protect against duplicate or common passwords being identifiable (as their hashes are identical). Salting is one such protection.\nA new salt is randomly generated for each password. Typically, the salt and the password (or its version after key stretching) are concatenated and fed to a cryptographic hash function, and the output hash value (but not the original password) is stored with the salt in a database. Hashing allows later authentication without keeping and therefore risking exposure of the plaintext password if the authentication data store is compromised. Salts don't need to be encrypted or stored separately from the hashed password itself, because even if an attacker has access to the database with the hash values and the salts, the correct use of said salts will hinder common attacks.Salts defend against attacks that use precomputed tables (e.g. rainbow tables), as they can make the size of table needed for a successful attack prohibitively large without burdening users. Since salts differ from one another, they also protect weak (e.g. commonly used, re-used) passwords, as different salted hashes are created for different instances of the same password.Cryptographic salts are broadly used in many modern computer systems, from Unix system credentials to Internet security.\nSalts are closely related to the concept of a cryptographic nonce.\n\n\n\n== Example usage ==\nHere is an incomplete example of a salt value for storing passwords. This first table has two username and password combinations. The password is not stored.\n\nThe salt value is generated at random and can be any length; in this case the salt value is 16 bytes long. The salt value is appended to the plaintext password and then the result is hashed, which is referred to as the hashed value. Both the salt value and hashed value are stored.\n\nAs the table above illustrates, different salt values will create completely different hashed values, even when the plaintext passwords are exactly the same. Additionally, dictionary attacks are mitigated to a degree as an attacker cannot practically precompute the hashes. However, a salt cannot protect common or easily guessed passwords.\nWithout a salt, the hashed value is the same for all users that have a given password, making it easier for hackers to guess the password from the hashed value:\n\n== Common mistakes ==\n\n\n*** Salt re-use ***\nUsing the same salt for all passwords is dangerous because a precomputed table which simply accounts for the salt will render the salt useless. \nGeneration of precomputed tables for databases with unique salts for every password is not viable because of the computational cost of doing so. But, if a common salt is used for all the entries, creating such a table (that accounts for the salt) then becomes a viable and possibly successful attack.Because salt re-use can cause users with the same password to have the same hash, cracking a single hash can result in other passwords being compromised too.\n\n\n*** Short salt ***\nIf a salt is too short, an attacker may precompute a table of every possible salt appended to every likely password. Using a long salt ensures such a table would be prohibitively large.\n\n== Benefits ==\nTo understand the difference between cracking a single password and a set of them, consider a file with users and their hashed passwords. Say the file is unsalted. Then an attacker could pick a string, call it attempt[0], and then compute hash(attempt[0]). A user whose hash stored in the file is hash(attempt[0]) may or may not have password attempt[0]. However, even if attempt[0] is not the user's actual password, it will be accepted as if it were, because the system can only check passwords by computing the hash of the password entered and comparing it to the hash stored in the file.  Thus, each match cracks a user password, and the chance of a match rises with the number of passwords in the file. In contrast, if salts are used, the attacker would have to compute hash(attempt[0] || salt[a]), compare against entry A, then hash(attempt[0] || salt[b]), compare against entry B, and so on. This prevents any one attempt from cracking multiple passwords, given that salt re-use is avoided.Salts also combat the use of precomputed tables for cracking passwords. Such a table might simply map common passwords to their hashes, or it might do something more complex, like store the start and end points of a set of precomputed hash chains. In either case, salting can defend against the use of precomputed tables by lengthening hashes and having them draw from larger character sets, making it less likely that the table covers the resulting hashes. In particular, a precomputed table would need to cover the string [salt + hash] rather than simply [hash]. \nThe modern shadow password system, in which password hashes and other security data are stored in a non-public file, somewhat mitigates these concerns. However, they remain relevant in multi-server installations which use centralized password management systems to push passwords or password hashes to multiple systems. In such installations, the root account on each individual system may be treated as less trusted than the administrators of the centralized password system, so it remains worthwhile to ensure that the security of the password hashing algorithm, including the generation of unique salt values, is adequate.Another (lesser) benefit of a salt is as follows: two users might choose the same string as their password. Without a salt, this password would be stored as the same hash string in the password file. This would disclose the fact that the two accounts have the same password, allowing anyone who knows one of the account's passwords to access the other account. By salting the passwords with two random characters, even if two accounts use the same password, no one can discover this just by reading hashes. Salting also makes it extremely difficult to determine if a person has used the same password for multiple systems.\n\n== Unix implementations ==\n\n\n*** 1970s\u20131980s ***\nEarlier versions of Unix used a password file /etc/passwd to store the hashes of salted passwords (passwords prefixed with two-character random salts). In these older versions of Unix, the salt was also stored in the passwd file (as cleartext) together with the hash of the salted password. The password file was publicly readable for all users of the system. This was necessary so that user-privileged software tools could find user names and other information. The security of passwords is therefore protected only by the one-way functions (enciphering or hashing) used for the purpose. Early Unix implementations limited passwords to eight characters and used a 12-bit salt, which allowed for 4,096 possible salt values.  This was an appropriate balance for 1970s computational and storage costs.\n\n\n*** 1980s\u2013 ***\n\nThe shadow password system is used to limit access to hashes and salt. The salt is eight characters, the hash is 86 characters, and the password length is unlimited.\n\n== Web-application implementations ==\nIt is common for a web application to store in a database the hash value of a user's password. Without a salt, a successful SQL injection attack may yield easily crackable passwords. Because many users re-use passwords for multiple sites, the use of a salt is an important component of overall web application security. Some additional references for using a salt to secure password hashes in specific languages or libraries (PHP, the .NET libraries, etc.) can be found in the external links section below.\n\nQuestions:\nWhat is a salt in cryptography and what is its purpose?q: How is a salt typically used with a password in cryptographic systems?q: Why is it not necessary to encrypt or store salts separately from the hashed password itself?q: How do salts defend against attacks using precomputed tables?q: Why do salts protect weak or commonly used passwords?q: What is a common mistake in using salts for password storage?q: What can happen if a salt is too short?q: How do salts prevent an attacker from cracking multiple passwords at once?q: How do salts help combat the use of precomputed tables for cracking passwords?q: What is the benefit of using a unique salt for each password?q: How does salting prevent the disclosure of identical passwords between users?q: How did earlier versions of Unix store salted passwords?q: How does the shadow password system improve the security of password storage in Unix?q: Why is it important to use a salt in web application security?q: What are some additional references for using a salt to secure password hashes in specific languages or libraries?\n\nAnswers:\n",

    "instruction": "Man-on-the-side attack\n\n==Introduction==\nA man-on-the-side attack is a form of active attack in computer security  similar to a man-in-the-middle attack. Instead of completely controlling a network node as in a man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker only has regular access to the communication channel, which allows him to read the traffic and insert new messages, but not to modify or delete messages sent by other participants. The attacker relies on a timing advantage to make sure that the response he sends to the request of a victim arrives before the legitimate response.\nIn real-world attacks, the response packet sent by the attacker can be used to place malware on the victim's computer. The need for a timing advantage makes the attack difficult to execute, as it requires a privileged position in the network, for example on the internet backbone. Potentially, this class of attack may be performed within a local network (assuming a privileged position), research has shown that it has been successful within critical infrastructure.The 2013 global surveillance revelations revealed that the US National Security Agency (NSA) widely uses a man-on-the-side attack to infect targets with malware through its QUANTUM program.GitHub suffered such an attack in 2015. The Russian Threat Group might have suffered a similar attack in 2019.\n\n\n\n== Definition ==\nMan-on-the-side has become a more familiarized term after Edward Snowden leaked information about the NSA's quantum insert project. Man-on-the-side attack involves a cyber-attacker in a conversation between two people or two parties who are communicating online. The cyber-attacker is able to intercept and inject messages into the communication between the two parties. However, the cyber-attacker is not able to remove any signals on communication channels. Man-on-the-side attack can be applied to websites while retrieving online file downloads. The cyber-attacker is able to receive signals and perform the attack through a satellite. As long as they have a satellite dish in the place they're residing in, they will be able to read transmissions and receive signals. Satellites tend to have high latency, which gives the cyber attacker enough time to send their injected response to the victim before the actual response from one party reaches the other through the satellite link. Therefore, this is the reason why an attacker relies on timing advantage.\nThe main difference between man-in-the-middle attack and man-on-the-side-attack is that man-in-the-middle attackers are able to intercept and block messages and signals from transmitting, whilst man-on-the-side attackers are able to intercept and inject messages and signals before the other party receives a legitimate response.\nSince man-on-the-side attack requires a strong timing advantage, a reason to why people use Man-on-the-side attack may be explained through their psychological behaviour. Faculty Member from the University of Stavanger, Maria Kjaerland, conducted an exploration study to examine the relationship between different cyber offences and psychological behaviours. She concluded that web compromise is a common activity for hackers attacking targets for challenge because it relies on attackers having accurate timing in leaving messages victims. They can be easily caught if the timing is incorrect and will not be able to make up for it. Therefore, this challenge bears higher consequences amongst other types of attacks. Therefore,  Similarly, man-on-the-side attack also require attackers to rely on having time advantage in order to retrieving and modifying information from victims without them realising or determining what the hacker has done.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n\n*** Russia ***\nIn 2019, it was reported that man-on-the-side attack might have been conceived by the Russian Threat Group through installing Malwares. When victim used the internet and requested to download a file at a particular website, man-on-the-side attackers who were present were aware that the victims were attempting to download the file. Since the man-on-the-side attackers were not able to prohibit the victim from downloading the file, what they could do was to intercept the server and send a signal to the victim before the victim received a legitimate response, which was the requested download file. The attacker then intercepted and sent the victims a message that directed them to a 302 error site, which led the victim to think that the file has been removed or it simply cannot be downloaded. However, even though the victim would receive a legitimate response from the website file download, since their servers were already contaminated, they would not have been able to view the legitimate website and file sine they received a so-called proper response from the attacking team. At the 302 error site, the attacking team directed the victims to an alternative website to download the files they wanted to, which the attacking team controlled and ran. When the victim connected to the attacking team's server, not known to their knowledge, they would start downloading the file because on the victim's screen, it shows that this site is working and they can finally download the file. However, the attacking team had already found the original file from the legitimate website and modified the file to include pieces of malwares and sent the file back to the victim. When the victim clicked on the link and started downloading the file, they were already downloading a file that consisted of malwares.\n\n\n*** China ***\nIn 2015, the two GitHub repositories suffered a flooded attack due to man-on-the-side attack. When a user outside of China attempts to browse a Chinese website, they are required to pass the Chinese Internet Infrastructure before automatically being directed to the website. The infrastructure allowed the request to the legitimate Chinese website the user wanted to browse to without any modifications involved. The response came back from the website, but as it passed through the Chinese Internet Infrastructure, before it could get back to the user, the response had been modified. The modification involved a malware that changed the Baidu analytics script from only accessing Baidu to the user-making request to access the two GitHub Repositories as they continued browse the website. The user, who was able to continue browsing the Chinese search engine, Baidu, were innocent since they were absolutely unaware of the fact that their response involved an embedded malicious script, which would make a request to access GitHub on the side. This happened to all users outside of china who was trying to seek access to a Chinese website, which resulted in extremely high volumes of requests being made to the two GitHub Repositories. The enormous load GitHub had to bear had caused the server to flood and was thus attacked.\n\nAnswer these questions based on the above context: What is a man-on-the-side attack and how does it differ from a man-in-the-middle attack?q: How does a man-on-the-side attacker use timing advantage?q: What is required for a man-on-the-side attack to be successful?q: How can man-on-the-side attacks be used to infect targets with malware?q: What is the significance of the high latency of satellites in man-on-the-side attacks?q: How can man-on-the-side attacks be used to compromise websites?q: What psychological behaviors may be associated with man-on-the-side attacks?q: How can man-on-the-side attacks be used to contaminate servers?q: How can man-on-the-side attacks be used to direct users to alternative websites?q: How can man-on-the-side attacks be used to modify files?q: How can man-on-the-side attacks be used to cause servers to flood?q: How can man-on-the-side attacks be used to modify scripts on websites?q: How can man-on-the-side attacks be used to inject malware into downloaded files?q: How can man-on-the-side attacks be used to exploit high volumes of requests to websites?q: How can man-on-the-side attacks be used to intercept and read transmissions?",

      "context": "Man-on-the-side attack\n\n==Introduction==\nA man-on-the-side attack is a form of active attack in computer security  similar to a man-in-the-middle attack. Instead of completely controlling a network node as in a man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker only has regular access to the communication channel, which allows him to read the traffic and insert new messages, but not to modify or delete messages sent by other participants. The attacker relies on a timing advantage to make sure that the response he sends to the request of a victim arrives before the legitimate response.\nIn real-world attacks, the response packet sent by the attacker can be used to place malware on the victim's computer. The need for a timing advantage makes the attack difficult to execute, as it requires a privileged position in the network, for example on the internet backbone. Potentially, this class of attack may be performed within a local network (assuming a privileged position), research has shown that it has been successful within critical infrastructure.The 2013 global surveillance revelations revealed that the US National Security Agency (NSA) widely uses a man-on-the-side attack to infect targets with malware through its QUANTUM program.GitHub suffered such an attack in 2015. The Russian Threat Group might have suffered a similar attack in 2019.\n\n\n\n== Definition ==\nMan-on-the-side has become a more familiarized term after Edward Snowden leaked information about the NSA's quantum insert project. Man-on-the-side attack involves a cyber-attacker in a conversation between two people or two parties who are communicating online. The cyber-attacker is able to intercept and inject messages into the communication between the two parties. However, the cyber-attacker is not able to remove any signals on communication channels. Man-on-the-side attack can be applied to websites while retrieving online file downloads. The cyber-attacker is able to receive signals and perform the attack through a satellite. As long as they have a satellite dish in the place they're residing in, they will be able to read transmissions and receive signals. Satellites tend to have high latency, which gives the cyber attacker enough time to send their injected response to the victim before the actual response from one party reaches the other through the satellite link. Therefore, this is the reason why an attacker relies on timing advantage.\nThe main difference between man-in-the-middle attack and man-on-the-side-attack is that man-in-the-middle attackers are able to intercept and block messages and signals from transmitting, whilst man-on-the-side attackers are able to intercept and inject messages and signals before the other party receives a legitimate response.\nSince man-on-the-side attack requires a strong timing advantage, a reason to why people use Man-on-the-side attack may be explained through their psychological behaviour. Faculty Member from the University of Stavanger, Maria Kjaerland, conducted an exploration study to examine the relationship between different cyber offences and psychological behaviours. She concluded that web compromise is a common activity for hackers attacking targets for challenge because it relies on attackers having accurate timing in leaving messages victims. They can be easily caught if the timing is incorrect and will not be able to make up for it. Therefore, this challenge bears higher consequences amongst other types of attacks. Therefore,  Similarly, man-on-the-side attack also require attackers to rely on having time advantage in order to retrieving and modifying information from victims without them realising or determining what the hacker has done.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n\n*** Russia ***\nIn 2019, it was reported that man-on-the-side attack might have been conceived by the Russian Threat Group through installing Malwares. When victim used the internet and requested to download a file at a particular website, man-on-the-side attackers who were present were aware that the victims were attempting to download the file. Since the man-on-the-side attackers were not able to prohibit the victim from downloading the file, what they could do was to intercept the server and send a signal to the victim before the victim received a legitimate response, which was the requested download file. The attacker then intercepted and sent the victims a message that directed them to a 302 error site, which led the victim to think that the file has been removed or it simply cannot be downloaded. However, even though the victim would receive a legitimate response from the website file download, since their servers were already contaminated, they would not have been able to view the legitimate website and file sine they received a so-called proper response from the attacking team. At the 302 error site, the attacking team directed the victims to an alternative website to download the files they wanted to, which the attacking team controlled and ran. When the victim connected to the attacking team's server, not known to their knowledge, they would start downloading the file because on the victim's screen, it shows that this site is working and they can finally download the file. However, the attacking team had already found the original file from the legitimate website and modified the file to include pieces of malwares and sent the file back to the victim. When the victim clicked on the link and started downloading the file, they were already downloading a file that consisted of malwares.\n\n\n*** China ***\nIn 2015, the two GitHub repositories suffered a flooded attack due to man-on-the-side attack. When a user outside of China attempts to browse a Chinese website, they are required to pass the Chinese Internet Infrastructure before automatically being directed to the website. The infrastructure allowed the request to the legitimate Chinese website the user wanted to browse to without any modifications involved. The response came back from the website, but as it passed through the Chinese Internet Infrastructure, before it could get back to the user, the response had been modified. The modification involved a malware that changed the Baidu analytics script from only accessing Baidu to the user-making request to access the two GitHub Repositories as they continued browse the website. The user, who was able to continue browsing the Chinese search engine, Baidu, were innocent since they were absolutely unaware of the fact that their response involved an embedded malicious script, which would make a request to access GitHub on the side. This happened to all users outside of china who was trying to seek access to a Chinese website, which resulted in extremely high volumes of requests being made to the two GitHub Repositories. The enormous load GitHub had to bear had caused the server to flood and was thus attacked.",

Enciphered teleprinter traffic was used between German High Command and Army Group commanders in the field, so its intelligence value (Ultra) was of the highest strategic value to the Allies. This traffic normally passed over landlines, but as German forces extended their geographic reach beyond western Europe, they had to resort to wireless transmission.Bletchley Park decrypts of messages enciphered with the Enigma machines revealed that the Germans called one of their wireless teleprinter transmission systems \"S\u00e4gefisch\" (sawfish) which led British cryptographers to refer to encrypted German radiotelegraphic traffic as Fish. The code Tunny (tunafish) was the name given to the first non-Morse link, and it was subsequently used for the Lorenz SZ machines and the traffic enciphered by them.\n\n== Traffic code names ==\n\n\n*** Tunny ***\n\nThe NoMo1 link was initially named Tunny (for tunafish), a name which went on to be used both for the Lorenz SZ40/42 machines and for the Bletchley Park analogues of them. The NoMo1 link was subsequently renamed Codfish. A large number of Tunny links were monitored by the Y-station at Knockholt and given names of fish. Most of these were between the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German High Command, OKW) in Berlin and German army commands throughout occupied Europe. \nThe Tunny links were based on two central transmitting and receiving points in Strausberg near Berlin for Army generals in the West and one in K\u00f6nigsberg in Prussia for the Eastern Front. The number of radio links jumped from eight in mid-1943 to fourteen or fifteen. In 1941 the initial experimental Tunny link was between Berlin and Athens/Salonoka. \nBy D-Day in 1944 there were twenty-six links, based on Konigsberg and Straussberg. Other links were usually mobile; in two trucks, one with radio equipment and one with a \"send\" Tunny machine and a receive \"Tunny\" machine. The links carried very high-grade intelligence: messages from Hitler and the High Command  to various Army Group commanders in the field.Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher at Bletchley Park was assisted initially by a machine called Heath Robinson and later by the Colossus computers yielded a great deal of valuable high-level intelligence.\n\nTunny decrypts provided high-grade intelligence in an unprecedented quality.

In May 1940, after the German invasion of Norway, the Swedish mathematician and cryptographer Arne Beurling used traffic intercepted from telegraph lines that passed through Sweden to break this cipher.  Although Bletchley Park eventually diagnosed and broke Sturgeon, the relatively low value of the intelligence gained, compared to the effort involved, meant that they did not read much of its traffic.\n\n\n*** Thrasher ***\nThis was the name used for traffic enciphered on a Geheimschreiber that was probably the Siemens T43 one-time tape machine.

    "instruction": "Malwarebytes\n\n==Introduction==\nMalwarebytes Inc. is an American Internet security company that specializes in protecting home computers, smartphones, and companies from malware and other threats. It has offices in Santa Clara, California; Clearwater, Florida; Tallinn, Estonia;  Bastia Umbra, Italy; and Cork, Ireland.Marcin Kleczynski has been the CEO of Malwarebytes since 2008.\n\n== Services and products ==\nKleczynski has stated that Malwarebytes, first developed in 2008, has a competitive advantage over many other traditional antivirus programs, many of which were developed in the late 1990s, before the development of many later forms of malware. The New York Times has described Malwarebytes as a \"hybrid of heuristics, behavior and a signature engine that is designed to detect and block malware that other vendors can't detect\". According to Dean Takahashi of VentureBeat, Malwarebytes complements other antivirus software from vendors such as Symantec and McAfee, with the anti-malware working alongside other anti-virus software to attack the problem from \"different directions\", remarking that the software both removed infections from infected machines, whilst preventing others from becoming infected in the first place.As in the early development days with RogueRemover, Malwarebytes continues to support community feedback on its products, and runs two sub-forums complementing the main forum, known as \"False positives\" and \"Malware contribution\", with the false positives being reported allowing the company to update its database within hours of posting, and the Malware contribution allowing for users to quickly report malware missed by the software.\n\n\n*** Products ***\n\nMalwarebytes has several products, which as of 2011 were available in 36 different languages. Malwarebytes Anti-Malware offers two different versions, one for free download for home computers, and the other a professional version, with a 14-day free trial in advance, offering \"real-time protection against malware, automated scanning, and automatic updating\". Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Mobile is a free Android app which protects smartphones from mobile malware, preventing unauthorized access to personal data identifying tracking applications. As of April 2023, it has a rating of 4.3 on the Google Play store.In 2014, the company launched Malwarebytes Anti-Malware 2.0 with an improved user interface and dashboard. The company also launched Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit in the same year, which shields selected applications from attacks by \"exploit mitigation to protect vulnerable programs\". Anti-Exploit also comes in a free and paid for version for Windows computers. The free version stops exploits in browsers and Java, whilst the paid product adds protection for a wider range of software applications. Anti-Exploit received four stars from PC Magazine in 2015 and won V3 magazine's \"Security Innovation of the Year\" award in 2014.In 2016, Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit was merged into the premium version Malwarebytes version 3.0, and the standalone application is now offered only as a perpetual beta.In January 2016, Malwarebytes unveiled Malwarebytes Endpoint Security, advanced anti-ransomware technology which is described as the \"first solution to offer multiple layers of protection against unknown ransomware\". The company sponsored a survey with Osterman Research into 540 firms in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Germany and found that nearly 40% of companies had experienced ransomware incidents, of which 34 percent had accounted for loss of revenue. The Guardian reported that one-fifth of British companies had been charged over $10,000 to unlock their files and that there was an increasing demand for anti-ransomware technology. After Endpoint's inception, the beta was reportedly downloaded by some 200,000 businesses and consumers in the first six months of the year.In 2017, Malwarebytes expanded its portfolio to include mobile products for Mac and Android including Malwarebytes for Android and Malwarebytes for Mac. Malwarebytes also can be run on ChromeOS, but mainly provides protection against Android threats.  Malwarebytes also released Malwarebytes for iOS in 2018 to deliver secure and private mobile experiences for its users. Due to Apple's security restrictions, Malwarebytes for iOS can not remove malware, but does provide basic web protection and spam blocking. In 2020, Malwarebytes Privacy, a VPN offering, was launched.\nIn 2018, Malwarebytes expanded its business portfolio by launching Malwarebytes Endpoint Protection and Response Archived 2021-10-02 at the Wayback Machine to monitor, identify and remediate attacks. This offering was extended in 2020 to include server protection for enterprise customers with Malwarebytes Endpoint Detection and Response for Servers and Malwarebytes Endpoint Protection for Servers.

      "context": "Malwarebytes\n\n==Introduction==\nMalwarebytes Inc. is an American Internet security company that specializes in protecting home computers, smartphones, and companies from malware and other threats. It has offices in Santa Clara, California; Clearwater, Florida; Tallinn, Estonia;  Bastia Umbra, Italy; and Cork, Ireland.Marcin Kleczynski has been the CEO of Malwarebytes since 2008.\n\n== Services and products ==\nKleczynski has stated that Malwarebytes, first developed in 2008, has a competitive advantage over many other traditional antivirus programs, many of which were developed in the late 1990s, before the development of many later forms of malware. The New York Times has described Malwarebytes as a \"hybrid of heuristics, behavior and a signature engine that is designed to detect and block malware that other vendors can't detect\". According to Dean Takahashi of VentureBeat, Malwarebytes complements other antivirus software from vendors such as Symantec and McAfee, with the anti-malware working alongside other anti-virus software to attack the problem from \"different directions\", remarking that the software both removed infections from infected machines, whilst preventing others from becoming infected in the first place.As in the early development days with RogueRemover, Malwarebytes continues to support community feedback on its products, and runs two sub-forums complementing the main forum, known as \"False positives\" and \"Malware contribution\", with the false positives being reported allowing the company to update its database within hours of posting, and the Malware contribution allowing for users to quickly report malware missed by the software.\n\n\n*** Products ***\n\nMalwarebytes has several products, which as of 2011 were available in 36 different languages. Malwarebytes Anti-Malware offers two different versions, one for free download for home computers, and the other a professional version, with a 14-day free trial in advance, offering \"real-time protection against malware, automated scanning, and automatic updating\". Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Mobile is a free Android app which protects smartphones from mobile malware, preventing unauthorized access to personal data identifying tracking applications. As of April 2023, it has a rating of 4.3 on the Google Play store.In 2014, the company launched Malwarebytes Anti-Malware 2.0 with an improved user interface and dashboard. The company also launched Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit in the same year, which shields selected applications from attacks by \"exploit mitigation to protect vulnerable programs\". Anti-Exploit also comes in a free and paid for version for Windows computers. The free version stops exploits in browsers and Java, whilst the paid product adds protection for a wider range of software applications. Anti-Exploit received four stars from PC Magazine in 2015 and won V3 magazine's \"Security Innovation of the Year\" award in 2014.In 2016, Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit was merged into the premium version Malwarebytes version 3.0, and the standalone application is now offered only as a perpetual beta.In January 2016, Malwarebytes unveiled Malwarebytes Endpoint Security, advanced anti-ransomware technology which is described as the \"first solution to offer multiple layers of protection against unknown ransomware\". The company sponsored a survey with Osterman Research into 540 firms in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Germany and found that nearly 40% of companies had experienced ransomware incidents, of which 34 percent had accounted for loss of revenue. The Guardian reported that one-fifth of British companies had been charged over $10,000 to unlock their files and that there was an increasing demand for anti-ransomware technology. After Endpoint's inception, the beta was reportedly downloaded by some 200,000 businesses and consumers in the first six months of the year.In 2017, Malwarebytes expanded its portfolio to include mobile products for Mac and Android including Malwarebytes for Android and Malwarebytes for Mac. Malwarebytes also can be run on ChromeOS, but mainly provides protection against Android threats.  Malwarebytes also released Malwarebytes for iOS in 2018 to deliver secure and private mobile experiences for its users. Due to Apple's security restrictions, Malwarebytes for iOS can not remove malware, but does provide basic web protection and spam blocking. In 2020, Malwarebytes Privacy, a VPN offering, was launched.\nIn 2018, Malwarebytes expanded its business portfolio by launching Malwarebytes Endpoint Protection and Response Archived 2021-10-02 at the Wayback Machine to monitor, identify and remediate attacks. This offering was extended in 2020 to include server protection for enterprise customers with Malwarebytes Endpoint Detection and Response for Servers and Malwarebytes Endpoint Protection for Servers.  In 2020, Malwarebytes also launched Malwarebytes Nebula, a cloud platform for enterprise customers to simplify endpoint management and reporting.\nMalwarebytes also has numerous tools such as a Junkware Removal Tool to remove adware, an Anti-Rootkit Beta to remove and repair rootkits, StartUpLITE to boost the speed of the Windows reboot, FileASSASSIN to prevent locked files and a Malware Removal Service to support organizations under an active malware attack.\n\n\n*** License and privacy ***\nThe software license requires arbitration \"in the county where you reside\", forbids class action suits, reverse engineering and sharing, and limits warranties and liability.

    "instruction": "Parasitic computing\n\n==Introduction==\nParasitic computing is programming technique where a program in normal authorized interactions with another program manages to get the other program to perform computations of a complex nature. It is, in a sense, a security exploit in that the program implementing the parasitic computing has no authority to consume resources made available to the other program.\nIt was first proposed by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, Vincent W. Freeh, Hawoong Jeong & Jay B. Brockman from University of Notre Dame, Indiana, USA, in 2001. The example given by the original paper was two computers communicating over the Internet, under disguise of a standard communications session. The first computer is attempting to solve a large and extremely difficult 3-SAT problem; it has decomposed the original 3-SAT problem in a considerable number of smaller problems. Each of these smaller problems is then encoded as a relation between a checksum and a packet such that whether the checksum is accurate or not is also the answer to that smaller problem. The packet/checksum is then sent to another computer. This computer will, as part of receiving the packet and deciding whether it is valid and well-formed, create a checksum of the packet and see whether it is identical to the provided checksum. If the checksum is invalid, it will then request a new packet from the original computer. The original computer now knows the answer to that smaller problem based on the second computer's response, and can transmit a fresh packet embodying a different sub-problem. Eventually, all the sub-problems will be answered and the final answer easily calculated.\nThe example is based on an exploit of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), used for internet connections, so in the end, the target computer(s) is unaware that it has performed computation for the benefit of the other computer, or even done anything besides have a normal TCP/IP session.\nThe proof-of-concept is obviously extremely inefficient as the amount of computation necessary to merely send the packets in the first place easily exceeds the computations leeched from the other program; the 3-SAT problem would be solved much more quickly if just analyzed locally. In addition, in practice packets would probably have to be retransmitted occasionally when real checksum errors and network problems occur. However, parasitic computing on the level of checksums is a demonstration of the concept. The authors suggest that as one moves up the application stack, there might come a point where there is a net computational gain to the parasite - perhaps one could break down interesting problems into queries of complex cryptographic protocols using public keys. If there was a net gain, one could in theory use a number of control nodes for which many hosts on the Internet form a distributed computing network completely unawares.\nStudents of the University of Applied Sciences, Bern, Switzerland, extended this concept into a programmable virtual machine in 2002.\n\n\n\n== Parasitic Bitcoin mining ==\nIn 2011, a group of malware programs were noticed by security software vendors, which utilized high performance graphics processing units (GPUs) for Bitcoin mining, a chain of computationally intensive tasks to generate cryptocurrency units. These programs invaded systems and were executed like other malware, rather than exploiting underlying protocols. Powerful GPUs on personal computers were originally created mainly for games, but with interfaces like CUDA and OpenCL, became usable for general computing tasks, surpassing the performance of a Central Processing Unit (CPU) by multiple times. Until then, parasitic computing lacked powerful computing resources and results to easily convert into cash for criminals.\nIn January 2014, Bitcoin mining malware was distributed through a Java exploit by compromised ads, displayed on the Yahoo website. In 2013, Bitcoin mining malware was installed as adware alongside other downloads, some pointing out the functionality in lengthy EULA texts. Malware including Bitcoin mining functionality was also secretly downloaded and activated by adware bundled with regular software downloads, both distributed by related companies in Israel and Ukraine.Bitcoin mining by personal computers infected with malware is being challenged by dedicated hardware, such as FPGA and ASIC platforms, which are more efficient in terms of power consumption and thus may have lower costs than theft of computing resources.\n\nBased on the above text, answer the questions.

      "answers": "Parasitic computing was first introduced in 2001 by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi, Vincent W. Freeh, Hawoong Jeong & Jay B. Brockman from the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, USA. The original example given was of two computers communicating over the internet under the disguise of a standard communications session. The first computer was attempting to solve a large and complex 3-SAT problem by decomposing it into smaller problems and encoding each one as a relation between a checksum and a packet. These packets were then sent to the second computer, which would create a checksum and compare it to the provided one to determine if the packet was valid or not. Through this process, the second computer would unknowingly perform computations for the benefit of the first computer.a: The example of parasitic computing exploits the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which is used for internet connections. The target computer is unaware of the computation being performed because it is carried out through the process of creating and checking checksums for the packets being sent, which is a normal part of a TCP/IP session.a: The original concept of parasitic computing as demonstrated is extremely inefficient, as the amount of computation necessary to send the packets and handle errors and network problems exceeds the computations leeched from the other program. In addition, the 3-SAT problem would be solved much more quickly if just analyzed locally.a: Students at the University of Applied Sciences, Bern, Switzerland extended the concept of parasitic computing into a programmable virtual machine in 2002.a: Bitcoin mining is a chain of computationally intensive tasks to generate cryptocurrency units. In the context of parasitic computing, Bitcoin mining was first used by malware programs in 2011 to convert computing resources into cash for criminals.a: In 2013-2014, malware programs distributing Bitcoin mining functionality were installed as adware alongside other downloads, secretly downloaded and activated by adware bundled with regular software downloads, and distributed through a Java exploit by compromised ads on the Yahoo website.a: The challenge facing Bitcoin mining through parasitic computing using personal computers is that it is being challenged by dedicated hardware, such as FPGA and ASIC platforms, which are more efficient in terms of power consumption and thus may have lower costs than theft of computing resources.a: Powerful GPUs were originally created mainly for games, but with interfaces like CUDA and OpenCL, they became usable for general computing tasks.a: Powerful GPUs can surpass the performance of a Central Processing Unit (CPU) by multiple times.a: Malware programs were first noticed to use high performance graphics processing units (GPUs) for Bitcoin mining in 2011.a: Bitcoin mining malware can infect systems by invading systems and being executed like other malware.a: Bitcoin mining through parasitic computing using personal computers has the benefit of potentially lower costs due to theft of computing resources, but is less efficient in terms of power consumption compared to dedicated hardware like FPGA and ASIC platforms.a: A 3-SAT problem is a type of problem in computer science where a boolean expression in conjunctive normal form with three literals per clause is to be satisfied. In the context of parasitic computing, it is used as an example of a complex problem that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems and solved through the process of sending and checking checksums for packets.a: In the context of parasitic computing, one could potentially use a number of control nodes for which many hosts on the Internet form a distributed computing network completely unawares by breaking down interesting problems into queries of complex cryptographic protocols using public keys and leeching computational resources through the process of sending and checking checksums for packets. This would require a net gain in computational power for the parasite.a: The potential security implications of parasitic computing include the exploitation of underlying protocols and the theft of computing resources without the knowledge or consent of the target computer or its users. Parasitic computing can also be used to perform complex computations and generate cryptocurrency units for criminal activity."

It is a memory protection policy whereby every page in a process's or kernel's address space may be either writable or executable, but not both. Without such protection, a program can write (as data \"W\") CPU instructions in an area of memory intended for data and then run (as executable \"X\"; or read-execute \"RX\") those instructions. This can be dangerous if the writer of the memory is malicious. W^X is the Unix-like terminology for a strict use of the general concept of executable space protection, controlled via the mprotect system call.\nW^X is relatively simple on processors that support fine-grained page permissions, such as Sun's SPARC and SPARC64, AMD's AMD64, Hewlett-Packard's PA-RISC, HP's (originally Digital Equipment Corporation's) Alpha, and ARM.\nThe term W^X has also been applied to file system write/execute permissions to mitigate file write vulnerabilities (as with in memory) and attacker persistence. Enforcing restrictions on file permissions can also close gaps in W^X enforcement caused by memory mapped files. Outright forbidding the usage of arbitrary native code can also mitigate kernel and CPU vulnerabilities not exposed via the existing code on the computer.

      "answers": "W^X is a security feature in operating systems and virtual machines that enforces a memory protection policy where every page in a process's or kernel's address space may be either writable or executable, but not both. Its purpose is to prevent a program from writing CPU instructions in an area of memory intended for data and then running those instructions, which can be dangerous if the writer of the memory is malicious.answer: W^X is relatively simple to implement on processors that support fine-grained page permissions, such as Sun's SPARC and SPARC64, AMD's AMD64, Hewlett-Packard's PA-RISC, HP's (originally Digital Equipment Corporation's) Alpha, and ARM.answer: The term W^X has been applied to file system write/execute permissions to mitigate file write vulnerabilities and attacker persistence. Enforcing restrictions on file permissions can also close gaps in W^X enforcement caused by memory mapped files. Outright forbidding the usage of arbitrary native code can also mitigate kernel and CPU vulnerabilities not exposed via the existing code on the computer.answer: The \"line in the sand\" scheme used in Exec Shield for W^X implementation involves using the CS code segment limit as a point in the address space above which execution is not permitted and data is located, and below which it is allowed and executable pages are placed.answer: W^X poses a problem for just-in-time compilation, which involves an interpreter generating machine code on the fly and then running it. This is because the page that the machine code is written to must be both writable and executable, which violates the W^X policy.answer: The simple solution used by most for W^X implementation in just-in-time compilation involves just making the page executable after the interpreter is done writing machine code, using VirtualProtect on Windows or mprotect on Unix-like operating systems.answer: The other solution used for W^X implementation in just-in-time compilation involves mapping the same region of memory to two pages, one with RW and the other with RX.answer: Supporters of the former approach for W^X implementation in just-in-time compilation believe that allowing a page that has ever been writable to be executed defeats the point of W^X and that address space layout randomization would make it safe to put both pages in the same process.answer: Supporters of the latter approach for W^X implementation in just-in-time compilation believe that the former approach is only safe when the two pages are given to two separate processes, and inter-process communication would be costlier than calling mprotect.answer: The mprotect system call in Unix-like operating systems is used to control the W^X memory protection policy. It is used to change the access permissions of a region of memory in a process's address space.answer: The NX bit in Intel 64 processors is required for W^X implementation. It is used to mark memory pages as non-executable, which prevents code from being executed from those pages.answer: The execstack option in Unix-like systems is used to allow mixing of data and code. It is used to make the stack executable, which is required for certain types of programs.answer: Linker changes are required for W^X implementation to separate data from code. This is necessary because the linker and library runtime functions often need to write to memory that is also used for code.answer: The allow\\_execmod SELinux policy is used to control operations that change the executable bit of a file. This is necessary for W^X implementation because it allows the operating system to prevent a page that has ever been writable from being executed.answer: Memory mapped files can cause gaps in W^X enforcement. Restrictions on file permissions can be used to close these gaps and enforce the W^X policy.answer: Outright forbidding the usage of arbitrary native code can mitigate kernel and CPU vulnerabilities not exposed via the existing code on the computer. This is necessary because W^X only protects against code that is written to memory at runtime, not code that is already present in the system.answer: Locking a file for the duration of any mapping into executable memory can prevent post-inspection bypasses. This is necessary because an attacker could modify the file after it has been mapped into memory, but before it has been executed."

    "instruction": "Personal identification number\n\n==Introduction==\nA personal identification number (PIN), or sometimes redundantly a PIN number or PIN code, is a numeric (sometimes alpha-numeric) passcode used in the process of authenticating a user accessing a system.\nThe PIN has been the key to facilitating the private data exchange between different data-processing centers in computer networks for financial institutions, governments, and enterprises. PINs may be used to authenticate banking systems with cardholders, governments with citizens, enterprises with employees, and computers with users, among other uses.\nIn common usage, PINs are used in ATM or POS transactions, secure access control (e.g. computer access, door access, car access), internet transactions, or to log into a restricted website.\n\n== Financial services ==\n\n\n*** PIN usage ***\nIn the context of a financial transaction, usually both a private \"PIN code\" and public user identifier are required to authenticate a user to the system. In these situations, typically the user is required to provide a non-confidential user identifier or token (the user ID) and a confidential PIN to gain access to the system. Upon receiving the user ID and PIN, the system looks up the PIN based upon the user ID and compares the looked-up PIN with the received PIN. The user is granted access only when the number entered matches the number stored in the system. Hence, despite the name, a PIN does not personally identify the user. The PIN is not printed or embedded on the card but is manually entered by the cardholder during automated teller machine (ATM) and point of sale (POS) transactions (such as those that comply with EMV), and  in card not present transactions, such as over the Internet or for phone banking.\n\n\n*** PIN length ***\nThe international standard for financial services PIN management, ISO 9564-1, allows for PINs from four up to twelve digits, but recommends that for usability reasons the card issuer not assign a PIN longer than six digits. The inventor of the ATM, John Shepherd-Barron, had at first envisioned a six-digit numeric code, but his wife could only remember four digits, and that has become the most commonly used length in many places, although banks in Switzerland and many other countries require a six-digit PIN.\n\n\n*** PIN validation ***\nThere are several main methods of validating PINs. The operations discussed below are usually performed within a hardware security module (HSM).\n\n\n**** IBM 3624 method ****\nOne of the earliest ATM models was the IBM 3624, which used the IBM method to generate what is termed a natural PIN.  The natural PIN is generated by encrypting the primary account number (PAN), using an encryption key generated specifically for the purpose. This key is sometimes referred to as the PIN generation key (PGK).  This PIN is directly related to the primary account number.  To validate the PIN, the issuing bank regenerates the PIN using the above method, and compares this with the entered PIN.\nNatural PINs cannot be user selectable because they are derived from the PAN.  If the card is reissued with a new PAN, a new PIN must be generated.\nNatural PINs allow banks to issue PIN reminder letters as the PIN can be generated.\n\n\n**** IBM 3624 + offset method ****\nTo allow user-selectable PINs it is possible to store a PIN offset value.  The offset is found by subtracting natural PIN from the customer selected PIN using modulo 10. For example, if the natural PIN is 1234, and the user wishes to have a PIN of 2345, the offset is 1111.\nThe offset can be stored either on the card track data, or in a database at the card issuer.\nTo validate the PIN, the issuing bank calculates the natural PIN as in the above method, then adds the offset and compares this value to the entered PIN.\n\n\n**** VISA method ****\n\nThe VISA method is used by many card schemes and is not VISA-specific.  The VISA method generates a PIN verification value (PVV).  Similar to the offset value, it can be stored on the card's track data, or in a database at the card issuer. This is called the reference PVV.\nThe VISA method takes the rightmost eleven digits of the PAN excluding the checksum value, a PIN validation key index (PVKI, chosen from one to six, a PVKI of 0 indicates that the PIN cannot be verified through PVS) and the required PIN value to make a 64-bit number, the PVKI selects a validation key (PVK, of 128 bits) to encrypt this number.  From this encrypted value, the PVV is found.To validate the PIN, the issuing bank calculates a PVV value from the entered PIN and PAN and compares this value to the reference PVV. If the reference PVV and the calculated PVV match, the correct PIN was entered.\nUnlike the IBM method, the VISA method doesn't derive a PIN. The PVV value is used to confirm the PIN entered at the terminal, was also used to generate the reference PVV. The PIN used to generate a PVV can be randomly generated, user-selected or even derived using the IBM method.\n\n== PIN security ==\nFinancial PINs are often four-digit numbers in the range 0000\u20132301, resulting in 10,000 possible combinations. Switzerland issues six-digit PINs by default.Some systems set up default PINs and most allow the customer to set up a PIN or to change the default one, and on some a change of PIN on first access is mandatory. Customers are usually advised not to set up a PIN-based on their or their spouse's birthdays, on driver license numbers, consecutive or repetitive numbers, or some other schemes. Some financial institutions do not give out or permit PINs where all digits are identical (such as 1111, 2222, ...), consecutive (1234, 2345, ...), numbers that start with one or more zeroes, or the last four digits of the cardholder's social security number or birth date.Many PIN verification systems allow three attempts, thereby giving a card thief a putative 0.03% probability of guessing the correct PIN before the card is blocked. This holds only if all PINs are equally likely and the attacker has no further information available, which has not been the case with some of the many PIN generation and verification algorithms that financial institutions and ATM manufacturers have used in the past.Research has been done on commonly used PINs. The result is that without forethought, a sizable portion of users may find their PIN vulnerable. \"Armed with only four possibilities, hackers can crack 20% of all PINs. Allow them no more than fifteen numbers, and they can tap the accounts of more than a quarter of card-holders.\"Breakable PINs can worsen with length, to wit:\n\n The problem with guessable PINs surprisingly worsens when customers are forced to use additional digits, moving from about a 25% probability with fifteen numbers to more than 30% (not counting 7-digits with all those phone numbers). In fact, about half of all 9-digit PINs can be reduced to two dozen possibilities, largely because more than 35% of all people use the all too tempting 123456789. As for the remaining 64%, there's a good chance they're using their Social Security Number, which makes them vulnerable. (Social Security Numbers contain their own well-known patterns.)\n\n\n*** Implementation flaws ***\nIn 2002, two PhD students at Cambridge University, Piotr Zieli\u0144ski and Mike Bond, discovered a security flaw in the PIN generation system of the IBM 3624, which was duplicated in most later hardware. Known as the decimalization table attack, the flaw would allow someone who has access to a bank's computer system to determine the PIN for an ATM card in an average of 15 guesses.\n\n== Reverse PIN hoax ==\n\nRumours have been in e-mail and Internet circulation claiming that in the event of entering a PIN into an ATM backwards,  law enforcement will be instantly alerted as well as money being ordinarily issued as if the PIN had been entered correctly. The intention of this scheme would be to protect victims of muggings; however, despite the system being proposed for use in some US states, there are no ATMs currently in existence that employ this software.\n\n== Mobile phone passcodes ==\nA mobile phone may be PIN protected. If enabled, the PIN (also called a passcode) for GSM mobile phones can be between four and eight digits  and is recorded in the SIM card. If such a PIN is entered incorrectly three times, the SIM card is blocked until a personal unblocking code (PUC or PUK), provided by the service operator, is entered. If the PUC is entered incorrectly ten times, the SIM card is permanently blocked, requiring a new SIM card from the mobile carrier service.\nPINs are also commonly used in smartphones, as a form of personal authentication, so that only those who know the PIN will be able to unlock the device. After a number of failed attempts of entering the correct PIN, the user may be blocked from trying again for an allocated amount of time, all of the data stored on the device may be deleted, or the user may be asked to enter alternate information that only the owner is expected to know to authenticate. Whether any of the formerly mentioned phenomena occur after failed attempts of entering the PIN depends largely upon the device and the owner's chosen preferences in its settings.\n\nAnswer these questions based on the above context: How does a PIN authenticate a user in a financial transaction system?Q: What is the recommended maximum length of a financial services PIN, according to ISO 9564-1?Q: How does the IBM 3624 method generate a natural PIN?Q: How does the IBM 3624 + offset method allow user-selectable PINs?Q: How does the VISA method generate a PIN verification value (PVV)?Q: How does the PIN validation process differ between the IBM method and the VISA method?Q: What is the average number of guesses required to determine the PIN for an ATM card using the decimalization table attack?Q: What happens when a mobile phone PIN is entered incorrectly three times?Q: How many times can a mobile phone PUC be entered incorrectly before the SIM card is permanently blocked?Q: What measures can be taken to protect a device after multiple failed attempts at entering the correct PIN on a smartphone?Q: How does the PIN verification process work in a financial transaction system?Q: How are PINs generated for financial transactions according to ISO 9564-1?Q: How does the IBM 3624 method store PINs for cardholders?Q: How does the VISA method differ from the IBM method in generating a PIN for financial transactions?Q: How does the IBM 3624 + offset method differ from the IBM 3624 method in generating a PIN for financial transactions?",

Allow them no more than fifteen numbers, and they can tap the accounts of more than a quarter of card-holders.\"Breakable PINs can worsen with length, to wit:\n\n The problem with guessable PINs surprisingly worsens when customers are forced to use additional digits, moving from about a 25% probability with fifteen numbers to more than 30% (not counting 7-digits with all those phone numbers). In fact, about half of all 9-digit PINs can be reduced to two dozen possibilities, largely because more than 35% of all people use the all too tempting 123456789. As for the remaining 64%, there's a good chance they're using their Social Security Number, which makes them vulnerable. (Social Security Numbers contain their own well-known patterns.)\n\n\n*** Implementation flaws ***\nIn 2002, two PhD students at Cambridge University, Piotr Zieli\u0144ski and Mike Bond, discovered a security flaw in the PIN generation system of the IBM 3624, which was duplicated in most later hardware. Known as the decimalization table attack, the flaw would allow someone who has access to a bank's computer system to determine the PIN for an ATM card in an average of 15 guesses.\n\n== Reverse PIN hoax ==\n\nRumours have been in e-mail and Internet circulation claiming that in the event of entering a PIN into an ATM backwards,  law enforcement will be instantly alerted as well as money being ordinarily issued as if the PIN had been entered correctly. The intention of this scheme would be to protect victims of muggings; however, despite the system being proposed for use in some US states, there are no ATMs currently in existence that employ this software.\n\n== Mobile phone passcodes ==\nA mobile phone may be PIN protected. If enabled, the PIN (also called a passcode) for GSM mobile phones can be between four and eight digits  and is recorded in the SIM card. If such a PIN is entered incorrectly three times, the SIM card is blocked until a personal unblocking code (PUC or PUK), provided by the service operator, is entered. If the PUC is entered incorrectly ten times, the SIM card is permanently blocked, requiring a new SIM card from the mobile carrier service.\nPINs are also commonly used in smartphones, as a form of personal authentication, so that only those who know the PIN will be able to unlock the device. After a number of failed attempts of entering the correct PIN, the user may be blocked from trying again for an allocated amount of time, all of the data stored on the device may be deleted, or the user may be asked to enter alternate information that only the owner is expected to know to authenticate. Whether any of the formerly mentioned phenomena occur after failed attempts of entering the PIN depends largely upon the device and the owner's chosen preferences in its settings.",

      "answers": "A PIN is used in conjunction with a user identifier to authenticate a user in a financial transaction system. The user provides both the user identifier and the PIN, and the system looks up the PIN based upon the user identifier and compares it with the received PIN. The user is granted access only when the entered PIN matches the stored PIN in the system.A: According to ISO 9564-1, the recommended maximum length of a financial services PIN is six digits.A: The IBM 3624 method generates a natural PIN by encrypting the primary account number (PAN) using a specific encryption key, known as the PIN generation key (PGK). This PIN is directly related to the PAN, and to validate the PIN, the issuing bank regenerates the PIN using the above method and compares it with the entered PIN.A: The IBM 3624 + offset method allows user-selectable PINs by storing a PIN offset value. The offset is found by subtracting the natural PIN from the customer-selected PIN using modulo 10. The offset can be stored either on the card track data or in a database at the card issuer. To validate the PIN, the issuing bank calculates the natural PIN, adds the offset, and compares this value to the entered PIN.A: The VISA method generates a PIN verification value (PVV) by taking the rightmost eleven digits of the PAN, excluding the checksum value, a PIN validation key index (PVKI), and the required PIN value to make a 64-bit number. The PVKI selects a validation key (PVK) to encrypt this number, and from the encrypted value, the PVV is found.A: The IBM method derives a PIN, while the VISA method generates a PVV value to confirm the entered PIN. The VISA method doesn't derive a PIN; instead, it confirms that the entered PIN matches the PIN used to generate the reference PVV.A: The decimalization table attack allows an attacker to determine the PIN for an ATM card in an average of 15 guesses.A: If a mobile phone PIN is entered incorrectly three times, the SIM card is blocked until a personal unblocking code (PUC or PUK), provided by the service operator, is entered.A: The SIM card is permanently blocked after the PUC is entered incorrectly ten times.A: After multiple failed attempts at entering the correct PIN on a smartphone, the user may be blocked from trying again for an allocated amount of time, all of the data stored on the device may be deleted, or the user may be asked to enter alternate information that only the owner is expected to know to authenticate.A: In a financial transaction system, the user provides a user identifier and a PIN. The system looks up the PIN based upon the user identifier and compares it with the received PIN. The user is granted access only when the entered PIN matches the stored PIN in the system.A: ISO 9564-1 allows for PINs from four up to twelve digits but recommends that for usability reasons, the card issuer not assign a PIN longer than six digits.A: The IBM 3624 method generates a natural PIN by encrypting the primary account number (PAN) and does not allow user-selectable PINs. If the card is reissued with a new PAN, a new PIN must be generated.A: The VISA method generates a PIN verification value (PVV) to confirm the entered PIN, while the IBM method derives a PIN directly related to the PAN. The VISA method can use randomly generated, user-selected, or even derived PINs, unlike the IBM method which derives a PIN.A: The IBM 3624 + offset method allows user-selectable PINs by storing a PIN offset value, while the IBM 3624 method generates a natural PIN and doesn't allow user-selectable PINs. The offset method stores the offset value either on the card track data or in a database at the card issuer."

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\n2022 Ukraine cyberattacks\n\n==Introduction==\nDuring the prelude to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, multiple cyberattacks against Ukraine were recorded, as well as some attacks on Russia. The first major cyberattack took place on 14 January 2022, and took down more than a dozen of Ukraine's government websites. According to Ukrainian officials, around 70 government websites, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the Security and Defense Council, were attacked. Most of the sites were restored within hours of the attack. On 15 February, another cyberattack took down multiple government and bank services.On 24 February, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Western intelligence officials believed that this would be accompanied by a major cyberattack against Ukrainian infrastructure, but this threat did not materialize. Cyberattacks on Ukraine have continued during the invasion, but with limited success. Independent hacker groups, such as Anonymous, have launched cyberattacks on Russia in retaliation for the invasion.The Canadian government in an undated white paper published after 22 June 2022 believed \"that the scope and severity of cyber operations related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine has almost certainly been more sophisticated and widespread than has been reported in open sources.\"\n\n== Background ==\n\nAt the time of the attack, tensions between Russia and Ukraine were high, with over 100,000 Russian troops stationed near the border with Ukraine and talks between Russia and NATO ongoing. The US government alleged that Russia was preparing for an invasion of Ukraine, including \"sabotage activities and information operations\". The US also allegedly found evidence of \"a false-flag operation\" in Eastern Ukraine, which could be used as a pretext for invasion. Russia denies the accusations of an impending invasion, but has threatened \"military-technical action\" if its demands are not met, especially a request that NATO never admit Ukraine to the alliance. Russia has spoken strongly against the expansion of NATO to its borders.\n\n== January attacks ==\nThe attacks on 14 January 2022 consisted of the hackers replacing the websites with text in Ukrainian, erroneous Polish, and Russian, which state \"be afraid and wait for the worst\" and allege that personal information has been leaked to the internet. About 70 government websites were affected, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the Security and Defense Council. The SBU has stated that no data was leaked. Soon after the message appeared, the sites were taken offline. The sites were mostly restored within a few hours. Deputy secretary of the NSDC Serhiy Demedyuk, stated that the Ukrainian investigation of the attack suspects that a third-party company's administration rights were used to carry out the attack. The unnamed company's software had been used since 2016 to develop government sites, most of which were affected in the attack. Demedyuk also blamed UNC1151, a hacker group allegedly linked to Belarusian intelligence, for the attack.A separate destructive malware attack took place around the same time, first appearing on 13 January. First detected by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), malware was installed on devices belonging to \"multiple government, non-profit, and information technology organizations\" in Ukraine. Later, this was reported to include the State Emergency Service and the Motor Transport Insurance Bureau. The software, designated DEV-0586 or WhisperGate, was designed to look like ransomware, but lacks a recovery feature, indicating an intent to simply destroy files instead of encrypting them for ransom. The MSTIC reported that the malware was programmed to execute when the targeted device was powered down. The malware would overwrite the master boot record (MBR) with a generic ransom note. Next, the malware downloads a second .exe file, which would overwrite all files with certain extensions from a predetermined list, deleting all data contained in the targeted files. The ransomware payload differs from a standard ransomware attack in several ways, indicating a solely destructive intent. However, later assessments indicate that damage was limited, likely a deliberate choice by the attackers.On 19 January, the Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) Gamaredon (also known as Primitive Bear) attempted to compromise a Western government entity in Ukraine. Cyber espionage appears to be the main goal of the group, which has been active since 2013; unlike most APTs, Gamaredon broadly targets all users all over the globe (in addition to also focusing on certain victims, especially Ukrainian organizations) and appears to provide services for other APTs. For example, the InvisiMole threat group has attacked select systems that Gamaredon had earlier compromised and fingerprinted.\n\n\n*** Reactions to January attack ***\n\n\n**** Russia ****\nRussia denied allegations by Ukraine that it was linked to the cyberattacks.\n\n\n**** Ukraine ****\nUkrainian government institutions, such as the Center for Strategic Communications and Information Security and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, suggested that the Russian Federation was the perpetrator of the attack, noting that this would not be the first time that Russia attacked Ukraine.\n\n\n**** International organizations ****\nEuropean Union High Representative Josep Borrell said of the source of the attack: \u201cOne can very well imagine with a certain probability or with a margin of error, where it can come from.\u201d The Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg announced that the organization would increase its coordination with Ukraine on cyberdefense in the face of potential additional cyberattacks. NATO later announced that it would sign an agreement granting Ukraine access to its malware information sharing platform.\n\n== February attacks ==\n\n\n*** DDoS attack ***\nOn 15 February, a large DDoS attack brought down the websites of the defense ministry, army, and Ukraine's two largest banks, PrivatBank and Oschadbank. Cybersecurity monitor NetBlocks reported that the attack intensified over the course of the day, also affecting the mobile apps and ATMs of the banks. The New York Times described it as \"the largest assault of its kind in the country's history\". Ukrainian government officials stated that the attack was likely carried out by a foreign government, and suggested that Russia was behind it. Although there were fears that the denial-of-service attack could be cover for more serious attacks, a Ukrainian official said that no such attack had been discovered.According to UK government and National Security Council of the US, the attack was performed by Russian Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU). American cybersecurity official Anne Neuberger stated that known GRU infrastructure has been noted transmitting high volumes of communications to Ukraine-based IP addresses and domains. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied that the attack originated from Russia.On 23 February, a third DDoS attack took down multiple Ukrainian government, military, and bank websites. Although military and banking websites were described as having \u201ca more rapid recovery\u201d, the SBU website was offline for an extended period.\n\n\n*** Wiper malware attack ***\nJust before 5 pm on 23 February, data wiper malware was detected on hundreds of computers belonging to multiple Ukrainian organizations, including in the financial, defense, aviation, and IT services sectors. ESET Research dubbed the malware HermeticWiper, named for its genuine code signing certificate from Cyprus-based company Hermetica Digital Ltd. The wiper was reportedly compiled on 28 December 2021, while Symantec reported malicious activity as early as November 2021, implying that the attack was planned months ahead of time. Symantec also reported wiper attacks against devices in Lithuania, and that some organizations were compromised months before the wiper attack. Similar to the January WhisperGate attack, ransomware is often deployed simultaneously with the wiper as a decoy, and the wiper damages the master boot record of the device.A day prior to the attack, the EU had deployed a cyber rapid-response team consisting of about ten cybersecurity experts from Lithuania, Croatia, Poland, Estonia, Romania, and the Netherlands. It is unknown if this team helped mitigate the effects of the cyberattack.The attack coincided with the Russian recognition of separatist regions in eastern Ukraine and the authorization of Russian troop deployments there. The US and UK blamed the attack on Russia. Russia denied the accusations and called them \u201cRussophobic\u201d.\n\n\n*** Viasat hack ***\nThe Viasat hack, which occurred between 5am and 9am EEST on 24 February, might have been intended to disrupt Ukrainian military networks, which used Viasat\u2019s network to provide them communications services. The attack might have intended to hit \"aspects of military command and control in Ukraine\". The attack \"rendered inoperable thousands of Viasat KA-SAT satellite broadband modems in Ukraine, including those used by military and other governmental agencies, causing major loss in internet communication.\"In a jointly-timed communication on 10 May 2022, many western governments adduced evidence that Russia was responsible for the attack because of their invasion.\n\n\n*** Initial Ukrainian response ***\nOn February 26, the Minister of Digital Transformation of Ukraine Mykhailo Fedorov announced the creation of an IT army, which will include cyber specialists, copywriters, designers, marketers and targetologists. As a result, numerous Russian government websites and banks were attacked. Dozens of issues of Russian stars and officials have been made public, and Ukrainian songs have been broadcast on some television channels, including Prayer for Ukraine.\n\n== March attacks ==\n\nBeginning on 6 March, Russia began to significantly increase the frequency of its cyber-attacks against Ukrainian civilians.On 9 March alone, the Quad9 malware-blocking recursive resolver intercepted and mitigated 4.6 million attacks against computers and phones in Ukraine and Poland, at a rate more than ten times higher than the European average. Cybersecurity expert Bill Woodcock of Packet Clearing House noted that the blocked DNS queries coming from Ukraine clearly show an increase in phishing and malware attacks against Ukrainians, and noted that the Polish numbers were also higher than usual because 70%, or 1.4 million, of the Ukrainian refugees were in Poland at the time. Explaining the nature of the attack, Woodcock said \"Ukrainians are being targeted by a huge amount of phishing, and a lot of the malware that is getting onto their machines is trying to contact malicious command-and-control infrastructure.\"On March 28, RTComm.ru, a Russian Internet service provider, BGP hijacked Twitter's 104.244.42.0/24 IPv4 address block for a period of two hours fifteen minutes.\n\nWhat was the main goal of the Gamaredon hacker group during their attempt to compromise a Western government entity in Ukraine in January 2022?question: How did the attackers of the January 2022 cyberattacks on Ukraine gain access to the targeted systems?question: What was the main difference between the ransomware payload of the WhisperGate malware and a standard ransomware attack?question: Who was blamed by Ukrainian officials for the cyberattacks on 14 January 2022?question: What was the impact of the DDoS attack on 15 February 2022 on Ukrainian banks and defense ministry?question: Who was blamed by Ukrainian government officials for the DDoS attack on 15 February 2022?question: What was the impact of the wiper malware attack on 23 February 2022 on Ukrainian organizations?question: Who blamed Russia for the wiper malware attack on 23 February 2022?question: What was the impact of the Viasat hack on 24 February 2022 on Ukrainian military networks?question: Who was blamed by many western governments for the Viasat hack on 24 February 2022?question: What was the initial response of the Ukrainian government to the cyber-attacks in February 2022?question: How did the frequency of Russia's cyber-attacks against Ukrainian civilians change in March 2022?question: How many attacks were intercepted and mitigated by the Quad9 malware-blocking recursive resolver on 9 March 2022 against computers and phones in Ukraine and Poland?question: Who BGP hijacked Twitter's 104.244.42.0/24 IPv4 address block for a period of two hours fifteen minutes on March 28?question: What was the impact of the increase in phishing and malware attacks against Ukrainians in March 2022?",

    "instruction": "Read this text below and answer the questions Domain privacy\n\n==Introduction==\nDomain privacy (often called Whois privacy) is a service offered by a number of domain name registrars. A user buys privacy from the company, who in turn replaces the user's information in the WHOIS with the information of a forwarding service (for email and sometimes postal mail, it is done by a proxy server).\n\n\n\n== Level of anonymity ==\nRegistrars typically collect personal information to provide the service. Some registrars take little persuasion to release the so-called 'private' information to the world, requiring only a phone request or a cease and desist letter. Others, however, handle privacy with more precaution, using measures including hosting domain names offshore and accepting cryptocurrencies for payment so that the registrar has no knowledge of the domain name owner's personal information (which would otherwise be transmitted with credit card transactions). It is debatable whether or not this practice is at odds with the domain registration requirement of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).\n\n\n*** Privacy by default ***\nSome top-level domains have privacy caveats:\n\n.al: No information about the owner is disclosed.\n.at, .co.at, .or.at: Since May 21, 2010, contact data (defined as phone number, fax number, e-mail address) is hidden by the registrar and must be explicitly made public.\n.ca: Since June 10, 2008, the Canadian Internet Registration Authority no longer posts registration details of individuals associated with .ca domains.\n.ch and .li  : Since 1st January 2021 Whois information is private by default and can be obtained only in limited cases\n.de: Since May 25, 2018, the German Internet Registration Authority denic put extensive changes into force for the Whois Lookup Service. With a few exceptions, third parties can no longer access domain ownership data.\n.eu: If the registrant is a natural person, only the e-mail address is shown in the public whois records unless specified otherwise.\n.fi: Individual persons' data is not published (changed in 2019), but for companies, associations, etc., data is published.\n.fr: By default, individual domain name holders benefit from the restricted publishing of their personal data in the AFNIC public Whois.\n.gr: No information about the owner is disclosed.\n.is: May hide address and phone number.\n.nl: Since January 12, 2010, registrant postal addresses are no longer publicly available.\n.ovh: Contact data is hidden by the registrar and must be explicitly made public.\n.uk: Nominet, the guardian of UK domain namespace, provide domain privacy tools on their extensions (.co.uk, .me.uk etc.), providing that the registrant is not trading from the domain name. While the home address of the registrant can be hidden, the full name cannot.\n.ro: No information about the owner is disclosed.\n\n\n*** Privacy forbidden ***\n.br: As of April 2022, the domain registration contract requires the publication of name, email, country, and CPF number for all domains. Additionally, if the domain owned by a company, the company's phone number, address, and CNPJ number must also be public. Access to some of these details requires passing a CAPTCHA at [1].\n.us: In March 2005, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) said that owners of .us domains will not have the option of keeping their information private, and that it must be made public.\n.in: Registrants for Indian domain names may not use any proxy or privacy services provided by registrars.\n.it Italian domain names can not keep information private for law.\n.au Any Australian domain names ends with .au is forbidden from privacy due to the law. While most of the information are public, some of the information such as the street address, telephone and fax numbers of registrant is hidden.\n\n== Implications ==\nThe Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) broadly requires the mailing address, phone number, and e-mail address of those owning or administrating a domain name to be made publicly available through the \"WHOIS\" directories. However, that policy enables spammers, direct marketers, identity thieves, or other attackers to use the directory to acquire personal information about those people. Although ICANN has been working to change WHOIS to enable greater privacy, there is a lack of consensus among major stakeholders as to what type of change should be made. However, with the offer of private registration from many registrars, some of the risk has been mitigated.\n\n== Litigation ==\nWith the help of \"private registration,\" the service can be the legal owner of the domain. This has occasionally resulted in legal problems.  Ownership of a domain name is given by the organization name of the owner contact in the domain's WHOIS record.  There are typically four contact positions in a domain's WHOIS record: owner, administrator, billing, and technical.  Some registrars will not shield the owner organization name in order to protect the ownership of the domain name.There has been at least one lawsuit against Namecheap, Inc. for its role as owner/registrant; Namecheap lost its motion to dismiss. Silverstein v. Alivemax, et al. Los Angeles Superior Court Case Number BC480994 was dismissed in May of 2014. Silverstein is well known for his anti-spam and email privacy campaigns, most notably in the case of William Silverstein v Keynetics, Inc., No. 17-15176 (9th Cir. 2018), but this was decided for Keynetics in March 2018.Ownership of domains held by a privacy service was also an issue in the RegisterFly case, in which a registrar effectively ceased operations and then went bankrupt.  Customers encountered serious difficulties in regaining control of the domains involved. ICANN has since remedied that situation by requiring all accredited registrars to maintain their customers' contact data in escrow.  In the event a registrar loses its accreditation, gTLD domains, along with the escrowed contact data, will be transferred to another accredited registrar.\nWhat is domain privacy and who offers this service?Question: How does the level of anonymity differ between domain registrars?Question: Are there any top-level domains that have privacy caveats?Question: Are there any top-level domains where privacy is forbidden?Question: What are the implications of ICANN's policy on WHOIS directories?Question: How can private registration help in mitigating the risk of personal information being made publicly available?Question: Can ownership of a domain name held by a privacy service lead to legal problems?Question: What is the role of ICANN in maintaining the WHOIS directories?Question: How does the WHOIS directory enable spammers and other attackers?Question: What measures has ICANN taken to change WHOIS to enable greater privacy?Question: What is the impact of not having consensus among major stakeholders on changing WHOIS to enable greater privacy?Question: How does the WHOIS directory affect the privacy and security of domain owners?Question: How can privacy forbidden top-level domains impact the privacy and security of domain owners?Question: How can private registration help in protecting the ownership of the domain name?Question: How can litigation arise from ownership of a domain name held by a privacy service?",

It is represented by the Chinese National Cryptography Standard (Guomi), GM/T 0044-2016 SM9. The standard contains the following components:\n\n(GM/T 0044.1) The Identity-Based Asymmetric Cryptography Algorithm\n(GM/T 0044.2) The Identity-Based Digital Signature Algorithm which allows one entity to digitally sign a message which can be verified by another entity.\n(GM/T 0044.3) The Identity-Based Key Establishment and Key Wrapping\n(GM/T 0044.4) The Identity Based Public-Key Encryption Key Encapsulation Algorithm which allows one entity to securely send a symmetric key to another entity.\n\n== Identity Based Cryptography ==\nIdentity Based Cryptography is a type of public key cryptography that uses a widely known representation of an entity's Identity (name, email address, phone number etc.) as the entities public key.  This eliminates the need to have a separate public key bound by some mechanism (such as a digitally signed public key certificate) to the Identity of an entity.  In Identity Based Cryptography (IBC)  the public key is often taken as the concatenation of an entity's Identity and a validity period for the public key.\nIn Identity Based Cryptography, one or more trusted agent's use their private keys to compute an entity's private key from their public key (Identity and Validity Period).  The corresponding public keys of the trusted agent or agents are known to everyone using the network.  If only one trusted agent is used that trusted agent can compute all the private keys for users in the network.  To avoid that state, some researchers propose using multiple trusted agents in such a way that more than one of them need to be compromised in order to compute individual public keys.\n\n== Chinese Cryptographic Standards ==\nThe SM9 Standard adopted in 2016 is one of a number of Chinese national cryptography standards.

    "instruction": "Promiscuous mode\n\n==Introduction==\nIn computer networking, promiscuous mode is a mode for a wired network interface controller (NIC) or wireless network interface controller (WNIC) that causes the controller to pass all traffic it receives to the central processing unit (CPU) rather than passing only the frames that the controller is specifically programmed to receive.  This mode is normally used for packet sniffing that takes place on a router or on a computer connected to a wired network or one being part of a wireless LAN. Interfaces are placed into promiscuous mode by software bridges often used with hardware virtualization.\nIn IEEE 802 networks such as Ethernet or IEEE 802.11, each frame includes a destination MAC address.  In non-promiscuous mode, when a NIC receives a frame, it drops it unless the frame is addressed to that NIC's MAC address or is a broadcast or multicast addressed frame.  In promiscuous mode, however, the NIC allows all frames through, thus allowing the computer to read frames intended for other machines or network devices.\nMany operating systems require superuser privileges to enable promiscuous mode. A non-routing node in promiscuous mode can generally only monitor traffic to and from other nodes within the same broadcast domain (for Ethernet and IEEE 802.11) or ring (for Token Ring).  Computers attached to the same Ethernet hub satisfy this requirement, which is why network switches are used to combat malicious use of promiscuous mode. A router may monitor all traffic that it routes.\nPromiscuous mode is often used to diagnose network connectivity issues. There are programs that make use of this feature to show the user all the data being transferred over the network. Some protocols like FTP and Telnet transfer data and passwords in clear text, without encryption, and network scanners can see this data. Therefore, computer users are encouraged to stay away from insecure protocols like telnet and use more secure ones such as SSH.\n\n== Detection ==\nAs promiscuous mode can be used in a malicious way to capture private data in transit on a network, computer security professionals might be interested in detecting network devices that are in promiscuous mode. In promiscuous mode, some software might send responses to frames even though they were addressed to another machine. However, experienced sniffers can prevent this (e.g., using carefully designed firewall settings). An example is sending a ping (ICMP echo request) with the wrong MAC address but the right IP address. If an adapter is operating in normal mode, it will drop this frame, and the IP stack never sees or responds to it. If the adapter is in promiscuous mode, the frame will be passed on, and the IP stack on the machine (to which a MAC address has no meaning) will respond as it would to any other ping. The sniffer can prevent this by configuring a firewall to block ICMP traffic.\n\n== Some applications that use promiscuous mode ==\nThe following applications and applications classes use promiscuous mode.\nWhat is promiscuous mode in the context of computer networking?Question: How does a NIC handle frames in non-promiscuous mode?Question: Why is promiscuous mode useful for packet sniffing?Question: What level of access is typically required to enable promiscuous mode?Question: In what type of network configuration can a non-routing node in promiscuous mode generally only monitor traffic to and from other nodes within the same broadcast domain or ring?Question: Why are network switches used to combat malicious use of promiscuous mode?Question: How can promiscuous mode be used to diagnose network connectivity issues?Question: Why are computer users encouraged to stay away from insecure protocols like telnet?Question: How can computer security professionals detect network devices that are in promiscuous mode?Question: What can a sniffer do to prevent its adapter from responding when it is in promiscuous mode and receives a ping with the wrong MAC address but the right IP address?Question: What is the purpose of software bridges used with hardware virtualization in placing interfaces into promiscuous mode?Question: Why does promiscuous mode allow a computer to read frames intended for other machines or network devices?Question: How does the IP stack on a machine respond when it receives a ping (ICMP echo request) with the wrong MAC address but the right IP address and the adapter is in promiscuous mode?Question: In what type of mode does a NIC drop any frame it receives that is not addressed to its MAC address, with the exception of broadcast or multicast frames?Question: How can promiscuous mode be used to monitor all traffic that a router routes?",

    "instruction": "Lorenz cipher\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Lorenz SZ40, SZ42a and SZ42b were German rotor stream cipher machines used by the German Army during World War II.  They were developed by C. Lorenz AG in Berlin. The model name SZ was derived from Schl\u00fcssel-Zusatz, meaning cipher attachment. The instruments implemented a Vernam stream cipher.\nBritish cryptanalysts, who referred to encrypted German teleprinter traffic as Fish, dubbed the machine and its traffic Tunny (meaning tunafish) and deduced its logical structure three years before they saw such a machine.The SZ machines were in-line attachments to standard teleprinters. An experimental link using SZ40 machines was started in June 1941. The enhanced SZ42 machines were brought into substantial use from mid-1942 onwards for high-level communications between the German High Command in W\u00fcnsdorf close to Berlin, and Army Commands throughout occupied Europe. The more advanced SZ42A came into routine use in February 1943 and the SZ42B in June 1944.Radioteletype (RTTY) rather than land-line circuits was used for this traffic. These non-Morse (NoMo) messages were picked up by Britain's Y-stations at Knockholt in Kent and Denmark Hill in south London, and sent to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park (BP). Some were deciphered using hand methods before the process was partially automated, first with Robinson machines and then with the Colossus computers. The deciphered Lorenz messages made one of the most significant contributions to British Ultra military intelligence and to Allied victory in Europe, due to the high-level strategic nature of the information that was gained from Lorenz decrypts.\n\n== Vernam cipher ==\n\nGilbert Vernam was an AT&T Bell Labs research engineer who, in 1917, invented a cipher system that used the Boolean \"exclusive or\" (XOR) function, symbolised by \u2295. This is represented by the following \"truth table\", where 1 represents \"true\" and 0 represents \"false\".\n\nOther names for this function are: Not equal (NEQ), modulo 2 addition (without 'carry') and modulo 2 subtraction (without 'borrow').\nVernam's cipher is a symmetric-key algorithm, i.e. the same key is used both to encipher plaintext to produce the ciphertext and to decipher ciphertext to yield the original plaintext:\n\nand:\n\nThis produces the essential reciprocity that allows the same machine with the same settings to be used for both encryption and decryption.\nVernam's idea was to use conventional telegraphy practice with a paper tape of the plaintext combined with a paper tape of the key. Each key tape would have been unique (a one-time tape), but generating and distributing such tapes presented considerable practical difficulties. In the 1920s four men in different countries invented rotor cipher machines to produce a key stream to act instead of a tape. The 1940 Lorenz SZ40/42 was one of these.\n\n== Key stream ==\nThe logical functioning of the Tunny system was worked out well before the Bletchley Park cryptanalysts saw one of the machines\u2014which only happened in 1945, as Germany was surrendering to the Allies.\n\nThe SZ machine served as an in-line attachment to a standard Lorenz teleprinter. It had a metal base 19 in \u00d7 15.5 in (48 cm \u00d7 39 cm) and was 17 in (43 cm) high.  The teleprinter characters consisted of five data bits (or \"impulses\"), encoded in the International Telegraphy Alphabet No. 2 (ITA2). The machine generated a stream of pseudorandom characters. These formed the key that was combined with the plaintext input characters to form the ciphertext output characters. The combination was by means of the XOR (or modulo 2 addition) process.The key stream consisted of two component parts that were XOR-ed together. These were generated by two sets of five wheels which rotated together. The Bletchley Park cryptanalyst Bill Tutte called these the \u03c7 (\"chi\") wheels, and the \u03c8 (\"psi\") wheels. Each wheel had a series of cams (or \"pins\") around their circumference. These cams could be set in a raised (active) or lowered (inactive) position. In the raised position they generated a '1' which reversed the value of a bit, in the lowered position they generated a '0' which left the bit unchanged. The number of cams on each wheel equalled the number of impulses needed to cause them to complete a full rotation. These numbers are all co-prime with each other, giving the longest possible time before the pattern repeated. This is the product of the number of positions of the wheels. For the set of \u03c7 wheels it was 41 \u00d7 31 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 26 \u00d7 23\n\n== Operation ==\n\nEach \"Tunny\" link had four SZ machines with a transmitting and a receiving teleprinter at each end. For enciphering and deciphering to work, the transmitting and receiving machines had to be set up identically. There were two components to this; setting the patterns of cams on the wheels and rotating the wheels for the start of enciphering a message. The cam settings were changed less frequently before summer 1944. The \u03c8 wheel cams were initially only changed quarterly, but later monthly, the \u03c7 wheels were changed monthly but the motor wheel patterns were changed daily. From 1 August 1944, all wheel patterns were changed daily.Initially the wheel settings for a message were sent to the receiving end by means of a 12-letter indicator sent un-enciphered, the letters being associated with wheel positions in a book. In October 1942 this was changed to the use of a book of single-use settings in what was known as the QEP book. The last two digits of the QEP book entry were sent for the receiving operator to look up in his copy of the QEP book and set his machine's wheels. Each book contained one hundred or more combinations. Once all the combinations in a QEP book had been used it was replaced by a new one. The message settings should never have been re-used, but on occasion they were, providing a \"depth\", which could be utilised by a cryptanalyst.As was normal telegraphy practice, messages of any length were keyed into a teleprinter with a paper tape perforator. The typical sequence of operations would be that the sending operator would punch up the message, make contact with the receiving operator, use the EIN / AUS switch on the SZ machine to connect it into the circuit, and then run the tape through the reader. At the receiving end, the operator would similarly connect his SZ machine into the circuit and the output would be printed up on a continuous sticky tape. Because this was the practice, the plaintext did not contain the characters for \"carriage return\", \"line feed\" or the null (blank tape, 00000) character.\n\n== Cryptanalysis ==\n\nBritish cryptographers at Bletchley Park had deduced the operation of the machine by January 1942 without ever having seen a Lorenz machine, a feat made possible by a mistake made by a German operator.\n\n\n*** Interception ***\nTunny traffic was known by Y Station operators used to listening to Morse code transmission as \"new music\". Its interception was originally concentrated at the Foreign Office Y Station operated by the Metropolitan Police at Denmark Hill in Camberwell, London. But due to lack of resources at this time (around 1941), it was given a low priority. A new Y Station, Knockholt in Kent, was later constructed specifically to intercept Tunny traffic so that the messages could be efficiently recorded and sent to Bletchley Park. The head of Y station, Harold Kenworthy, moved to head up Knockholt. He was later promoted to head the Foreign Office Research and Development Establishment (F.O.R.D.E).\n\n\n*** Code breaking ***\nOn 30 August 1941, a message of some 4,000 characters was transmitted from Athens to Vienna. However, the message was not received correctly at the other end. The receiving operator then sent an uncoded request back to the sender asking for the message to be retransmitted. This let the codebreakers know what was happening.\nThe sender then retransmitted the message but, critically, did not change the key settings from the original \"HQIBPEXEZMUG\".  This was a forbidden practice; using a different key for every different message is critical to any stream cipher's security.  This would not have mattered had the two messages been identical, however the second time the operator made a number of small alterations to the message, such as using abbreviations, making the second message somewhat shorter.\nFrom these two related ciphertexts, known to cryptanalysts as a depth, the veteran cryptanalyst Brigadier John Tiltman in the Research Section teased out the two plaintexts and hence the keystream. But even almost 4,000 characters of key was not enough for the team to figure out how the stream was being generated; it was just too complex and seemingly random.\nAfter three months, the Research Section handed the task to mathematician Bill Tutte. He applied a technique that he had been taught in his cryptographic training, of writing out the key by hand and looking for repetitions. Tutte did this with the original teleprinter 5-bit Baudot codes, which led him to his initial breakthrough of recognising a 41-bit repetition. Over the following two months up to January 1942, Tutte and colleagues worked out the complete logical structure of the cipher machine. This remarkable piece of reverse engineering was later described as \"one of the greatest intellectual feats of World War II\".After this cracking of Tunny, a special team of code breakers was set up under Ralph Tester, most initially transferred from Alan Turing's Hut 8. The team became known as the Testery. It performed the bulk of the subsequent work in breaking Tunny messages, but was aided by machines in the complementary section under Max Newman known as the Newmanry.\n\n\n*** Decryption machines ***\nSeveral complex machines were built by the British to aid the attack on Tunny. The first was the British Tunny. This machine was designed by Bletchley Park, based on the reverse engineering work done by Tiltman's team in the Testery, to emulate the Lorenz Cipher Machine. When the pin wheel settings were found by the Testery, the Tunny machine was set up and run so that the messages could be printed.\nA family of machines known as \"Robinsons\" were built for the Newmanry. These used two paper tapes, along with logic circuitry, to find the settings of the \u03c7 pin wheels of the Lorenz machine. The Robinsons had major problems keeping the two paper tapes synchronized and were relatively slow, reading only 2,000 characters per second.\n\nThe most important machine was the Colossus of which ten were in use by the war's end, the first becoming operational in December 1943. Although not fully programmable, they were far more efficient than their predecessors, representing advances in electronic digital computers. The Colossus computers were developed and built by Tommy Flowers, of the Dollis Hill Post Office Research Station, using algorithms developed by Bill Tutte and his team of mathematicians. Colossus proved to be efficient and quick against the twelve-rotor Lorenz SZ42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine.\nSome influential figures had doubts about his proposed design for the decryption machine, and Flowers  proceeded with the project while partly funding it himself. Like the later ENIAC of 1946, Colossus did not have a stored program, and was programmed through plugboards and jumper cables. It was faster, more reliable and more capable than the Robinsons, so speeding up the process of finding the Lorenz \u03c7 pin wheel settings. Since Colossus generated the putative keys electronically, it only had to read one tape. It did so with an optical reader which, at 5,000 characters per second, was driven much faster than the Robinsons' and meant that the tape travelled at almost 30 miles per hour (48 km/h). This, and the clocking of the electronics from the optically read paper tape sprocket holes, completely eliminated the Robinsons' synchronisation problems. Bletchley Park management, which had been sceptical of Flowers's ability to make a workable device, immediately began pressuring him to construct another. After the end of the war, Colossus machines were dismantled on the orders of Winston Churchill, but GCHQ retained two of them.\n\n\n*** Testery executives and Tunny codebreakers ***\nRalph Tester: linguist and head of Testery\nJerry Roberts: shift-leader, linguist and senior codebreaker\nPeter Ericsson: shift-leader, linguist and senior codebreaker\nVictor Masters: shift-leader\nDenis Oswald: linguist and senior codebreaker\nPeter Hilton: codebreaker and mathematician\nPeter Benenson: codebreaker\nPeter Edgerley: codebreaker\nJohn Christie: codebreaker\nJohn Thompson: codebreaker\nRoy Jenkins: codebreaker\nShaun Wylie: codebreaker\nTom Colvill: general managerBy the end of the war, the Testery had grown to nine cryptographers and 24 ATS girls (as the women serving that role were then called), with a total staff of 118, organised in three shifts working round the clock.\n\n== Surviving machines ==\n\nLorenz cipher machines were built in small numbers; today only a handful survive in museums.\nIn Germany, examples may be seen at the Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum, a computer museum in Paderborn, and the Deutsches Museum, a museum of science and technology in Munich.

      "context": "Lorenz cipher\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Lorenz SZ40, SZ42a and SZ42b were German rotor stream cipher machines used by the German Army during World War II.  They were developed by C. Lorenz AG in Berlin. The model name SZ was derived from Schl\u00fcssel-Zusatz, meaning cipher attachment. The instruments implemented a Vernam stream cipher.\nBritish cryptanalysts, who referred to encrypted German teleprinter traffic as Fish, dubbed the machine and its traffic Tunny (meaning tunafish) and deduced its logical structure three years before they saw such a machine.The SZ machines were in-line attachments to standard teleprinters. An experimental link using SZ40 machines was started in June 1941. The enhanced SZ42 machines were brought into substantial use from mid-1942 onwards for high-level communications between the German High Command in W\u00fcnsdorf close to Berlin, and Army Commands throughout occupied Europe. The more advanced SZ42A came into routine use in February 1943 and the SZ42B in June 1944.Radioteletype (RTTY) rather than land-line circuits was used for this traffic. These non-Morse (NoMo) messages were picked up by Britain's Y-stations at Knockholt in Kent and Denmark Hill in south London, and sent to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park (BP). Some were deciphered using hand methods before the process was partially automated, first with Robinson machines and then with the Colossus computers. The deciphered Lorenz messages made one of the most significant contributions to British Ultra military intelligence and to Allied victory in Europe, due to the high-level strategic nature of the information that was gained from Lorenz decrypts.\n\n== Vernam cipher ==\n\nGilbert Vernam was an AT&T Bell Labs research engineer who, in 1917, invented a cipher system that used the Boolean \"exclusive or\" (XOR) function, symbolised by \u2295. This is represented by the following \"truth table\", where 1 represents \"true\" and 0 represents \"false\".\n\nOther names for this function are: Not equal (NEQ), modulo 2 addition (without 'carry') and modulo 2 subtraction (without 'borrow').\nVernam's cipher is a symmetric-key algorithm, i.e. the same key is used both to encipher plaintext to produce the ciphertext and to decipher ciphertext to yield the original plaintext:\n\nand:\n\nThis produces the essential reciprocity that allows the same machine with the same settings to be used for both encryption and decryption.\nVernam's idea was to use conventional telegraphy practice with a paper tape of the plaintext combined with a paper tape of the key. Each key tape would have been unique (a one-time tape), but generating and distributing such tapes presented considerable practical difficulties. In the 1920s four men in different countries invented rotor cipher machines to produce a key stream to act instead of a tape. The 1940 Lorenz SZ40/42 was one of these.\n\n== Key stream ==\nThe logical functioning of the Tunny system was worked out well before the Bletchley Park cryptanalysts saw one of the machines\u2014which only happened in 1945, as Germany was surrendering to the Allies.\n\nThe SZ machine served as an in-line attachment to a standard Lorenz teleprinter.

      "answers": "The Vernam cipher, invented by Gilbert Vernam in 1917, used a one-time tape for generating a key stream. However, creating and distributing such tapes was impractical. In the 1920s, four inventors in different countries developed rotor cipher machines to produce a key stream instead of a tape. The Lorenz SZ40/42 was one such rotor cipher machine, introduced in the 1940s.a: The two component parts of the key stream generated by the Tunny system were produced by two sets of five wheels, known as the \u03c7 (\"chi\") wheels and the \u03c8 (\"psi\") wheels. Each wheel had cams that could be set in a raised or lowered position to generate a '1' or a '0', respectively. The key stream was formed by XOR-ing these two components together.a: The wheel patterns in the Tunny system were changed daily from 1 August 1944. Before that, the \u03c8 wheel cams were changed monthly, the \u03c7 wheels were changed monthly, and the motor wheel patterns were changed daily. Changing all wheel patterns daily increased the security of the system and made it more difficult for the Allies to break the cipher.a: The error in retransmitting the message with the same key settings, despite making alterations to the second message, provided British cryptographers with a \"depth\" \u2013 two related ciphertexts. This allowed them to tease out the two plaintexts and the keystream, but figuring out how the stream was being generated remained challenging due to its complexity.a: The British Tunny machine was a device designed by Bletchley Park to emulate the Lorenz Cipher Machine. Once the pin wheel settings were found by the Testery, the Tunny machine was set up and run so that the messages could be printed, aiding the attack on the Tunny cipher.a: The Robinsons machines had major problems keeping the two paper tapes synchronized and were relatively slow, reading only 2,000 characters per second. In contrast, the Colossus computers were far more efficient, representing advances in electronic digital computers. They were not fully programmable but were faster, more reliable, and more capable than the Robinsons. Colossus could read one tape at 5,000 characters per second, eliminating the synchronization problems of the Robinsons.a: The Testery, led by Ralph Tester, was a special team of codebreakers that performed the bulk of the work in breaking Tunny messages, while the Newmanry, under Max Newman, provided complementary assistance. The Testery initially consisted of nine cryptographers and 24 ATS girls, with a total staff of 118, organized in three shifts working round the clock.a: Tommy Flowers, of the Dollis Hill Post Office Research Station, developed and built the Colossus computers using algorithms developed by Bill Tutte and his team of mathematicians. The Colossus computers were efficient and quick against the twelve-rotor Lorenz SZ42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine. They proved to be faster, more reliable, and more capable than the Robinsons, significantly speeding up the process of finding the Lorenz \u03c7 pin wheel settings.a: Lorenz cipher machines were used by the German Army during World War II for high-level communications between the German High Command and Army Commands throughout occupied Europe. They were secured by using a Vernam stream cipher and generating a stream of pseudorandom characters as the key. This made the cipher resistant to cryptanalysis, as the key stream was seemingly random and complex.a: Initially, key settings were transmitted to the receiving end by means of a 12-letter indicator sent un-enciphered, later changed to the use of a book of single-use settings in the QEP book. The last two digits of the QEP book entry were sent for the receiving operator to look up in his copy of the QEP book and set his machine's wheels. However, message settings should never have been re-used, but on occasion, they were, providing a \"depth\" that could be utilized by a cryptanalyst.a: Tunny traffic differed from Morse code transmission in that it used radioteletype (RTTY) rather than land-line circuits. This traffic was picked up by Britain's Y-stations at Knockholt in Kent and Denmark Hill in south London. Interception was challenging due to the lack of resources and the fact that Tunny traffic was known as \"new music\" by Y Station operators, who were used to listening to Morse code transmission.a: Bill Tutte reverse engineered the Tunny cipher machine by writing out the key by hand and looking for repetitions. He recognized a 41-bit repetition, which led him to his initial breakthrough. Over the following two months up to January 1942, Tutte and colleagues worked out the complete logical structure of the cipher machine. This remarkable achievement was later described as \"one of the greatest intellectual feats of World War II.\"a: The Tunny machine served as an in-line attachment to a standard Lorenz teleprinter and generated a stream of pseudorandom characters. These characters formed the key that was combined with the plaintext input characters to form the ciphertext output characters. The combination was by means of the XOR (or modulo 2 addition) process. The machine's components, including the \u03c7 and \u03c8 wheels, played a crucial role in generating the key stream that ensured the security of the cipher.a: The deciphered Lorenz messages made one of the most significant contributions to British Ultra military intelligence and to Allied victory in Europe due to the high-level strategic nature of the information gained from Lorenz decrypts. This intelligence provided critical insights into German plans and operations, enabling the Allies to make informed decisions and gain a strategic advantage in the war.a: The main challenges in breaking the Tunny cipher included the complexity and seemingly random nature of the key stream. The Allies addressed these issues by using various techniques, such as recognizing repetitions in the key and working out the logical structure of the cipher machine. The development of complex machines like the British Tunny, Robinsons, and Colossus computers significantly aided the attack on the Tunny cipher, enabling the Allies to break the cipher and gain valuable intelligence."

    "instruction": "KRACK\n\n==Introduction==\nKRACK (\"Key Reinstallation Attack\") is a replay attack (a type of exploitable flaw) on the Wi-Fi Protected Access protocol that secures Wi-Fi connections. It was discovered in 2016 by the Belgian researchers Mathy Vanhoef and Frank Piessens of the University of Leuven. Vanhoef's research group published details of the attack in October 2017. By repeatedly resetting the nonce transmitted in the third step of the WPA2 handshake, an attacker can gradually match encrypted packets seen before and learn the full keychain used to encrypt the traffic.\nThe weakness is exhibited in the Wi-Fi standard itself, and not due to errors in the implementation of a sound standard by individual products or implementations. Therefore, any correct implementation of WPA2 is likely to be vulnerable. The vulnerability affects all major software platforms, including Microsoft Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux, OpenBSD and others.The widely used open-source implementation wpa_supplicant, utilized by Linux and Android, was especially susceptible as it can be manipulated to install an all-zeros encryption key, effectively nullifying WPA2 protection in a man-in-the-middle attack. Version 2.7 fixed this vulnerability.The security protocol protecting many Wi-Fi devices can essentially be bypassed, potentially allowing an attacker to intercept sent and received data.\n\n\n\n== Details ==\nThe attack targets the four-way handshake used to establish a nonce (a kind of \"shared secret\") in the WPA2 protocol. The standard for WPA2 anticipates occasional Wi-Fi disconnections, and allows reconnection using the same value for the third handshake (for quick reconnection and continuity). Because the standard does not require a different key to be used in this type of reconnection, which could be needed at any time, a replay attack is possible.\nAn attacker can repeatedly re-send the third handshake of another device's communication to manipulate or reset the WPA2 encryption key. Each reset causes data to be encrypted using the same values, so blocks with the same content can be seen and matched, working backwards to identify parts of the keychain which were used to encrypt that block of data. Repeated resets gradually expose more of the keychain until eventually the whole key is known, and the attacker can read the target's entire traffic on that connection.\nAccording to US-CERT:\n\n\"US-CERT has become aware of several key management vulnerabilities in the 4-way handshake of the Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) security protocol. The impact of exploiting these vulnerabilities includes decryption, packet replay, TCP connection hijacking, HTTP content injection, and others.

    "instruction": "Pepper (cryptography)\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, a pepper is a secret added to an input such as a password during hashing with a cryptographic hash function. This value differs from a salt in that it is not stored alongside a password hash, but rather the pepper is kept separate in some other medium, such as a Hardware Security Module.  Note that the National Institute of Standards and Technology never refers to this value as a pepper but rather as a secret salt.  A pepper is similar in concept to a salt or an encryption key.

    "instruction": "Context: Guided tour puzzle protocol\n\n==Introduction==\nGuided tour puzzle (GTP) protocol is a cryptographic protocol for mitigating application layer denial of service attacks. It aims to overcome the shortcoming of computation-based puzzle protocols, in which clients are required to compute hard CPU or memory-bound puzzles that favor clients with abundant computational resources. Guided tour puzzle protocol can be seen as a form of proof-of-work (POW) protocol.\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe protocol steps of the guided tour puzzle protocol is similar to that of client puzzle protocol. All clients are required to complete a guided tour puzzle prior to receiving service from the server, if the server suspects it is currently under denial of service attack or its load exceeds a pre-defined threshold. Simply put, a guided tour puzzle is a tour that needs to be completed by taking multiple round-trips to a set of special nodes, called tour guides, in a sequential order. It is called a guided tour, because the order in which the tour guides are visited is unknown to the client, and each tour guide has to direct the client towards the next tour guide for the client to complete the tour in correct order. A single tour guide may appear multiple times in a tour, so the term stop is used to denote a single appearance of a tour guide in a tour. A client knows which tour guide is at the next stop, only after completing its visit to the current stop.\nSolving a guided tour puzzle is essentially equal to completing a guided tour in the correct order. Starting from the first stop, the client contacts each stop and receives a reply. Each reply contains a unique token. The token in the reply message from the current stop is used for computing the address of the next stop tour guide. The address of the first stop tour guide is computed using the token contained in the server's first reply message that informs the client of the start of a puzzle process.The client must send the token received from the current stop tour guide to the next stop tour guide, which will use it as an input to its token calculation function. The token received from the last stop tour guide plus the token from the server's puzzle message are sent to the server as the proof of completion of a tour. The server can efficiently validate these two tokens, and grants service to the client only after proving their validity.\n\n== Protocol steps ==\n\nBefore the guided tour puzzle can start, \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n   tour guides has to be set up in the system, where \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        \u2265\n        2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N\\geq 2}\n  .

The advantage of using round-trip delays, as opposed to hard computational problems, is that the round trip delay of a small packet is determined mostly by the processing delays, queuing delays, and propagation delays at the intermediate routers, therefore is beyond the control of end hosts (clients).

The server can efficiently validate these tokens and grant service to the client upon proving their validity.a: The GTP protocol controls the difficulty of a guided tour puzzle by including the length of the tour (L) in the puzzle message. The server sets the value of L to control the number of tour guides that the client needs to visit in a guided tour, thus controlling the puzzle's difficulty.a: The GTP protocol prevents an attacker from overwhelming the server by enforcing round-trip delays on clients, which are beyond the control of end hosts. This approach ensures that clients' requests arrive at a rate that is sustainable by the server, regardless of the attacker's computational resources."

    "instruction": "Greynet\n\n==Introduction==\nWithin the context of corporate and organizational networks, a greynet (or Grayware) is an elusive networked computer application that is downloaded and installed on end user systems without express permission from network administrators and often without awareness or cognition that it is deeply embedded in the organization\u2019s network fabric.  These applications may be of some marginal use to the user, but inevitably consume system and network resources.  In addition, greynet applications often open the door for end use systems to become compromised by additional applications, security risks and malware.\n\n== Examples ==\nPublic instant messaging (AOL Instant Messenger, Windows Live Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger)\nWeb conferencing (webcam, VoIP telephony)\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing clients\nDistributed computing such as SETI@home\nAdware \"utilities\"\nCommercial spyware\nKeystroke logging\n\n== The dynamics of greynet growth ==\nAs computer workstations have become connected to the Internet, a variety of programs have proliferated that offer the ability to extend communications, gather and deliver information, and to serve the needs of marketing concerns.  Among the first to emerge were instant messaging clients such as ICQ, AOL Instant Messenger and MSN Messenger.  Developments in technology have added video capability through webcam units, all of which have worked together to take advantage of available bandwidth in single, small network, and corporate environments.\nThe growth of greynets takes advantage of software and hardware developments.  Informal networks are now appearing that provide a variety of streaming media and content that is supplied or modified by end users.  An emerging category is \"podcasting\", in which users generate content for widespread download on portable MP3 players.\n\n== Problems with greynet programs ==\nThe problem with greynet programs is fourfold. First, greynet programs create network security risks by causing broad vectors for malware dissemination. Second, they create privacy issues for the network by opening large holes for information leakage. Third, greynet programs create compliance issues for a computer network by creating an invisible parallel communications network.  Fourth, they create issues on local machines through the consumption of local system resources and possible operating system or program stability concerns.  All of these things increase network and IT administration time and costs.\nAdded to this in the corporate work environment is the loss of meaningful production time due to non-work related distractions through these greynet applications.  Individual network environment policies may vary from non-existent to a full lockdown of end user system privileges.

It allows individuals communicating over a network to prove their identity to each other while also preventing eavesdropping or replay attacks, and provides for detection of modification and the prevention of unauthorized reading. This can be proven using Degano.\nThe protocol was first described under the name \"The Wide-mouthed-frog Protocol\" in the paper \"A Logic of Authentication\" (1990), which introduced Burrows\u2013Abadi\u2013Needham logic, and in which it was an \"unpublished protocol ... proposed by\" coauthor Michael Burrows.

If an attacker gains access to S, they can decrypt all communication between A and B. Additionally, S must be highly trusted, as it has the ability to impersonate any user in the system.Answer: The Wide Mouth Frog protocol prevents eavesdropping and replay attacks by using timestamps (T<sub>A</sub> and T<sub>S</sub>) and symmetric keys (K<sub>AS</sub> and K<sub>BS</sub>) known only to the communicating parties. These measures ensure that only the intended parties can understand the communication and that replayed messages can be detected. However, a potential vulnerability remains in that an active attacker could still replay messages within the period when the timestamp is valid, potentially causing unintended consequences.Answer: The global clock requirement in the Wide Mouth Frog protocol ensures that the timestamps used in the communication are accurate and can be used to prevent replay attacks. If this requirement is not met, the protocol becomes vulnerable to replay attacks, as an attacker could intercept a valid message and replay it at a later time, potentially causing unintended consequences. Additionally, accurate time synchronization is required for the proper functioning of the protocol, and without a global clock, achieving this synchronization could be challenging.",

      "context": "Wide Mouth Frog protocol\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Wide-Mouth Frog protocol is a computer network authentication protocol designed for use on insecure networks (the Internet for example). It allows individuals communicating over a network to prove their identity to each other while also preventing eavesdropping or replay attacks, and provides for detection of modification and the prevention of unauthorized reading. This can be proven using Degano.\nThe protocol was first described under the name \"The Wide-mouthed-frog Protocol\" in the paper \"A Logic of Authentication\" (1990), which introduced Burrows\u2013Abadi\u2013Needham logic, and in which it was an \"unpublished protocol ... proposed by\" coauthor Michael Burrows.

    "instruction": "Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol\n\n==Introduction==\nSimple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) is described by the informational RFC 8894. Older versions of this protocol became a de facto industrial standard for pragmatic provisioning of digital certificates mostly for network equipment.\nThe protocol has been designed to make the request and issuing of digital certificates as simple as possible for any standard network user. These processes have usually required intensive input from network administrators, and so have not been suited to large-scale deployments.\n\n\n\n== Popularity ==\nThe Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol still is the most popular and widely available certificate enrollment protocol, being used by numerous manufacturers of network equipment and software who are developing simplified means of handling certificates for large-scale implementation to everyday users. It is used for example by the Cisco IOS operating system (even if Cisco is now pushing the slightly more featured EST) and iPhones to enroll in enterprises PKI. Most PKI software (specifically RA implementations) supports it, including the Network Device Enrollment Service (NDES) of Active Directory Certificate Service and Intune.\n\n== Criticism ==\nLegacy versions of SCEP, which still are employed in the vast majority of implementations, are limited to enrolling certificates for RSA keys only.\nDue to the use of the self-signed PKCS#10 format for Certificate Signing Requests (CSR), certificates can be enrolled only for keys that support signing. A limitation shared by other enrollment protocols based on PKCS#10 CSRs, e.g., EST and ACME, or even the web-based enrollment workflow of most PKI software where the requester starts by generating a key pair and a CSR in PKCS#10 format. The CRMF format, as used by CMP and CMS, is more flexible here, supporting also keys that are usable for encryption or key agreement only. However this distinction is mostly theoretical since in practice all algorithms commonly used with certificates support signing.  For example ACME, which also uses PKCS#10, issues TLS certificates which by definition must be capable of signing for the TLS handshake.\nAlthough proof-of-origin of certificate enrollment requests, i.e., authentication of the certificate requestor, is the most critical security requirement, for pragmatic reasons its support is not strictly required within SCEP. Signature-based client authentication using an already existing certificate would be the preferred mechanism but in many use cases is not possible or not supported by the given deployments. As an alternative, SCEP just provides the use of a shared secret, which should be client-specific and used only once.\nThe confidentiality of the shared secret optionally used for source authentication is fragile because it must be included in the 'challengePassword' field of the CSR, which is then protected by an outer encryption. It would have been more secure to use a password-based MAC algorithm such as HMAC.\nEncrypting the whole PKCS#10 structure in order to protect the 'challengePassword' field (which is used for self-contained source authentication) has a further drawback: the whole CSR becomes unreadable for all parties except the intended ultimate receiver (the CA), although most of its contents is not confidential. So the PKCS#10 structure cannot be checked by intermediate agents such as an RA.\n\nBased on the above text, answer the questions. What is the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) designed for?Q: Which key types are supported by legacy versions of SCEP for certificate enrollment?Q: Why are other enrollment protocols based on PKCS#10 CSRs, such as EST and ACME, limited to keys that support signing?Q: What is the primary security requirement for SCEP that is not strictly enforced?Q: What is the preferred mechanism for client authentication in SCEP?Q: How does SCEP provide source authentication when signature-based client authentication is not possible?Q: Why is the confidentiality of the shared secret used for source authentication in SCEP considered fragile?Q: What is the drawback of encrypting the whole PKCS#10 structure in SCEP to protect the 'challengePassword' field?Q: What is the primary limitation of the PKCS#10 format used by SCEP for Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs)?Q: Why is the use of a password-based MAC algorithm, such as HMAC, considered more secure than encrypting the whole PKCS#10 structure in SCEP to protect the 'challengePassword' field?Q: Which types of keys are supported by the CRMF format used by CMP and CMS for Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs)?Q: Why is the distinction between keys that support signing, encryption, and key agreement mostly theoretical in SCEP?Q: What is the primary purpose of the Network Device Enrollment Service (NDES) of Active Directory Certificate Service and Intune?Q: Why is the confidentiality of the shared secret used for source authentication in SCEP dependent on outer encryption?Q: Why can't intermediate agents, such as an RA, check the contents of the PKCS#10 structure in SCEP if the whole structure is encrypted to protect the 'challengePassword' field?",

The attack was published in 1999 by David Wagner, who used it to break the COCONUT98 cipher.\nThe boomerang attack has allowed new avenues of attack for many ciphers previously deemed safe from differential cryptanalysis.\nRefinements on the boomerang attack have been published: the amplified boomerang attack, and the rectangle attack.\nDue to the similarity of a Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction with a block cipher, this attack may also be applicable to certain hash functions such as MD5.\n\n\n\n== The attack ==\nThe boomerang attack is based on differential cryptanalysis. In differential cryptanalysis, an attacker exploits how differences in the input to a cipher (the plaintext) can affect the resultant difference at the output (the ciphertext). A high-probability \"differential\" (that is, an input difference that will produce a likely output difference) is needed that covers all, or nearly all, of the cipher. The boomerang attack allows differentials to be used which cover only part of the cipher.\nThe attack attempts to generate a so-called \"quartet\" structure at a point halfway through the cipher. For this purpose, say that the encryption action, E, of the cipher can be split into two consecutive stages, E0 and E1, so that E(M)\n\n== Application to specific ciphers ==\nOne attack on KASUMI, a block cipher used in 3GPP, is a related-key rectangle attack which breaks the full eight rounds of the cipher faster than exhaustive search (Biham et al., 2005).

The attack was published in 1999 by David Wagner, who used it to break the COCONUT98 cipher.\nThe boomerang attack has allowed new avenues of attack for many ciphers previously deemed safe from differential cryptanalysis.\nRefinements on the boomerang attack have been published: the amplified boomerang attack, and the rectangle attack.\nDue to the similarity of a Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction with a block cipher, this attack may also be applicable to certain hash functions such as MD5.\n\n\n\n== The attack ==\nThe boomerang attack is based on differential cryptanalysis. In differential cryptanalysis, an attacker exploits how differences in the input to a cipher (the plaintext) can affect the resultant difference at the output (the ciphertext). A high-probability \"differential\" (that is, an input difference that will produce a likely output difference) is needed that covers all, or nearly all, of the cipher. The boomerang attack allows differentials to be used which cover only part of the cipher.\nThe attack attempts to generate a so-called \"quartet\" structure at a point halfway through the cipher. For this purpose, say that the encryption action, E, of the cipher can be split into two consecutive stages, E0 and E1, so that E(M)\n\n== Application to specific ciphers ==\nOne attack on KASUMI, a block cipher used in 3GPP, is a related-key rectangle attack which breaks the full eight rounds of the cipher faster than exhaustive search (Biham et al., 2005).

    "instruction": "Mod ssl\n\n==Introduction==\nmod_ssl is an optional module for the Apache HTTP Server. It provides strong cryptography for the Apache v1.3 and v2 webserver via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) cryptographic protocols by the help of the Open Source SSL/TLS toolkit OpenSSL.\nThe original version created for Apache v1.3 was initially created in April 1998 by Ralf S. Engelschall via porting Ben Laurie's Apache-SSL 1.17 source patches for Apache 1.2.6 to Apache 1.3b6. This version is under a BSD-style license. The version for v2.0 and later, in contrast, is maintained by Apache Software Foundation and licensed under Apache License 2.0.\nIt is possible to provide HTTP and HTTPS with a single server machine, because HTTP and HTTPS use different server ports, so there is no direct conflict between them. It is either the maintainer who would run two separate Apache server instances (one binds to port 80, the other to port 443) or use Apache's virtual hosting facility where the maintainer can create two virtual servers which Apache dispatches: one responding to port 80 and speaking HTTP and one responding to port 443 speaking HTTPS.\n\n\n\n== Differences ==\nThe original mod_ssl in Apache 1.3 available at www.modssl.org is a third-party add-on package requiring additional steps in the compilation and configuration process.

It is intended to provide authentication of the communication partners, as well as data integrity and confidentiality.\nSMTPS is not a proprietary protocol and not an extension of SMTP.  It is a way to secure SMTP at the transport layer, by wrapping SMTP inside TLS.  Conceptually, it is similar to how HTTPS wraps HTTP inside TLS.\nThis means that the client and server speak normal SMTP at the application layer, but the connection is secured by SSL or TLS.  This happens when the TCP connection is established, before any mail data has been exchanged. Since whether or not to use SSL or TLS is not explicitly negotiated by the peers, services that speak SMTPS are usually reachable on a dedicated port of their own.\n\n== Difference between SMTPS and smtps ==\n\"smtps\" is also the name of an IANA-registered service, with the TCP port number 465. The service was intended for use by Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs), as a point of contact where these could exchange email in an encrypted form rather than in plaintext. The registration was quickly revoked, however, as standardization efforts resulted in an alternate approach. The registration has never been reinstated.\nWhen describing the IANA service registration, the official capitalization is \"smtps\". When describing the network protocol, the capitalization \"SMTPS\" is often used (similar to how HTTPS is capitalized).\nPort 587 is the well-known port for submitting mail to a server, frequently (but not required to be) encrypted using STARTTLS. Some email service providers allow their customers to use the SMTPS protocol to access a TLS-encrypted version of the \"submission\" service on port 465. This is a different service from what the original IANA registration dedicated the port to (for it used to be dedicated to encrypted content delivered as-is / in plain text, whereas nowadays' SMTPS on port 465 still uses plaintext content, only wrapped within TLS-encrypted transportation-basically the reverse mechanism).\nRFC 8314 corrected this problem (a special exception was made to assign TCP-465 to two use cases simultaneously) and integrate the use of port 465 as a TLS-encrypted \"submission\" port into the well-known port registrations published by IANA. The service name is \"submissions\".\nWhile there is no longer any officially registered endpoint for the SMTP service, it is still possible to exchange email over an encrypted transport with similar guarantees as those offered by smtps, in particular with the guarantee that either the exchange succeeds securely, or does not happen at all, by using DANE in combination with DNSSEC. \nMany email servers are configured to either not deliver email securely at all, or to first try secure delivery with the STARTTLS mechanism, and if that fails, for example, because the remote service does not offer it, or because a successful MITM-attack has stripped announcement of the feature, simply fall back to delivery by insecure means.\n\nAnswer these questions based on the above context: What is SMTPS and how does it secure SMTP?Question: How is the decision to use SSL or TLS in SMTPS made?Question: What is the purpose of the IANA-registered service \"smtps\" on TCP port number 465?Question: How does the SMTPS protocol differ from the IANA-registered service \"smtps\"?Question: What is the well-known port for submitting mail to a server?Question: Can SMTPS be used to access a TLS-encrypted version of the \"submission\" service on port 465?Question: What is the service name for the TLS-encrypted \"submission\" port on port 465?Question: Why is it possible to exchange email over an encrypted transport with similar guarantees as those offered by smtps, even though there is no longer any officially registered endpoint for the SMTP service?Question: What is the problem with using SMTPS on port 465 for encrypted content delivered as-is/in plain text?Question: How do many email servers handle secure delivery of email?Question: How does SMTPS provide authentication, data integrity, and confidentiality?Question: What is the difference between SMTPS and STARTTLS?Question: What is the purpose of the IANA registrations for network protocols and services?Question: What is the difference between SMTP and SMTPS?Question: What is the impact of using SMTPS on port 465 for encrypted content delivered as-is/in plain text on the security of email communications?",

The tool has been developed by Bruno Blanchet.\nSupport is provided for cryptographic primitives including: symmetric & asymmetric cryptography; digital signatures; hash functions; bit-commitment; and signature proofs of knowledge. The tool is capable of evaluating reachability properties, correspondence assertions and observational equivalence. These reasoning capabilities are particularly useful to the computer security domain since they permit the analysis of secrecy and authentication properties.

    "instruction": "Read this text below and answer the questions Buffer overflow protection\n\n==Introduction==\nBuffer overflow protection is any of various techniques used during software development to enhance the security of executable programs by detecting buffer overflows on stack-allocated variables, and preventing them from causing program misbehavior or from becoming serious security vulnerabilities.  A stack buffer overflow occurs when a program writes to a memory address on the program's call stack outside of the intended data structure, which is usually a fixed-length buffer.  Stack buffer overflow bugs are caused when a program writes more data to a buffer located on the stack than what is actually allocated for that buffer.  This almost always results in corruption of adjacent data on the stack, which could lead to program crashes, incorrect operation, or security issues.\nTypically, buffer overflow protection modifies the organization of stack-allocated data so it includes a canary value that, when destroyed by a stack buffer overflow, shows that a buffer preceding it in memory has been overflowed.  By verifying the canary value, execution of the affected program can be terminated, preventing it from misbehaving or from allowing an attacker to take control over it.  Other buffer overflow protection techniques include bounds checking, which checks accesses to each allocated block of memory so they cannot go beyond the actually allocated space, and tagging, which ensures that memory allocated for storing data cannot contain executable code.\nOverfilling a buffer allocated on the stack is more likely to influence program execution than overfilling a buffer on the heap because the stack contains the return addresses for all active function calls.  However, similar implementation-specific protections also exist against heap-based overflows.\nThere are several implementations of buffer overflow protection, including those for the GNU Compiler Collection, LLVM, Microsoft Visual Studio, and other compilers.\n\n== Overview ==\n\nA stack buffer overflow occurs when a program writes to a memory address on the program's call stack outside of the intended data structure, which is usually a fixed-length buffer.  Stack buffer overflow bugs are caused when a program writes more data to a buffer located on the stack than what is actually allocated for that buffer.  This almost always results in corruption of adjacent data on the stack, and in cases where the overflow was triggered by mistake, will often cause the program to crash or operate incorrectly.  Stack buffer overflow is a type of the more general programming malfunction known as buffer overflow (or buffer overrun).  Overfilling a buffer on the stack is more likely to derail program execution than overfilling a buffer on the heap because the stack contains the return addresses for all active function calls.Stack buffer overflow can be caused deliberately as part of an attack known as stack smashing.  If the affected program is running with special privileges, or if it accepts data from untrusted network hosts (for example, a public webserver), then the bug is a potential security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject executable code into the running program and take control of the process.  This is one of the oldest and more reliable methods for attackers to gain unauthorized access to a computer.Typically, buffer overflow protection modifies the organization of data in the stack frame of a function call to include a \"canary\" value that, when destroyed, shows that a buffer preceding it in memory has been overflowed.  This provides the benefit of preventing an entire class of attacks. According to some researchers, the performance impact of these techniques is negligible.\nStack-smashing protection is unable to protect against certain forms of attack. For example, it cannot protect against buffer overflows in the heap.  There is no sane way to alter the layout of data within a structure; structures are expected to be the same between modules, especially with shared libraries. Any data in a structure after a buffer is impossible to protect with canaries; thus, programmers must be very careful about how they organize their variables and use their structures.\n\n== Canaries ==\nCanaries or canary words are known values that are placed between a buffer and control data on the stack to monitor buffer overflows. When the buffer overflows, the first data to be corrupted will usually be the canary, and a failed verification of the canary data will therefore alert of an overflow, which can then be handled, for example, by invalidating the corrupted data.  A canary value should not be confused with a  sentinel value.\nThe terminology is a reference to the historic practice of using canaries in coal mines, since they would be affected by toxic gases earlier than the miners, thus providing a biological warning system.  Canaries are alternately known as cookies, which is meant to evoke the image of a \"broken cookie\" when the value is corrupted.\nThere are three types of canaries in use: terminator, random, and random XOR. Current versions of StackGuard support all three, while ProPolice supports terminator and random canaries.\n\n\n*** Terminator canaries ***\nTerminator canaries use the observation that most buffer overflow attacks are based on certain string operations which end at string terminators. The reaction to this observation is that the canaries are built of null terminators, CR, LF, and FF. As a result, the attacker must write a null character before writing the return address to avoid altering the canary. This prevents attacks using strcpy() and other methods that return upon copying a null character, while the undesirable result is that the canary is known. Even with the protection, an attacker could potentially overwrite the canary with its known value and control information with mismatched values, thus passing the canary check code, which is executed soon before the specific processor's return-from-call instruction.\n\n\n*** Random canaries ***\nRandom canaries are randomly generated, usually from an entropy-gathering daemon, in order to prevent an attacker from knowing their value. Usually, it is not logically possible or plausible to read the canary for exploiting; the canary is a secure value known only by those who need to know it\u2014the buffer overflow protection code in this case.\nNormally, a random canary is generated at program initialization, and stored in a global variable. This variable is usually padded by unmapped pages so that attempting to read it using any kinds of tricks that exploit bugs to read off RAM cause a segmentation fault, terminating the program. It may still be possible to read the canary if the attacker knows where it is or can get the program to read from the stack.\n\n\n*** Random XOR canaries ***\nRandom XOR canaries are random canaries that are XOR-scrambled using all or part of the control data. In this way, once the canary or the control data is clobbered, the canary value is wrong.\nRandom XOR canaries have the same vulnerabilities as random canaries, except that the \"read from stack\" method of getting the canary is a bit more complicated. The attacker must get the canary, the algorithm, and the control data in order to re-generate the original canary needed to spoof the protection.\nIn addition, random XOR canaries can protect against a certain type of attack involving overflowing a buffer in a structure into a pointer to change the pointer to point at a piece of control data. Because of the XOR encoding, the canary will be wrong if the control data or return value is changed. Because of the pointer, the control data or return value can be changed without overflowing over the canary.\nAlthough these canaries protect the control data from being altered by clobbered pointers, they do not protect any other data or the pointers themselves. Function pointers especially are a problem here, as they can be overflowed into and can execute shellcode when called.\n\n== Bounds checking ==\n\nBounds checking is a compiler-based technique that adds run-time bounds information for each allocated block of memory, and checks all pointers against those at run-time. For C and C++, bounds checking can be performed at pointer calculation time or at dereference time.Implementations of this approach use either a central repository, which describes each allocated block of memory, or fat pointers, which contain both the pointer and additional data, describing the region that they point to.\n\n== Tagging ==\nTagging is a compiler-based or hardware-based (requiring a tagged architecture) technique for tagging the type of a piece of data in memory, used mainly for type checking. By marking certain areas of memory as non-executable, it effectively prevents memory allocated to store data from containing executable code. Also, certain areas of memory can be marked as non-allocated, preventing buffer overflows.\nHistorically, tagging has been used for implementing high-level programming languages; with appropriate support from the operating system, tagging can also be used to detect buffer overflows.  An example is the NX bit hardware feature, supported by Intel, AMD and ARM processors.\n\n== Implementations ==\n\n\n*** GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) ***\nStack-smashing protection was first implemented by StackGuard in 1997, and published at the 1998 USENIX Security Symposium. StackGuard was introduced as a set of patches to the Intel x86 backend of GCC 2.7. StackGuard was maintained for the Immunix Linux distribution from 1998 to 2003, and was extended with implementations for terminator, random and random XOR canaries. StackGuard was suggested for inclusion in GCC 3.x at the GCC 2003 Summit Proceedings, but this was never achieved.\nFrom 2001 to 2005, IBM developed GCC patches for stack-smashing protection, known as ProPolice. It improved on the idea of StackGuard by placing buffers after local pointers and function arguments in the stack frame. This helped avoid the corruption of pointers, preventing access to arbitrary memory locations.\nRed Hat engineers identified problems with ProPolice though, and in 2005 re-implemented stack-smashing protection for inclusion in GCC 4.1. This work introduced the -fstack-protector flag, which protects only some vulnerable functions, and the -fstack-protector-all flag, which protects all functions whether they need it or not.In 2012, Google engineers implemented the -fstack-protector-strong flag to strike a better balance between security and performance. This flag protects more kinds of vulnerable functions than -fstack-protector does, but not every function, providing better performance than -fstack-protector-all. It is available in GCC since its version 4.9.All Fedora packages are compiled with -fstack-protector since Fedora Core 5, and -fstack-protector-strong since Fedora 20. Most packages in Ubuntu are compiled with -fstack-protector since 6.10. Every Arch Linux package is compiled with -fstack-protector since 2011. All Arch Linux packages built since 4 May 2014 use -fstack-protector-strong. Stack protection is only used for some packages in Debian, and only for the FreeBSD base system since 8.0. Stack protection is standard in certain operating systems, including OpenBSD, Hardened Gentoo and DragonFly BSD.\nStackGuard and ProPolice cannot protect against overflows in automatically allocated structures that overflow into function pointers. ProPolice at least will rearrange the allocation order to get such structures allocated before function pointers. A separate mechanism for pointer protection was proposed in PointGuard and is available on Microsoft Windows.\n\n\n*** Microsoft Visual Studio ***\nThe compiler suite from Microsoft implements buffer overflow protection since version 2003 through the /GS command-line switch, which is enabled by default since version 2005. Using /GS- disables the protection.\n\n\n*** IBM Compiler ***\nStack-smashing protection can be turned on by the compiler flag -qstackprotect.\n\n\n*** Clang/LLVM ***\nClang supports the same -fstack-protector options as GCC and a stronger \"safe stack\" (-fsanitize\n\n== A canary example ==\nNormal buffer allocation for x86 architectures and other similar architectures is shown in the buffer overflow entry. Here, we will show the modified process as it pertains to StackGuard.\nWhen a function is called, a stack frame is created. A stack frame is built from the end of memory to the beginning; and each stack frame is placed on the top of the stack, closest to the beginning of memory. Thus, running off the end of a piece of data in a stack frame alters data previously entered into the stack frame; and running off the end of a stack frame places data into the previous stack frame. A typical stack frame may look as below, having a return address (RETA) placed first, followed by other control information (CTLI).\n\n(CTLI)(RETA) \n\nIn C, a function may contain many different per-call data structures. Each piece of data created on call is placed in the stack frame in order, and is thus ordered from the end to the beginning of memory. Below is a hypothetical function and its stack frame.\n\n(d..)(c.........)(b...)(a...)(CTLI)(RETA)\n\nIn this hypothetical situation, if more than ten bytes are written to the array c, or more than 13 to the character array d, the excess will overflow into integer pointer b, then into integer a, then into the control information, and finally the return address. By overwriting b, the pointer is made to reference any position in memory, causing a read from an arbitrary address. By overwriting RETA, the function can be made to execute other code (when it attempts to return), either existing functions (ret2libc) or code written into the stack during the overflow.\nIn a nutshell, poor handling of c and d, such as the unbounded strcpy() calls above, may allow an attacker to control a program by influencing the values assigned to c and d directly. The goal of buffer overflow protection is to detect this issue in the least intrusive way possible. This is done by removing what can be out of harms way and placing a sort of tripwire, or canary, after the buffer.\nBuffer overflow protection is implemented as a change to the compiler. As such, it is possible for the protection to alter the structure of the data on the stack frame. This is exactly the case in systems such as ProPolice. The above function's automatic variables are rearranged more safely: arrays c and d are allocated first in the stack frame, which places integer a and integer pointer b before them in memory. So the stack frame becomes\n\n(b...)(a...)(d..)(c.........)(CTLI)(RETA)\n\nAs it is impossible to move CTLI or RETA without breaking the produced code, another tactic is employed. An extra piece of information, called a \"canary\" (CNRY), is placed after the buffers in the stack frame. When the buffers overflow, the canary value is changed. Thus, to effectively attack the program, an attacker must leave definite indication of his attack. The stack frame is\n\n(b...)(a...)(d..)(c.........)(CNRY)(CTLI)(RETA)\n\nAt the end of every function there is an instruction which continues execution from the memory address indicated by RETA. Before this instruction is executed, a check of CNRY ensures it has not been altered. If the value of CNRY fails the test, program execution is ended immediately. In essence, both deliberate attacks and inadvertent programming bugs result in a program abort.\nThe canary technique adds a few instructions of overhead for every function call with an automatic array, immediately before all dynamic buffer allocation and after dynamic buffer deallocation. The overhead generated in this technique is not significant. It does work, though, unless the canary remains unchanged. If the attacker knows that it's there, and can determine the value of the canary, they may simply copy over it with itself. This is usually difficult to arrange intentionally, and highly improbable in unintentional situations.\nThe position of the canary is implementation specific, but it is always between the buffers and the protected data. Varied positions and lengths have varied benefits.\nHow does stack buffer overflow protection work to prevent misbehavior or security vulnerabilities in executable programs?Question: What is the cause of stack buffer overflow bugs in programs?Question: How can overfilling a buffer on the stack influence program execution?Question: What is stack smashing and how can it be used in an attack?Question: How do terminator canaries prevent buffer overflow attacks?Question: How do random canaries protect against buffer overflow attacks?Question: How do random XOR canaries protect against buffer overflow attacks?Question: What is bounds checking and how does it prevent buffer overflow attacks?Question: What is tagging and how does it prevent buffer overflow attacks?Question: How does stack-smashing protection in GCC work?Question: How does ProPolice improve upon the idea of StackGuard in GCC?Question: How do Fedora, Ubuntu, and Arch Linux implement stack protection?Question: How do Microsoft Visual Studio and IBM Compiler implement buffer overflow protection?Question: How do Clang/LLVM support buffer overflow protection?Question: How does the canary technique prevent buffer overflow attacks?",

Stack buffer overflow bugs are caused when a program writes more data to a buffer located on the stack than what is actually allocated for that buffer.  This almost always results in corruption of adjacent data on the stack, and in cases where the overflow was triggered by mistake, will often cause the program to crash or operate incorrectly.  Stack buffer overflow is a type of the more general programming malfunction known as buffer overflow (or buffer overrun).  Overfilling a buffer on the stack is more likely to derail program execution than overfilling a buffer on the heap because the stack contains the return addresses for all active function calls.Stack buffer overflow can be caused deliberately as part of an attack known as stack smashing.  If the affected program is running with special privileges, or if it accepts data from untrusted network hosts (for example, a public webserver), then the bug is a potential security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject executable code into the running program and take control of the process.  This is one of the oldest and more reliable methods for attackers to gain unauthorized access to a computer.Typically, buffer overflow protection modifies the organization of data in the stack frame of a function call to include a \"canary\" value that, when destroyed, shows that a buffer preceding it in memory has been overflowed.  This provides the benefit of preventing an entire class of attacks. According to some researchers, the performance impact of these techniques is negligible.\nStack-smashing protection is unable to protect against certain forms of attack. For example, it cannot protect against buffer overflows in the heap.  There is no sane way to alter the layout of data within a structure; structures are expected to be the same between modules, especially with shared libraries. Any data in a structure after a buffer is impossible to protect with canaries; thus, programmers must be very careful about how they organize their variables and use their structures.\n\n== Canaries ==\nCanaries or canary words are known values that are placed between a buffer and control data on the stack to monitor buffer overflows. When the buffer overflows, the first data to be corrupted will usually be the canary, and a failed verification of the canary data will therefore alert of an overflow, which can then be handled, for example, by invalidating the corrupted data.  A canary value should not be confused with a  sentinel value.\nThe terminology is a reference to the historic practice of using canaries in coal mines, since they would be affected by toxic gases earlier than the miners, thus providing a biological warning system.  Canaries are alternately known as cookies, which is meant to evoke the image of a \"broken cookie\" when the value is corrupted.\nThere are three types of canaries in use: terminator, random, and random XOR. Current versions of StackGuard support all three, while ProPolice supports terminator and random canaries.\n\n\n*** Terminator canaries ***\nTerminator canaries use the observation that most buffer overflow attacks are based on certain string operations which end at string terminators. The reaction to this observation is that the canaries are built of null terminators, CR, LF, and FF. As a result, the attacker must write a null character before writing the return address to avoid altering the canary. This prevents attacks using strcpy() and other methods that return upon copying a null character, while the undesirable result is that the canary is known. Even with the protection, an attacker could potentially overwrite the canary with its known value and control information with mismatched values, thus passing the canary check code, which is executed soon before the specific processor's return-from-call instruction.\n\n\n*** Random canaries ***\nRandom canaries are randomly generated, usually from an entropy-gathering daemon, in order to prevent an attacker from knowing their value. Usually, it is not logically possible or plausible to read the canary for exploiting; the canary is a secure value known only by those who need to know it\u2014the buffer overflow protection code in this case.\nNormally, a random canary is generated at program initialization, and stored in a global variable. This variable is usually padded by unmapped pages so that attempting to read it using any kinds of tricks that exploit bugs to read off RAM cause a segmentation fault, terminating the program. It may still be possible to read the canary if the attacker knows where it is or can get the program to read from the stack.\n\n\n*** Random XOR canaries ***\nRandom XOR canaries are random canaries that are XOR-scrambled using all or part of the control data. In this way, once the canary or the control data is clobbered, the canary value is wrong.\nRandom XOR canaries have the same vulnerabilities as random canaries, except that the \"read from stack\" method of getting the canary is a bit more complicated. The attacker must get the canary, the algorithm, and the control data in order to re-generate the original canary needed to spoof the protection.\nIn addition, random XOR canaries can protect against a certain type of attack involving overflowing a buffer in a structure into a pointer to change the pointer to point at a piece of control data. Because of the XOR encoding, the canary will be wrong if the control data or return value is changed. Because of the pointer, the control data or return value can be changed without overflowing over the canary.\nAlthough these canaries protect the control data from being altered by clobbered pointers, they do not protect any other data or the pointers themselves. Function pointers especially are a problem here, as they can be overflowed into and can execute shellcode when called.\n\n== Bounds checking ==\n\nBounds checking is a compiler-based technique that adds run-time bounds information for each allocated block of memory, and checks all pointers against those at run-time. For C and C++, bounds checking can be performed at pointer calculation time or at dereference time.Implementations of this approach use either a central repository, which describes each allocated block of memory, or fat pointers, which contain both the pointer and additional data, describing the region that they point to.\n\n== Tagging ==\nTagging is a compiler-based or hardware-based (requiring a tagged architecture) technique for tagging the type of a piece of data in memory, used mainly for type checking. By marking certain areas of memory as non-executable, it effectively prevents memory allocated to store data from containing executable code. Also, certain areas of memory can be marked as non-allocated, preventing buffer overflows.\nHistorically, tagging has been used for implementing high-level programming languages; with appropriate support from the operating system, tagging can also be used to detect buffer overflows.  An example is the NX bit hardware feature, supported by Intel, AMD and ARM processors.\n\n== Implementations ==\n\n\n*** GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) ***\nStack-smashing protection was first implemented by StackGuard in 1997, and published at the 1998 USENIX Security Symposium. StackGuard was introduced as a set of patches to the Intel x86 backend of GCC 2.7. StackGuard was maintained for the Immunix Linux distribution from 1998 to 2003, and was extended with implementations for terminator, random and random XOR canaries. StackGuard was suggested for inclusion in GCC 3.x at the GCC 2003 Summit Proceedings, but this was never achieved.\nFrom 2001 to 2005, IBM developed GCC patches for stack-smashing protection, known as ProPolice. It improved on the idea of StackGuard by placing buffers after local pointers and function arguments in the stack frame. This helped avoid the corruption of pointers, preventing access to arbitrary memory locations.\nRed Hat engineers identified problems with ProPolice though, and in 2005 re-implemented stack-smashing protection for inclusion in GCC 4.1. This work introduced the -fstack-protector flag, which protects only some vulnerable functions, and the -fstack-protector-all flag, which protects all functions whether they need it or not.In 2012, Google engineers implemented the -fstack-protector-strong flag to strike a better balance between security and performance. This flag protects more kinds of vulnerable functions than -fstack-protector does, but not every function, providing better performance than -fstack-protector-all. It is available in GCC since its version 4.9.All Fedora packages are compiled with -fstack-protector since Fedora Core 5, and -fstack-protector-strong since Fedora 20. Most packages in Ubuntu are compiled with -fstack-protector since 6.10. Every Arch Linux package is compiled with -fstack-protector since 2011. All Arch Linux packages built since 4 May 2014 use -fstack-protector-strong. Stack protection is only used for some packages in Debian, and only for the FreeBSD base system since 8.0. Stack protection is standard in certain operating systems, including OpenBSD, Hardened Gentoo and DragonFly BSD.\nStackGuard and ProPolice cannot protect against overflows in automatically allocated structures that overflow into function pointers. ProPolice at least will rearrange the allocation order to get such structures allocated before function pointers. A separate mechanism for pointer protection was proposed in PointGuard and is available on Microsoft Windows.\n\n\n*** Microsoft Visual Studio ***\nThe compiler suite from Microsoft implements buffer overflow protection since version 2003 through the /GS command-line switch, which is enabled by default since version 2005. Using /GS- disables the protection.\n\n\n*** IBM Compiler ***\nStack-smashing protection can be turned on by the compiler flag -qstackprotect.\n\n\n*** Clang/LLVM ***\nClang supports the same -fstack-protector options as GCC and a stronger \"safe stack\" (-fsanitize\n\n== A canary example ==\nNormal buffer allocation for x86 architectures and other similar architectures is shown in the buffer overflow entry. Here, we will show the modified process as it pertains to StackGuard.\nWhen a function is called, a stack frame is created. A stack frame is built from the end of memory to the beginning; and each stack frame is placed on the top of the stack, closest to the beginning of memory. Thus, running off the end of a piece of data in a stack frame alters data previously entered into the stack frame; and running off the end of a stack frame places data into the previous stack frame. A typical stack frame may look as below, having a return address (RETA) placed first, followed by other control information (CTLI).\n\n(CTLI)(RETA) \n\nIn C, a function may contain many different per-call data structures. Each piece of data created on call is placed in the stack frame in order, and is thus ordered from the end to the beginning of memory. Below is a hypothetical function and its stack frame.\n\n(d..)(c.........)(b...)(a...)(CTLI)(RETA)\n\nIn this hypothetical situation, if more than ten bytes are written to the array c, or more than 13 to the character array d, the excess will overflow into integer pointer b, then into integer a, then into the control information, and finally the return address. By overwriting b, the pointer is made to reference any position in memory, causing a read from an arbitrary address. By overwriting RETA, the function can be made to execute other code (when it attempts to return), either existing functions (ret2libc) or code written into the stack during the overflow.\nIn a nutshell, poor handling of c and d, such as the unbounded strcpy() calls above, may allow an attacker to control a program by influencing the values assigned to c and d directly. The goal of buffer overflow protection is to detect this issue in the least intrusive way possible. This is done by removing what can be out of harms way and placing a sort of tripwire, or canary, after the buffer.\nBuffer overflow protection is implemented as a change to the compiler. As such, it is possible for the protection to alter the structure of the data on the stack frame. This is exactly the case in systems such as ProPolice. The above function's automatic variables are rearranged more safely: arrays c and d are allocated first in the stack frame, which places integer a and integer pointer b before them in memory. So the stack frame becomes\n\n(b...)(a...)(d..)(c.........)(CTLI)(RETA)\n\nAs it is impossible to move CTLI or RETA without breaking the produced code, another tactic is employed. An extra piece of information, called a \"canary\" (CNRY), is placed after the buffers in the stack frame. When the buffers overflow, the canary value is changed. Thus, to effectively attack the program, an attacker must leave definite indication of his attack. The stack frame is\n\n(b...)(a...)(d..)(c.........)(CNRY)(CTLI)(RETA)\n\nAt the end of every function there is an instruction which continues execution from the memory address indicated by RETA. Before this instruction is executed, a check of CNRY ensures it has not been altered. If the value of CNRY fails the test, program execution is ended immediately. In essence, both deliberate attacks and inadvertent programming bugs result in a program abort.\nThe canary technique adds a few instructions of overhead for every function call with an automatic array, immediately before all dynamic buffer allocation and after dynamic buffer deallocation. The overhead generated in this technique is not significant. It does work, though, unless the canary remains unchanged. If the attacker knows that it's there, and can determine the value of the canary, they may simply copy over it with itself. This is usually difficult to arrange intentionally, and highly improbable in unintentional situations.\nThe position of the canary is implementation specific, but it is always between the buffers and the protected data. Varied positions and lengths have varied benefits.",

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nFreegate\n\n==Introduction==\nFreegate is a software application developed by Dynamic Internet Technology (DIT) that enables internet users from mainland China, South Korea , North Korea, Syria, Vietnam, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, and the United Kingdom among others, to view websites blocked by their governments. The program takes advantage of a range of proxy servers called Dynaweb. This allows users to bypass Internet firewalls that block web sites by using DIT's Peer-to-peer (P2P)-like proxy network system. FreeGate's anti-censorship capability is further enhanced by a new, unique encryption and compression algorithm in the versions of 6.33 and above. Dynamic Internet Technology estimates Freegate had 200,000 users in 2004. The maintainer and CEO of DIT is Bill Xia.\n\n== Dynaweb ==\nDynaWeb is a collection of anti-censorship services provided by Dynamic Internet Technology Inc. (DIT). DynaWeb is a web-based anti-censorship portal. Once users point their web browser at one of the DynaWeb URLs, a web page will be presented similar to the original, with most blocked websites as links. In addition, a user can type in any URL in the box on this page and DynaWeb will fetch the pages for him or her instantly. No software is needed, nor are any settings tweaked on a user's computer. Since the Chinese net police watch DynaWeb's portal websites closely and block them as soon as they identify them, DynaWeb must be dynamic. It has hundreds of mirror sites at any time, and each with a varying IP and DNS domain names to defeat IP blocking and DNS hijacking. On the backend, DynaWeb also has mechanisms to proactively monitor the blocking status of each of its mirror sites, and as soon as blocking is detected, it will change the IP and DNS domain name instantly.To keep users connected to such a dynamic infrastructure, DynaWeb has a variety of channels to keep users updated. For example, a user can send a message to one of DynaWeb's instant messenger (IM) accounts, and will get an instant reply showing the newest addresses of DynaWeb portals. Similar things are being done with emails. By these many, dynamic channels, DynaWeb outsmarts any attempt to collect all DynaWeb addresses by the censors, because each user receives only a (different) subset of DynaWeb's addresses. Automatic blocking detection combined with quick reaction apparently frustrates the blocking efforts on the China side of the Great Firewall of China (GFW).DIT also releases a tiny piece of software, FreeGate, which directly taps into DynaWeb's backbone and keeps a user connected to the dynamic channels automatically.\nToday DynaWeb offers the widest range of options for users to access Internet freely, and supports more than 50 million web hits per day on average from Chinese users alone.\n\n== Creation and funding ==\nDIT was founded in 2001 to provide email delivery services to China for US government agencies and NGOs. In 2002, DIT started to provide anti-censorship services under the framework of DynaWeb, and like UltraSurf, DynaWeb became a top contender of the GFW-penetration effort.Freegate was created by Falun Gong practitioners and has been financed by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, a US governmental agency. Freegate also receives funding from  Human Rights in China, which is also one of its clients and which receives some funding from the American non-profit organization  the National Endowment for Democracy. According to a CRS report, the US government gave funding of $685,000 to Freegate in 2005.\n\n== Feature ==\nFreegate Android VPN\n\n== Malware reports ==\nIn 2004, the Financial Times, citing a member of staff at Symantec in mainland China, reported that Norton AntiVirus identified Freegate as a Trojan horse. There were initial fears that the reports may be a ploy by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) authorities to encourage removal of the software from computers, but it was soon delisted as a threat. Symantec explained that its detection was based on the software operating similarly to various Trojan horses, based on the use of proxies to penetrate firewalls used to block web sites, but that it had modified its detection to exclude Freegate.In 2013, it was reported that \"pro-government electronic actors\" in Syria sent electronic messages to rebels encouraging them to download a file named Freegate which was claimed to be designed to help dissidents circumvent state surveillance agencies, but actually it was a malware and the intruder was able to monitor what the victims were typing on their computers and read or remove the files.In August 2013 while Freegate was testing a new proxy program, some people thought it was a phishing attack.

      "context": "Freegate\n\n==Introduction==\nFreegate is a software application developed by Dynamic Internet Technology (DIT) that enables internet users from mainland China, South Korea , North Korea, Syria, Vietnam, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, and the United Kingdom among others, to view websites blocked by their governments. The program takes advantage of a range of proxy servers called Dynaweb. This allows users to bypass Internet firewalls that block web sites by using DIT's Peer-to-peer (P2P)-like proxy network system. FreeGate's anti-censorship capability is further enhanced by a new, unique encryption and compression algorithm in the versions of 6.33 and above. Dynamic Internet Technology estimates Freegate had 200,000 users in 2004. The maintainer and CEO of DIT is Bill Xia.\n\n== Dynaweb ==\nDynaWeb is a collection of anti-censorship services provided by Dynamic Internet Technology Inc. (DIT). DynaWeb is a web-based anti-censorship portal. Once users point their web browser at one of the DynaWeb URLs, a web page will be presented similar to the original, with most blocked websites as links. In addition, a user can type in any URL in the box on this page and DynaWeb will fetch the pages for him or her instantly. No software is needed, nor are any settings tweaked on a user's computer. Since the Chinese net police watch DynaWeb's portal websites closely and block them as soon as they identify them, DynaWeb must be dynamic. It has hundreds of mirror sites at any time, and each with a varying IP and DNS domain names to defeat IP blocking and DNS hijacking. On the backend, DynaWeb also has mechanisms to proactively monitor the blocking status of each of its mirror sites, and as soon as blocking is detected, it will change the IP and DNS domain name instantly.To keep users connected to such a dynamic infrastructure, DynaWeb has a variety of channels to keep users updated. For example, a user can send a message to one of DynaWeb's instant messenger (IM) accounts, and will get an instant reply showing the newest addresses of DynaWeb portals. Similar things are being done with emails. By these many, dynamic channels, DynaWeb outsmarts any attempt to collect all DynaWeb addresses by the censors, because each user receives only a (different) subset of DynaWeb's addresses. Automatic blocking detection combined with quick reaction apparently frustrates the blocking efforts on the China side of the Great Firewall of China (GFW).DIT also releases a tiny piece of software, FreeGate, which directly taps into DynaWeb's backbone and keeps a user connected to the dynamic channels automatically.\nToday DynaWeb offers the widest range of options for users to access Internet freely, and supports more than 50 million web hits per day on average from Chinese users alone.\n\n== Creation and funding ==\nDIT was founded in 2001 to provide email delivery services to China for US government agencies and NGOs. In 2002, DIT started to provide anti-censorship services under the framework of DynaWeb, and like UltraSurf, DynaWeb became a top contender of the GFW-penetration effort.Freegate was created by Falun Gong practitioners and has been financed by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, a US governmental agency. Freegate also receives funding from  Human Rights in China, which is also one of its clients and which receives some funding from the American non-profit organization  the National Endowment for Democracy. According to a CRS report, the US government gave funding of $685,000 to Freegate in 2005.\n\n== Feature ==\nFreegate Android VPN\n\n== Malware reports ==\nIn 2004, the Financial Times, citing a member of staff at Symantec in mainland China, reported that Norton AntiVirus identified Freegate as a Trojan horse. There were initial fears that the reports may be a ploy by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) authorities to encourage removal of the software from computers, but it was soon delisted as a threat. Symantec explained that its detection was based on the software operating similarly to various Trojan horses, based on the use of proxies to penetrate firewalls used to block web sites, but that it had modified its detection to exclude Freegate.In 2013, it was reported that \"pro-government electronic actors\" in Syria sent electronic messages to rebels encouraging them to download a file named Freegate which was claimed to be designed to help dissidents circumvent state surveillance agencies, but actually it was a malware and the intruder was able to monitor what the victims were typing on their computers and read or remove the files.In August 2013 while Freegate was testing a new proxy program, some people thought it was a phishing attack. Reports from Iran said the users who used Freegate to pass Internet censorship in Iran, were led to a fake page instead of Facebook's main website. Freegate published a note saying they were testing a new proxy program, and the fake Facebook page was a tunnel. Although IT experts warned users to be careful with the tunnel link because it doesn't use SSL security so users' information is not encrypted.",

    "instruction": "DigiCipher 2\n\n==Introduction==\nDigiCipher 2, or simply DCII, is a proprietary standard format of digital signal transmission and it doubles as an encryption standard with MPEG-2/MPEG-4 signal video compression used on many communications satellite television and audio signals. The DCII standard was originally developed in 1997 by General Instrument, which then became the Home and Network Mobility division of Motorola, then bought by Google in Aug 2011, and lastly became the Home portion of the division to Arris.The original attempt for a North American digital signal encryption and compression standard was DigiCipher 1, which was used most notably in the now-defunct PrimeStar medium-power direct broadcast satellite (DBS) system during the early 1990s. The DCII standard predates wide acceptance of DVB-based digital terrestrial television compression (although not cable or satellite DVB) and therefore is incompatible with the DVB standard.\nApproximately 70% of newer first-generation digital cable networks in North America use the 4DTV/DigiCipher 2 format. The use of DCII is most prevalent in North American digital cable television set-top boxes. DCII is also used on Motorola's 4DTV digital satellite television tuner and Shaw Direct's DBS receiver.\nThe DigiCipher 2 encryption standard was reverse engineered in 2016.\n\n\n\n== Technical specifications ==\nDigiCipher II uses QPSK and BPSK at the same time. The primary difference between DigiCipher 2 and DVB lies in how each standard handles SI metadata, or System Information, where DVB reserves packet identifiers from 16 to 31 for metadata, DigiCipher reserves only packet identifier 8187 for its  master guide table which acts as a look-up table for all other metadata tables. DigiCipher 2 also extends the MPEG program number that is assigned for each service in a transport stream with the concept of a virtual channel number, whereas the DVB system never defined this type of remapping preferring to use a registry of network identifiers to further differentiate program numbers from those used in other transport streams.  There are also private non-standard additions to DVB that add virtual channel remapping using logical channel numbers. Also unlike DVB, all text used in descriptors can be compressed using standard Huffman coding which saves on broadcast bandwidth and loading times. DigiCipher II uses Dolby Digital AC-3 audio for all channels, although MPEG-1 Level 2 audio is not supported.\n\nBased on the above text, answer the questions.

It is based on the so-called FX construction. Its most notable feature is the alpha reflection: the decryption is the encryption with a related key which is very cheap to compute. Unlike most other \"lightweight\" ciphers, it has a small number of rounds and the layers constituting a round have low logic depth. As a result, fully unrolled implementation are able to reach much higher frequencies than AES or PRESENT.

The paper argues that the FX construction is a fine solution to improve the security of a widely deployed cipher (like DES-X did for DES) but that it is a questionable choice for new designs. It presents a tweak to the Prince cipher to strengthen it against this particular kind of attack.\nA biclique cryptanalysis attack has been published on the full cipher. It is somewhat inline with the estimation of the designers since it reduces the key search space by 21.28 (the original paper mentions a factor 2).\nThe paper \"Reflection Cryptanalysis of PRINCE-Like Ciphers\" focuses on the alpha reflection and establishes choice criteria for the alpha constant. It shows that a poorly chosen alpha would lead to efficient attacks on the full cipher; but the value randomly chosen by the designers is not among the weak ones.Several meet-in-the-middle attacks have been published on round reduced versions.An attack in the multi-user setting can find the keys of 2 users among a set of 232 users in time 265.An attack on 10 rounds with overall complexity of 118.56 bits has been published.An attack on 7 rounds with time complexity of 257 operations has been published.A differential fault attack has been published using 7 faulty cipher texts under random 4 bit nibble fault model.The paper \"New approaches for round-reduced PRINCE cipher cryptanalysis\" presents boomerang attack and known-plaintext attack on reduced round versions up to 6 rounds.\nIn 2015 few additional attacks have been published but are not freely available.\n\n\n*** Most practical attacks on reduced round versions ***\n\nWhat is the block size and key size of the Prince cipher?Q: What is the main feature that distinguishes Prince from other lightweight ciphers?Q: How many rounds does the Prince cipher have and what is the composition of these rounds?Q: What is the nonlinear layer of the Prince cipher based on and what is the linear layer composed of?Q: How is the linear layer matrix multiplication computed in the Prince cipher?Q: What is the middle round of the Prince cipher and how is it different from the other rounds?Q: What is the \"Prince challenge\" and what is its purpose?Q: What is the FX construction and how does it improve the security of the Prince cipher?Q: What is a biclique cryptanalysis attack and how does it apply to the Prince cipher?Q: What is the \"alpha reflection\" in the Prince cipher and what is its significance?Q: What is a meet-in-the-middle attack and how has it been applied to the Prince cipher?Q: What is a differential fault attack and how has it been applied to the Prince cipher?Q: What is the \"New approaches for round-reduced PRINCE cipher cryptanalysis\" paper and what attacks does it present?Q: What is a time-memory-data tradeoff attack and how has it been applied to the Prince cipher?Q: What is reflection cryptanalysis and how does it apply to the Prince cipher?",

The forward rounds start with a round constant XORed with the subkey, followed by a nonlinear layer and a linear layer. The backward rounds are the inverse of the forward rounds, except for the round constants.A: The nonlinear layer of the Prince cipher is based on a single 4-bit S-box, which can be chosen from a set of affine-equivalent S-boxes. The linear layer consists of multiplication by a 64x64 matrix and a shift row operation that operates on 4-bit nibbles.A: The linear layer matrix multiplication in the Prince cipher is computed using four smaller multiplications, two using one 16x16 matrix and two using another 16x16 matrix.A: The middle round of the Prince cipher consists of the nonlinear layer, followed by the linear layer, and then the inverse of the nonlinear layer. It is different from the other rounds because it contains two nonlinear layers, whereas the other rounds only contain one.A: The \"Prince challenge\" is a competition created by the organizations behind the Prince cipher to encourage cryptanalysis of the cipher. The purpose of the challenge is to find attacks on the Prince cipher and its reduced round variants.A: The FX construction is a design principle used in the Prince cipher in which the decryption is the encryption with a related key. This construction can improve the security of a widely deployed cipher, but it is a questionable choice for new designs due to its susceptibility to certain attacks.A: A biclique cryptanalysis attack is a type of attack that can be used to analyze the security of a cipher.

This is significant because it makes the cipher more efficient in hardware implementations.A: A meet-in-the-middle attack is a type of attack that can be used to find the keys of a cipher by searching for matches in the middle of the encryption and decryption processes. Several meet-in-the-middle attacks have been published on round-reduced versions of the Prince cipher.A: A differential fault attack is a type of attack that involves injecting faults into a cipher and analyzing the differences in the ciphertexts to deduce information about the key.

The paper argues that the FX construction is a fine solution to improve the security of a widely deployed cipher (like DES-X did for DES) but that it is a questionable choice for new designs. It presents a tweak to the Prince cipher to strengthen it against this particular kind of attack.\nA biclique cryptanalysis attack has been published on the full cipher. It is somewhat inline with the estimation of the designers since it reduces the key search space by 21.28 (the original paper mentions a factor 2).\nThe paper \"Reflection Cryptanalysis of PRINCE-Like Ciphers\" focuses on the alpha reflection and establishes choice criteria for the alpha constant. It shows that a poorly chosen alpha would lead to efficient attacks on the full cipher; but the value randomly chosen by the designers is not among the weak ones.Several meet-in-the-middle attacks have been published on round reduced versions.An attack in the multi-user setting can find the keys of 2 users among a set of 232 users in time 265.An attack on 10 rounds with overall complexity of 118.56 bits has been published.An attack on 7 rounds with time complexity of 257 operations has been published.A differential fault attack has been published using 7 faulty cipher texts under random 4 bit nibble fault model.The paper \"New approaches for round-reduced PRINCE cipher cryptanalysis\" presents boomerang attack and known-plaintext attack on reduced round versions up to 6 rounds.\nIn 2015 few additional attacks have been published but are not freely available.\n\n\n*** Most practical attacks on reduced round versions ***",

      "answers": "The block size of the Prince cipher is 64 bits and the key size is 128 bits.A: The main feature that distinguishes Prince from other lightweight ciphers is its alpha reflection, which allows the decryption to be computed very cheaply using a related key.A: The Prince cipher has 12 rounds, composed of 5 \"forward\" rounds, a middle round, and 5 \"backward\" rounds. The forward rounds start with a round constant XORed with the subkey, followed by a nonlinear layer and a linear layer. The backward rounds are the inverse of the forward rounds, except for the round constants.A: The nonlinear layer of the Prince cipher is based on a single 4-bit S-box, which can be chosen from a set of affine-equivalent S-boxes. The linear layer consists of multiplication by a 64x64 matrix and a shift row operation that operates on 4-bit nibbles.A: The linear layer matrix multiplication in the Prince cipher is computed using four smaller multiplications, two using one 16x16 matrix and two using another 16x16 matrix.A: The middle round of the Prince cipher consists of the nonlinear layer, followed by the linear layer, and then the inverse of the nonlinear layer. It is different from the other rounds because it contains two nonlinear layers, whereas the other rounds only contain one.A: The \"Prince challenge\" is a competition created by the organizations behind the Prince cipher to encourage cryptanalysis of the cipher. The purpose of the challenge is to find attacks on the Prince cipher and its reduced round variants.A: The FX construction is a design principle used in the Prince cipher in which the decryption is the encryption with a related key. This construction can improve the security of a widely deployed cipher, but it is a questionable choice for new designs due to its susceptibility to certain attacks.A: A biclique cryptanalysis attack is a type of attack that can be used to analyze the security of a cipher. In the case of the Prince cipher, a biclique cryptanalysis attack has been published that reduces the key search space by a factor of 2^1.28.A: The \"alpha reflection\" is a feature of the Prince cipher that allows the decryption to be computed very cheaply using a related key. This is significant because it makes the cipher more efficient in hardware implementations.A: A meet-in-the-middle attack is a type of attack that can be used to find the keys of a cipher by searching for matches in the middle of the encryption and decryption processes. Several meet-in-the-middle attacks have been published on round-reduced versions of the Prince cipher.A: A differential fault attack is a type of attack that involves injecting faults into a cipher and analyzing the differences in the ciphertexts to deduce information about the key. A differential fault attack has been published on the Prince cipher using 7 faulty ciphertexts under a random 4-bit nibble fault model.A: The \"New approaches for round-reduced PRINCE cipher cryptanalysis\" paper is a research paper that presents boomerang and known-plaintext attacks on reduced round versions of the Prince cipher, up to 6 rounds.A: A time-memory-data tradeoff attack is a type of attack that involves precomputing a table of values and then using this table to quickly search for the key of a cipher. A generic time-memory-data tradeoff for FX constructions, with an application to Prince, has been published. This attack argues that the FX construction is a fine solution to improve the security of a widely deployed cipher, but it is a questionable choice for new designs.A: Reflection cryptanalysis is a type of attack that focuses on the alpha reflection of a cipher and establishes choice criteria for the alpha constant. A paper on reflection cryptanalysis of Prince-like ciphers shows that a poorly chosen alpha would lead to efficient attacks on the full cipher, but the value randomly chosen by the designers is not among the weak ones."

    "instruction": "Keybase\n\n==Introduction==\nKeybase is a key directory that maps social media identities to encryption keys (including, but not limited to PGP keys) in a publicly auditable manner. Additionally it offers an end-to-end encrypted chat and cloud storage system, called Keybase Chat and the Keybase Filesystem respectively. Files placed in the public portion of the filesystem are served from a public endpoint, as well as locally from a filesystem mounted by the Keybase client.Keybase supports publicly connecting Twitter, GitHub, Reddit, and Hacker News identities, including websites and domains under one's control, to encryption keys. It also supports Bitcoin, Zcash, Stellar, and QRL wallet addresses. Keybase has supported Coinbase identities since initial public release, but ceased to do so on March 17, 2017, when Coinbase terminated public payment pages. In general, Keybase allows for any service with public identities to integrate with Keybase.On May 7, 2020, Keybase announced it had been acquired by Zoom, as part of Zoom's \"plan to further strengthen the security of [its] video communications platform\".\n\n== Identity proofs ==\nKeybase allows users to prove a link between certain online identities (such as a Twitter or Reddit account) and their encryption keys. Instead of using a system such as OAuth, identities are proven by posting a signed statement as the account a user wishes to prove ownership of. This makes identity proofs publicly verifiable \u2013 instead of having to trust that the service is being truthful, a user can find and check the relevant proof statements themselves, and the Keybase client does this automatically.\n\n== App ==\nIn addition to the web interface, Keybase offers a client application for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, and most desktop Linux distributions, written in Go with an Electron front end. The app offers additional features to the website, such as the end-to-end encrypted chat, teams feature, and the ability to add files to and access private files in their personal and team Keybase Filesystem storage. Each device running the client app is authorized by a signature made either by another device or the user's PGP key. Each device is also given a per-device NaCl (pronounced \"salt\") key to perform cryptographic operations.\n\n== Chat ==\nKeybase Chat is an end-to-end encrypted chat built in to Keybase launched in February 2017. A distinguishing feature of Keybase Chat is that it allows Keybase users to send messages to someone using their online aliases (for example a reddit account), even if they haven't signed up to Keybase yet.If the recipient (the online alias owner) has an account on Keybase, they will seamlessly receive the message. If the recipient doesn't have a Keybase account, and later signs up and proves the link between the online account and their devices, the sender's device will rekey the message for the recipient based on the public proof they posted, allowing them to read the message. Since the Keybase app checks the proof, it avoids trust on first use.\n\n== Keybase Filesystem (KBFS) ==\nKeybase allows users to store up to 250 GB of files in a cloud storage called the Keybase Filesystem for free. There are no storage upgrades available, but paid plans allowing for more data are planned. The filesystem is divided into three parts: public files, private files, and team files. On Unix-like machines, the filesystem is mounted to /keybase, and on Microsoft Windows systems it is usually mounted to the K drive. Currently, mobile versions of the Keybase client can only download files from kbfs, and can not mount it. However, they do support operations such as rekeying files as necessary. In October 2017 Keybase brought out end-to-end encrypted Git repositories.\n\n\n*** Public files ***\nPublic files are stored in /public/username, and are publicly visible. All files in the public filesystem are automatically signed by the client. Only the user who the folder is named after can edit its contents, however, a folder may be named after a comma-separated list of users (e.g. a folder /public/foo,bar,three would be editable by the users foo, bar, and three).Public files can be accessed by any user. Single user folders are displayed at keybase.pub and are also accessible by opening the directory in the mounted version of the filesystem. Multi user folders (such as /public/foo,bar,three) are only accessible through the mounted version of the system.\n\n\n*** Private files ***\nPrivate files are stored in /private/username, and are only visible to username. Private folders, like public folders, can be named after more than one user (e.g. a folder /private/foo,bar,three would be readable and editable by the users foo, bar, and three). Private files can also be read only for users after \"#\" (e.g. a folder /private/writer1,writer2,#reader1,reader2 would be readable and editable by the users writer1 and  writer2 but only readable for reader1 and reader2).  Unlike public files, all private files are both encrypted and signed before being uploaded, making them end-to-end encrypted.\n\n\n*** Team files ***\nTeam files are stored in /team/teamname, and are publicly visible to team members. All files in the team filesystem are automatically encrypted and signed by the client. Only users who are marked as writers can edit its contents, however, any readers can access the files stored there.\n\n== Teams ==\nIn September 2017, Keybase launched Keybase Teams. A team is described as \"...a named group of people.\" Each team has a private folder in the Keybase filesystem, and a number of chat channels (similar to Slack). Teams can also be divided into \"subteams\" by placing a . in the team name. For example, wikipedia.projects would be a subteam of wikipedia, while wikipedia.projects.foobar would be a subteam of wikipedia.projects (and therefore, also of wikipedia).\n\n\n*** Team administration ***\nTeams are largely administered by adding signatures to a chain. Each signature can add, remove, or change the membership of a user in a team, as well as when changes are made to subteams.\nEach chain starts with a signature made by the team owner, with subsequent actions signed on by team admins or users. This ensures that every action is made by an authorized user, and that actions can be verified by anyone in possession of the public key used.\n\nBased on the above text, answer the questions. How does Keybase allow users to connect their social media identities to encryption keys?Q: What is the function of the Keybase app's per-device NaCl key?Q: How does Keybase Chat enable messaging to online aliases, even if the recipient hasn't joined Keybase?Q: How are public files in the Keybase Filesystem protected?Q: How does Keybase handle the encryption and access permissions for private files?Q: How are teams managed and administered in Keybase?Q: What is the purpose of the \"subteams\" feature in Keybase Teams?Q: How does Keybase ensure the security and privacy of team files?Q: How does Keybase handle storage for the Filesystem, and are there any storage upgrade options?Q: How does Keybase's acquisition by Zoom impact the security of Zoom's video communications platform?Q: How does Keybase enable multi-user access to public and private files?Q: How does Keybase handle the verification of proof statements for identity links?Q: How does Keybase support the integration of services with public identities?Q: How does Keybase handle the rekeying of messages for recipients who join the platform later?Q: How does Keybase's end-to-end encrypted Git repositories feature benefit users and developers?",

These attacks rely on the phenomenon of heat transfer from one object to another. During authentication, heat transfers from the users' hands to the surface they are interacting with, leaving heat traces behind that can be analyzed using thermal cameras that operate in the far-infrared spectrum. These traces can be recovered and used to reconstruct the passwords. In some cases, the attack can be successful even 30 seconds after the user has authenticated.Thermal attacks can be performed after the victim had authenticated, alleviating the need for in-situ observation attacks (e.g., shoulder surfing attacks) that can be affected by hand occlusions. While smudge attacks can reveal the order of entries of graphical passwords, such as the Android Lock Patterns, thermal attacks can reveal the order of entries even in the case of PINs or alphanumeric passwords. The reason thermal attacks leak information about the order of entry is because keys and buttons that the user touches first lose heat over time, while recently touched ones maintain the heat signature for a longer time.

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nCollision attack\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, a collision attack on a cryptographic hash tries to find two inputs producing the same hash value, i.e. a hash collision. This is in contrast to a preimage attack where a specific target hash value is specified.\nThere are roughly two types of collision attacks:\n\nClassical collision attack\nFind two different messages m1 and m2 such that hash(m1) = hash(m2).More generally:\n\nChosen-prefix collision attack\nGiven two different prefixes p1 and p2, find two appendages m1 and m2 such that hash(p1 \u2225 m1) = hash(p2 \u2225 m2), where \u2225 denotes the concatenation operation.\n\n\n\n== Classical collision attack ==\nMathematically stated, a collision attack finds two different messages m1 and m2, such that hash(m1)\n\n== Chosen-prefix collision attack ==\nAn extension of the collision attack is the chosen-prefix collision attack, which is specific to Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd hash functions. In this case, the attacker can choose two arbitrarily different documents, and then append different calculated values that result in the whole documents having an equal hash value. This attack is much more powerful than a classical collision attack.\nMathematically stated, given two different prefixes p1, p2, the attack finds two appendages m1 and m2 such that hash(p1 \u2225 m1)\n\n== Attack scenarios ==\nMany applications of cryptographic hash functions do not rely on collision resistance, thus collision attacks do not affect their security. For example, HMACs are not vulnerable. For the attack to be useful, the attacker must be in control of the input to the hash function.\n\n\n*** Digital signatures ***\nBecause digital signature algorithms cannot sign a large amount of data efficiently, most implementations use a hash function to reduce (\"compress\") the amount of data that needs to be signed down to a constant size. Digital signature schemes often become vulnerable to hash collisions as soon as the underlying hash function is practically broken; techniques like randomized (salted) hashing will buy extra time by requiring the harder preimage attack.The usual attack scenario goes like this:\n\nMallory creates two different documents A and B that have an identical hash value, i.e., a collision. Mallory seeks to deceive Bob into accepting document B, ostensibly from Alice.\nMallory sends document A to Alice, who agrees to what the document says, signs its hash, and sends the signature to Mallory.\nMallory attaches the signature from document A to document B.\nMallory then sends the signature and document B to Bob, claiming that Alice signed B. Because the digital signature matches document B's hash, Bob's software is unable to detect the substitution.In 2008, researchers used a chosen-prefix collision attack against MD5 using this scenario, to produce a rogue certificate authority certificate. They created two versions of a TLS public key certificate, one of which appeared legitimate and was submitted for signing by the RapidSSL certificate authority. The second version, which had the same MD5 hash, contained flags which signal web browsers to accept it as a legitimate authority for issuing arbitrary other certificates.\n\n\n*** Hash flooding ***\nHash flooding (also known as HashDoS) is a denial of service attack that uses hash collisions to exploit the worst-case (linear probe) runtime of hash table lookups. It was originally described in 2003. To execute such an attack, the attacker sends the server multiple pieces of data that hash to the same value and then tries to get the server to perform slow lookups. As the main focus of hash functions used in hash tables was speed instead of security, most major programming languages were affected, with new vulnerabilities of this class still showing up a decade after the original presentation.To prevent hash flooding without making the hash function overly complex, newer keyed hash functions are introduced, with the security objective that collisions are hard to find as long as the key is unknown.

      "context": "Collision attack\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, a collision attack on a cryptographic hash tries to find two inputs producing the same hash value, i.e. a hash collision. This is in contrast to a preimage attack where a specific target hash value is specified.\nThere are roughly two types of collision attacks:\n\nClassical collision attack\nFind two different messages m1 and m2 such that hash(m1) = hash(m2).More generally:\n\nChosen-prefix collision attack\nGiven two different prefixes p1 and p2, find two appendages m1 and m2 such that hash(p1 \u2225 m1) = hash(p2 \u2225 m2), where \u2225 denotes the concatenation operation.\n\n\n\n== Classical collision attack ==\nMathematically stated, a collision attack finds two different messages m1 and m2, such that hash(m1)\n\n== Chosen-prefix collision attack ==\nAn extension of the collision attack is the chosen-prefix collision attack, which is specific to Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd hash functions. In this case, the attacker can choose two arbitrarily different documents, and then append different calculated values that result in the whole documents having an equal hash value. This attack is much more powerful than a classical collision attack.\nMathematically stated, given two different prefixes p1, p2, the attack finds two appendages m1 and m2 such that hash(p1 \u2225 m1)\n\n== Attack scenarios ==\nMany applications of cryptographic hash functions do not rely on collision resistance, thus collision attacks do not affect their security. For example, HMACs are not vulnerable. For the attack to be useful, the attacker must be in control of the input to the hash function.\n\n\n*** Digital signatures ***\nBecause digital signature algorithms cannot sign a large amount of data efficiently, most implementations use a hash function to reduce (\"compress\") the amount of data that needs to be signed down to a constant size. Digital signature schemes often become vulnerable to hash collisions as soon as the underlying hash function is practically broken; techniques like randomized (salted) hashing will buy extra time by requiring the harder preimage attack.The usual attack scenario goes like this:\n\nMallory creates two different documents A and B that have an identical hash value, i.e., a collision. Mallory seeks to deceive Bob into accepting document B, ostensibly from Alice.\nMallory sends document A to Alice, who agrees to what the document says, signs its hash, and sends the signature to Mallory.\nMallory attaches the signature from document A to document B.\nMallory then sends the signature and document B to Bob, claiming that Alice signed B. Because the digital signature matches document B's hash, Bob's software is unable to detect the substitution.In 2008, researchers used a chosen-prefix collision attack against MD5 using this scenario, to produce a rogue certificate authority certificate. They created two versions of a TLS public key certificate, one of which appeared legitimate and was submitted for signing by the RapidSSL certificate authority. The second version, which had the same MD5 hash, contained flags which signal web browsers to accept it as a legitimate authority for issuing arbitrary other certificates.\n\n\n*** Hash flooding ***\nHash flooding (also known as HashDoS) is a denial of service attack that uses hash collisions to exploit the worst-case (linear probe) runtime of hash table lookups. It was originally described in 2003. To execute such an attack, the attacker sends the server multiple pieces of data that hash to the same value and then tries to get the server to perform slow lookups. As the main focus of hash functions used in hash tables was speed instead of security, most major programming languages were affected, with new vulnerabilities of this class still showing up a decade after the original presentation.To prevent hash flooding without making the hash function overly complex, newer keyed hash functions are introduced, with the security objective that collisions are hard to find as long as the key is unknown. They may be slower than previous hashes, but are still much easier to compute than cryptographic hashes. As of 2021, Daniel J. Bernstein's SipHash (2012) is the most widely-used hash function in this class.

    "instruction": "ISO/IEC 27001\n\n==Introduction==\nISO/IEC 27001 is an international standard to manage information security. The standard was originally published jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in 2005, revised in 2013, and again most recently in 2022. There are also numerous recognized national variants of the standard.  It details requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS) \u2013 the aim of which is to help organizations make the information assets they hold more secure. Organizations that meet the standard's requirements can choose to be certified by an accredited certification body following successful completion of an audit. The effectiveness of the ISO/IEC 27001 certification process and the overall standard has been addressed in a large-scale study conducted in 2020.\n\n\n\n== How the standard works ==\nMost organizations have a number of information security controls. However, without an information security management system (ISMS), controls tend to be somewhat disorganized and disjointed, having been implemented often as point solutions to specific situations or simply as a matter of convention. Security controls in operation typically address certain aspects of information technology (IT) or data security specifically; leaving non-IT information assets (such as paperwork and proprietary knowledge) less protected on the whole. Moreover, business continuity planning and physical security may be managed quite independently of IT or information security while Human Resources practices may make little reference to the need to define and assign information security roles and responsibilities throughout the organization.\nISO/IEC 27001 requires that management:\n\nSystematically examine the organization's information security risks, taking account of the threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts;\nDesign and implement a coherent and comprehensive suite of information security controls and/or other forms of risk treatment (such as risk avoidance or risk transfer) to address those risks that are deemed unacceptable; and\nAdopt an overarching management process to ensure that the information security controls continue to meet the organization's information security needs on an ongoing basis.What controls will be tested as part of certification to ISO/IEC 27001 is dependent on the certification auditor. This can include any controls that the organisation has deemed to be within the scope of the ISMS and this testing can be to any depth or extent as assessed by the auditor as needed to test that the control has been implemented and is operating effectively.\nManagement determines the scope of the ISMS for certification purposes and may limit it to, say, a single business unit or location. The ISO/IEC 27001 certificate does not necessarily mean the remainder of the organization, outside the scoped area, has an adequate approach to information security management.\nOther standards in the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards provide additional guidance on certain aspects of designing, implementing and operating an ISMS, for example on information security risk management (ISO/IEC 27005).\n\n== History of ISO/IEC 27001 ==\nBS 7799 was a standard originally published by BSI Group in 1995. It was written by the UK government's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and consisted of several parts.\nThe first part, containing the best practices for information security management, was revised in 1998; after a lengthy discussion in the worldwide standards bodies, it was eventually adopted by ISO as ISO/IEC 17799, \"Information Technology - Code of practice for information security management.\" in 2000. ISO/IEC 17799 was then revised in June 2005 and finally incorporated in the ISO 27000 series of standards as ISO/IEC 27002 in July 2007.\nThe second part of BS7799 was first published by BSI in 1999, known as BS 7799 Part 2, titled \"Information Security Management Systems - Specification with guidance for use.\" BS 7799-2 focused on how to implement an Information security management system (ISMS), referring to the information security management structure and controls identified in BS 7799-2. This later became ISO/IEC 27001:2005. BS 7799 Part 2 was adopted by ISO as ISO/IEC 27001 in November 2005.\nBS 7799 Part 3 was published in 2005, covering risk analysis and management. It aligns with ISO/IEC 27001:2005.\nVery little reference or use is made to any of the BS standards in connection with ISO/IEC 27001.\n\n== Certification ==\nAn ISMS may be certified compliant with the ISO/IEC 27001 standard by a number of Accredited Registrars worldwide. Certification against any of the recognized national variants of ISO/IEC 27001 (e.g. JIS Q 27001, the Japanese version) by an accredited certification body is functionally equivalent to certification against ISO/IEC 27001 itself.\nIn some countries, the bodies that verify conformity of management systems to specified standards are called \"certification bodies\", while in others they are commonly referred to as \"registration bodies\", \"assessment and registration bodies\", \"certification/ registration bodies\", and sometimes \"registrars\".\nThe ISO/IEC 27001 certification, like other ISO management system certifications, usually involves a three-stage external audit process defined by ISO/IEC 17021 and ISO/IEC 27006 standards:\n\nStage 1 is a preliminary, informal review of the ISMS.  For example there are checks for the existence and completeness of key documentation, such as the organization's information security policy, Statement of Applicability (SoA), and Risk Treatment Plan (RTP). This stage serves to familiarize the auditors with the organization and vice versa.\nStage 2 is a more detailed and formal compliance audit, independently testing the ISMS against the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 27001. The auditors will seek evidence to confirm that the management system has been properly designed and implemented, and is in fact in operation (for example by confirming that a security committee or similar management body meets regularly to oversee the ISMS). Certification audits are usually conducted by ISO/IEC 27001 Lead Auditors. Passing this stage results in the ISMS being certified compliant with ISO/IEC 27001.\nOngoing involves follow-up reviews or audits to confirm that the organization remains in compliance with the standard. Certification maintenance requires periodic re-assessment audits to confirm that the ISMS continues to operate as specified and intended.

      "context": "ISO/IEC 27001\n\n==Introduction==\nISO/IEC 27001 is an international standard to manage information security. The standard was originally published jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in 2005, revised in 2013, and again most recently in 2022. There are also numerous recognized national variants of the standard.  It details requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS) \u2013 the aim of which is to help organizations make the information assets they hold more secure. Organizations that meet the standard's requirements can choose to be certified by an accredited certification body following successful completion of an audit. The effectiveness of the ISO/IEC 27001 certification process and the overall standard has been addressed in a large-scale study conducted in 2020.\n\n\n\n== How the standard works ==\nMost organizations have a number of information security controls. However, without an information security management system (ISMS), controls tend to be somewhat disorganized and disjointed, having been implemented often as point solutions to specific situations or simply as a matter of convention. Security controls in operation typically address certain aspects of information technology (IT) or data security specifically; leaving non-IT information assets (such as paperwork and proprietary knowledge) less protected on the whole. Moreover, business continuity planning and physical security may be managed quite independently of IT or information security while Human Resources practices may make little reference to the need to define and assign information security roles and responsibilities throughout the organization.\nISO/IEC 27001 requires that management:\n\nSystematically examine the organization's information security risks, taking account of the threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts;\nDesign and implement a coherent and comprehensive suite of information security controls and/or other forms of risk treatment (such as risk avoidance or risk transfer) to address those risks that are deemed unacceptable; and\nAdopt an overarching management process to ensure that the information security controls continue to meet the organization's information security needs on an ongoing basis.What controls will be tested as part of certification to ISO/IEC 27001 is dependent on the certification auditor. This can include any controls that the organisation has deemed to be within the scope of the ISMS and this testing can be to any depth or extent as assessed by the auditor as needed to test that the control has been implemented and is operating effectively.\nManagement determines the scope of the ISMS for certification purposes and may limit it to, say, a single business unit or location. The ISO/IEC 27001 certificate does not necessarily mean the remainder of the organization, outside the scoped area, has an adequate approach to information security management.\nOther standards in the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards provide additional guidance on certain aspects of designing, implementing and operating an ISMS, for example on information security risk management (ISO/IEC 27005).\n\n== History of ISO/IEC 27001 ==\nBS 7799 was a standard originally published by BSI Group in 1995. It was written by the UK government's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and consisted of several parts.\nThe first part, containing the best practices for information security management, was revised in 1998; after a lengthy discussion in the worldwide standards bodies, it was eventually adopted by ISO as ISO/IEC 17799, \"Information Technology - Code of practice for information security management.\" in 2000. ISO/IEC 17799 was then revised in June 2005 and finally incorporated in the ISO 27000 series of standards as ISO/IEC 27002 in July 2007.\nThe second part of BS7799 was first published by BSI in 1999, known as BS 7799 Part 2, titled \"Information Security Management Systems - Specification with guidance for use.\" BS 7799-2 focused on how to implement an Information security management system (ISMS), referring to the information security management structure and controls identified in BS 7799-2. This later became ISO/IEC 27001:2005. BS 7799 Part 2 was adopted by ISO as ISO/IEC 27001 in November 2005.\nBS 7799 Part 3 was published in 2005, covering risk analysis and management. It aligns with ISO/IEC 27001:2005.\nVery little reference or use is made to any of the BS standards in connection with ISO/IEC 27001.\n\n== Certification ==\nAn ISMS may be certified compliant with the ISO/IEC 27001 standard by a number of Accredited Registrars worldwide. Certification against any of the recognized national variants of ISO/IEC 27001 (e.g. JIS Q 27001, the Japanese version) by an accredited certification body is functionally equivalent to certification against ISO/IEC 27001 itself.\nIn some countries, the bodies that verify conformity of management systems to specified standards are called \"certification bodies\", while in others they are commonly referred to as \"registration bodies\", \"assessment and registration bodies\", \"certification/ registration bodies\", and sometimes \"registrars\".\nThe ISO/IEC 27001 certification, like other ISO management system certifications, usually involves a three-stage external audit process defined by ISO/IEC 17021 and ISO/IEC 27006 standards:\n\nStage 1 is a preliminary, informal review of the ISMS.  For example there are checks for the existence and completeness of key documentation, such as the organization's information security policy, Statement of Applicability (SoA), and Risk Treatment Plan (RTP). This stage serves to familiarize the auditors with the organization and vice versa.\nStage 2 is a more detailed and formal compliance audit, independently testing the ISMS against the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 27001. The auditors will seek evidence to confirm that the management system has been properly designed and implemented, and is in fact in operation (for example by confirming that a security committee or similar management body meets regularly to oversee the ISMS). Certification audits are usually conducted by ISO/IEC 27001 Lead Auditors. Passing this stage results in the ISMS being certified compliant with ISO/IEC 27001.\nOngoing involves follow-up reviews or audits to confirm that the organization remains in compliance with the standard. Certification maintenance requires periodic re-assessment audits to confirm that the ISMS continues to operate as specified and intended. These should happen at least annually but (by agreement with management) are often conducted more frequently, particularly while the ISMS is still maturing.",

    "instruction": "Market for zero-day exploits\n\n==Introduction==\nThe market for zero-day exploits is commercial activity related to the trafficking of software exploits.\nSoftware vulnerabilities and \"exploits\" are used to get remote access to both stored information and information generated in real time. When most people use the same software, as is the case in most of countries today given the monopolistic nature of internet content and service providers, one specific vulnerability can be used against thousands if not millions of people. In this context, criminals have become interested in such vulnerabilities. A 2014 report from McAfee's Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates that the cost of cybercrime and cyberespionage is somewhere around $160 billion per year. Worldwide, countries have appointed public institutions to deal with this issue, but they will likely conflict with the interest of their own government to access people's information in order to prevent crime. As a result, both national security agencies and criminals hide certain software vulnerabilities from both users and the original developer. This type of vulnerability is known as a zero-day exploit.\nMuch has been said in academia and regular media about the regulation of zero-day exploits in the market. However, it is very difficult to reach a consensus because most definitions for zero-day exploits are rather vague or not applicable, as one can only define the use of certain software as malware after it has been used. In addition, there is a conflict of interest within the operations of the state that could prevent a regulation that can make mandatory the disclosure of zero-days. Governments face a trade-off between protecting their citizens' privacy through the reporting of vulnerabilities to private companies on one hand and undermining the communication technologies used by their targets\u2014who also threaten the security of the public\u2014on the other. The protection of national security through exploitation of software vulnerabilities unknown to both companies and the public is an ultimate resource for security agencies but also compromises the safety of every single user because any third party, including criminal organizations, could be making use of the same resource. Hence, only users and private firms have incentives to minimize the risks associated with zero-day exploits; the former to avoid an invasion of privacy and the latter to reduce the costs of data breaches. These include legal processes, costs related to the development of solutions to fix or \"patch\" the original vulnerability in the software and costs associated with the loss of confidence of clients in the product.\n\n== Description ==\nAblon, Libicki and Golay have explained to a great extent the inner workings of the zero-day market. The main findings can be separated into five components: Commodity, Currency, Marketplace, Supply and Demand. These components and their relationship with pricing will be described. The definition given to the demand component will also be challenged because it is paramount to understand the nature of the markets (i.e. white, gray and black) and its regulation or lack thereof.\n\n\n*** Commodity ***\nExploits are digital products, which means that they are information goods with near-zero marginal production costs. However, they are atypical information goods. Unlike e-books or digital videos, they do not lose their value because they are easy to replicate but due to the fact that once they are exposed, the original developer will \"patch\" the vulnerability, decreasing the value of the commodity.\n\nThe value will not go to zero for two reasons: (1) the distribution of the patch is asymmetric and (2) developers could use the original bug to create a variant at a decreased cost. They are also atypical because they are time-sensitive commodities. Companies are updating their software on a regular basis and a patch is only useful during the lapse between versions; sometimes a vulnerability can be corrected without any external report. Third, even in confidential transactions, the use of the exploit itself can create a dysfunction on the user-end, exposing the vulnerability and leading to its loss of value. In this sense, exploits are non-excludable but they can or can not be non-rivalrous, as the more users use a zero day exploit after a certain point, the more visible its impact will be to the company in question. This could result in the company being more likely to patch the exploit, resulting in a limited period of time where the exploit is available for all users.\n\n\n*** Currency ***\nIn most cases, transactions are typically designed to protect the identity of at least one of the parties involved in the exchange. While this is dependent on the type of market\u2014white markets can use traceable money\u2014most purchases are made with stolen digital funds (credit cards) and cryptocurrencies. While the latter has been the dominant trend in the last few years, prices in the gray market are set in dollars, as shown by the leaks of Hacking Team's email archive.\n\n\n*** Marketplace ***\n\nClassically, black markets\u2014like illegal weapons or narcotics\u2014require a huge network of trusted parties to perform the transactions of deal-making, document forgery, financial transfers and illicit transport, among others. As it is very difficult to enforce any legal agreement within these networks, many criminal organizations recruit members close to home. This proximity element increases the cost of transaction as more intermediaries are required for transnational transactions, decreasing the overall profit of the original seller.\nZero-days, on the other hand, are virtual products and can be easily sold without intermediaries over the internet as available technologies are strong enough to provide anonymity at a very low cost. Even if there is a need for intermediaries, \"unwitting data mules\" can be used to avoid any evidence of wrongdoing. This is why the black market is so lucrative compared to gray markets. Gray markets, which involve transactions with public institutions in charge of national security, usually require the use of third parties to hide the traces of their transactions. The Hacking Team archive, for example, contains alleged contracts with the Ecuadorian National Secretariat of Intelligence where they used two intermediaries: Robotec and Theola. In the same archive, it is said that third-party companies Cicom and Robotec negotiated the contracts on behalf of the FBI and DEA respectively. It is less likely that white markets face the same problem as it is not in their interest to hide the transaction, it is quite the opposite because companies actively promote the use of their new patches.\n\n\n*** Supply ***\nThe supply chain is complex and involves multiple actors organized by hierarchies, where administrators sit at the top, followed by the technical experts. Next are intermediaries, brokers and vendors which can or can not be sophisticated, finally followed by witting mules. Within this chain of command, one can find multiple products. While zero-day exploits can be \"found\" or developed by subject matter experts only, other exploits can be easily commercialized by almost any person willing to enter the black market. There are two reasons for this. First, some devices use outdated or deprecated software and can be easily targeted by exploits that otherwise would be completely useless. Second, these \"half-day exploits\" can be used through graphical interfaces and learned through freely available tutorials, which means that very little expertise is required to enter the market as a seller.\nThe coexistence of zero-day and half-day markets influences the resilience of the black market, as developers keep moving towards the more sophisticated end. While take-downs on high organized crime has increased, the suppliers are easily replaced with people in lower levels of the pyramid. It can take less than a day to find a new provider after a take-down operation that can easily last months.\nGetting to the top, however, requires personal connections and a good reputation, in this the digital black market is no different from the physical one. Half-day exploits are usually traded in more easily accessible places but zero-days often require \"double-blind\" auctions and the use of multiple layers of encryption to evade law enforcement. This can not be done in forums or boards, hence these transactions occur in extremely vetted spaces.\n\n\n*** Demand ***\nWho buys zero-day exploits defines the kind of market we are dealing with. Afidler differentiates between white, gray and black markets following the market-sizing methodology from Harvard Business School as a guide. Here they differentiate between white markets, gray markets and black markets.\nWhite markets are those where the original developers reward security researchers for reporting vulnerabilities. On average, prices reported until 2014 were less than ten thousands of dollars but special offers up to $100,000 were made to certain vulnerabilities based on the type, criticality, and nature of the affected software. Fourteen percent of all Microsoft, Apple and Adobe vulnerabilities in the past ten years came through white market programs.Criminals buy in the black market; however, governments can be occasional buyers if their offer can not be satisfied in the gray market or if they find impediments to acquire zero-days due to international regulations. Hacking Team states in their website that they \"do not sell products to governments or to countries blacklisted by the U.S., EU, UN, NATO or ASEAN\", although they have been found infringing their own policy. Prices are usually 10\u2013100 times higher in this market when compared to the white market and this changes depending on the location of the buyer; The United States being the place where the best prices are offered. Potential sellers which are not allowed to sell in specific territories, like Cuba and North Korea in the case of the U.S., are likely to operate in the black market as well.\nGray markets buyers include clients from the private sector, governments and brokers who resell vulnerabilities. The information regarding these markets is only available through requests of confidential information from governments, where the price is usually redacted for safety purposes, and information leaked from both national security agencies and private companies (i.e. FinFisher and Hacking Team).\nTsyrklevich reported on the transactions made by Hacking Team. To date, this represents the best evidence available on the inner workings of the gray market. However, it is likely to be the case that some of these procedures are applied in both white and black markets as well:\n\nBuyers follow standard technology purchasing practices around testing, delivery, and acceptance. Warranty and requirements negotiations become necessary in purchasing a product intrinsically predicated on the existence of information asymmetry between the buyer and the seller. Requirements\u2014like targeted software configurations\u2014are important to negotiate ahead of time because adding support for new targets might be impossible or not worth the effort. Likewise warranty provisions for buyers are common so they can minimize risk by parceling out payments over a set time frame and terminating payments early if the vulnerability is patched before that time frame is complete. Payments are typically made after a 0day exploit has been delivered and tested against requirements, necessitating sellers to trust buyers to act in good faith. Similarly, buyers purchasing exploits must trust the sellers not to expose the vulnerability or share it with others if it's sold on an exclusive basis.\n\n== Controversies ==\nTypically the parties opposed to gray markets are the retailers of the item in the market as it damages its profits and reputation. As a result, they usually pressure the original manufacturer to adjust the official channels of distribution. The state also plays an important role enforcing penalties in the case of law infringement. However, the zero-day exploit market is atypical and the way it operates is closer to the workings of the black market. Brokers and bounty programs, which could be seen as retailers of zero-days, have no control whatsoever on the original producers of the \"bad\" as they are independently discovered by different, and often anonymous, actors. It is not in their interest to change the channel of distribution as they can profit from both the white and gray markets, having much less risk in the former.\nStates, which usually complement the labour of the original manufacturers to restrict gray markets, play a different role in the zero-day market as they are regular purchasers of exploits. Given the secretive nature of information security, it is not in their interest to disclose information on software vulnerabilities as their interest is, in this case, aligned with that of the criminals who seek to infiltrate devices and acquire information of specific targets. It can be argued that the presence of intelligence agencies as consumers of this \"bad\" could increase the price of zero-days even further as legitimate markets provide bargaining power to black-market sellers.Finally, private companies are unwilling to raise the prices of their rewards to those levels reached in the gray and black markets arguing that they are not sustainable for defensive markets. Previous studies have shown that reward programs are more cost-effective for private firms as compared to hiring in-house security researchers, but if the prize of rewards keeps increasing that might not be the case anymore.\nIn 2015, Zerodium, a new start-up focused on the acquisition of \"high-risk vulnerabilities\", announced their new bounty program. They published the formats required for vulnerability submissions, their criteria to determine prices\u2014the popularity and complexity of the affected software, and the quality of the submitted exploit\u2014and the prices themselves. This represents a mixture of the transparency offered by traditional vulnerability reward program and the high rewards offered in the gray and black markets. Software developer companies perceived this new approach as a threat, primarily due to the fact that very high bounties could cause developer and tester employees to leave their day jobs. Its effects on the market, however, are yet to be defined.\nThe NSA was criticized for buying up and stockpiling zero-day vulnerabilities, keeping them secret and developing mainly offensive capabilities instead of helping patch vulnerabilities.\n\nBased on the above text, answer the questions.

    "output": "The value of exploits as digital products is affected by their replicability, the distribution of patches, the time-sensitivity of the vulnerability, and the potential impact on user-end dysfunction.

On average, prices reported until 2014 were less than ten thousands of dollars, but special offers up to $100,000 were made to certain vulnerabilities based on the type, criticality, and nature of the affected software. Fourteen percent of all Microsoft, Apple and Adobe vulnerabilities in the past ten years came through white market programs.Answer: Criminals acquire zero-day exploits in the black market from brokers and bounty programs. The prices of these exploits are usually 10-100 times higher in this market when compared to the white market, and this changes depending on the location of the buyer. The best prices are offered in the United States, and potential sellers which are not allowed to sell in specific territories, like Cuba and North Korea in the case of the U.S., are likely to operate in the black market as well.Answer: Buyers in the gray market for zero-day exploits include clients from the private sector, governments, and brokers who resell vulnerabilities. The information regarding these markets is only available through requests of confidential information from governments, where the price is usually redacted for safety purposes, and information leaked from both national security agencies and private companies.Answer: Very high bounties offered by companies like Zerodium can cause developer and tester employees to leave their day jobs, leading to a decrease in the number of vulnerabilities reported to private companies and an increase in the number of vulnerabilities exploited by criminals.Answer: The market for zero-day exploits is atypical and the way it operates is closer to the workings of the black market. Brokers and bounty programs, which could be seen as retailers of zero-days, have no control whatsoever on the original producers of the \"bad\" as they are independently discovered by different, and often anonymous, actors. It is not in their interest to change the channel of distribution as they can profit from both the white and gray markets, having much less risk in the former.Answer: The secretive nature of information security means that it is not in the interest of states to disclose information on software vulnerabilities. This aligns their interests with those of criminals who seek to infiltrate devices and acquire information of specific targets. The presence of intelligence agencies as consumers of this \"bad\" can increase the price of zero-days even further as legitimate markets provide bargaining power to black-market sellers.",

      "context": "Market for zero-day exploits\n\n==Introduction==\nThe market for zero-day exploits is commercial activity related to the trafficking of software exploits.\nSoftware vulnerabilities and \"exploits\" are used to get remote access to both stored information and information generated in real time. When most people use the same software, as is the case in most of countries today given the monopolistic nature of internet content and service providers, one specific vulnerability can be used against thousands if not millions of people. In this context, criminals have become interested in such vulnerabilities. A 2014 report from McAfee's Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates that the cost of cybercrime and cyberespionage is somewhere around $160 billion per year. Worldwide, countries have appointed public institutions to deal with this issue, but they will likely conflict with the interest of their own government to access people's information in order to prevent crime. As a result, both national security agencies and criminals hide certain software vulnerabilities from both users and the original developer. This type of vulnerability is known as a zero-day exploit.\nMuch has been said in academia and regular media about the regulation of zero-day exploits in the market. However, it is very difficult to reach a consensus because most definitions for zero-day exploits are rather vague or not applicable, as one can only define the use of certain software as malware after it has been used. In addition, there is a conflict of interest within the operations of the state that could prevent a regulation that can make mandatory the disclosure of zero-days. Governments face a trade-off between protecting their citizens' privacy through the reporting of vulnerabilities to private companies on one hand and undermining the communication technologies used by their targets\u2014who also threaten the security of the public\u2014on the other. The protection of national security through exploitation of software vulnerabilities unknown to both companies and the public is an ultimate resource for security agencies but also compromises the safety of every single user because any third party, including criminal organizations, could be making use of the same resource. Hence, only users and private firms have incentives to minimize the risks associated with zero-day exploits; the former to avoid an invasion of privacy and the latter to reduce the costs of data breaches. These include legal processes, costs related to the development of solutions to fix or \"patch\" the original vulnerability in the software and costs associated with the loss of confidence of clients in the product.\n\n== Description ==\nAblon, Libicki and Golay have explained to a great extent the inner workings of the zero-day market. The main findings can be separated into five components: Commodity, Currency, Marketplace, Supply and Demand. These components and their relationship with pricing will be described. The definition given to the demand component will also be challenged because it is paramount to understand the nature of the markets (i.e. white, gray and black) and its regulation or lack thereof.\n\n\n*** Commodity ***\nExploits are digital products, which means that they are information goods with near-zero marginal production costs. However, they are atypical information goods. Unlike e-books or digital videos, they do not lose their value because they are easy to replicate but due to the fact that once they are exposed, the original developer will \"patch\" the vulnerability, decreasing the value of the commodity.\n\nThe value will not go to zero for two reasons: (1) the distribution of the patch is asymmetric and (2) developers could use the original bug to create a variant at a decreased cost. They are also atypical because they are time-sensitive commodities. Companies are updating their software on a regular basis and a patch is only useful during the lapse between versions; sometimes a vulnerability can be corrected without any external report. Third, even in confidential transactions, the use of the exploit itself can create a dysfunction on the user-end, exposing the vulnerability and leading to its loss of value. In this sense, exploits are non-excludable but they can or can not be non-rivalrous, as the more users use a zero day exploit after a certain point, the more visible its impact will be to the company in question. This could result in the company being more likely to patch the exploit, resulting in a limited period of time where the exploit is available for all users.\n\n\n*** Currency ***\nIn most cases, transactions are typically designed to protect the identity of at least one of the parties involved in the exchange. While this is dependent on the type of market\u2014white markets can use traceable money\u2014most purchases are made with stolen digital funds (credit cards) and cryptocurrencies. While the latter has been the dominant trend in the last few years, prices in the gray market are set in dollars, as shown by the leaks of Hacking Team's email archive.\n\n\n*** Marketplace ***\n\nClassically, black markets\u2014like illegal weapons or narcotics\u2014require a huge network of trusted parties to perform the transactions of deal-making, document forgery, financial transfers and illicit transport, among others. As it is very difficult to enforce any legal agreement within these networks, many criminal organizations recruit members close to home. This proximity element increases the cost of transaction as more intermediaries are required for transnational transactions, decreasing the overall profit of the original seller.\nZero-days, on the other hand, are virtual products and can be easily sold without intermediaries over the internet as available technologies are strong enough to provide anonymity at a very low cost. Even if there is a need for intermediaries, \"unwitting data mules\" can be used to avoid any evidence of wrongdoing. This is why the black market is so lucrative compared to gray markets. Gray markets, which involve transactions with public institutions in charge of national security, usually require the use of third parties to hide the traces of their transactions. The Hacking Team archive, for example, contains alleged contracts with the Ecuadorian National Secretariat of Intelligence where they used two intermediaries: Robotec and Theola. In the same archive, it is said that third-party companies Cicom and Robotec negotiated the contracts on behalf of the FBI and DEA respectively. It is less likely that white markets face the same problem as it is not in their interest to hide the transaction, it is quite the opposite because companies actively promote the use of their new patches.\n\n\n*** Supply ***\nThe supply chain is complex and involves multiple actors organized by hierarchies, where administrators sit at the top, followed by the technical experts. Next are intermediaries, brokers and vendors which can or can not be sophisticated, finally followed by witting mules. Within this chain of command, one can find multiple products. While zero-day exploits can be \"found\" or developed by subject matter experts only, other exploits can be easily commercialized by almost any person willing to enter the black market. There are two reasons for this. First, some devices use outdated or deprecated software and can be easily targeted by exploits that otherwise would be completely useless. Second, these \"half-day exploits\" can be used through graphical interfaces and learned through freely available tutorials, which means that very little expertise is required to enter the market as a seller.\nThe coexistence of zero-day and half-day markets influences the resilience of the black market, as developers keep moving towards the more sophisticated end. While take-downs on high organized crime has increased, the suppliers are easily replaced with people in lower levels of the pyramid. It can take less than a day to find a new provider after a take-down operation that can easily last months.\nGetting to the top, however, requires personal connections and a good reputation, in this the digital black market is no different from the physical one. Half-day exploits are usually traded in more easily accessible places but zero-days often require \"double-blind\" auctions and the use of multiple layers of encryption to evade law enforcement. This can not be done in forums or boards, hence these transactions occur in extremely vetted spaces.\n\n\n*** Demand ***\nWho buys zero-day exploits defines the kind of market we are dealing with. Afidler differentiates between white, gray and black markets following the market-sizing methodology from Harvard Business School as a guide. Here they differentiate between white markets, gray markets and black markets.\nWhite markets are those where the original developers reward security researchers for reporting vulnerabilities. On average, prices reported until 2014 were less than ten thousands of dollars but special offers up to $100,000 were made to certain vulnerabilities based on the type, criticality, and nature of the affected software. Fourteen percent of all Microsoft, Apple and Adobe vulnerabilities in the past ten years came through white market programs.Criminals buy in the black market; however, governments can be occasional buyers if their offer can not be satisfied in the gray market or if they find impediments to acquire zero-days due to international regulations. Hacking Team states in their website that they \"do not sell products to governments or to countries blacklisted by the U.S., EU, UN, NATO or ASEAN\", although they have been found infringing their own policy. Prices are usually 10\u2013100 times higher in this market when compared to the white market and this changes depending on the location of the buyer; The United States being the place where the best prices are offered. Potential sellers which are not allowed to sell in specific territories, like Cuba and North Korea in the case of the U.S., are likely to operate in the black market as well.\nGray markets buyers include clients from the private sector, governments and brokers who resell vulnerabilities. The information regarding these markets is only available through requests of confidential information from governments, where the price is usually redacted for safety purposes, and information leaked from both national security agencies and private companies (i.e. FinFisher and Hacking Team).\nTsyrklevich reported on the transactions made by Hacking Team. To date, this represents the best evidence available on the inner workings of the gray market. However, it is likely to be the case that some of these procedures are applied in both white and black markets as well:\n\nBuyers follow standard technology purchasing practices around testing, delivery, and acceptance. Warranty and requirements negotiations become necessary in purchasing a product intrinsically predicated on the existence of information asymmetry between the buyer and the seller. Requirements\u2014like targeted software configurations\u2014are important to negotiate ahead of time because adding support for new targets might be impossible or not worth the effort. Likewise warranty provisions for buyers are common so they can minimize risk by parceling out payments over a set time frame and terminating payments early if the vulnerability is patched before that time frame is complete. Payments are typically made after a 0day exploit has been delivered and tested against requirements, necessitating sellers to trust buyers to act in good faith. Similarly, buyers purchasing exploits must trust the sellers not to expose the vulnerability or share it with others if it's sold on an exclusive basis.\n\n== Controversies ==\nTypically the parties opposed to gray markets are the retailers of the item in the market as it damages its profits and reputation. As a result, they usually pressure the original manufacturer to adjust the official channels of distribution. The state also plays an important role enforcing penalties in the case of law infringement. However, the zero-day exploit market is atypical and the way it operates is closer to the workings of the black market. Brokers and bounty programs, which could be seen as retailers of zero-days, have no control whatsoever on the original producers of the \"bad\" as they are independently discovered by different, and often anonymous, actors. It is not in their interest to change the channel of distribution as they can profit from both the white and gray markets, having much less risk in the former.\nStates, which usually complement the labour of the original manufacturers to restrict gray markets, play a different role in the zero-day market as they are regular purchasers of exploits. Given the secretive nature of information security, it is not in their interest to disclose information on software vulnerabilities as their interest is, in this case, aligned with that of the criminals who seek to infiltrate devices and acquire information of specific targets. It can be argued that the presence of intelligence agencies as consumers of this \"bad\" could increase the price of zero-days even further as legitimate markets provide bargaining power to black-market sellers.Finally, private companies are unwilling to raise the prices of their rewards to those levels reached in the gray and black markets arguing that they are not sustainable for defensive markets. Previous studies have shown that reward programs are more cost-effective for private firms as compared to hiring in-house security researchers, but if the prize of rewards keeps increasing that might not be the case anymore.\nIn 2015, Zerodium, a new start-up focused on the acquisition of \"high-risk vulnerabilities\", announced their new bounty program. They published the formats required for vulnerability submissions, their criteria to determine prices\u2014the popularity and complexity of the affected software, and the quality of the submitted exploit\u2014and the prices themselves. This represents a mixture of the transparency offered by traditional vulnerability reward program and the high rewards offered in the gray and black markets. Software developer companies perceived this new approach as a threat, primarily due to the fact that very high bounties could cause developer and tester employees to leave their day jobs. Its effects on the market, however, are yet to be defined.\nThe NSA was criticized for buying up and stockpiling zero-day vulnerabilities, keeping them secret and developing mainly offensive capabilities instead of helping patch vulnerabilities.",

      "answers": "The value of exploits as digital products is affected by their replicability, the distribution of patches, the time-sensitivity of the vulnerability, and the potential impact on user-end dysfunction. Once a vulnerability is exposed, the value decreases due to the developer patching the vulnerability, but it does not go to zero because of the potential for creating variants at a decreased cost and the asymmetric distribution of patches.Answer: Transactions in the black market for zero-day exploits are typically designed to protect the identity of at least one of the parties involved.

    "instruction": "Pseudorandom generator\n\n==Introduction==\nIn theoretical computer science and cryptography, a pseudorandom generator (PRG) for a class of statistical tests is a deterministic procedure that maps a random seed to a longer pseudorandom string such that no statistical test in the class can distinguish between the output of the generator and the uniform distribution. The random seed itself is typically a short binary string drawn from the uniform distribution.\nMany different classes of statistical tests have been considered in the literature, among them the class of all Boolean circuits of a given size.\nIt is not known whether good pseudorandom generators for this class exist, but it is known that their existence is in a certain sense equivalent to (unproven) circuit lower bounds in computational complexity theory.\nHence the construction of pseudorandom generators for the class of Boolean circuits of a given size rests on currently unproven hardness assumptions.\n\n== Definition ==\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            A\n\n== In cryptography ==\n\nIn cryptography, the class \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}}\n   usually consists of all circuits of size polynomial in the input and with a single bit output, and one is interested in designing pseudorandom generators that are computable by a polynomial-time algorithm and whose bias is negligible in the circuit size.\nThese pseudorandom generators are sometimes called cryptographically secure pseudorandom generators (CSPRGs).\nIt is not known if cryptographically secure pseudorandom generators exist.\nProving that they exist is difficult since their existence implies P \u2260 NP, which is widely believed but a famously open problem.\nThe existence of cryptographically secure pseudorandom generators is widely believed. This is because it has been proven that pseudorandom generators can be constructed from any one-way function which are believed to exist. Pseudorandom generators are necessary for many applications in cryptography.\nThe pseudorandom generator theorem shows that cryptographically secure pseudorandom generators exist if and only if one-way functions exist.\n\n\n*** Uses ***\nPseudorandom generators have numerous applications in cryptography. For instance, pseudorandom generators provide an efficient analog of one-time pads. It is well known that in order to encrypt a message m in a way that the cipher text provides no information on the plaintext, the key k used must be random over strings of length |m|. Perfectly secure encryption is very costly in terms of key length. Key length can be significantly reduced using a pseudorandom generator if perfect security is replaced by semantic security. Common constructions of stream ciphers are based on pseudorandom generators.\nPseudorandom generators may also be used to construct symmetric key cryptosystems, where a large number of messages can be safely encrypted under the same key. Such a construction can be based on a pseudorandom function family, which generalizes the notion of a pseudorandom generator.\nIn the 1980s, simulations in physics began to use pseudorandom generators to produce sequences with billions of elements, and by the late 1980s, evidence had developed that a few common generators gave incorrect results in such cases as phase transition properties of the 3D Ising model and shapes of diffusion-limited aggregates. Then in the 1990s, various idealizations of physics simulations\u2014based on random walks, correlation functions, localization of eigenstates, etc., were used as tests of pseudorandom generators.\n\n\n*** Testing ***\nNIST announced SP800-22 Randomness tests to test whether a pseudorandom generator produces high quality random bits. Yongge Wang showed that NIST testing is not enough to detect weak pseudorandom generators and developed statistical distance based testing technique LILtest.\n\n== For derandomization ==\nA main application of pseudorandom generators lies in the derandomization of computation that relies on randomness, without corrupting the result of the computation.\nPhysical computers are deterministic machines, and obtaining true randomness can be a challenge.\nPseudorandom generators can be used to efficiently simulate randomized algorithms with using little or no randomness.\nIn such applications, the class \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}}\n   describes the randomized algorithm or class of randomized algorithms that one wants to simulate, and the goal is to design an \"efficiently computable\" pseudorandom generator against \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}}\n   whose seed length is as short as possible.\nIf a full derandomization is desired, a completely deterministic simulation proceeds by replacing the random input to the randomized algorithm with the pseudorandom string produced by the pseudorandom generator.\nThe simulation does this for all possible seeds and averages the output of the various runs of the randomized algorithm in a suitable way.\n\n\n*** Constructions ***\n\n\n**** For polynomial time ****\nA fundamental question in computational complexity theory is whether all polynomial time randomized algorithms for decision problems can be deterministically simulated in polynomial time.  The existence of such a simulation would imply that BPP\n\n== Limitations on probability ==\nThe pseudorandom generators used in cryptography and universal algorithmic derandomization have not been proven to exist, although their existence is widely believed.  Proofs for their existence would imply proofs of lower bounds on the circuit complexity of certain explicit functions.

The random seed itself is typically a short binary string drawn from the uniform distribution.\nMany different classes of statistical tests have been considered in the literature, among them the class of all Boolean circuits of a given size.\nIt is not known whether good pseudorandom generators for this class exist, but it is known that their existence is in a certain sense equivalent to (unproven) circuit lower bounds in computational complexity theory.\nHence the construction of pseudorandom generators for the class of Boolean circuits of a given size rests on currently unproven hardness assumptions.\n\n== Definition ==\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            A\n\n== In cryptography ==\n\nIn cryptography, the class \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}}\n   usually consists of all circuits of size polynomial in the input and with a single bit output, and one is interested in designing pseudorandom generators that are computable by a polynomial-time algorithm and whose bias is negligible in the circuit size.\nThese pseudorandom generators are sometimes called cryptographically secure pseudorandom generators (CSPRGs).\nIt is not known if cryptographically secure pseudorandom generators exist.\nProving that they exist is difficult since their existence implies P \u2260 NP, which is widely believed but a famously open problem.\nThe existence of cryptographically secure pseudorandom generators is widely believed. This is because it has been proven that pseudorandom generators can be constructed from any one-way function which are believed to exist. Pseudorandom generators are necessary for many applications in cryptography.\nThe pseudorandom generator theorem shows that cryptographically secure pseudorandom generators exist if and only if one-way functions exist.\n\n\n*** Uses ***\nPseudorandom generators have numerous applications in cryptography. For instance, pseudorandom generators provide an efficient analog of one-time pads. It is well known that in order to encrypt a message m in a way that the cipher text provides no information on the plaintext, the key k used must be random over strings of length |m|. Perfectly secure encryption is very costly in terms of key length. Key length can be significantly reduced using a pseudorandom generator if perfect security is replaced by semantic security. Common constructions of stream ciphers are based on pseudorandom generators.\nPseudorandom generators may also be used to construct symmetric key cryptosystems, where a large number of messages can be safely encrypted under the same key. Such a construction can be based on a pseudorandom function family, which generalizes the notion of a pseudorandom generator.\nIn the 1980s, simulations in physics began to use pseudorandom generators to produce sequences with billions of elements, and by the late 1980s, evidence had developed that a few common generators gave incorrect results in such cases as phase transition properties of the 3D Ising model and shapes of diffusion-limited aggregates. Then in the 1990s, various idealizations of physics simulations\u2014based on random walks, correlation functions, localization of eigenstates, etc., were used as tests of pseudorandom generators.\n\n\n*** Testing ***\nNIST announced SP800-22 Randomness tests to test whether a pseudorandom generator produces high quality random bits. Yongge Wang showed that NIST testing is not enough to detect weak pseudorandom generators and developed statistical distance based testing technique LILtest.\n\n== For derandomization ==\nA main application of pseudorandom generators lies in the derandomization of computation that relies on randomness, without corrupting the result of the computation.\nPhysical computers are deterministic machines, and obtaining true randomness can be a challenge.\nPseudorandom generators can be used to efficiently simulate randomized algorithms with using little or no randomness.\nIn such applications, the class \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}}\n   describes the randomized algorithm or class of randomized algorithms that one wants to simulate, and the goal is to design an \"efficiently computable\" pseudorandom generator against \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}}\n   whose seed length is as short as possible.\nIf a full derandomization is desired, a completely deterministic simulation proceeds by replacing the random input to the randomized algorithm with the pseudorandom string produced by the pseudorandom generator.\nThe simulation does this for all possible seeds and averages the output of the various runs of the randomized algorithm in a suitable way.\n\n\n*** Constructions ***\n\n\n**** For polynomial time ****\nA fundamental question in computational complexity theory is whether all polynomial time randomized algorithms for decision problems can be deterministically simulated in polynomial time.  The existence of such a simulation would imply that BPP\n\n== Limitations on probability ==\nThe pseudorandom generators used in cryptography and universal algorithmic derandomization have not been proven to exist, although their existence is widely believed.  Proofs for their existence would imply proofs of lower bounds on the circuit complexity of certain explicit functions. Such circuit lower bounds cannot be proved in the framework of natural proofs assuming the existence of stronger variants of cryptographic pseudorandom generators.",

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nRSA SecurID\n\n==Introduction==\nRSA SecurID, formerly referred to as SecurID, is a mechanism developed by RSA for performing two-factor authentication for a user to a network resource.\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe RSA SecurID authentication mechanism consists of a \"token\"\u2014either hardware (e.g. a key fob) or software (a soft token)\u2014which is assigned to a computer user and which creates an authentication code at fixed intervals (usually 60 seconds) using a built-in clock and the card's factory-encoded almost random key (known as the \"seed\"). The seed is different for each token, and is loaded into the corresponding RSA SecurID server (RSA Authentication Manager, formerly ACE/Server) as the tokens are purchased. On-demand tokens are also available, which provide a tokencode via email or SMS delivery, eliminating the need to provision a token to the user.\nThe token hardware is designed to be tamper-resistant to deter reverse engineering. When software implementations of the same algorithm (\"software tokens\") appeared on the market, public code had been developed by the security community allowing a user to emulate RSA SecurID in software, but only if they have access to a current RSA SecurID code, and the original 64-bit RSA SecurID seed file introduced to the server. Later, the 128-bit RSA SecurID algorithm was published as part of an open source library. In the RSA SecurID authentication scheme, the seed record is the secret key used to generate one-time passwords.  Newer versions also feature a USB connector, which allows the token to be used as a smart card-like device for securely storing certificates.A user authenticating to a network resource\u2014say, a dial-in server or a firewall\u2014needs to enter both a personal identification number and the number being displayed at that moment on their RSA SecurID token. Though increasingly rare, some systems using RSA SecurID disregard PIN implementation altogether, and rely on password/RSA SecurID code combinations. The server, which also has a real-time clock and a database of valid cards with the associated seed records, authenticates a user by computing what number the token is supposed to be showing at that moment in time and checking this against what the user entered.\nOn older versions of SecurID, a \"duress PIN\" may be used\u2014an alternate code which creates a security event log showing that a user was forced to enter their PIN, while still providing transparent authentication. Using the duress PIN would allow one successful authentication, after which the token will automatically be disabled. The \"duress PIN\" feature has been deprecated and is not available on currently supported versions.\nWhile the RSA SecurID system adds a layer of security to a network, difficulty can occur if the authentication server's clock becomes out of sync with the clock built into the authentication tokens. Normal token clock drift is accounted for automatically by the server by adjusting a stored \"drift\" value over time. If the out of sync condition is not a result of normal hardware token clock drift, correcting the synchronization of the Authentication Manager server clock with the out of sync token (or tokens) can be accomplished in several different ways. If the server clock had drifted and the administrator made a change to the system clock, the tokens can either be resynchronized one-by-one, or the stored drift values adjusted manually. The drift can be done on individual tokens or in bulk using a command line utility.\nRSA Security has pushed forth an initiative called \"Ubiquitous Authentication\", partnering with device manufacturers such as IronKey, SanDisk, Motorola, Freescale Semiconductor, Redcannon, Broadcom, and BlackBerry to embed the SecurID software into everyday devices such as USB flash drives and cell phones, to reduce cost and the number of objects that the user must carry.\n\n== Theoretical vulnerabilities ==\nToken codes are easily stolen, because no mutual-authentication exists (anything that can steal a password can also steal a token code).  This is significant, since it is the principal threat most users believe they are solving with this technology.\nThe simplest practical vulnerability with any password container is losing the special key device or the activated smart phone with the integrated key function. Such vulnerability cannot be healed with any single token container device within the preset time span of activation. All further consideration presumes loss prevention, e.g. by additional electronic leash or body sensor and alarm.\nWhile RSA SecurID tokens offer a level of protection against password replay attacks, they are not designed to offer protection against man in the middle type attacks when used alone.  If the attacker manages to block the authorized user from authenticating to the server until the next token code will be valid, he will be able to log into the server. Risk-based analytics (RBA), a new feature in the latest version (8.0) provides significant protection against this type of attack if the user is enabled and authenticating on an agent enabled for RBA. RSA SecurID does not prevent man in the browser (MitB) based attacks.\nSecurID authentication server tries to prevent password sniffing and simultaneous login by declining both authentication requests, if two valid credentials are presented within a given time frame. This has been documented in an unverified post by John G. Brainard. If the attacker removes from the user the ability to authenticate however, the SecurID server will assume that it is the user who is actually authenticating and hence will allow the attacker's authentication through. Under this attack model, the system security can be improved using encryption/authentication mechanisms such as SSL.\nAlthough soft tokens may be more convenient, critics indicate that the tamper-resistant property of hard tokens is unmatched in soft token implementations, which could allow seed record secret keys to be duplicated and user impersonation to occur.\nHard tokens, on the other hand, can be physically stolen (or acquired via social engineering) from end users. The small form factor makes hard token theft much more viable than laptop/desktop scanning. A user will typically wait more than one day before reporting the device as missing, giving the attacker plenty of time to breach the unprotected system. This could only occur, however, if the users UserID and PIN are also known. Risk-based analytics can provide additional protection against the use of lost or stolen tokens, even if the users UserID and PIN are known by the attackers.\nBatteries go flat periodically, requiring complicated replacement and re-enrollment procedures.\n\n== Reception and competing products ==\nAs of 2003, RSA SecurID commanded over 70% of the two-factor authentication market and 25 million devices have been produced to date. A number of competitors, such as VASCO, make similar security tokens, mostly based on the open OATH HOTP standard. A study on OTP published by Gartner in 2010 mentions OATH and SecurID as the only competitors.Other network authentication systems, such as OPIE and S/Key (sometimes more generally known as OTP, as S/Key is a trademark of Telcordia Technologies, formerly Bellcore) attempt to provide the \"something you have\" level of authentication without requiring a hardware token.\n\n== March 2011 system compromise ==\nOn 17 March 2011, RSA announced that they had been victims of \"an extremely sophisticated cyber attack\". Concerns were raised specifically in reference to the SecurID system, saying that \"this information could potentially be used to reduce the effectiveness of a current two-factor authentication implementation\". However, their formal Form 8-K submission indicated that they did not believe the breach would have a \"material impact on its financial results\". The breach cost EMC, the parent company of RSA, $66.3 million, which was taken as a charge against second quarter earnings. It covered costs to investigate the attack, harden its IT systems and monitor transactions of corporate customers, according to EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer David Goulden, in a conference call with analysts.The breach into RSA's network was carried out by hackers who sent phishing emails to two targeted, small groups of employees of RSA.  Attached to the email was a Microsoft Excel file containing malware. When an RSA employee opened the Excel file, the malware exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash. The exploit allowed the hackers to use the Poison Ivy RAT to gain control of machines and access servers in RSA's network.There are some hints that the breach involved the theft of RSA's database mapping token serial numbers to the secret token \"seeds\" that were injected to make each one unique. Reports of RSA executives telling customers to \"ensure that they protect the serial numbers on their tokens\" lend credibility to this hypothesis.\nBarring a fatal weakness in the cryptographic implementation of the token code generation algorithm (which is unlikely, since it involves the simple and direct application of the extensively scrutinized AES-128 block cipher), the only circumstance under which an attacker could mount a successful attack without physical possession of the token is if the token seed records themselves had been leaked. RSA stated it did not release details about the extent of the attack so as to not give potential attackers information they could use in figuring out how to attack the system.On 6 June 2011, RSA offered token replacements or free security monitoring services to any of its more than 30,000 SecurID customers, following an attempted cyber breach on defense customer Lockheed Martin that appeared to be related to the SecurID information stolen from RSA. In spite of the resulting attack on one of its defense customers, company chairman Art Coviello said that \"We believe and still believe that the customers are protected\".\n\n\n*** Resulting attacks ***\nIn April 2011, unconfirmed rumors cited L-3 Communications as having been attacked as a result of the RSA compromise.In May 2011, this information was used to attack Lockheed Martin systems. However Lockheed Martin claims that due to \"aggressive actions\" by the company's information security team, \"No customer, program or employee personal data\" was compromised by this \"significant and tenacious attack\".

      "context": "RSA SecurID\n\n==Introduction==\nRSA SecurID, formerly referred to as SecurID, is a mechanism developed by RSA for performing two-factor authentication for a user to a network resource.\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe RSA SecurID authentication mechanism consists of a \"token\"\u2014either hardware (e.g. a key fob) or software (a soft token)\u2014which is assigned to a computer user and which creates an authentication code at fixed intervals (usually 60 seconds) using a built-in clock and the card's factory-encoded almost random key (known as the \"seed\"). The seed is different for each token, and is loaded into the corresponding RSA SecurID server (RSA Authentication Manager, formerly ACE/Server) as the tokens are purchased. On-demand tokens are also available, which provide a tokencode via email or SMS delivery, eliminating the need to provision a token to the user.\nThe token hardware is designed to be tamper-resistant to deter reverse engineering. When software implementations of the same algorithm (\"software tokens\") appeared on the market, public code had been developed by the security community allowing a user to emulate RSA SecurID in software, but only if they have access to a current RSA SecurID code, and the original 64-bit RSA SecurID seed file introduced to the server. Later, the 128-bit RSA SecurID algorithm was published as part of an open source library. In the RSA SecurID authentication scheme, the seed record is the secret key used to generate one-time passwords.  Newer versions also feature a USB connector, which allows the token to be used as a smart card-like device for securely storing certificates.A user authenticating to a network resource\u2014say, a dial-in server or a firewall\u2014needs to enter both a personal identification number and the number being displayed at that moment on their RSA SecurID token. Though increasingly rare, some systems using RSA SecurID disregard PIN implementation altogether, and rely on password/RSA SecurID code combinations. The server, which also has a real-time clock and a database of valid cards with the associated seed records, authenticates a user by computing what number the token is supposed to be showing at that moment in time and checking this against what the user entered.\nOn older versions of SecurID, a \"duress PIN\" may be used\u2014an alternate code which creates a security event log showing that a user was forced to enter their PIN, while still providing transparent authentication. Using the duress PIN would allow one successful authentication, after which the token will automatically be disabled. The \"duress PIN\" feature has been deprecated and is not available on currently supported versions.\nWhile the RSA SecurID system adds a layer of security to a network, difficulty can occur if the authentication server's clock becomes out of sync with the clock built into the authentication tokens. Normal token clock drift is accounted for automatically by the server by adjusting a stored \"drift\" value over time. If the out of sync condition is not a result of normal hardware token clock drift, correcting the synchronization of the Authentication Manager server clock with the out of sync token (or tokens) can be accomplished in several different ways. If the server clock had drifted and the administrator made a change to the system clock, the tokens can either be resynchronized one-by-one, or the stored drift values adjusted manually. The drift can be done on individual tokens or in bulk using a command line utility.\nRSA Security has pushed forth an initiative called \"Ubiquitous Authentication\", partnering with device manufacturers such as IronKey, SanDisk, Motorola, Freescale Semiconductor, Redcannon, Broadcom, and BlackBerry to embed the SecurID software into everyday devices such as USB flash drives and cell phones, to reduce cost and the number of objects that the user must carry.\n\n== Theoretical vulnerabilities ==\nToken codes are easily stolen, because no mutual-authentication exists (anything that can steal a password can also steal a token code).  This is significant, since it is the principal threat most users believe they are solving with this technology.\nThe simplest practical vulnerability with any password container is losing the special key device or the activated smart phone with the integrated key function. Such vulnerability cannot be healed with any single token container device within the preset time span of activation. All further consideration presumes loss prevention, e.g. by additional electronic leash or body sensor and alarm.\nWhile RSA SecurID tokens offer a level of protection against password replay attacks, they are not designed to offer protection against man in the middle type attacks when used alone.  If the attacker manages to block the authorized user from authenticating to the server until the next token code will be valid, he will be able to log into the server. Risk-based analytics (RBA), a new feature in the latest version (8.0) provides significant protection against this type of attack if the user is enabled and authenticating on an agent enabled for RBA. RSA SecurID does not prevent man in the browser (MitB) based attacks.\nSecurID authentication server tries to prevent password sniffing and simultaneous login by declining both authentication requests, if two valid credentials are presented within a given time frame. This has been documented in an unverified post by John G. Brainard. If the attacker removes from the user the ability to authenticate however, the SecurID server will assume that it is the user who is actually authenticating and hence will allow the attacker's authentication through. Under this attack model, the system security can be improved using encryption/authentication mechanisms such as SSL.\nAlthough soft tokens may be more convenient, critics indicate that the tamper-resistant property of hard tokens is unmatched in soft token implementations, which could allow seed record secret keys to be duplicated and user impersonation to occur.\nHard tokens, on the other hand, can be physically stolen (or acquired via social engineering) from end users. The small form factor makes hard token theft much more viable than laptop/desktop scanning. A user will typically wait more than one day before reporting the device as missing, giving the attacker plenty of time to breach the unprotected system. This could only occur, however, if the users UserID and PIN are also known. Risk-based analytics can provide additional protection against the use of lost or stolen tokens, even if the users UserID and PIN are known by the attackers.\nBatteries go flat periodically, requiring complicated replacement and re-enrollment procedures.\n\n== Reception and competing products ==\nAs of 2003, RSA SecurID commanded over 70% of the two-factor authentication market and 25 million devices have been produced to date. A number of competitors, such as VASCO, make similar security tokens, mostly based on the open OATH HOTP standard. A study on OTP published by Gartner in 2010 mentions OATH and SecurID as the only competitors.Other network authentication systems, such as OPIE and S/Key (sometimes more generally known as OTP, as S/Key is a trademark of Telcordia Technologies, formerly Bellcore) attempt to provide the \"something you have\" level of authentication without requiring a hardware token.\n\n== March 2011 system compromise ==\nOn 17 March 2011, RSA announced that they had been victims of \"an extremely sophisticated cyber attack\".

    "instruction": "Syko Cipher Device\n\n==Introduction==\nThe SYKO cipher device was a compact British cipher apparatus in use during World War II. It was invented and patented by Morgan O'Brien before the war.  O'Brien developed a sophisticated cipher typewriter, which was complex and delicate, but then came up with the relatively simple device adopted by the military that was known the SYKO. Although the German crypt analysts managed to break the SYKO code, it remained in use for much of the war as a quick method for low-level encoding of radio traffic, particularly from aircraft. Code breaking took considerable time plus a sufficient sample of messages, and for certain classes of radio traffic (such as an aircraft's position) decoded information that became available many hours later was of little value.\n\n== Description ==\nThe SYKO machine is a purely mechanical device. Details of its mechanical construction can be found in GB Patent 534615 (Morgan O'Brien and O'Brien Cipher Machines Ltd, London) Robust, small, and lightweight, it fitted in a brown hardcover case, with an optional canvas outer bag. A few machines survive, and operating instructions issued by the Royal Australian Air Force in November 1940 have been made available on-line.When the grey top cover is opened up it reveals 32 vertical columns of letters. Each column has the characters reading downwards from A to Z then 9 to 0 followed by a pause character (37 characters in all). These columns are moveable on an endless band. The SYKO case contains a propelling pencil with a small brass pin at the other end, which is inserted in a notch at each letter allowing the columns to be moved as required. Use of the device requires the code card for that day. This is placed within the machine and is revealed as the columns are moved down.\nThe code card contains 32 columns of symbols, each column having the same 37 characters as in the moveable columns but in a random order. Code cards were different for each day, and usually aircraft only carried the card for the day. In the event that events dictated a flight unexpectedly went past midnight there was provision when sending code to indicate you were using an earlier days card. The characters on the code card were paired in each column (18 pairs) leaving a single character unpaired. The pairing means that, for example, if 'C' codes as 'R', then 'R' codes as 'C'. There is a 1 in 37 chance that a character will be the un-paired character and code as itself.\nThe bottom cover of the device can be slid in to reset all the columns to 'A' at the top. Encoding involves taking the special pencil and, for each column in turn, selecting the corresponding letter in the message using the pencil brass pin to draw down the moveable column so that letter is at the bottom bar thus revealing the code card underneath. The encoded message is then the lower-most symbol visible on the code card (i.e. above the 'A' in each moveable column). The original message is still visible along the bottom bar, so you can check the column placement hasn't moved. Due to the pairing of characters outlined above, the decoding of messages follows the same process, with it essential that both parties are using the same coding card. To avoid confusion between similar letters on the code card, the 'i' was in lower case, the zero had a line through it, and the 'e' was lower case.\nThe use of the reciprocal codes (e.g. A codes as Z, and Z codes as A) limited the variations possible, so in July 1942 non-reciprocal codes for SYKO and NYKO were introduced. This meant turning the code card over when changing from coding to decoding, but it did make the code significantly harder to break.\nHere are some questions you should answer: How was the SYKO cipher device used for encoding radio traffic messages during World War II?question: What were the physical attributes of the SYKO cipher device?question: How were the code cards used in the SYKO cipher device, and what was their composition?question: How was the pairing of characters implemented in the SYKO cipher device?question: How did the SYKO cipher device handle similar letters, such as 'i', '0', and 'e'?question: What was the purpose of introducing non-reciprocal codes for the SYKO and NYKO cipher devices?question: How were messages decoded using the SYKO cipher device?question: How many columns and characters were there in the SYKO cipher device?question: How was the SYKO cipher device powered or operated?question: What was the role of the bottom cover in the SYKO cipher device, and how was it used?question: How was the SYKO cipher device used in aircraft radio traffic communication during World War II?question: How did the SYKO cipher device handle the issue of reciprocal codes limiting variations?question: How was the design of the SYKO cipher device changed from its initial version to the one adopted by the military?question: How were the code cards distributed to aircraft using the SYKO cipher device during World War II?question: What was the role of the pairing of characters in the decoding process of the SYKO cipher device?",

According to media reports, Yahoo, Symantec, Northrop Grumman, Morgan Stanley, and Dow Chemical were also among the targets.\nAs a result of the attack, Google stated in its blog that it plans to operate a completely uncensored version of its search engine in China \"within the law, if at all,\" and acknowledged that if this is not possible, it may leave China and close its Chinese offices. Official Chinese sources claimed this was part of a strategy developed by the U.S. government.The attack was named \"Operation Aurora\" by Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of Threat Research at cybersecurity company McAfee. Research by McAfee Labs discovered that \"Aurora\" was part of the file path on the attacker's machine that was included in two of the malware binaries McAfee said were associated with the attack. \"We believe the name was the internal name the attacker(s) gave to this operation,\" McAfee Chief Technology Officer George Kurtz said in a blog post.According to McAfee, the primary goal of the attack was to gain access to and potentially modify source code repositories at these high-tech, security, and defense contractor companies. \"[The SCMs] were wide open,\" says Alperovitch. \"No one ever thought about securing them, yet these were the crown jewels of most of these companies in many ways\u2014much more valuable than any financial or personally identifiable data that they may have and spend so much time and effort protecting.\"\n\n== Attackers involved ==\n\nTechnical evidence including IP addresses, domain names, malware signatures, and other factors, show Elderwood was behind the Operation Aurora attack. The \"Elderwood\" group was named by Symantec (after a source-code variable used by the attackers), and is referred to as the \"Beijing Group\" by Dell Secureworks. The group obtained some of Google's source code, as well as access to information about Chinese activists. Elderwood also targeted numerous other companies in the shipping, aeronautics, arms, energy, manufacturing, engineering, electronics, financial, and software sectors.The \"APT\" designation for the Chinese threat actors responsible for attacking Google is APT17.Elderwood specializes in attacking and infiltrating second-tier defense industry suppliers that make electronic or mechanical components for top defense companies. Those firms then become a cyber \"stepping stone\" to gain access to top-tier defense contractors. One attack procedure used by Elderwood is to infect legitimate websites frequented by employees of the target company \u2013 a so-called \"water hole\" attack, just as lions stake out a watering hole for their prey. Elderwood infects these less-secure sites with malware that downloads to a computer that clicks on the site. After that, the group searches inside the network to which the infected computer is connected, finding and then downloading executives' e-mails and critical documents on company plans, decisions, acquisitions, and product designs.\n\n== Attack analysis ==\nIn its blog posting, Google stated that some of its intellectual property had been stolen. It suggested that the attackers were interested in accessing Gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents. According to the Financial Times, two accounts used by Ai Weiwei had been attacked, their contents read and copied;  his bank accounts were investigated by state security agents who claimed he was under investigation for \"unspecified suspected crimes\". However, the attackers were only able to view details on two accounts and those details were limited to things such as the subject line and the accounts' creation date.Security experts immediately noted the sophistication of the attack. Two days after the attack became public, McAfee reported that the attackers had exploited purported zero-day vulnerabilities (unfixed and previously unknown to the target system developers) in Internet Explorer and dubbed the attack \"Operation Aurora\". A week after the report by McAfee, Microsoft issued a fix for the issue, and admitted that they had known about the security hole used since September. Additional vulnerabilities were found in Perforce, the source code revision software used by Google to manage their source code.VeriSign's iDefense Labs claimed that the attacks were perpetrated by \"agents of the Chinese state or proxies thereof\".According to a diplomatic cable from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, a Chinese source reported that the Chinese Politburo directed the intrusion into Google's computer systems. The cable suggested that the attack was part of a coordinated campaign executed by \"government operatives, public security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the Chinese government.\" The report suggested that it was part of an ongoing campaign in which attackers have \"broken into American government computers and those of Western allies, the Dalai Lama and American businesses since 2002.\" According to The Guardian's reporting on the leak, the attacks were \"orchestrated by a senior member of the Politburo who typed his own name into the global version of the search engine and found articles criticising him personally.\"Once a victim's system was compromised, a backdoor connection that masqueraded as an SSL connection made connections to command and control servers running in Illinois, Texas, and Taiwan, including machines that were running under stolen Rackspace customer accounts.  The victim's machine then began exploring the protected corporate intranet that it was a part of, searching for other vulnerable systems as well as sources of intellectual property, specifically the contents of source code repositories.\nThe attacks were thought to have definitively ended on Jan 4 when the command and control servers were taken down, although it is not known at this point whether or not the attackers intentionally shut them down. However, the attacks were still occurring as of February 2010.\n\n== Response and aftermath ==\nThe German, Australian, and French governments publicly issued warnings to users of Internet Explorer after the attack, advising them to use alternative browsers at least until a fix for the security hole was made. The German, Australian, and French governments considered all versions of Internet Explorer vulnerable or potentially vulnerable.In an advisory on January 14, 2010, Microsoft said that attackers targeting Google and other U.S. companies used software that exploits a hole in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8 on Windows 7, Vista, Windows XP, Server 2003, Server 2008 R2, as well as IE 6 Service Pack 1 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4.The Internet Explorer exploit code used in the attack has been released into the public domain, and has been incorporated into the Metasploit Framework penetration testing tool. A copy of the exploit was uploaded to Wepawet, a service for detecting and analyzing web-based malware operated by the computer security group at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \"The public release of the exploit code increases the possibility of widespread attacks using the Internet Explorer vulnerability,\" said George Kurtz, CTO of McAfee, of the attack. \"The now public computer code may help cybercriminals craft attacks that use the vulnerability to compromise Windows systems.\"Security company Websense said it identified \"limited public use\" of the unpatched IE vulnerability in drive-by attacks against users who strayed onto malicious Web sites. According to Websense, the attack code it spotted is the same as the exploit that went public last week. \"Internet Explorer users currently face a real and present danger due to the public disclosure of the vulnerability and release of attack code, increasing the possibility of widespread attacks,\" said George Kurtz, chief technology officer of McAfee, in a blog update. Confirming this speculation, Websense Security Labs identified additional sites using the exploit on January 19. According to reports from Ahnlab, the second URL was spread through the Instant Messenger network Misslee Messenger, a popular IM client in South Korea.Researchers have created attack code that exploits the vulnerability in Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) and IE8\u2014even when Microsoft's recommended defensive measure (Data Execution Prevention (DEP)) is turned on.  According to Dino Dai Zovi, a security vulnerability researcher, \"even the newest IE8 isn't safe from attack if it's running on Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) or earlier, or on Windows Vista RTM (release to manufacturing), the version Microsoft shipped in January 2007.\"Microsoft admitted that the security hole used had been known to them since September. Work on an update was prioritized and on Thursday, January 21, 2010, Microsoft released a security patch aiming to counter this weakness, the published exploits based on it and a number of other privately reported vulnerabilities. They did not state if any of the latter had been used or published by exploiters or whether these had any particular relation to the Aurora operation, but the entire cumulative update was termed critical for most versions of Windows, including Windows 7.\nSecurity researchers continued to investigate the attacks. HBGary, a security firm, released a report in which they claimed to have found some significant markers that might help identify the code developer. The firm also said that the code was Chinese language based but could not be specifically tied to any government entity.On February 19, 2010, a security expert investigating the cyber-attack on Google, has claimed that the people behind the attack were also responsible for the cyber-attacks made on several Fortune 100 companies in the past one and a half years. They have also tracked the attack back to its point of origin, which seems to be two Chinese schools, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Lanxiang Vocational School. As highlighted by The New York Times, both of these schools have ties with the Chinese search engine Baidu, a rival of Google China. Both Lanxiang Vocational and Jiaotong University have denied the allegation.In March 2010, Symantec, which was helping investigate the attack for Google, identified Shaoxing as the source of 21.3% of all (12 billion) malicious emails sent throughout the world.\n\n\n*** Google retrospective ***\nOn October 3, 2022, Google on YouTube released a six-episode series covering the events that occurred during Operation Aurora, with commentary from insiders who dealt with the attack, though the series primary focus was to reassure the Google-using public that measures are in place to counter hacking attempts.\n\nWho are the threat actors behind Operation Aurora and what is their specialization?Q: How did Elderwood gain access to Google's source code and information about Chinese activists?Q: What was the primary goal of Operation Aurora?Q: How did the attackers exploit Internet Explorer in Operation Aurora?Q: What was the response of the German, Australian, and French governments to the Operation Aurora attack?Q: What was the role of the Chinese Politburo in the Operation Aurora attack?Q: How did the attackers masquerade the backdoor connection in Operation Aurora?Q: What was the vulnerability in Perforce, the source code revision software used by Google, that was exploited in Operation Aurora?Q: What measures did Google take in response to Operation Aurora?Q: What was the impact of the public release of the exploit code used in Operation Aurora?Q: How did researchers create attack code that exploits the vulnerability in Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) and IE8 in Operation Aurora?Q: How did Microsoft respond to the security hole used in Operation Aurora?",

First publicly disclosed by Google on January 12, 2010, in a blog post, the attacks began in mid-2009 and continued through December 2009.The attack was aimed at dozens of other organizations, of which Adobe Systems, Akamai Technologies, Juniper Networks, and Rackspace have publicly confirmed that they were targeted.

    "instruction": "MUSCULAR\n\n==Introduction==\nMUSCULAR (DS-200B), located in the United Kingdom, is the name of a surveillance program jointly operated by Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) that was revealed by documents released by Edward Snowden and interviews with knowledgeable officials. GCHQ is the primary operator of the program. GCHQ and the NSA have secretly broken into the main communications links that connect the data centers of Yahoo! and Google. Substantive information about the program was made public at the end of October 2013.\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe programme is jointly run by:\n\n \u2013 Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) (United Kingdom)\n \u2013 U.S. National Security Agency (NSA)MUSCULAR is one of at least four other similar programs that rely on a trusted 2nd party, programs which together are known as WINDSTOP. In a 30-day period from December 2012 to January 2013, MUSCULAR was responsible for collecting 181 million records. It was however dwarfed by another WINDSTOP program known (insofar) only by its code DS-300 and codename INCENSER, which collected over 14 billion records in the same period.\n\n== Operational details ==\nAccording to the leaked document the NSA's acquisitions directorate sends millions of records every day from internal Yahoo! and Google networks to data warehouses at the agency's headquarters at Fort Meade, Maryland. The program operates via an access point known as DS-200B, which is outside the United States, and it relies on an unnamed telecommunications operator to provide secret access for the NSA and the GCHQ.According to The Washington Post, the MUSCULAR program collects more than twice as many data points (\"selectors\" in NSA jargon) compared to the better known PRISM. Unlike PRISM, the MUSCULAR program requires no (FISA or other type of) warrants.Because of the huge amount of data involved, MUSCULAR has presented a special challenge to NSA's Special Source Operations. For example, when Yahoo! decided to migrate a large amount of mailboxes between its data centers, the NSA's PINWALE database (their primary analytical database for the Internet) was quickly overwhelmed with the data coming from MUSCULAR.Closely related programmes are called INCENSER and TURMOIL. TURMOIL, belonging to the NSA, is a system for processing the data collected from MUSCULAR.According to a post-it style note from the presentation, the exploitation relied on the fact that (at the time at least) data was transmitted unencrypted inside Google's private cloud, with \"Google Front End Servers\" stripping and respectively adding back SSL from/to external connections. After the information about MUSCULAR was published by the press, Google announced that it was working on deploying encrypted communication between its datacenters.\n\n== Reactions and countermeasures ==\nIn early November 2013, Google announced that it was encrypting traffic between its data centers. In mid-November, Yahoo! announced similar plans.In December 2013, Microsoft announced similar plans and used the expression \"advanced persistent threat\" in their press release (signed-off by their top legal representative), which the press immediately interpreted as comparison of the NSA with the Chinese government-sponsored hackers.Google engineer Brandon Downey stated the following on Google+:\n\"Fuck these guys.\nI've spent the last ten years of my life trying to keep Google's users safe and secure from the many diverse threats Google faces\u2026 But after spending all that time helping in my tiny way to protect Google -- one of the greatest things to arise from the internet -- seeing this, well, it's just a little like coming home from War with Sauron, destroying the One Ring, only to discover the NSA is on the front porch of the Shire chopping down the Party Tree and outsourcing all the hobbit farmers with half-orcs and whips.\"\n\n== Gallery ==\n\nAnswer these questions based on the above context: What are the two government organizations responsible for operating the MUSCULAR program?q: What is WINDSTOP, and how does MUSCULAR fit into it?q: How does MUSCULAR collect data from internal Yahoo! and Google networks?q: What is the significance of the number of \"selectors\" collected by MUSCULAR compared to PRISM?q: Why did the NSA's PINWALE database become overwhelmed with data from MUSCULAR?q: What is TURMOIL, and how does it relate to MUSCULAR?q: What security measures did Google and Yahoo! implement in response to the MUSCULAR program?q: How did the MUSCULAR program impact Google's efforts to keep its users safe and secure?q: What is the role of the trusted second party in the WINDSTOP group of programs?q: How does the MUSCULAR program collect data from Google's private cloud?q: What is the significance of the NSA's PINWALE database being overwhelmed with data from MUSCULAR?q: How has the MUSCULAR program impacted the relationship between technology companies and their users?q: What is the role of the NSA's Special Source Operations in the MUSCULAR program?q: How has the MUSCULAR program been compared to the actions of Chinese government-sponsored hackers?q: How has the MUSCULAR program been received by Google employees?",

      "context": "MUSCULAR\n\n==Introduction==\nMUSCULAR (DS-200B), located in the United Kingdom, is the name of a surveillance program jointly operated by Britain's Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) that was revealed by documents released by Edward Snowden and interviews with knowledgeable officials. GCHQ is the primary operator of the program. GCHQ and the NSA have secretly broken into the main communications links that connect the data centers of Yahoo! and Google. Substantive information about the program was made public at the end of October 2013.\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe programme is jointly run by:\n\n \u2013 Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) (United Kingdom)\n \u2013 U.S. National Security Agency (NSA)MUSCULAR is one of at least four other similar programs that rely on a trusted 2nd party, programs which together are known as WINDSTOP. In a 30-day period from December 2012 to January 2013, MUSCULAR was responsible for collecting 181 million records. It was however dwarfed by another WINDSTOP program known (insofar) only by its code DS-300 and codename INCENSER, which collected over 14 billion records in the same period.\n\n== Operational details ==\nAccording to the leaked document the NSA's acquisitions directorate sends millions of records every day from internal Yahoo! and Google networks to data warehouses at the agency's headquarters at Fort Meade, Maryland. The program operates via an access point known as DS-200B, which is outside the United States, and it relies on an unnamed telecommunications operator to provide secret access for the NSA and the GCHQ.According to The Washington Post, the MUSCULAR program collects more than twice as many data points (\"selectors\" in NSA jargon) compared to the better known PRISM. Unlike PRISM, the MUSCULAR program requires no (FISA or other type of) warrants.Because of the huge amount of data involved, MUSCULAR has presented a special challenge to NSA's Special Source Operations. For example, when Yahoo! decided to migrate a large amount of mailboxes between its data centers, the NSA's PINWALE database (their primary analytical database for the Internet) was quickly overwhelmed with the data coming from MUSCULAR.Closely related programmes are called INCENSER and TURMOIL. TURMOIL, belonging to the NSA, is a system for processing the data collected from MUSCULAR.According to a post-it style note from the presentation, the exploitation relied on the fact that (at the time at least) data was transmitted unencrypted inside Google's private cloud, with \"Google Front End Servers\" stripping and respectively adding back SSL from/to external connections. After the information about MUSCULAR was published by the press, Google announced that it was working on deploying encrypted communication between its datacenters.\n\n== Reactions and countermeasures ==\nIn early November 2013, Google announced that it was encrypting traffic between its data centers. In mid-November, Yahoo! announced similar plans.In December 2013, Microsoft announced similar plans and used the expression \"advanced persistent threat\" in their press release (signed-off by their top legal representative), which the press immediately interpreted as comparison of the NSA with the Chinese government-sponsored hackers.Google engineer Brandon Downey stated the following on Google+:\n\"Fuck these guys.\nI've spent the last ten years of my life trying to keep Google's users safe and secure from the many diverse threats Google faces\u2026 But after spending all that time helping in my tiny way to protect Google -- one of the greatest things to arise from the internet -- seeing this, well, it's just a little like coming home from War with Sauron, destroying the One Ring, only to discover the NSA is on the front porch of the Shire chopping down the Party Tree and outsourcing all the hobbit farmers with half-orcs and whips.\"\n\n== Gallery ==",

      "answers": "The two government organizations responsible for operating the MUSCULAR program are the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) of the United Kingdom and the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).a: WINDSTOP is a group of at least five similar programs, one of which is MUSCULAR. These programs rely on a trusted second party and are used for surveillance purposes. MUSCULAR is responsible for collecting a significant amount of data, although it is not the largest program in the WINDSTOP group.a: MUSCULAR collects data from internal Yahoo! and Google networks by sending millions of records every day from these networks to data warehouses at the agency's headquarters at Fort Meade, Maryland. This is done through an access point known as DS-200B, which is located outside the United States.a: MUSCULAR collects more than twice as many data points, or \"selectors,\" compared to the better-known PRISM program.
