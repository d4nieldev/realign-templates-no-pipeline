Here is the information I have about the threat: LinkedIn Users Were Targeted in a Social Engineering Attack\nLinkedIn users, located in Italy, and working in the aerospace and avionics sectors were targeted in a social-engineering attack. According to a report from Telsy, the attack began with users receiving private messages from an account that impersonated an HR recruiter.\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Social Engineering, APT\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nA social-engineering attack that targeted LinkedIn users has been analyzed by Telsy. The analysis, that began in May 2020, led Telsy to conclude with medium confidence that the attack is linked to the APT group commonly known as MuddyWater (also known as Mercury and Static Kitten). The attribution is based on code and infrastructure overlap. The targets of the attack were LinkedIn users located in Italy and working in the aerospace and avionics sectors. The attack began with the victim receiving a private message that asked them to download an archive file containing information about a job. The private messages came from an account that impersonated an HR recruiter for a company dealing in satellite imagery. The archive contained a vCard file (.vcf) file and a folder named http, which contained another file. If the victim opened the vCard file the infection chain is kicked off. The file exploited a vulnerability identified as ZDI-CAN-6920. The vulnerability allows for the vCard file to execute the file contained in the http folder. The executed file, in turn, opened the victim's web browser while downloading a PowerShell script in the background. There are several further stages in the infection chain, which culminates with a RAT being installed. Persistence is achieved using a Registry key and a Startup folder item. Certain information is collected and forwarded to a C&C server. At this stage, if the infected host is not considered relevant to the operation, the C&C server will respond with a command that will put the malware in an infinite sleep loop.

This campaign was specifically designed to implement an old WPAD abuse tactic. The threat actors registered the domain wpad.id so that users on a network with the .id top-level domain may fall victim to a WPAD abuse attack. This occurs if WPAD services are enabled without a WPAD URL set up for the victim network, causing WPAD to iterate over the subdomains until it is able to resolve wpad.id. From that domain, a wpad.dat file is executed; in this case, it's a JavaScript exploit script. CVE-2019-1367 is exploited by this JavaScript file in order to execute shellcode. The shellcode then kicks off an attack chain with multiple stages involving PowerShell and MSI files hosted at remote URLs. Exploited vulnerabilities included CVE-2020-1054 and CVE-2018-8120, as well as an exploit for MS15-051. As with the previous campaign analyzed by Trend Micro, the threat actors once again leveraged Cloudflare proxies.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Exploit Kit\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nTrend Micro published a blog post analyzing a Purple Fox campaign targeting Indonesian users. This campaign was specifically designed to implement an old WPAD abuse tactic. The threat actors registered the domain wpad.id so that users on a network with the .id top-level domain may fall victim to a WPAD abuse attack. This occurs if WPAD services are enabled without a WPAD URL set up for the victim network, causing WPAD to iterate over the subdomains until it is able to resolve wpad.id. From that domain, a wpad.dat file is executed; in this case, it's a JavaScript exploit script. CVE-2019-1367 is exploited by this JavaScript file in order to execute shellcode. The shellcode then kicks off an attack chain with multiple stages involving PowerShell and MSI files hosted at remote URLs. Exploited vulnerabilities included CVE-2020-1054 and CVE-2018-8120, as well as an exploit for MS15-051. As with the previous campaign analyzed by Trend Micro, the threat actors once again leveraged Cloudflare proxies. For more information, see the Trend Micro blog post in the Reference section.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report. \n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/g/purplefox-using-wpad-to-targent-indonesian-users.html>"

The email uses CoinSpot branding and purports to be a withdrawal confirmation. Buttons are provided to either confirm or cancel the transaction, but both lead to a Netlify link that ultimately redirects to the phishing page. The landing page is almost an exact copy of the legitimate CoinSpot login page and is hosted on a lookalike domain. Upon entering credentials, victims are further asked for a 2FA code. Finally, they are redirected to the official CoinSpot website in an attempt to allay suspicions.

The second attacker is installing backdoors onto victim servers. This actor also leverages a different method of exploitation than bajatax. With backdoors installed on the system, the attacker injects additional malicious code into WordPress files. Possible final goals include cryptomining, SEO spam, or leasing access to a botnet. Both threat actors are adding password protection to the vulnerable file in order to prevent other attackers from infecting the server, allowing them to maintain control.

Ranzy will encrypt multiple file types while avoiding encrypting system files. Like many ransomware families, Ranzy will delete shadow copies and modifies boot options. It will attempt to terminate processes which may be holding files open, so they can be encrypted. Ransom notes are left in each directory where files have been encrypted.

Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Phishing\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nFrom late-December 2020 to early-January 2021, threat actors have employed several campaigns meant to trick victims into providing sensitive information in exchange for several scam \"prizes\" being promised. One such scam is a sweepstakes scam that promises unlimited access to 100,000 e-books. Using a countdown clock to create urgency among victims, the campaign leads to a landing page promising no necessary purchase; however in order to obtain the promised books, the victim must enter personal information and credit card information. Once the victim enters their information, they are directed to a page which states the submission was unsuccessful. At this point, it appears the details provided have already been sent to the attacker. A second scam is a fake money transfer scam. In this attack, a phishing email is used to provide the victim with a specific amount of money in exchange for personal information requested on a linked page. The landing page contains a generic bank name and requests name and credit card details. Once the credentials are provided, the victim is redirected to a legitimate transaction verification services. Once this verification is complete, an error message is displayed stating the payment was declined. A third campaign involves the use of fake payment service sites. This campaign siphons credit card information. A phishing email is used as the delivery mechanism for the payment service website. The user agrees to pay a certain amount, and, again, a verification service is used to test the validity of the credit card. Once the information is entered, there is no indication on the success or failure of the payment. Finally, two scams involving Taiwanese targets have been observed. Using UPS Taiwan as the phishing service, the promise of a delivery in exchange for a held package is used. Upon payment, the victim is taken to a secondary page which contains a fake SMS verification page. If the victim enters any number in the SMS key field, an infinitely loading page is displayed. Finally, threat actors are using Taiwan and Singapore's postal service to request financial information before a package can be delivered. Interestingly, the Singapore scam is signed as the Australia Post team.

    "output": "You are asking about a specific threat report. Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Backdoor, DNS Tunneling\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nThe xHunt Campaign has been actively observed since at least July 2018. In the latest developments, Unit 42 has uncovered new techniques being employed to provide new C2 vectors. The campaign has focused its efforts mainly on the Kuwaiti government as well as the shipping and transportation industries. The latest information suggests the threat actors compromised a Microsoft Exchange server, belonging to an organization in Kuwait, on or before August 22, 2019. Analysts note two backdoors, called TriFive and Snugy by Unit 42, as well as a web shell called BumbleBee were discovered. The backdoors are PowerShell scripts that provide the threat actors with backdoor access to the compromised Exchange server. The backdoors each provide a different C2 channel with which the actors communicate. TriFive is a backdoor that utilizes an email-based channel using Exchange Web Services to create draft emails in the Deleted Items folder of a previously compromised email account. Snugy uses DNS tunneling to execute commands on the compromised server. In September 2020, analysts were notified of a breached organization in Kuwait. Suspicious commands were noted as being executed on the Exchange server by an Internet Information Services (IIS) process. Threat actors issued the commands using the BumbleBee web shell, which had been previously installed on the Exchange server. In reviewing the logs, the analysts were unable to find the initial infection vector. They were able to find two scheduled tasks, which were in place prior to the dates of the collected logs. These tasks executed PowerShell scripts, and although the analysts were unable to confirm, they believe the threat actors were able to access the server prior the creation of logging events. The naming of tasks was done in order to blend into other tasks and had names that, upon first glance, could appear to be normal functions. The threat actors were able to resolve hosts through these two scripts. The backdoors mentioned were executed at intervals not matching each other with TriFive occurring every 5 minutes and Snugy every 30 minutes. The hypothesis is that this is done to offer some form of stealth in order to avoid detection. The actor created a draft email with a specific subject that included the commands encrypted and encoded using a base64 format. The commands are executed when PowerShell is directed to the Deleted Items folder and searches for the aforementioned subject line. Persistence for this module is achieved via the scheduled task and not through a looping process. Snugy allows the actors to run commands as well as obtain the system's hostname. Snugy is a variant of the CASHY200 backdoor previously employed in xHunt campaigns. Significant overlap exists to suggest this claim. Snugy uses DNS tunneling to communicate with C2 servers using A record lookups to resolve custom subdomains of C2 domains controlled by the actor. The tunneling protocol only sends one byte of data per query. This speed makes the backdoor inefficient for the exfiltration of data. DNS tunneling allows for the receipt of four bytes of data making it a little more efficient. Further details of the TTPs of the actor and these tools can be found in the report located within the reference section below.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report.   \n\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n  * Exercise caution with attachments and links in emails.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/xhunt-campaign-backdoors/>",

Specially-crafted packets sent by an attacker could allow for a denial-of-service condition or arbitrary code execution.\n\nWe recommend reviewing the advisories for patching and mitigation advice and implementing recommendations as soon as possible.\n\n# CVEs\n\n  * A complete list of CVEs can be found here: [ CVEs.txt](/download/attachments/32147067/ICS-CERT%20Security%20Advisories%20-%20October%2029th%2C%202020%20CVEs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1604069362155&api=v2)\n\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Review the source article for full details.\n\n  * Apply applicable patches, updates, or workarounds as necessary. \n\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-303-01>\n\n  * <https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-303-02>"

Researchers from Insikt Group at Recorded Future have analyzed the malware and published a comprehensive report on the malware's capabilities. The infostealer has been distributed since early 2020 by a group known as \"REDGlade\" or \"Glade\". According to these actors, there are two subscription licenses available - a lifetime license for 800 dollars, or monthly service for 150 dollars. This malware is normally distributed via phishing emails, as well as over social media. It has also been found masquerading as legitimate programs, including as an installer for Telegram. Once installed, the malware can perform a wide array of functions. At its core, it can steal usernames, passwords, cookies, saved credentials, and credit card information from browsers. It can also gather files from cryptocurrency cold wallets and other locations. Beyond that, RedLine Stealer is capable of performing basic download and execute functions, meaning it can be used as a loader in a multi-stage attack. RedLine is being continually developed by a competent C# developer, and so new versions of this malware are being released regularly.

The report draws attention to the methods and functions used by the cryptominers to disable other cryptomining malware that may be found on the infected system. In some cases, legitimate processes may also be terminated to increase the number of CPU cycles available to the cryptominer. Some cryptominers may even search for deployed Docker containers from within which mining operations may be being conducted. The samples in question search for Docker and Redis APIs, which they will attempt to exploit. If a system is successfully exploited, a shell script is typically used to download payloads.

Trend Micro has observed a new tactic on its honeypots, the use of Metasploit shellcode in the payload. The attackers are using alpine:latest as the base container image.

The actual payload is compressed using Base64 encoding and within the payload is a small, 250 byte executable link format file. This payload is written in pure assembly code and requires no excess instructions that would require processing. This appears to be used so there is a limited number of characters per shell line. These characteristics could be an attempt to minimize the footprint of the infiltration. The payload is executed in memory. A TCP socket is opened and the connection to the C2 server occurs at this point. The shellcode is a standard Metasploit reverse_tcp payload.

The server also hosts folders containing pictures of a female model used to build a fake Instagram account to lure victims. One of the most interesting discoveries was that of Morph Vox Pro installation files. It is believed that this tool is used to create audio messages from the fake Instagram models in order to increase legitimacy despite the group likely being made up of all males. A spear phishing delivery tool and router exploitation capabilities were also discovered.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Phishing\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nCofense has published a blog post analyzing a phishing email using an Adobe Document Cloud lure. The email originates from a Gmail account and claims to be from a government agency, providing legitimate contact details to support this. Attached, is what the body of the email states, is a purchase order that can be accessed via Adobe Document Cloud login or by downloading the latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader, hoping they'll opt for the easier login choice. Opening the attachment results in an HTML page stored locally that gathers its resources from the legitimate Adobe website. After bypassing a popup stating that the document is electronically encrypted and requires the recipient to log in with their email to view, they are directed to a fake Adobe Document Cloud sign in page. Any submitted credentials are exfiltrated to a remote URL controlled by the attacker. Finally, the victim is redirected to the legitimate Adobe Acrobat webpage. For more information, see the Cofense blog post in the Reference section.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report.   \n\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n  * Exercise caution with attachments and links in emails.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://cofense.com/document-sharing-services-represent-a-vector-for-phishing-campaigns/>"

Government-related topics are used in emails with shortened links to entice victims into downloading malware. The shortened URLs redirect to a C2 server hosting a ZIP archive. Inside the ZIP archive was either an RTF, DOC, PDF, JS, LNK or EXE. The methodology for dropping the final payload depended on the file type leveraged. For example, the PDF leveraged an action object alongside a Google redirect, while the Word documents used malicious macros in combination with PowerShell and a Batch script to download the final payload.

A report from Cyble Research Labs notes that Python source code for both the original version and an updated version observed by Cyble, are available from Github. A builder script is provided with the source code which uses Pyinstaller to create an executable payload file. The payload contains anti-debugging routines and will terminate if it detects it is being debugged. The malware steals Discord tokens from more than twenty applications, cookies, login credentials from Chrome, and Roblox Studio cookies. A Discord authorization token is then used to obtain the account information associated with the token. Stolen data is compressed and exfiltrated to a webhook specified in the payload's configuration file. Cyble's report also notes they observed a significant increase in the number of samples related to Hazard Token Grabber over the last three months and located more than two thousand samples in total.

One technique to evade detection used by Aggah in their VBA scripts is to include the string \"MsgBox\" in comments as this may lead AI-based detection tools to identify the code as \"benign\". The report also details how Dridex and Emotet droppers obfuscate their malicious VBA code in Microsoft documents.

The backdoor operates on Windows hosts, is written in Delphi, and dates back to at least 2017. Upon execution, the malware points to the MZ header to run embedded shell code. The shell code is responsible for calling a reflective loader function that loads the binary and jumps to its entry point. Unlike most Windows backdoors that beacon to a C2 server to retrieve commands, CrimsonIAS simply opens a listener that waits to receive commands from the attacker. There are three available commands an attacker can pass to the backdoor: run a command, receive a file, or send a file. Researchers believe that this backdoor could potentially be attributed to the Mustang Panda APT due to a few key similarities. First, the payload is encrypted with an XOR key that is prepended to the binary. Additionally, it leverages the MZ header to store shell code. Lastly, an exported library named Loader is used to reflectively load the binary. This also means that existing Mustang Panda PlugX archives could be used to launch CrimsonIAS instead of a PlugX DLL.

This particular campaign is using cloud technologies to deliver the payloads, allowing the attackers to not have to compromise or set up their own infrastructure. The attacks begin with a phishing email with a malicious ZIP file attached. The email states that his attachment is a copy of an invoice corresponding to a fake order. The archive contains an ISO image with a malicious script which downloads the next stage from Azure or Amazon cloud services.

This particular campaign is using cloud technologies to deliver the payloads, allowing the attackers to not have to compromise or set up their own infrastructure. The attacks begin with a phishing email with a malicious ZIP file attached. The email states that his attachment is a copy of an invoice corresponding to a fake order. The archive contains an ISO image with a malicious script which downloads the next stage from Azure or Amazon cloud services.

This subset of HIDDEN COBRA activity has been active since 2014. The alert notes that since 2015, according to public estimates, the BeagleBoyz have attempted to steal almost $2 billion. The BeagleBoyz compromise a bank's systems using multiple techniques including spearphishing, employment application themed phishing emails, exploit vulnerabilities in Internet facing systems, breaching of third party systems who have access to the target, and watering hole attacks. Other groups, such as TA505, may be acting on behalf of the BeagleBoyz. Once an initial foothold has been gained, depending on the value of the target, and that sufficient privileges and access to the required systems have been attained, the BeagleBoyz may initiate fraudulent international money transfers using the victim's SWIFT terminals or use payment switch application servers to conduct fraudulent ATM cash outs. In some cases the BeagleBoyz have been known to render critical systems inoperable. Information from the victim's are also exfiltrated using a variety of methods.

The first phase is an email with a PDF attachment claiming to be an Office 365 notification that a file has been shared with the victim. If the user clicks on the link in the PDF, they are then taken to a file hosted on a legitimate file-sharing site, such as Sway. The attacker abuses Sway's default borderless view and a specially crafted presentation page to make it seem as if the user has landed on a valid Office 365 login page. The link on this page directs the user to the final phase, which is a false login page on the attacker-controlled infrastructure. Once the user's details are entered, the attacker receives a notification email and the victim is served an 'access denied' page. After the credentials have been stolen, the attackers log into the compromised email account and dump all of the available emails. They then use the victim's details to generate new phishing PDFs that will seem legitimate, before sending them out to external targets on the victim's contact list.

Victims are initially compromised via SSH by a Bash script that operates as an SSH worm that uses compromised credentials or brute force tactics. Various tools from the hack tools URL are downloaded to the system, including rootkits, reconnaissance tools, obfuscators, exploits, and more.

The ransomware waits for the presence of a specified file on the hack tool server before beginning encryption. Once the file is observed, AES with CBC mode encryption is performed against various directories. A ransom note is left on the system requesting the victim contact the attackers by email. Based on the use of Yellowdog Updater, Modified (YUM) package manager to install prerequisite packages, the worm and ransomware are currently designed to target CentOS, RHEL, and Debian-based Linux distributions.

To gain access to a network, UNC1945 has exploited vulnerabilities in the Solaris operating system. The first compromise of a Solaris host by UNC1945 which is noted in the report occurred in late 2018. A backdoor named SLAPSTICK was installed on the compromised host. In mid 2020, Mandiant observed a remote exploitation tool named EVILSUN being deployed by UNC1945. EVILSUN contained an exploit, for what at the time, was a 0-day vulnerability in Solaris, which is now identified as CVE-2020-14871. Oracle provided a patch for this vulnerability in its October 2020 Critical Patch Update. An exploit for the vulnerability had been advertised for sale on black-market website in April 2020. Once the initial foothold was established, UNC1945 installed a number of tools, including a QEMU Virtual Machine that contained a version of Tiny Core Linux. A number of techniques and tools were used to facilitate lateral movement to HP-UX, Linux, and Windows hosts, and to third-party environments. UNC1945 takes a number of steps to evade detection including the scrubbing of log files. No data exfiltration was detected in the UNC1945 attacks but in one case, ransomware was deployed. Mandiant does not attribute the ransomware to UNC1945 and instead suggests that access to the compromised system may have been sold to a third-party. Tools and malware associated with UNC1945 includes LEMONSTICK, OKSOLO, PUPYRAT, SLAPSTICK, TINYSHELL which all provide some level of backdoor capabilities, STEELCORGI which is a packer for Linux ELF programs, the reconnaissance tool OPENSHACKLE, LOGBLEACH which is used for scrubbing log files, and ProxyChains.

APT29 is a threat actor known by many names including Cozy Bear, CozyDuke, Cozys, Dark Halo, Duke Group, Hammertoss, Minis, Office Monkeys, Pitty Tiger, Spikerrush, StellarParticle, TEMP.Monkey, TEMP.Noble, The Dukes, TG-4127, UNC2452, and Yttrium. IBM X-Force tracks NOBELIUM as ITG11. They are associated with Russia's Foreign Intelligence service and are believed to be behind the high-profile SolarWinds compromise in 2020. MiniDuke is a backdoor generally used by APT29 as a second-stage backdoor, with the newest version being seen in 2019. The analysis mainly focuses on the communications between the malware and the C2 server, and details three different modes of communication. If the machine does not have internet access, the malware will open a named pipe and use it to connect to another machine in the network which does have internet access and use this as a proxy to exfiltrate data. There is a command for an instance of MiniDuke to set up a named pipe and listen for connections if another machine in the network requires it. If it does have internet access, the malware can exfiltrate data via either POST or PUT requests. On top of exfiltration, the malware can receive commands to manipulate files and processes and has been used as a dropper in past campaigns. ATP 29 has previously used this malware in attacks on government entities in different countries in Europe and the United States.

Trend Micro has been keeping track of the changes of this malware as it improves its infrastructure and adds capabilities. Recently, the researchers observed the malware using a new initial access vector and early access loaders. The malware is distributed using disguised software packages that contain the first-stage loader. The installer name contains a character that indicates which payloads are to be downloaded and installed from the C2 server.

As with other Agent Tesla campaigns, the initial infection vector is a phishing email. In this recent campaign, however, the actors have changed to delivering the payload within a .daa file. Interestingly, this file type, Direct Access Archive, cannot be opened on default Windows installations and requires a special tool. If the file is able to be opened by the target, an executable file will be extracted. The executable file is an Agent Tesla payload. It operates as usual except for it now leverages the Telegram API to exfiltrate stolen data.

The bug starts with the create your own map functionality. Upon building the map, the user is able to export the map in KML. KML is similar to XML with some extra features. In his research, he created a map and exported with KML; however, upon submission of the exported file to the server, some XML responses were received. The culprit in the vulnerability is the inability to close the CDATA tag. Mr. Shachar was able to find a way to close the tag by using special characters at the beginning of the payload. In his case, he used the map name tag. It is at this point where the introduction of arbitrary XML code can be introduced. This leads to the XSS. This discovery and submission of this bug garnered Mr. Shachar a bounty and an email stating the bug had been addressed. In order to check the fix, the researcher performed the same steps and found the only way to close a CDATA tag was to add another CDATA tag. This allowed him to bypass the first fix. This information was passed to Google with the promise of another fix and, for Mr. Shachar, an additional bounty.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * XSS, Vulnerability\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nUnder Google's bug hunter program, a security researcher discovered a bug in Google Maps. The bug starts with the create your own map functionality. Upon building the map, the user is able to export the map in KML. KML is similar to XML with some extra features. In his research, he created a map and exported with KML; however, upon submission of the exported file to the server, some XML responses were received. The culprit in the vulnerability is the inability to close the CDATA tag. Mr. Shachar was able to find a way to close the tag by using special characters at the beginning of the payload. In his case, he used the map name tag. It is at this point where the introduction of arbitrary XML code can be introduced. This leads to the XSS. This discovery and submission of this bug garnered Mr. Shachar a bounty and an email stating the bug had been addressed. In order to check the fix, the researcher performed the same steps and found the only way to close a CDATA tag was to add another CDATA tag. This allowed him to bypass the first fix. This information was passed to Google with the promise of another fix and, for Mr. Shachar, an additional bounty.

FIN12 victims exist in many sectors, however, close to 20% of FIN12's victims are in the healthcare industry. Other industry sectors targeted by FIN12 includes business services, education, finance, government, manufacturing, retail, and technology. Historically, the vast majority of FIN12\u2019s victims have been located in the United States but in the first half of 2021, a significant increase in the number of victims in other countries was noted. The countries include Australia, Colombia, France, Indonesia, Ireland, the Philippines, South Korea, Spain, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. This may be due to a shift in FIN12\u2019s regional targeting, working with additional initial access providers, or avoiding the attention of the United States government. Mandiant notes that FIN12 relies heavily on initial access providers, rather than directly compromising systems, and has close relationships with the actors associated with Anchor, BazarBackdoor, BazarLoader, and Trickbot. Unusually, FIN12 does not typically use the double extortion technique to extort their ransomware victims though this has occurred in some cases. It is thought that FIN12\u2019s target selection may be based on the revenue of a potential victim as the typical FIN12 victim has revenue of at least $300 million USD.

This contains an LNK file, that will download a DOT file on execution and place it in the Microsoft Word startup folder. At this stage, the user will be distracted by a decoy PDF file that will be displayed. After this, every time the user opens a Word document, the DOT file will load and execute a macro to download a second file and execute it. At this point, the researchers were unable to retrieve the final payload from the server. The decoy PDF files seen in this attack were related to international relations between Japan and South Korea. The APT group appears to be based in East Asia and the researchers believe they are mainly targeting Japan.

Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Phishing, Ransomware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nA new Russian threat group is wreaking havoc on various Russian industries. Using a variety of techniques, the group seeks to phish credentials, implant malware, and deploy ransomware. The group is made up of Russian speakers who break the untold rule of not working within Russia and post-Soviet countries. Impersonating regulatory organizations, a metallurgical company, an industrial plant, a dental clinic, and media holdings company, the group uses a variety of techniques to infiltrate these and other industries within Russia. The first attack was against a large medical company using a phishing email claiming to be from the media holding company. Upon opening of the phishing email, a custom malware called TinyNode is installed. This malware is used as a backdoor and to load additional malware. The group performs reconnaissance, collection of data, and propagation. Additionally, the group uses Cobalt Strike to ensure post-exploitation is effective. The group moves laterally in an effort to obtain domain administrator credentials as well as creates a new account with privileges to perform administrative actions in case the original account is deleted or blocked. A backup of the data was unsuccessful as it was later revealed the attackers had deleted the organization's backups. Within hours, the ransomware TinyCryptor was spread throughout the network. A note of interest is each campaign uses a different email address. A demand of $50,000 worth of cryptocurrency was made in exchange for decrypting the encrypted files. The group was first observed between late-March and early-April. The group used a custom Trojan called TinyPosh. After a two week break, the group changed tactics and employed a fake email from a journalist to take part in research activities. The email used proper grammar as well as imitating the media's holding style. The fake journalist offered a 30-minute interview and uploaded questions to the cloud. Upon clicking the link, the TinyPosh Trojan was downloaded to a victim's computer. Persistence was set and the privileges of the account were obtained. Additionally, Cobalt Strike Beacon was launched and, in order to hide the actual C2 address, the group used a Cloudflare Workers server. The group took a hiatus until August 2020 when two large-scales campaigns were launched using the Russian media holding company as a front. Within days, the decoy email was edited to address protests in Belarus. Using several themes the group continued to launch TinyPosh backdoor attacks. These emails contained malicious emails with malicious ZIP files attached.

Utilizing two popular brands within the email lends credence to the ruse perpetrated by the threat actors. Microsoft's OneDrive is leveraged as the lure for recipients to retrieve a file from the service. This file is a dummy tax return PDF, which is enticing to a victim due to its sensitive nature. The link, when hovered over, reveals no true OneDrive address but a typeform.com link. Once the link is clicked, the second brand is a fake Adobe login screen that is hosted on TypeForm. TypeForm allows users to create a multitude of products such as forms, quizzes, surveys, and other products. TypeForm being a free service makes it attractive to threat actors to use as a phishing service. In order to make the form, the threat actor used a login screen with a W-2 tax form as the background image. The threat actor added a question to the form prior to opening that stated \"Adobe Secure Document\" and a description of \"Sign in with your email address.\" Similarly, the tactic is used again when requesting the user's password. The user is requested to enter the password twice, a common requirement when opening secure documents in order to confirm the correct password. Once the password is collected, the user is presented with a \"View Document\" button. Should the user click this button, the responses to the questions previously asked are sent back to the threat actor for harvesting. Upon successful exfiltration, the user is informed their identity could not be verified, and they are redirected to the first step of entering their email. This repetition allows the actor to confirm the email and password. Utilization of the W-2 and the prior scouting of targeting users in the home loan process allows the perpetrator to add relevance to their campaign.

TypeForm allows users to create a multitude of products such as forms, quizzes, surveys, and other products. TypeForm being a free service makes it attractive to threat actors to use as a phishing service. In order to make the form, the threat actor used a login screen with a W-2 tax form as the background image. The threat actor added a question to the form prior to opening that stated \"Adobe Secure Document\" and a description of \"Sign in with your email address.\" Similarly, the tactic is used again when requesting the user's password. The user is requested to enter the password twice, a common requirement when opening secure documents in order to confirm the correct password. Once the password is collected, the user is presented with a \"View Document\" button. Should the user click this button, the responses to the questions previously asked are sent back to the threat actor for harvesting. Upon successful exfiltration, the user is informed their identity could not be verified, and they are redirected to the first step of entering their email. This repetition allows the actor to confirm the email and password. Utilization of the W-2 and the prior scouting of targeting users in the home loan process allows the perpetrator to add relevance to their campaign.

The campaign begins with malicious emails directing users to a link hosting an MSI installer. If the installer is launched, a ZIP archive is retrieved from a compromised AWS, Azure, or WordPress server. The archive contains a malicious DLL, an AutoHotKey or AutoIt script runner, and a script to call an exported function from the DLL. The exported function contains heavily-obfuscated, malicious code to install Bizarro. All browser processes are killed to end any existing sessions on banking websites and autocomplete is disabled in the browser. Basic system information is gathered and exfiltrated to the attacker via an HTTP POST request. Screen recording begins at this point, allowing the attackers to view entered credentials. Furthermore, a clipboard monitor watches for and replaces cryptocurrency wallet addresses. Besides its credential stealing capabilities, Bizarro provides the attackers with extensive backdoor access. Its capabilities include file operations, remote control of mouse and keyboard, keystroke logging, and social engineering. As part of the social engineering capabilities the attackers attempt to obtain 2FA codes and bank transfers.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Banking Trojan, Backdoor\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nKaspersky published a blog post analyzing the Bizarro banking Trojan, which has recently spread its campaign from Brazil to other countries in Europe and South America. The campaign begins with malicious emails directing users to a link hosting an MSI installer. If the installer is launched, a ZIP archive is retrieved from a compromised AWS, Azure, or WordPress server. The archive contains a malicious DLL, an AutoHotKey or AutoIt script runner, and a script to call an exported function from the DLL. The exported function contains heavily-obfuscated, malicious code to install Bizarro. All browser processes are killed to end any existing sessions on banking websites and autocomplete is disabled in the browser. Basic system information is gathered and exfiltrated to the attacker via an HTTP POST request. Screen recording begins at this point, allowing the attackers to view entered credentials. Furthermore, a clipboard monitor watches for and replaces cryptocurrency wallet addresses. Besides its credential stealing capabilities, Bizarro provides the attackers with extensive backdoor access. Its capabilities include file operations, remote control of mouse and keyboard, keystroke logging, and social engineering. As part of the social engineering capabilities the attackers attempt to obtain 2FA codes and bank transfers.

The attackers have compromised several WordPress sites using known vulnerabilities. With this, they have implanted a JavaScript file that runs when the site is loaded. The script forces the browser to make many connections to a hardcoded website, intending to degrade the service of the website. The sites targeted by the script include Ukrainian government agencies, think tanks, financial sites, and other pro-Ukrainian sites. Upon further analysis, the researchers found the same script being used by a pro-Ukrainian site to target Russian websites. The difference in this use of the script is that the website is transparent about the use of the script whereas on the compromised WordPress sites the user wouldn't know the script is running in the background. The script uses a random query string in the request to avoid anti-DDoS services and get to the actual target server.

      "xfe_q": "Vulnerable WordPress Sites Used To DDoS Ukrainian Targets\nBleepingComputer has reported on the discovery of several WordPress sites which contain a malicious script. When accessed by a user, the script is run and the browser is used to stage a DDoS attack. Details have been published in a report.",
      "xfe_report": "# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** DDoS\n  *  **Targets:** Ukrainian Websites\n  *  **Malware Family/Families:** Unknown\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** WordPress Vulnerabilities\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** DDoS Attack\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nBrowsers are being used as part of an ongoing DDoS attack, BleepingComputer has reported. The attackers have compromised several WordPress sites using known vulnerabilities. With this, they have implanted a JavaScript file that runs when the site is loaded. The script forces the browser to make many connections to a hardcoded website, intending to degrade the service of the website. The sites targeted by the script include Ukrainian government agencies, think tanks, financial sites, and other pro-Ukrainian sites. Upon further analysis, the researchers found the same script being used by a pro-Ukrainian site to target Russian websites. The difference in this use of the script is that the website is transparent about the use of the script whereas on the compromised WordPress sites the user wouldn't know the script is running in the background. The script uses a random query string in the request to avoid anti-DDoS services and get to the actual target server.

The report notes that the SPM55 offerings have a high rate of success in comparison to other phishing kits. Financial institutions, services companies, and technology companies are the typical targets. The operator also offer add-ons for credit card checkers, account validators, and what is described as an \"antibot.\" The antibot is used to help evade detection by redirecting sessions to benign sites if they do not appear to be from a valid phishing target. SPM55 prefers Indonesian-speaking customers and payments from OVO and DANA, which are Indonesian payment services. Payments can also be made using Bitcoin and Ethereum. The typical lures used in target emails claim a recipient's account has been disabled. Aside from seeking a victim's credentials the phishing pages can also include fields to capture other personal information. The kit is written in PHP, some parts of which have been copied from other phishing kits. Interestingly, harvested credentials are sent not only to the SPM55 customer but also to the operators.

Targets are sent an email from a lookalike Google domain with a PDF attached. The email claims that the user has been selected by Google for something and to view the PDF for further information. Inside the PDF is a letter claiming that the recipient has won prize money and Google products. They are requested to respond with various personally identifiable information (PII) to receive their prize.

    "output": "You are asking about a specific threat report. Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Scam, Monetary Theft, Social Engineering\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nThose of us that have been in the computing world for a number of years are aware of the \"Microsoft Tech Support\" and \"Social Security\" scams. But there are those who, either from lack of participation on Social Media or age, may not be aware of the evil people do to make money. If a potential victim is taken in by the social engineering techniques, the intimidation and threats from these scams, they can potentially lose a good portion, if not all, of their life savings they have set aside for their retirement years. The following is the result of an interview with such a victim.\n\nShe and her husband had moved back to their home town area into an assisted living facility, to be near their sons. The husband was a victim of dementia and died from the disease about a year later. The two of them were, by no means, \"wealthy\", but she still retained enough income to live on and to purchase the occasional birthday and Christmas gifts. There was even enough money for a bowl of chili from Wendy's when her sons weren't around to pay for it.\n\nThen there was that faithful day, when the telephone rang with a number that appeared to be from Washington DC. The caller informed the lady that there had been an attempt by someone to take money out of her Social Security account and that her account had been frozen. Since the lady did not immediately hang up, the criminal on the line thought he may have just found a new victim. Using social engineering techniques, he was able to convince the lady that not only were there arrest warrants made out for her (after all, cocaine had been found in the trunk of her car), but that he might be able to assist her with getting the charges dropped if she paid the fine. He assured her that he would be right there to help her gather and transfer the money himself. The best way to transfer the money would be through gift cards that she would purchase in $200 increments. He warned her, not to tell anyone what was going on, because, after all, this was a federal investigation.\n\nThe next day, the caller once again contacted the lady and guided her through the steps she would be taking that day. First, she would go to the bank and withdraw $3,000 in cash, which would be used to purchase the gift cards. Then she would go to Kroger (a local grocery chain) for the first card purchases. Again she was warned not to tell anyone what she was doing or why. The staff at the assisted living facility, her family, her friends, no one was to be told of her secretive mission. And she must stay on the line with the criminal at all times so that he could walk her through what needed to be done.\n\nShe arrived at the bank just before noon and withdrew $3,000 from her account, money that otherwise would have been spent on her assisted living costs. Next she was to go to Kroger where she would purchase some E-Bay gift cards valued at $200 each. While keeping her line open at all times, she was to return to her car and scratch off the covering to the redemption code. For each card, she was to read off the thirteen digits found underneath to the criminal on the line. Next, she was to go to Walgreens for more purchases. This time the gift cards would be for Google Play, again for the same amount.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the assisted facility, those in charge were becoming worried about the lady. She was only supposed to be going to the bank and should have returned a while ago. So they called the point of contact to inform him of the missing lady. He, in turn, called his brother and they both began calling the lady, trying to get her to answer. At the time, she was not answering any calls other than from the criminal, what few times she wasn't already on the line with him. The two brothers, not knowing about the calls, were fearful something had happened to her. They even had contacted the police regarding a possible traffic accident involving her, since they were unaware of the scam taking place.\n\nJust as the brothers were about to reach the city limits, she finally called and told them she was at Walgreens and wanted to know if they were coming for a visit. Relieved that she appeared to be okay, they indicated that while the visit was not a planned one, yes, they were coming. She indicated she would be back at the facility shortly, then, for their visit. The brothers arrived first and waited. For thirty minutes. Since they had just passed Walgreens on the way to the facility and it was less than five minutes away, they returned to see what was wrong. The lady was acting strangely and was just getting into her car while trying to talk on the phone. They all drove back to the facility for a visit.\n\nWhile the brothers were explaining how concerned they were about her being gone for so long and not answering her phone, her phone rang and she promptly answered it. Her side of the conversation sounded strange, subdued, almost secretive. The older brother picked up the phone and asked who was on the other end. Upon hearing a foreign accent, he became concerned and asked what this call was in regards to. Upon hearing the words \"Social Security\", combined the secretive actions of the lady, he immediately arrived at the correct conclusion that the lady was being scammed and may have said a few things that would have required soap to wash out of his mouth in his youth.\n\nThe facts and events of the previous twenty-four hours were slowly drawn out of the lady. Her reluctance to hand over the cards, so their balances could be checked, shed some light on the brain washing and social engineering techniques used on her. They assured they lady that her Social Security account was not frozen, that there were not warrants out for her arrest, and that cocaine had not been discovered in her car.\n\nWhile this vile criminal may have gotten some money out of the lady's account, her inexperience in dealing with gift cards and her lack of knowledge of places of purchase the criminal was trying to lead her to at least allowed her to retain some of her purchased cards that day. An expensive lesson, but one hopefully her declining years will allow her to retain against another incident.\n\nTales such as these appear all the time on Social Media and often they are written off as slight exaggerations. When the \"lady\" is your own mother and you walk into the middle of what otherwise might have been a successful scam, it hits home and it hits deep.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Warn your elderly parents, relatives, and friends of the dangers of these types of scam calls\n  * Report attempts, especially successful attempts, to local law enforcement agencies\n  * Review the Social Security document warnings on such incidents\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://www.ssa.gov/scam/>",

The group has advertised an affiliate program on clear web hacking forums in order to recruit distributors for the payload. They leverage a double extortion model, stealing and threatening to release data if the ransom for decryption is not paid. Victim data is published on a leak site operated by the group. A portal for negotiating and paying the ransom also exists. In terms of the AvosLocker payload, files are encrypted using a custom AES-256 algorithm and are appended with a .avos extension. Advertisements detail the ransomware's functionality including multi-threaded encryption, encryption of all drives and network shares, shadow copy deletion, and more.

The group has advertised an affiliate program on clear web hacking forums in order to recruit distributors for the payload. They leverage a double extortion model, stealing and threatening to release data if the ransom for decryption is not paid. Victim data is published on a leak site operated by the group. A portal for negotiating and paying the ransom also exists. In terms of the AvosLocker payload, files are encrypted using a custom AES-256 algorithm and are appended with a .avos extension. Advertisements detail the ransomware's functionality including multi-threaded encryption, encryption of all drives and network shares, shadow copy deletion, and more.

According to a report from Kaspersky, one of the notable differences between BlackCat and other ransomware operators is that the BlackCat ransomware is written in the Rust language and provides variants for Linux and Windows. BlackCat uses the double extortion technique in their attacks and the tool used to exfiltrate data from a victim system is named Fendr, also known as ExMatter. This tool was previously associated with the BlackMatter ransomware group. Kaspersky notes that the modification and reuse of Fendr, and telemetry, suggests that some members of BlackCat are linked to the BlackMatter group. The version of the BlackCat ransomware analyzed by Kaspersky is a command-line application that accepts several arguments at runtime. Many of the operations it carries out, such as privilege escalation, deleting Windows shadow copies, and killing processes, are similar to other ransomware. For lateral movement, a compressed version of PsExec is used.

Gallium has historically targeted the telecommunications sector but has expanded its targeting to include the finance and government sectors. According to a report from Palo Alto's Unit42, Gallium is likely to be a Chinese state-sponsored group. The new PingPull RAT used by Gallium comes in three main variants, each of which uses one of three protocols, HTTP(S), ICMP, or raw TCP, for C&C communications. The use of ICMP helps PingPull helps hide its connections to C2 servers as few organizations monitor ICMP traffic.

Gallium has historically targeted the telecommunications sector but has expanded its targeting to include the finance and government sectors. According to a report from Palo Alto's Unit42, Gallium is likely to be a Chinese state-sponsored group. The new PingPull RAT used by Gallium comes in three main variants, each of which uses one of three protocols, HTTP(S), ICMP, or raw TCP, for C&C communications. The use of ICMP helps PingPull helps hide its connections to C2 servers as few organizations monitor ICMP traffic. PingPull malware is coded in C++ and gives the threat actor the ability to execute commands and access a reverse shell on compromised hosts.

In order to distribute their malicious code, they injected it into legitimate applications, essentially performing a supply chain attack. Two different operating systems were targeted, Windows and Android. On Windows, the code is distributed via either the wallet installer or a firmware update program. Along with the legitimate code is the threat actor's code that ensures communication is established with a C2 server. In the same way, Android APKs for legitimate wallet apps were repackaged to include the actor's code that establishes C2 communication. It was reported that unauthorized withdrawal of coins were made in some cases. Credentials were also able to be stolen by the malware. The activity has been attributed to the Thallium APT based on code overlaps, such as the use of the same mutex and string encryption method. For more information, see the EST blog post linked to in the Reference section. \n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report.   \n\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n  * Exercise caution with attachments and links in emails.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://blog.alyac.co.kr/3310>",

There are consistent tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actor across all their intrusions, including their method of initial access. The actor begins by using compromised usernames and passwords in a password spraying attack against remote services, such as webmail.

Able Desktop is widely used by Mongolian government agencies. Beginning around December in 2017, Trojanized installers were used to deliver the malware. The report further notes that Able's update system was probably compromised and also used to deliver malware. The malware included a backdoor named HyperBro and two RATs, Korplug (PlugX) and Tmanger. ESET named the campaign . In the early stages of the campaign, HyperBro was the installed malware, but in July 2020 the compromised update system began delivering Tmanger. The Trojanized installers were used to deliver HyperBro or Korplug. The group known as LuckyMouse appear to be behind the campaign. LuckyMouse is a Chinese threat group and is also known by several other names including APT27, Bronze Union, Emissary Panda, Hippo, Iodine, Iron Tiger, and TG-3390. IBM X-Force tracks LuckyMouse as Hive0006. ESET also discovered relationships between LuckyMouse and TA428 due to one of the Tmanger C&C server addresses also being used by the ShadowPad backdoor.

The malware delivered in these attacks was the Pegasus spyware from NSO. Citizen Lab reports that the timing of the attacks coincided with media organizations reporting on sensitive issues related to the Salvadoran government. In total, thirty-seven devices were found to be infected.

To quickly set up phishing sites, Planetary Reef is using dynamic DNS services and domains registered through well-known registrars. As proof of the group's bulletproof hosting intentions, PhishLabs points out that the group allows their customers leniency in the types of illicit material their customers upload and distribute. They also provide hosting services to another group known for attacking large social media sites. Lastly, they have connections to other groups that are known for their phishing-for-hire services.

Upon execution, the users will receive an error message, but a Base64 encoded PowerShell command is executed in the background. It downloads two files which are executed as the final payload, which is the PowerShell RAT. This RAT can download and upload files, execute PowerShell scripts, and execute commands. The C2 domain is another Germain domain to avoid suspicion.

The ransomware was discovered due to a hit on a Babuk payload signature. The reason it was detected as Babuk is because it was based on leaked Babuk source code. The Bitcoin address, actor email addresses, and ransomware name were edited for the actor's purpose, but the payload remained the same. McAfee notes that prior to leveraged leaked Babuk code, the actor attempted to write their own ransomware but it was simple and easy to analyze. Investigating domains contacted by the payload led to the discovery of an open directory containing additional tools, such as scripts for defense evasion and privilege escalation. Further pivoting on the network infrastructure led to what is likely the initial infection vector, fake Flash and AnyDesk installers, along with an exfiltration tool and other payloads.

If an attacker had control of a WiFi network and can convince a victim to scan a custom NFC tag with their device, they could intercept the traffic associated with this activity to inject malicious JavaScript and force the phone to install and launch an application of the attacker's choice from the Galaxy Store. An update to the Galaxy Store app, version 4.5.20.7, provides a fix for this by only allowing HTTPS URLs to be used in conjunction with this WebView activity.

The vulnerability specifically results from the allowance of HTTP URLs which, in turn, results in plaintext traffic. If an attacker had control of a WiFi network and can convince a victim to scan a custom NFC tag with their device, they could intercept the traffic associated with this activity to inject malicious JavaScript and force the phone to install and launch an application of the attacker's choice from the Galaxy Store. An update to the Galaxy Store app, version 4.5.20.7, provides a fix for this by only allowing HTTPS URLs to be used in conjunction with this WebView activity. For more information, see the F-Secure blog post in the Reference section.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Review the source article for full details.\n\n  * Apply applicable patches, updates, or workarounds as necessary. \n\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://labs.f-secure.com/blog/samsung-s20-rce-via-samsung-galaxy-store-app/>"

The investigation suggested the firewall was compromised via the internet-exposed User Portal component.\u00a0 Researchers identified suspicious and repeated access targeting a valid JSP file (login.JSP). Further analysis of the firewall revealed that the threat actor established a webshell backdoor through modification of a legitimate component file. The threat actor utilized this webshell in order to establish multiple VPN user accounts and associated certificate pairs for legitimate network access persistence. The attacker also modified specific DNS responses on the compromised device to conduct Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks targeting hostnames, which belonged to the victim organization.\n\nThe MITM attacks allowed the attacker to conduct credential and session cookie theft from administrative access to the websites' content management systems (CMS).

On September 6th, 2021, an update for ADSelfService Plus was released and it addressed an authentication bypass vulnerability, CVE-2021-40539. On September 16th, a joint alert from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United States Coast Guard Cyber Command (CGCYBER), and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) was published that noted reports of exploitation of the vulnerability as early as August 2021 and that APT actors were likely among those exploiting the vulnerability. Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center and Palo Alto's Unit 42 have both produced reports concerning campaigns they observed that began exploiting the vulnerability on September 22nd. Unit 42 notes in their report that as early as September 17 an actor was leveraging leased infrastructure located in the United States to scan the internet for vulnerable instances of ADSelfService Plus. If a compromise was achieved, post-exploitation activities carried out by the attackers include credential dumping and deploying malware to maintain persistence and move laterally within the environment. While Unit 42 provides no specific attribution, they do note similarities between this campaign and the tactics and tooling used by Threat Group 3390, also known as APT27, Emissary Panda, and TG-3390. Microsoft however attributes the activity directly to a Chinese threat actor they refer to as DEV-0322. Targets of the global campaign have included organizations in the consulting, defense, education, energy, healthcare, and technology sectors. The objective of the campaign appears to be the collection and exfiltration of sensitive data.

      "xfe_report": "# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Malware, Data theft.\n  *  **Targets:** Unpatched instances of Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus\n  *  **Malware Family/Families:** Godzilla webshell, KdcSponge, and NGLite\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Exploitation of the ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus vulnerability CVE-2021-40539.\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Persistence, Lateral movement, Collection and exfiltration of data.\n  *  **Additional TTPs:** See the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below.\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nThe Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus software is a self-service password management and single sign-on solution. On September 6th, 2021, an update for ADSelfService Plus was released and it addressed an authentication bypass vulnerability, CVE-2021-40539. On September 16th, a joint alert from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United States Coast Guard Cyber Command (CGCYBER), and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) was published that noted reports of exploitation of the vulnerability as early as August 2021 and that APT actors were likely among those exploiting the vulnerability. Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center and Palo Alto's Unit 42 have both produced reports concerning campaigns they observed that began exploiting the vulnerability on September 22nd. Unit 42 notes in their report that as early as September 17 an actor was leveraging leased infrastructure located in the United States to scan the internet for vulnerable instances of ADSelfService Plus. If a compromise was achieved, post-exploitation activities carried out by the attackers include credential dumping and deploying malware to maintain persistence and move laterally within the environment. While Unit 42 provides no specific attribution, they do note similarities between this campaign and the tactics and tooling used by Threat Group 3390, also known as APT27, Emissary Panda, and TG-3390. Microsoft however attributes the activity directly to a Chinese threat actor they refer to as DEV-0322. Targets of the global campaign have included organizations in the consulting, defense, education, energy, healthcare, and technology sectors. The objective of the campaign appears to be the collection and exfiltration of sensitive data.

Those arrests led to the seizing of property, money, computer equipment, documents, and other high-end items such as cars. But with these arrests, the Clop ransomware gang is back in action after a brief hiatus. About a week after the arrests, new victim information was found on their ransomware data leak site, CLoP^-LEAKS. Authorities believe there were no arrests involving core actors behind the gang, thus allowing the group to continue operations. There is speculation that the unwanted law enforcement attention could lead to an abandonment or slowing of the group, as has been seen in other ransomware groups. The group has been operating since March 2019 and has used a variant of the CryptoMix ransomware. The gang gains a foothold into the victim network and spreads laterally while stealing documents and data. Once the data has been harvested, the ransomware encrypts the data on the victim hard drive. In its most recent reported attack, the gang stole data from Accellion FTA file transfer devices using a zero-day and demanded a $10+ million ransom. Victims of the attack included energy company Shell, cybersecurity firm Qualys, Flagstar Bank, the University of Miami, and the University of California. Ukrainian police estimate damages to be in the range of $500 million total.

Across the four Mirai variants, two new vulnerabilities were identified. In both cases, remote code execution vulnerabilities in IoT devices were exploited to run a wget command that downloads a shell script. The shell script, in turn, downloads Mirai binaries for various architectures and executes each one. The first vulnerability is the result of an unsanitized HTTP parameter in IoT devices synchronizing time over HTTP. Palo Alto researchers are still analyzing IoT devices that use such NTP server handling routines to identify which specific devices are being targeted. The second exploit is also due to lack of sanitization of an HTTP parameter. In this case, limited context is provided so pinpointing the targeted device has been a challenge, but it is believe that it may be a remote process management tool based on the included parameters. This second exploit was only used for a matter of seconds based on Palo Altos observations and not been observed since. All four of the analyzed variants have the capability to launch DDoS attacks.

Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Phishing, Backdoor\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nTrend Micro has published a blog post analyzing recent SideWinder activities targeting Nepalese and Afghan government and military organizations. The first set of activity reported on is related to Windows backdoors being spread through various malicious document types. These include RTF files that exploit the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability, LNK files, PDFs, Word Documents, and Zip archives. Regardless of the series of file types leveraged, all the infection chains lead to the execution of JavaScript code that drops a backdoor/stealer to the ProgramData folder, which will either be directly executed or run by a scheduled task. The backdoor uses DLL sideloading for execution of the malicious code. Once running on the system, it can perform its main function of downloading and executing a .NET executable, stealing system information and reporting it to the C2 server, and exfiltrating files. The second attack observed was a spear-phishing campaign. This campaign was discovered when the researchers identified subdomains on the servers hosting the aforementioned malicious documents that were mimicking mail servers associated with target organizations. Hosted on these domains were phishing pages that were based off of the legitimate version of the target organization's webmail login pages. After entering credentials, victims were redirected to either the legitimate webmail login page or to a document or website hosting news content regarding Covid-19 or South Asian territorial disputes. Also found on these servers were Android APK files. While some are benign applications that appear to be for testing, the themes indicate targeting of users in South Asia. Furthermore, applications developed using JavaPayload for Metasploit were observed. The applications load extra code from a remote server, however the researchers were unable to obtain this code at the time of investigation. Due to the lack of other components in this application, they believe the group is still developing these applications before use.

The backdoor module that was named Mars.Deimos is now named using random strings. The infostealer module, previously named Jupyter.Jupyter, is now named Module.Main. PowerShell code, used in the registry has also changed from previous versions. The payload that was previously delivered as a .exe file is now a .msi file which has been observed using various .msi package builders. Binary Defense notes that despite the changes, a Yara rule (included below) by Luke Acha still detects Solarmarker's backdoor. Further information is available from the links in the Reference section below.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * A complete list of IoCs can be found here: [ IoCs.txt](/download/attachments/68616916/Solarmarker%20Malware%20Updates%20IoCs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1635395405709&api=v2)\n\n\n\n# Detection\n\n  * A Yara rule can be found here: [ Yara Rule.txt](/download/attachments/68616916/Solarmarker%20Malware%20Updates%20Yara%20Rule.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1635395422696&api=v2)\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Use anti-virus software and ensure software and associated files are up to date (M1049).\n\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs (M1031, M1035, M1037).\n\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level (M1051).\n\n\n\n\n# References\n\n  * <https://www.binarydefense.com/solarmarker-by-any-other-name-mars-deimos-part-3/>\n  * <https://github.com/securitymagic/yara/blob/main/Jupyter%20Malware/JupyterDll.yar>\n\n\n\n# MITRE ATT&CK Framework\n\n **Initial Access - TA0001**  \nT1566 - Phishing  \n  \n **Execution - TA0002**  \nT1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter  \nT1059.001 - PowerShell  \nT1059.003 - Windows Command Shell  \n  \n **Persistence - TA0003**  \nT1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution  \nT1547.001 - Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder  \nT1547.009 - Shortcut Modification  \n  \n **Privilege Escalation - TA0004**  \nT1574 - Hijack Execution Flow  \n  \n **Defense Evasion - TA0005**  \nT1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information  \nT1036 - Masquerading  \nT1055 - Process Injection  \nT1055.012 - Process Hollowing  \nT1127 - Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution  \nT1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information  \nT1564 - Hide Artifacts  \n  \n **Credential Access - TA0006**  \nT1555 - Credentials from Password Stores  \nT1555.003 - Credentials from Web Browsers  \n  \n **Discovery - TA0007**  \nT1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery  \nT1033 - System Owner/User Discovery  \nT1049 - System Network Connections Discovery  \nT1082 - System Information Discovery  \nT1217 - Browser Bookmark Discovery  \n  \n **Collection - TA0009**  \nT1560 - Archive Collected Data  \nT1560.001 - Archive via Utility  \n  \n **Exfiltration - TA0010**  \nT1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n  \n **Command and Control - TA0011**  \nT1102 - Web Service  \nT1104 - Multi-Stage Channels  \nT1132 - Data Encoding"

Before C2 communication is initiated, the malicious executable edits Windows firewall rules to avoid connection and communication issues. The db-json.js package eludes malicious intention by appearing to be a safe and legitimate JSON DB creation package but works in conjunction with the jdb.js package. According to the analyst, what was even more interesting, was the effective implementation of the db-json.js package. After infecting the desired target, the end-user\u2019s machine is then open to a multitude of nefarious acts, granting the attacker the ability to, log keystrokes, alter registry values, inaugurate system shutdown, initially granting a level of C2 to the attacker.

According to the analyst, jdb.js contains the credential stealing RAT, njRAT. The npm package contained three files and conducts multiple malicious activities such as: data gathering, reconnaissance, and launching patch.exe which is the njRAT dropper. Before C2 communication is initiated, the malicious executable edits Windows firewall rules to avoid connection and communication issues. The db-json.js package eludes malicious intention by appearing to be a safe and legitimate JSON DB creation package but works in conjunction with the jdb.js package. According to the analyst, what was even more interesting, was the effective implementation of the db-json.js package. After infecting the desired target, the end-user\u2019s machine is then open to a multitude of nefarious acts, granting the attacker the ability to, log keystrokes, alter registry values, inaugurate system shutdown, initially granting a level of C2 to the attacker. Furthermore, putting developers at risk who may be unaware of the malware.

Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nKryptos Logic published a blog post analyzing the updated version of TrickBot's web inject module. The web inject module previously supported two modes: dynamic and static. The static inject mode would ultimately redirect users to an attacker-controlled copy of the target site. The dynamic mode injected the stealing code into the legitimate website. The updated web inject module now has a single inject mode that performs injects by proxying traffic through a local SOCKS server if the victim accesses a URL on the list of target sites. Self-signed TLS certificates are used in man-in-the-middle TLS connections. Notably, the new web inject config file uses a Zeus-style format, which is widely used by the cybercrime community. While TrickBot previously performed fraud operations, it has more recently focused on targeted ransomware attacks. This update to the web inject module may indicate a return to their banking fraud activity though.

Additional activity believed to be carried out by this actor was a voter intimidation campaign; this type of campaign could also leverage stolen voter registration data to increase effectiveness.

The attacks are carried out using a Kubernetes cluster. The primary service targeted in the attacks has been Microsoft Office 365 cloud services, though other service providers and on-premise email servers are also targeted. If credentials are obtained they are typically used to gain an initial foothold before attempts are made to escalate privileges and move laterally.

The second DNS TXT record is from one of the domains in the aforementioned list and returns the TOR proxy addresses. Finally, the last TXT record provides the TOR C2 address.

In a report they have published, Trend Micro note that Nokoyawa may be connected to the Hive ransomware operators as there are significant similarities in the tools used and the order in which steps in the attack chain are carried out. Nokoyawa has been used in attacks targeting South America with Argentina appearing to be the primary target.

While it has been in existence since 2017, most of its development has occurred in 2021, with multiple major evolutions between March and October. The infection chain begins with a document containing a malicious macro that writes a VBS script to the startup folder. This VBS script proceeds to download an executable from a remote server. The downloaded executable was determined to be a packer that decrypts and executes the Spectre payload in memory. After anti-analysis checks pass, strings and C2 configuration information are decoded. An initial check-in is then performed, at which point the C2 returns various commodity tools to be used by the RAT. The RAT provides a variety of capabilities, such as browser data theft, clipboard stealer, and file download and execution. Each version of Spectre has added additional C2 commands, expanding the functionality of the malware. The researchers highlight that the sellers of the malware-as-a-service are also providing C2 infrastructure as part of their offering.

Its builder has been advertised for testing on dark web forums since June 2021 but has not yet been observed in attacks in the wild. The latest version's main update is to expand the size of files that will be encrypted to 2 MB. Upon execution, the ransomware searches all drives for target files. If the file is within the size limit, it is encrypted using AES. If it exceeds the 2 MB limit, the file is overwritten with random bytes, making it unrecoverable. A ransom note is dropped in each affected folder and the victim's wallpaper is modified. Additionally, the ransomware implements common techniques to make the recovery of files more challenging, such as deleting volume shadow copies and disabling Windows recovery mode.

They have recently observed this group using a new backdoor in a campaign against the Jordanian government. This backdoor is being called Saitama. Initial access is gained through a malicious email containing an excel file, pretending to be from the Government of Jordan. If the victim enables macros, the excel file performs the necessary actions to drop the Saitama backdoor onto the victim machine. The backdoor uses DNS for C2 communications, as well as long sleep times and compression to disguise the malicious traffic. The backdoor can execute predefined commands, and custom commands from the C2 server, and manipulate files on disk. Some of the predefined commands contain internal IP and domain names, showing that this is a highly targeted attack and that the attackers had some knowledge of the victim's internal infrastructure.

They have recently observed this group using a new backdoor in a campaign against the Jordanian government. This backdoor is being called Saitama. Initial access is gained through a malicious email containing an excel file, pretending to be from the Government of Jordan. If the victim enables macros, the excel file performs the necessary actions to drop the Saitama backdoor onto the victim machine. The backdoor uses DNS for C2 communications, as well as long sleep times and compression to disguise the malicious traffic. The backdoor can execute predefined commands, and custom commands from the C2 server, and manipulate files on disk. Some of the predefined commands contain internal IP and domain names, showing that this is a highly targeted attack and that the attackers had some knowledge of the victim's internal infrastructure.

The ransomware, which was first seen in April 2022, now appears to be infecting ESXi servers. Researchers were able to attribute this behavior to the group behind Black Basta due to the similarities in the encrypted file extension and the chat support link. In this example, the ransomware looks for the directory which stores the virtual machines on the server and encrypts the files present. Multithreading is used to speed up the encryption process, and the malware uses the fast 'chacha20' encryption algorithm.

The ransomware, which was first seen in April 2022, now appears to be infecting ESXi servers. Researchers were able to attribute this behavior to the group behind Black Basta due to the similarities in the encrypted file extension and the chat support link. In this example, the ransomware looks for the directory which stores the virtual machines on the server and encrypts the files present. Multithreading is used to speed up the encryption process, and the malware uses the fast 'chacha20' encryption algorithm.

The botnet can spread by scanning private IP address ranges for vulnerable systems. The botnet uses implicit trust, application exploits, and weak passwords to gain a foothold into databases, cloud-based applications, and IT admin tools. The botnet is using XMRig to mine for Monero currency and appears to be operating out of Russia or Eastern Europe. The botnet uses an ELF binary to set up the environment, infecting systems, downloading new modules, and deploying XMRig. The ELF binary is packed using UPX and a modified header and footer. This obfuscation reduces file sizes and hides the malware code. Most of the C2 components are hosted through TOR or anonymous file sharing services that use HTTP as its transport protocol. The main component spreads through SSH and is downloaded over HTTP when the exploit is successful. The module contains seven shell scripts with each performing a different action. Persistence is achieved via x() functionality in the creation of a cron job. This script will download the latest version of the malware. Each time the exploit is successful, the malware attempts to authenticate with the username of the compromised system. The SSH module is a brute force shell script used to download and extract a TAR file.

Spook published the names of all companies that have been attacked, regardless of whether or not they paid the ransom demand. They also publish whether or not the victim paid the ransom. If the ransom is not paid, the attackers advertise the victim's data for sale.

The campaign uses copycat versions of legitimate sites, six of which are sites that offer cleaning services with a seventh that is a pet store. The copycat sites do not provide the ability to shop on them. Instead, they offer the download of a fake Android app that is purported to be the online shopping app from the legitimate site. The app is not downloaded from Google's Play store which means that a user would have to have enabled the \"Install unknown apps\" setting to allow the Android device to install the app. The app asks for a single permission, to read SMS messages. On the first run, the app asks the victim to login in but does no checks and will accept any credentials and report them as correct. The apps are themed to resemble the sites they claim to be from and allow the victim to select services and products. When the victim attempts to pay, they are offered the choice of paying using one of eight Malaysian banks or a credit card. ESET notes in its report that the credit card option was not selectable during their testing. Bank details entered into the app are sent to the campaign operators and the app reports to the user their credentials were rejected.

The document contains a malicious macro that disables security protections and spawns a second macro that fetches the second stage payload. Although at the time of analysis this payload wasn't available, the researchers were able to access a compromised machine that was used to send the phishing emails to work out other stages of the attacks. The researchers found evidence that the malware operator collected sensitive information from the victim using additional tools. The tools found included a tool to zip and upload files, along with two log files that contain the uploading history. There was also evidence that the threat actor used the Chinotto malware to exfiltrate sensitive data from the victim.

Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Ransomware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nSophos researchers have been analyzing Conti ransomware over the past several months. Through that investigation, the team was able to put together a highly accurate accounting of the actual attack cycle day-by-day as well as some of the rapid growth and development of the ransomware. Conti ransomware has been around since 2020 and has wreaked havoc on systems worldwide. Now, with the help of the Rapid Response team from Sophos, a clearer picture of the TTPs for the group(s) behind the attacking software has been obtained. The authors of the malware have taken great steps toward making the malware difficult to analyze, such as programming reflective loaders that never write the ransomware binary to the file system. By doing so, no artifacts of the actual ransomware remain after infection. Initially, a Cobalt Strike DLL is loaded into system memory. The DLL then calls to the C2 server to retrieve the next stage. This connection allows the first stage to download a Cobalt Strike shellcode loader that contains the reflective instructions. If successful, the C2 server places the ransomware binary onto the server, implants it into the infected machine via the aforementioned reflective loader, and can be removed immediately upon completion of the attack. The attackers also use API-by-hash in order to use hash values to call specific API functions. This keeps analysts from reverse engineering simply. Upon the actual ransomware infection, files are immediately encrypted and connection attempts are made to other machines on the network using SMB. An RSA public key is used to perform the encryption using AES-256 algorithm. The ransomware seems to follow a pattern of daily activity which was analyzed and made into a flowchart as seen in the second of the three reports which can be found in the Reference section below. On Day 1, the ransomware conducts initial access and scans over the course of six hours. This sends a map of basic network topography. Day 2 brings no malicious activity observed. Day 3 is used for data exfiltration and credential gathering. Day 4 is the actual Conti attack using bash scripts to loop through lists of gathered devices in order to load the Cobalt Strike loader on any vulnerable machine. Day 5 had the researchers stop the attack and get the network back to \"normal\". Initial entry was made via public facing application and a domain admin account which had been compromised. Additionally, vulnerable firewalls were exploited. Batch scripts were employed for network scanning and system discovery. Beacons from Cobalt Strike were loaded via Windows Management Instrumentation commands.

The upload functionality of this plugin allows the attacker to upload a backdoor to the victim website. Additionally, the vulnerability allows for the creation of an admin account, providing further access. The backdoor includes functionality to delete the vulnerable plugin after the infection is complete, preventing further exploitation. The researchers observed the backdoor being used to install a fake \"Zend Fonts\" plugin. The malicious code in this plugin is responsible for redirecting non-admin visitors to a spam site. These spam sites can then be used by the attacker for distributing malicious payloads or performing phishing.

Here is the information I have about the threat: Emotet Chronicles\nKaspersky has published a report chronicling what is known about Emotet malware.\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Trojan\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, Emotet was first discovered in June 2014 by Trend Micro. Emotet is a malware package designed to steal banking credentials. Initial targets were German and Austrian bank users. At that time, the infection vector was bank-related spam with either weaponized attachments or links to ZIP files with the loader install. November of that year saw additional modules added that could modify HTTP(s) traffic, collect Outlook email addresses, and steal credentials in Mail PassView, among others. December saw unresponsive command and control servers as attacks dropped off. The following January saw a public RSA key and encrypted embedded strings. Swiss bank clients were also added to the victim list. June 2015 saw the beginning of another shutdown of the command and control servers. December of 2016 saw a new outlook for Emotet with the ability to infect victims using the RIG-E and RIG-V exploit kits. In February 2017, it was discovered that Emotet had included a spam module in its tool set. Banking clients in Poland were added in April's spam emails. May saw a change in the spam attachment used in the attack. This was the first time a weaponized Microsoft Word document (or a link to one) required the victim to enable macros. It was also the first time that Emotet began installing the banking Trojan Qbot (or QakBot), although the number of installs were not numerous. June saw Emotet begin to use a network spreading technique to infect other systems on the local network. In July, Emotet changed from using GET requests to using POST requests. The list of brute-force passwords used significantly increased in August. IBM X-Force announced in November that Emotet was now spreading IcedID. In January of 2018, Emotet began installing the banking Trojan Panda (also known as Zeus Panda). In April, Emotet added a module to spread laterally over wireless networks. In June, Emotet began a relationship with Trickbot (also known as Trickster). The ability to access computers behind NAT and convert them into command and control proxies was added in July. Installing Ryuk by Emotet began in August. October saw a brief suspension of command and control servers as well as an update to the Outlook exfiltration module. Another suspension of command and control servers began in November with a resumption beginning in January of 2019. March saw modifications to the HTTP protocol used in command and control communication. In April, data exfiltration (topics, mailing lists, message contents) began showing up in Emotet spam emails. From May until August, command and control servers went down once more. In November and February, additional minor changes were made to the headers in the HTTP protocol. Infections declined in February, not to resume until July. After starting back up in July, public reports indicated that the links in the spam emails were replaced with benign images and memes instead of the malicious Emotet payload. In a few days, this issue was corrected and Emotet began flowing again.

Several reports indicate the receipt of an email stating the product for which the customer may or may not have a legitimate license for has been seen in the wild. The email states that a subscription service offered by the company has been renewed at a rate much higher than the actual rate the company charges for this product. The threat actors show a charge of between $300-500. A typical yearly subscription for the product is actually about $100. The scam uses these emails in the hopes the victim will call and try to get the charges reversed. Should victims call, they're pointed to a website wherein a technician will remotely connect to their computer and 'uninstall' the product in question. Once the product is 'removed', the promise of a refund is given. Instead, the actors ask the victim to download TeamViewer and to share their ID and password to connect to the victim machine. The actors then install a second program to achieve persistence. In the same way as a tech support scheme, the threat actors use notepad to concoct a note telling the victim of the risks of not continuing with the product. Using SysKey, the actors place a password known only to them is installed on the computer. Should this be the case, a VBS script is downloaded and placed in the Startup folder.

The phishing emails contain a malicious zip file attachment. The attachment is either a Microsoft Word document or Excel spreadsheet containing macros that allow for the installation of the IcedID banking Trojan. IcedID is then used to install and execute Cobalt Strike on the network for the purposes of lateral movement with PowerShell remoting. Rclone is used for data exfiltration. It has been observed the attacker remains on the victim network for about a month before deploying ransomware. Upon successful deployment, the victim receives phone calls from spoofed numbers with the callers demanding a ransom and are provided with an email address for further communications and negotiation.

The phishing emails contain a malicious zip file attachment. The attachment is either a Microsoft Word document or Excel spreadsheet containing macros that allow for the installation of the IcedID banking Trojan. IcedID is then used to install and execute Cobalt Strike on the network for the purposes of lateral movement with PowerShell remoting. Rclone is used for data exfiltration. It has been observed the attacker remains on the victim network for about a month before deploying ransomware. Upon successful deployment, the victim receives phone calls from spoofed numbers with the callers demanding a ransom and are provided with an email address for further communications and negotiation. Other tools employed include AWS S3 cloud, Mimikatz, SharpKatz, BetterSafetyKatz, and SharpSploit. The attacker persistently threatens the release of the stolen data should the ransom not be paid.

Rather than blocking individual IP addresses, Doki typically blocks address ranges such as /22 and /24. The blocking of ranges, instead of single IP addresses may be due to Doki's operators being aware of activity from multiple addresses in the blocked ranges. Kinsing itself typically targets the Docker API, the F5 vulnerability CVE-2020-5092, Redis, and SaltStack.

Using this company they have posed as a legitimate cybersecurity software company in order to recruit IT specialists and pay them a lower wage in post-Soviet states than they would pay them if they were knowingly participating in the cybercriminal activity that FIN7 has them doing. A Gemini source who was offered a position as an IT specialist at Bastion Secure Ltd was able to analyze the tools provided by Bastion Secure and found they are components of the post-exploitation toolkits Carbanak and Lizar/Tirion, both having been previously attributed to the FIN7 group.

Using attack vectors designed to exploit different infrastructures, the group is using SQL injection to upload malicious files, installing through InstallUtil.exe using a scheduled task, a possible malicious link file in an email attachment, and exploiting the ProxyLogon vulnerability (CVE-2021-26855) to upload the China Chopper web shell. In addition to the above, the campaign is using unidentified shellcode loaders named StealthVector and StealthMutant, as well as a backdoor called ScrambleCross. These tools, developed by Earth Baku, are used to facilitate targeted attacks on entities in specific industries within the Indo-Pacific region. Countries affected include India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. StealthVector is a shellcode loader designed to be configurable for the threat actor's needs including disabling Event Tracing for Windows allowing for stealth mode execution. StealthMutant uses AES-256-ECB for decryption, whereas an earlier version uses XOR. This allows StealthMutant to perform process hollowing for execution remotely. ScrambleCross is a newly discovered backdoor. Instructions are received from a C2 server that allows it to receive and change plug-ins. The researchers have yet to obtain a plug-in to study.

Three variants were released in May, Kekpop, Kekware, and YourCyanide. Trend Micro has published an analysis of YourCyanide that describes it as sophisticated. Its download routine includes the utilizing of Discord, Microsoft document links, and Pastebin. The first stage of the infection chain is an LNK file that contains PowerShell code that downloads and executes a file from Discord that in turn creates and executes a CMD file. The CMD file downloads and executes a heavily obfuscated CMD script from Pastebin. This file carries out a number of operations including creating a registry entry for persistence, attempting to add a user to the Administrators group, disabling Task Manager, terminating certain services and security applications, and enabling RDP. It also checks the machine for certain usernames used by malware researchers and sandbox systems that are to be avoided. YourCyanide can also move laterally by sending emails containing itself as an attachment and copying itself to other drives and directories. Several other files are also downloaded and executed throughout the attack. Of note, is that files are not encrypted and instead are just renamed. A ransom note is left on the system and the report also notes that all users in the compromised network may be messaged with a warning.

Three variants were released in May, Kekpop, Kekware, and YourCyanide. Trend Micro has published an analysis of YourCyanide that describes it as sophisticated. Its download routine includes the utilizing of Discord, Microsoft document links, and Pastebin. The first stage of the infection chain is an LNK file that contains PowerShell code that downloads and executes a file from Discord that in turn creates and executes a CMD file. The CMD file downloads and executes a heavily obfuscated CMD script from Pastebin. This file carries out a number of operations including creating a registry entry for persistence, attempting to add a user to the Administrators group, disabling Task Manager, terminating certain services and security applications, and enabling RDP. It also checks the machine for certain usernames used by malware researchers and sandbox systems that are to be avoided. YourCyanide can also move laterally by sending emails containing itself as an attachment and copying itself to other drives and directories. Several other files are also downloaded and executed throughout the attack. Of note, is that files are not encrypted and instead are just renamed. A ransom note is left on the system and the report also notes that all users in the compromised network may be messaged with a warning. Collected data and system information are exfiltrated using Telegram.

    "output": "You are asking about a specific threat report. Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Ransomware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nGiven the continuing battle against COVID-19, threat actors have consistently attacked communication platforms used by the work-from-home crowd. Zoom attacks have been the most popular with the platform being the most used since the start of the pandemic. WFH users rely on the platform for meetings, collaboration, and communication with closing of many office spaces in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus. Known as \"Zoombombing,\" pranksters will crash a meeting and perform actions not deemed appropriate for the setting. These actions can include but are not limited to displaying pornographic images and videos or being disruptive to the environment. This type of behavior is typically harmless, however, some threat actors have taken to using fake Zoom installers in an effort to implant malware onto unsuspecting victim's computers. Bots such as Devil Shadow Botnet and backdoors have been found within these installers. These fake applications can cause the user's machine to perform unintended actions or allow backdoor access to the machine. Additionally, they execute operator commands, add or delete files, log keystrokes, and gather information from a victim system. One such malware, ZAPIZ, comes bundled with a legitimate Zoom installer, however, the malicious application included will perform a variety of actions. A sextortion email based on a supposed Zoom recording was also observed. Slack and Discord face similar issues with actors using tactics to disrupt communications. A ransomware variant (Crypren) encrypts files of various types. Utilizing Slack's Webhooks, the encryption of the victim's files is reported back to the C2 server. This is a yet unseen tactic in the ransomware world. Discord is being exploited through the use of spam campaigns that contain AveMaria or AgentTesla malwares. These emails typically resemble postal delivery notifications or invoices as attachments. Additionally, the emails contain embedded links to a Discord URL.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Ransomware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nGiven the continuing battle against COVID-19, threat actors have consistently attacked communication platforms used by the work-from-home crowd. Zoom attacks have been the most popular with the platform being the most used since the start of the pandemic. WFH users rely on the platform for meetings, collaboration, and communication with closing of many office spaces in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus. Known as \"Zoombombing,\" pranksters will crash a meeting and perform actions not deemed appropriate for the setting. These actions can include but are not limited to displaying pornographic images and videos or being disruptive to the environment. This type of behavior is typically harmless, however, some threat actors have taken to using fake Zoom installers in an effort to implant malware onto unsuspecting victim's computers. Bots such as Devil Shadow Botnet and backdoors have been found within these installers. These fake applications can cause the user's machine to perform unintended actions or allow backdoor access to the machine. Additionally, they execute operator commands, add or delete files, log keystrokes, and gather information from a victim system. One such malware, ZAPIZ, comes bundled with a legitimate Zoom installer, however, the malicious application included will perform a variety of actions. A sextortion email based on a supposed Zoom recording was also observed. Slack and Discord face similar issues with actors using tactics to disrupt communications. A ransomware variant (Crypren) encrypts files of various types. Utilizing Slack's Webhooks, the encryption of the victim's files is reported back to the C2 server. This is a yet unseen tactic in the ransomware world. Discord is being exploited through the use of spam campaigns that contain AveMaria or AgentTesla malwares. These emails typically resemble postal delivery notifications or invoices as attachments. Additionally, the emails contain embedded links to a Discord URL.

Once installed, Warsaw sends a basic profile of the system to a Telegram bot which notifies the malware's operators that a system has been infected. From that point, the operators can then take control of the system using the Horus Eyes RAT. Horus Eyes connects to the operator's AWS instance using a hard-coded ngrok TCP URL.

This means there is no single, large payload on the victim system and allows the operator to create custom commands for victims as required.

Caution should be exercised in using the decryption tools for each group as the provenance of these tools is uncertain. **IBM HAS NOT TESTED THESE DECRYPTORS AND THE USE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED DECRYPTORS SHOULD BE EXECUTED AT YOUR OWN RISK.** Further details can be found in the article located within the Reference section below.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Review the source article for full details.\n\n  * Apply applicable patches, updates, or workarounds as necessary.\n\n  * Obtain the master decryptor if your organization was affected\n  *  **IBM has not tested this decryptor and cannot confirm its validity. ***Use at your own risk.*****\n\n\n\n#  Reference\n\n  * <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ragnarok-ransomware-releases-master-decryptor-after-shutdown/>"

Here is the information I have about the threat: Recent Atlassian Confluence and Oracle WebLogic Exploit Campaigns\nExploit chains are commonly leveraged by botnets to spread their infections.

The first campaign involves the Muhstik botnet and exploits CVE-2021-26048, a recent Atlassian Confluence OGNL injection vulnerability. The exploit allows for remote code execution, in this case for the purpose of downloading a script from a remote server. The initial script subsequently downloads a Trojan shell script and the Tsunami IRC backdoor. The backdoor access provides the attacker the ability to move laterally and perform denial-of-service (DoS) attacks while the Trojan shell script is responsible for executing the XMRig miner. The second exploit campaign observed involved the Kinsing botnet spreading via CVE-2020-14750, an Oracle WebLogic remote code execution vulnerability. As with the Muhstik infection, the initial exploit downloads a shell script. This shell script performs several defense evasion techniques and ultimately installs the Kinsing malware. Kinsing is capable of receiving C2 commands from the attacker, running a cryptominer, and moving laterally via SSH.

Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Phishing\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nUsing intimidation tactics, threat actors are sending phishing emails containing information about termination of employment in order to implant malware into unsuspecting users' computer systems and networks. Initial infection is accomplished through said phishing email, which contains a Google document link, presumably, from the TrickBot gang. This link leads to the Bazar backdoor as well as the Buer loader. Trickbot has previously used different botnets, including Emotet, for the carrying out of its mission. Unlike most phishing emails, this contains no attachments, only a link to the aforementioned Google documents links. The body of the email states the recipient has been terminated and a link to the termination reasoning is included. In one such email, the reason for termination was positional redundancy. The link actually redirects to a URL used to download the malware payload. Most of the cases analyzed were instances where Bazar malware was downloaded; however, in some cases Buer loader was used. The packer for both is identical. The packed binaries contain an export function that is responsible for decryption and injection. First, a shell is deployed to decrypt a leaderless PE loader which contains the final payload. Using memory allocation, the payload is mapped into memory, given permissions, and transfers control. No self-injection is used. The Bazar backdoor is new malware and is part of TrickBot's toolkit. This is reserved for almost exclusively high profile targets. The Bazar loader is used to download and execute the backdoor, which, in turn, is used to execute binaries, scripts, modules, kill processes, and self removal. Control flow is obfuscated to hinder analysis. The Bazar loader is used to download the backdoor from a C2 using a URI format. This download was captured and analyzed. As with other Trickbot certificates, the certificates for Bazar were created in the same manner. It was also seen that the backdoor downloaded and executed the Cobalt Strike pentesting and post-exploit toolkit. It is hypothesized this is done so ransomware could be deployed, data stolen, or network access could be sold. Buer loader is sold on Russian underground forums. Most of its strings are encrypted and APIs are loaded by hash.

Control flow is obfuscated to hinder analysis. The Bazar loader is used to download the backdoor from a C2 using a URI format. This download was captured and analyzed. As with other Trickbot certificates, the certificates for Bazar were created in the same manner. It was also seen that the backdoor downloaded and executed the Cobalt Strike pentesting and post-exploit toolkit. It is hypothesized this is done so ransomware could be deployed, data stolen, or network access could be sold. Buer loader is sold on Russian underground forums. Most of its strings are encrypted and APIs are loaded by hash.

After finishing the survey, the visitor is instructed to visit a secondary link from which they can receive their reward.

The email continues to implore the victim to change their registration to Republican in a sign of compliance. The group further explains they have access to the entire voting infrastructure.

It is not clear whether the video is showing any actual activity in the Alaska voter rolls, but the technique depicted is convincing enough and could lead to successful intimidation. A subsequent report from Reuters purports to have evidence that this threat actually originated from Iranian hackers.

Interestingly, the trojan allows for a \"livestream\" view of the victim device as well as providing the ability for interacting through Accessibility Services. Injections were first observed in March 2021 against Italian banks. In May 2021, injections were seen against Belgium and Netherlands-based banks. At present, the trojan appears to be in early development. Other capabilities seen include key logging, stealing Google Authentication codes, and full remote control over an Android device. Anti-analysis techniques are implemented, such as junk code, a dynamic 2nd stage, and partially encrypted network communications using an XOR algorithm.
