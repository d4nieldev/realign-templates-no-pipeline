The threat actor targets information technology, government, healthcare, financial, and insurance organizations across the United States. The initial infection vector in their attacks is through the exploitation of vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure virtual private network (VPN), Citrix NetScaler, and F5 devices. After successfully exploiting one of these vulnerabilities, the attackers were observed deploying various webshells onto the system. These included the ChunkyTuna, Tiny, and China Chopper web shells. Capabilities provided with these web shells installed include the ability to execute commands, enumerate directories, download and execute additional payloads, and exfiltrate data. Two additional tools were also discovered in use, FRP and KeeThief. FRP is an open source project allowing tunneling of network connections, which the researchers believed was used by this threat actor to tunnel Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) sessions. KeeThief is another open source tool that is used to decrypt and steal credentials stored in the KeePass password manager. These credentials could then be used to move laterally.

APT29 is a threat actor known by many names including Cozy Bear, CozyDuke, Cozys, Dark Halo, Duke Group, Hammertoss, Minis, Office Monkeys, Pitty Tiger, Spikerrush, StellarParticle, TEMP.Monkey, TEMP.Noble, The Dukes, TG-4127, UNC2452, and Yttrium. IBM X-Force tracks NOBELIUM as ITG11. They are associated with Russia's Foreign Intelligence service and are believed to be behind the high-profile SolarWinds compromise in 2020. MiniDuke is a backdoor generally used by APT29 as a second-stage backdoor, with the newest version being seen in 2019. The analysis mainly focuses on the communications between the malware and the C2 server, and details three different modes of communication. If the machine does not have internet access, the malware will open a named pipe and use it to connect to another machine in the network which does have internet access and use this as a proxy to exfiltrate data. There is a command for an instance of MiniDuke to set up a named pipe and listen for connections if another machine in the network requires it. If it does have internet access, the malware can exfiltrate data via either POST or PUT requests. On top of exfiltration, the malware can receive commands to manipulate files and processes and has been used as a dropper in past campaigns.

The initial emails in each campaign are sent via business' website contact forms, increasing the chance it will be opened by the recipient. The content of the message claims that there are images hosted on the website that violate copyright and request the recipient review a document hosted at a provided link for more information. To send the form submissions, the operators leveraged proxy servers and automated scripting to generate and submit the lure. With regard to the links in the emails, most point to a document hosted on Google Drive. The document is a macro-emedded file that, if downloaded and executed, will begin infecting the system. Some infection chains led to the installation of various payloads, while others only delivered a single malicious payload. Regardless of the full infection chain and malware family in use, the initial payload leveraged the Salfram crypter to obfuscate its content. The crypter seems to have evolved over the course of the campaigns. Some differences include the actual code used for similar function calls. However, many similarities can be seen, such as the use of a large number of jumps and fake API calls. Ultimately, the payload is unpacked and run on the system. The researchers note that the crypter is quite advanced outside its inclusion of a string in the DOS stub that is highly trackable.

The phishing emails contain a malicious zip file attachment. The attachment is either a Microsoft Word document or Excel spreadsheet containing macros that allow for the installation of the IcedID banking Trojan. IcedID is then used to install and execute Cobalt Strike on the network for the purposes of lateral movement with PowerShell remoting. Rclone is used for data exfiltration. It has been observed the attacker remains on the victim network for about a month before deploying ransomware. Upon successful deployment, the victim receives phone calls from spoofed numbers with the callers demanding a ransom and are provided with an email address for further communications and negotiation.

The phishing emails contain a malicious zip file attachment. The attachment is either a Microsoft Word document or Excel spreadsheet containing macros that allow for the installation of the IcedID banking Trojan. IcedID is then used to install and execute Cobalt Strike on the network for the purposes of lateral movement with PowerShell remoting. Rclone is used for data exfiltration. It has been observed the attacker remains on the victim network for about a month before deploying ransomware. Upon successful deployment, the victim receives phone calls from spoofed numbers with the callers demanding a ransom and are provided with an email address for further communications and negotiation.

A report from Sophos provides an analysis of SolarMarker and SEO campaigns that were used to distribute it throughout 2021. The SEO operations were, according to Sophos, were very effective with the results for their search phrases appearing high in the Google search results. To achieve the results the campaigns used three main methods, web pages and PDF documents hosted on compromised sites, and Google Groups discussions where the campaign operators would create fake conversations with between 500 and 600 entries. From the initial pages, a victim would be redirected to another site that has been known for hosting malware for some years. The victim would eventually be delivered an MSI installer that contained two files, a malicious PowerShell script, and a decoy executable. The decoy file was typically a legitimate installer for Wondershare's PDFelement or Adobe's Acrobat Pro DC. The SolarMarker payload is embedded in the PowerShell script, it is base64-encoded and encrypted.

A report from Sophos provides an analysis of SolarMarker and SEO campaigns that were used to distribute it throughout 2021. The SEO operations were, according to Sophos, were very effective with the results for their search phrases appearing high in the Google search results. To achieve the results the campaigns used three main methods, web pages and PDF documents hosted on compromised sites, and Google Groups discussions where the campaign operators would create fake conversations with between 500 and 600 entries. From the initial pages, a victim would be redirected to another site that has been known for hosting malware for some years. The victim would eventually be delivered an MSI installer that contained two files, a malicious PowerShell script, and a decoy executable. The decoy file was typically a legitimate installer for Wondershare's PDFelement or Adobe's Acrobat Pro DC. The SolarMarker payload is embedded in the PowerShell script, it is base64-encoded and encrypted. When the script is executed it carries out a number of operations including dropping the payload in the form of a DLL, establishing persistence, and creating a smokescreen directory that contains a large number of randomly named junk files, and a randomly named file which the payload is copied to. An LNK file is used to ultimately begin the process of decrypting the payload which is a DLL and then reflexively loading it.

TA2541 is a cybercriminal actor that has been infecting aviation, aerospace, transportation, manufacturing, and defense organizations with commodity remote access Trojans (RATs) since at least 2017. Their infection chain begins with a phishing email using a transportation theme and a malicious link or attachment. Most recently, they have leveraged a link to Google Drive or OneDrive hosting a VBS file. Upon execution, the VBS file downloads and executes PowerShell code. Security defenses are disabled, system information is gathered, and persistence is established, usually via the Startup folder. Ultimately, a commodity RAT is installed on the system. The current payload of choice appears to be AsyncRAT, but Netwire, WSH RAT, and other RATs have also been leveraged by the group. Dynamic DNS is frequently used for C2 communications.

DoppelPaymer is, according to Trend Micro, based on the BitPaymer ransomware, but has a number of differences, including the length of the RSA key used. DoppelPaymer takes advantage of threaded file encryption for better performance and also uses a tool named ProcessHacker to terminate processes and services which may be holding files open and preventing them being encrypted. DoppelPaymer it typically distributed through emails containing either links or malicious attachments which result in the installation of malware such as Emotet. In turn, Emotet would be used to download further payloads such as Dridex and DoppelPaymer itself. Other tools such as Cobalt Strike, Empire, Mimikatz, PowerShell, and PsExec may also be downloaded. Before DoppelPaymer is executed, the attackers will attempt to locate high value targets from which they will exfiltrate data prior to initiating the encryption process.

There are two stages in the infection chain. When the first stage (a loader) executes, it opens a legitimate banking page to distract the victim while it sets up persistence, disables Internet Explorer's security settings, modifies software policy settings, and downloads the second stage, the Maxtrilha banking Trojan. Maxtrilha monitors Internet Explorer's windows and matches the pages against a hard-coded list. When a match is found, window overlays are used to obtain the victim's credentials.

There are two stages in the infection chain. When the first stage (a loader) executes, it opens a legitimate banking page to distract the victim while it sets up persistence, disables Internet Explorer's security settings, modifies software policy settings, and downloads the second stage, the Maxtrilha banking Trojan. Maxtrilha monitors Internet Explorer's windows and matches the pages against a hard-coded list. When a match is found, window overlays are used to obtain the victim's credentials. Other credentials are also obtained from the victim's system. Maxtrilha is capable of loading additional payloads using DLL injection.

Another review contains the same information verbatim right down to the punctuation. This practice is common on this application as many other reviews copy seem to be carbon copies of others. The Talos team submitted a request for a four-page, PhD-level essay for about $50.

The finished product was not PhD-level and was determined to only be on the high school level. Other domains offered services similar to the above. Clicking on these other domains leads to redirection networks of a malicious nature. This could have the user presented with a fake Flash installer, JavaScript, or other malicious objects. The level of sophistication for these threat actors is on par with the type of knowledge of other types of malicious sites.

The threat group Shathak, also known as TA551, is an email-based malware distributor that uses phishing emails to spread malware. Shathak has spread a wide range of malware, primarily information-stealing malware, such as Ursniff and Valak, and more recently IcedID. IBM X-Force reported in October 2021 that the threat group ITG23, also known as the TrickBot Gang, had partnered with Shathak in July 2021 to distribute the TrickBot and the BazarLoader malware. The malware is distributed by the Shathak group via malicious documents such as Microsoft Word documents. These documents are stored in password-protected archive files and contain malicious macros that run when the user opens the file and enables macros. This macro then drops and executes the malware that allows the attacker to continue the attack. Other activities, such as reconnaissance, credential theft, and data exfiltration, are first carried out by the actors. The attackers then deploy a Cobalt Strike beacon before deploying Conti ransomware. This whole process takes around two days from the initial compromise.

After being downloaded and executed on the system, FatalRAT performs anti-VM checks. If these checks pass, execution proceeds, beginning with the decryption of the configuration. The ability to lock the workstation is disabled via the Registry. Additionally, persistence is established either via a Registry Run key or Windows service. A keylogger is executed to begin capturing keystrokes. System information is mined and exfiltrated to a C2 server over port 8081. From this point the attacker can issue commands to perform additional capabilities, such as spreading via brute force attacks, downloading and executing additional files, installing AnyDesk, executing shell commands, and more.

After being downloaded and executed on the system, FatalRAT performs anti-VM checks. If these checks pass, execution proceeds, beginning with the decryption of the configuration. The ability to lock the workstation is disabled via the Registry. Additionally, persistence is established either via a Registry Run key or Windows service. A keylogger is executed to begin capturing keystrokes. System information is mined and exfiltrated to a C2 server over port 8081. From this point the attacker can issue commands to perform additional capabilities, such as spreading via brute force attacks, downloading and executing additional files, installing AnyDesk, executing shell commands, and more.

Mandiant notes that UNC3524's targeting suggests a financial motivation, the level of tradecraft displayed by the group is more suggestive of an espionage actor. How UNC3524 gain their initial access to an organization is, at the time Mandiant's report was published, unknown. Once the group has gained access, they typically install a backdoor named QUIETEXIT on devices such as load balancers, SAN arrays, and wireless access point controllers. QUIETEXIT establishes an SSH connection to a C&C server, and once connected QUIETEXIT provides the functionality of an SSH server. It is also capable of setting up a SOCKS tunnel that allows the attackers to execute their tools on their local system thus leaving no traces of tools on the compromised systems. The C&C servers used by the group are a botnet of compromised IoT devices. The IoT devices are typically legacy conference room camera systems from a specific vendor.

Victimology includes government organizations in Malaysia, Mongolia, Indonesia and the Philippines. The researchers were unable to attribute the activity to a known threat actor but provide their analysis of potential related personas and payloads based on PDB paths observed.

Specifically, in connected devices that are accessible over the internet. The study looked at results from open-source scans of over 200,000 infusion pumps on hospital networks. They found that 75% of the infusion pumps that were scanned had known security issues. Together, the pumps represented almost 40 different known security vulnerabilities, as well as almost 70 other known security issues commonly found in IoT devices. A more alarming statistic was that over 50% of the pumps were vulnerable to two known vulnerabilities that were rated 'critical' and 'high' severity. The majority of vulnerabilities were found to be related to sensitive information leakage. There were also several vulnerabilities that would allow a malicious actor to take a device offline, or give them unauthorized access to the device.

A number of apps that used various versions of the Tencent Legu packer to hide their malicious code were discovered on the Play store by the White Ops Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team. The number of apps discovered exceeded 240 and collectively the apps were downloaded some 14 million times and at peak, the apps generated some 15 million ad impressions, per day. The apps were mainly based on Nintendo (NES) emulators which the authors of the malicious apps obtained from legitimate sources. The ads delivered to the users were made to appear to come from applications and social media platforms such as Youtube and Chrome. The apps tracked the device's screen on and off times in an effort to deliver ads when the user was more likely to see them.

The second stage payloads can be tracked using upload times on the server and show that these payloads are being continually updated by the attackers. The payloads showed a range of capabilities for evading security software, including disabling agents and using stolen certificates.

In examples obtained by Fortinet, indicators of invalid emails are apparent such as misspellings, titles that do not exist, and, perhaps most importantly, emails from the IRS. The IRS does not send emails to citizens. The only IRS-initiated correspondence is in the form of mailed letters. The emails in question have attachments and/or links just as most other phishing emails. In using keywords such as taxes and COVID, the actors hope to entice victims into downloading a malicious Excel binary workbook which, in turn, attempts to download and execute a DLL.

In examples obtained by Fortinet, indicators of invalid emails are apparent such as misspellings, titles that do not exist, and, perhaps most importantly, emails from the IRS. The IRS does not send emails to citizens. The only IRS-initiated correspondence is in the form of mailed letters. The emails in question have attachments and/or links just as most other phishing emails. In using keywords such as taxes and COVID, the actors hope to entice victims into downloading a malicious Excel binary workbook which, in turn, attempts to download and execute a DLL.

The technique uses Microsoft file-sharing services, such as Sway, Sharepoint, and OneNote. This property is why the campaign is being called PerSwaysion. This campaign has been seen in multiple countries across North America, Europe, and Asia. Phishing emails in this campaign typically work in 3 phases. The first phase is an email with a PDF attachment claiming to be an Office 365 notification that a file has been shared with the victim. If the user clicks on the link in the PDF, they are then taken to a file hosted on a legitimate file-sharing site, such as Sway. The attacker abuses Sway's default borderless view and a specially crafted presentation page to make it seem as if the user has landed on a valid Office 365 login page. The link on this page directs the user to the final phase, which is a false login page on the attacker-controlled infrastructure. Once the user's details are entered, the attacker receives a notification email and the victim is served an 'access denied' page. After the credentials have been stolen, the attackers log into the compromised email account and dump all of the available emails. They then use the victim's details to generate new phishing PDFs that will seem legitimate, before sending them out to external targets on the victim's contact list. These targets are generally hand-picked to be high-profile members of businesses other than the victim's organization.

The stealer is able to steal from many different browsers, as well as VPN, FTP, Messaging and Gaming apps. In addition to this, it can perform financial theft using keylogger functionality. The developer of the malware claims it is undetectable by security software. The malware is encoded using a rot13 cipher and executes in memory rather than dropping a payload. Upon execution, the malware first searches for files and steals them before stealing data from browsers. It can steal from almost all Chromium-based browsers, as well as MS Edge and Firefox-based browsers. It then moves onto other applications such as Telegram and Steam. All of this data is collated, along with system information and screenshots and is compressed into a folder. The stealer uses Telegram to retrieve the remote server IP and sends the compressed folder. The malware also contained unused functionality, such as a keylogger. This could be controlled using a builder which was provided by the TA, and allows customization of the malware.

The stealer is able to steal from many different browsers, as well as VPN, FTP, Messaging and Gaming apps. In addition to this, it can perform financial theft using keylogger functionality. The developer of the malware claims it is undetectable by security software. The malware is encoded using a rot13 cipher and executes in memory rather than dropping a payload. Upon execution, the malware first searches for files and steals them before stealing data from browsers. It can steal from almost all Chromium-based browsers, as well as MS Edge and Firefox-based browsers. It then moves onto other applications such as Telegram and Steam. All of this data is collated, along with system information and screenshots and is compressed into a folder. The stealer uses Telegram to retrieve the remote server IP and sends the compressed folder. The malware also contained unused functionality, such as a keylogger. This could be controlled using a builder which was provided by the TA, and allows customization of the malware.

Check Point attributes the operation to an unnamed Chinese APT group. The operation uses spearphishing emails that are sent to the defense institutes which have malicious documents attached and additionally, a link to a site that mimics the Russian Health Ministry. The lures used in the email subject line relate to sanctions imposed on Russia by other countries.

    "context": "",
    "output": "Sure! Here is the information I have about the threat: Exploit Kits Targeting of Chrome\nThe developers of the Magnitude and Underminer exploit kits created exploit chains targeting Google Chrome, according to a report from Avast.\n\n# Threat Details\n\n  *  **Malware Type:** Exploit Kits.\n  *  **Associated Threat Actors:** Magnitude, and Underminer.\n  *  **Associated Payloads:** Various.\n  *  **Targets:** Users of Google Chrome.\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Various vulnerabilities in Google Chrome.\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Unspecified.\n  *  **Additional TTPs:** See the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below.\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nExploit kits, in terms of web browsers they exploit, have typically focused on Internet Explorer. Avast discovered that the developers of the Magnitude kit were testing exploits targeting Google Chrome. A month later, Avast observed the Underminer kit developers following suit. Both sets of developers were targeting the vulnerabilities CVE-2021-21224 and CVE-2021-31956 while the Underminer developers also targeted CVE-2019-0808, CVE-2020-1020, CVE-2020-1054, and CVE-2021-21224. The Magnitude developers appear to have discontinued the use of Chrome exploits while Underminer has continued though Avast notes that only around twenty percent of Underminer exploit attempts target Chrome. Considering Chrome appears to have sixty percent or more of the browser market share, this is a relatively low number. Avast notes that while both sets of developers were able to successfully create Chrome exploits, they were not very successful in the number of victims exploited.

Avast discovered that the developers of the Magnitude kit were testing exploits targeting Google Chrome. A month later, Avast observed the Underminer kit developers following suit. Both sets of developers were targeting the vulnerabilities CVE-2021-21224 and CVE-2021-31956 while the Underminer developers also targeted CVE-2019-0808, CVE-2020-1020, CVE-2020-1054, and CVE-2021-21224. The Magnitude developers appear to have discontinued the use of Chrome exploits while Underminer has continued though Avast notes that only around twenty percent of Underminer exploit attempts target Chrome. Considering Chrome appears to have sixty percent or more of the browser market share, this is a relatively low number. Avast notes that while both sets of developers were able to successfully create Chrome exploits, they were not very successful in the number of victims exploited. Perhaps one reason for this is the frequent and automatic updating of Chrome. Avast also notes that other Chromium-based browsers may be more at risk due to less frequent updating or the use of aged Chromium forks or vulnerabilities in their own codebases.

This vulnerability, CVE-2020-9020, was discovered in 2020 and is rated as critical due to a low attack complexity resulting in remote code execution. The exploit attempt observed by Palo Alto researchers tries to call wget on the target host in order to download a file from a remote server and subsequently executes it. The same server hosting this malware is believed to be the C2 server for the Satori botnet. Once on the system, the malware spawns and detaches multiple child processes. A brute force attack is performed against port 23 on random hosts, and multiple hardcoded commands are executed to spread the botnet infection to new victim devices. A patch for this vulnerability has been released by Vantage Velocity and should be applied as soon as possible. For more information, see the Palo Alto blog post in the Reference section.  \n\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report. \n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/satori-mirai-botnet-variant-targeting-vantage-velocity-field-unit-rce-vulnerability/>",

This vulnerability, CVE-2020-9020, was discovered in 2020 and is rated as critical due to a low attack complexity resulting in remote code execution. The exploit attempt observed by Palo Alto researchers tries to call wget on the target host in order to download a file from a remote server and subsequently executes it. The same server hosting this malware is believed to be the C2 server for the Satori botnet. Once on the system, the malware spawns and detaches multiple child processes. A brute force attack is performed against port 23 on random hosts, and multiple hardcoded commands are executed to spread the botnet infection to new victim devices. A patch for this vulnerability has been released by Vantage Velocity and should be applied as soon as possible. For more information, see the Palo Alto blog post in the Reference section.  \n\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report. \n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/satori-mirai-botnet-variant-targeting-vantage-velocity-field-unit-rce-vulnerability/>"

TA505 is also known as CHIMBORAZO, Evil Corp, GOLD TAHOE, Graceful Spider, Sector J04, and Temp.Warlock. The group known as FIN11 may also be TA505 or a subgroup of TA505. IBM X-Force tracks TA505 as ITG19. According to Deutsche Telekom, the operators of the CL0P ransomware may also be a subgroup of, or managed by, TA505. Another group known as Silence appears to have some form on relationship with TA505. These subgroups may also be simple clients of TA505 as TA505 tends to focus on gaining access to targets. They may then sell access to the victim's network or hand off to a subgroup or client who conducts further operations, such as the deployment of the CL0P ransomware. Deutsche Telekom noted three waves of spam from TA505 in 2020. The first wave ran January through February, the second June until September, and the last run in early December. TA505 spam is typically sent during weekdays, whereas the CL0P deployments more often occurred on a Friday or Saturday. The emails may contain a link or an HTML attachment, which lead the victim to a malicious document. If the document is opened and macros are enabled, the infection chain begins. CL0P ransoms tend to be based on the revenue of the victim company and a victim's sensitive data will have been exfiltrated prior to the ransomware being executed. The ransom notes are customized to the victim and the CL0P operators maintain a portal where victims can negotiate or pay ransoms. If a victim does not pay the ransom, their sensitive data will be made public on the portal.

FIN12 victims exist in many sectors, however, close to 20% of FIN12's victims are in the healthcare industry. Other industry sectors targeted by FIN12 includes business services, education, finance, government, manufacturing, retail, and technology. Historically, the vast majority of FIN12\u2019s victims have been located in the United States but in the first half of 2021, a significant increase in the number of victims in other countries was noted. The countries include Australia, Colombia, France, Indonesia, Ireland, the Philippines, South Korea, Spain, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. This may be due to a shift in FIN12\u2019s regional targeting, working with additional initial access providers, or avoiding the attention of the United States government. Mandiant notes that FIN12 relies heavily on initial access providers, rather than directly compromising systems, and has close relationships with the actors associated with Anchor, BazarBackdoor, BazarLoader, and Trickbot. Unusually, FIN12 does not typically use the double extortion technique to extort their ransomware victims though this has occurred in some cases. It is thought that FIN12\u2019s target selection may be based on the revenue of a potential victim as the typical FIN12 victim has revenue of at least $300 million USD.

      "xfe_q": "An Analysis of FIN12 and its Activity\nMandiant has published a report on the activities and TTPs associated with the financially motivated threat group Mandiant refers to as FIN12.",
      "xfe_report": "# Threat Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Ransomware\n  *  **Targets:** Organizations with revenue of at least $300 million USD.\n  *  **Ransomware Family:** Ryuk (S0446), Conti (S0575)\n  *  **RaaS Operation:** N/A\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Typically through initial access providers.\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Persistence, Privilege escalation, Lateral movement, Data exfiltration (in some cases), Data encryption.\n  *  **Additional Malware:** Anchor, Beacon, Bloodhound, Daveshell, Empire, Grimagent, Grunt, Icecandle, Maltshake, SystemBC, Weirdloop, Whitedagger. **  \n**\n  *  **Additional TTPs:** See the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below.\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nAccording to a report from Mandiant, FIN12 is a financially motivated threat actor. FIN12 victims exist in many sectors, however, close to 20% of FIN12's victims are in the healthcare industry. Other industry sectors targeted by FIN12 includes business services, education, finance, government, manufacturing, retail, and technology. Historically, the vast majority of FIN12\u2019s victims have been located in the United States but in the first half of 2021, a significant increase in the number of victims in other countries was noted. The countries include Australia, Colombia, France, Indonesia, Ireland, the Philippines, South Korea, Spain, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. This may be due to a shift in FIN12\u2019s regional targeting, working with additional initial access providers, or avoiding the attention of the United States government. Mandiant notes that FIN12 relies heavily on initial access providers, rather than directly compromising systems, and has close relationships with the actors associated with Anchor, BazarBackdoor, BazarLoader, and Trickbot. Unusually, FIN12 does not typically use the double extortion technique to extort their ransomware victims though this has occurred in some cases. It is thought that FIN12\u2019s target selection may be based on the revenue of a potential victim as the typical FIN12 victim has revenue of at least $300 million USD. Further information is available from Mandiant's report which is linked in the Reference section below.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * A complete list of IoCs can be found here: [ IoCs.txt](/download/attachments/64129955/An%20Analysis%20of%20FIN12%20and%20its%20Activity%20IoCs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1633934443318&api=v2)\n\n\n\n# Detection\n\n  * A list of Yara rules can be found here: [ Yara Rules.txt](/download/attachments/64129955/An%20Analysis%20of%20FIN12%20and%20its%20Activity%20Yara%20Rules.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1633934456132&api=v2)\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Use anti-virus software and ensure software and associated files are up to date (M1049).\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs (M1031, M1035, M1037).\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level (M1051).\n  * Restrict Web-Based Content (M1021).\n\n\n\n# References\n\n  * <https://www.mandiant.com/resources/fin12-ransomware-intrusion-actor-pursuing-healthcare-targets>\n  * <https://www.mandiant.com/media/12596/download/>\n\n\n\n# MITRE ATT&CK Framework\n\n **Resource Development -

The group is also known, to a lesser degree, to have targeted telecommunication companies in the aforementioned geographies. BackdoorDiplomacy typically exploits vulnerabilities in Internet-accessible web-based applications and the management interfaces of network equipment to gain initial access to an environment and install a webshell. Examples of the vulnerabilities exploited by the group include an F5 BIP-IP vulnerability (CVE-2020-5902), unspecified Microsoft Exchange server vulnerabilities, and a misconfigured Plesk server. The webshell is used to install the group's principle backdoor which ESET refers to as Turian. The group's preferred method for installing Turian is to hijack DLL search orders. There are Windows and Linux versions of Turian and ESET notes that Turian is likely to be an evolution of the Quarian backdoor which has been previously used in attacks against diplomatic entities. Another binary installed by the group is used to detect removable media and copy their contents to the recycle bin on the system's main drive. Once a foothold has been established, a number of well-known tools are used to facilitate reconnaissance and lateral movement. The toolset is known to include EarthWorm, Mimikatz, SafetyKatz, Nbtscan, NetCat, PortQry, SMBTouch, EternalBlue, DoublePulsar, EternalRocks, and EternalSynergy.

Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nKryptos Logic posted their analysis of a new Trickbot module named masrv. The module is delivered as a DLL and executed via its Start and Control export functions. The available commands allow for configuration settings to be obtained, a required library to be installed, and results to be sent to the attacker. Masscan is the open-source tool incorporated to perform the scanning activities. It is able to perform scans based on IP address and port ranges. If the required Npcap library is not present on the victim host, it is downloaded from the C2 server.

Infection is accomplished via multi-stage processes beginning with a malicious Excel file. The file contains an AHK script compiler executable, a malicious AHK script file, and a VBA AutoOpen macro. The malware communicates with C2 servers in the U.S., the Netherlands, and Sweden and specifically targets U.S. and Canadian customers. The compiler is a legitimate application and is used to compile and execute an AHK script. The script is used for persistence, profiling victims, and downloading and executing the AHK script on a victim system. The downloader creates an auto-run link for the executable in the startup folder. The script then profiles victims by generating a unique ID based on the serial number of the C drive. An HTTP GET request is sent every five seconds and is used to serve as the request path to the C2 server as well as retrieve and execute the AHK script on the infected machine. Other AHK scripts can be employed against the victim depending on information obtained by the initial script. At present, the only commands seen have been 'deletecookies' and 'passwords'. The stealer portion is written in AHK and harvests credentials from browsers, then exports those credentials to the attacker. Instructions within are written in Russian on usage of the script.

In terms of the sender, the threat actors initially exploited randomly generated email addresses for distribution; but they have since pivoted to using lookalike domains and addresses, in order to increase legitimacy. The body and subject of the email are: written in Japanese, use legitimate Amazon logos, and request that the recipient provide information to update or unlock their account. In most cases, the URL is linked to an IP address, but in some cases, random domain names were used. The phishing page is also, geofenced and checks whether the user is in Japan before proceeding. If they are not, they are redirected to the legitimate Amazon Japan login page. If they are located in Japan, they are directed to a fake login page. Submitting credentials redirects users to, two additional forms, one requesting various pieces of personally identifiable information and another requesting credit card information. After the forms are complete, victims are redirected to the real Amazon Japan homepage, leaving the attackers with all of the provided information. Proofpoint gives credence to the fact that, this campaign is unique to other Amazon phishing campaigns. This is due to, the volume of emails sent, with an average of several hundred thousand distributed per day.

Further details, including information on the vulnerabilities and exploits, are available from the Check Point report which is linked in the reference section below.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report. \n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n  * Exercise caution with attachments and links in emails.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://research.checkpoint.com/2021/the-story-of-jian/>"

Their report notes that Donot is known for attacking government and military organizations, and individuals, located in a small number of South Asian countries, primarily Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. However, Donot may also attack the embassies of the countries they target in any location. The group, also identified as APT-C-35 and SectorE02, has been active since 2016, and its objective is espionage. Donot typically use spearphishing as the infection vector with one of three functionally different documents attached to the emails. One variant is macros is Excel, PowerPoint, and Word files which use macros to deliver the payload. Another variant is RTF documents with a .doc extension that exploit the Equation Editor vulnerability, CVE\u20112017\u201111882. The last variant uses RTF template injection to download another document that exploits the Equation Editor vulnerability. Of the malware analyzed in the report, the malware used in the Gedit campaign was first observed used in attacks in September 2020 with DarkMusical malware being first used in June 2021. Both are variants of the yty malware framework. In some cases, another malware framework named Jaca was used.

Upon visiting the sponsored ad, users are presented with a prompt to install the browser extension from \"MetaMask,\" which gives the option to import a current wallet or open a new wallet.

A version of the PHP web shell has been making the rounds since at least late 2016 when DHS and the FBI issued a joint report (linked below) on the malware with several IoCs for detection of the web shell. The initial version of the web shell was retired in 2013 due to accusations made against the authors of the shell. The latest variant was first seen in January 2020 in a new thread on a forum. Interest in the P.A.S. web shell was renewed after disclosure of new capabilities. These capabilities were mainly related to evasion tactics to avoid detection from web application firewalls and IDS systems. First verifiable usage of the new version came in March 2020 on a compromised website. Other changes included a different packer/obfuscator and the addition of random ASCII characters, which makes the PHP code difficult to read without proper editing tools. By removing the added strings, analysis could more easily be performed. Other modifications exist and can be seen by comparing older versions with the newest in a side-by-side editor. Backdoor commands are contained within the attacker's HTTP request as cookies. Hash values are set to facilitate obfuscation and are applied to a string containing the server IP and backdoor file. Hashed passwords can also be encoded.

It operates much like most ransomware families, deleting backups, encrypting user files while avoiding system directories, and displaying a ransom note to the victim. Interestingly, the ransomware does not append a new extension to the encrypted file names, so the files do not look different when viewed in a directory. One of the most significant features of this ransomware that the researchers note is particularly concerning is its compatibility with Cobalt Strike. Specifically, it is capable of being executed by Cobalt Strike's execute-assembly function, which allows a payload to be run through memory from a Cobalt Strike server without dropping a payload onto the victim system. This decreases the chances of detection and analysis. Due to its purpose as a POC tool, the code does not include any capabilities to spread across a network or destroy devices, but its open-source nature could allow a malicious actor to add that functionality.

These include an XML attribute instability (CVE-2020-29509), an XML directive instability (CVE_2020-29510), and an XML element instability (CVE-2020-29511). In essence, if your application is processing information that has already gone through Go's decoder and encoder functions at least one time before, the application may be processing invalid data, since Go's decoder and encoder does not preserve the semantics of the data. The lack of integrity is a major issue in applications that require absolute semantic integrity in order to be secure, such as SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language). The notification indicates that the Go team cannot, at this time, reliably and reasonably address the issues. Only one of the issues is on the Go roadmap to be addressed in the foreseeable future. Mattermost is releasing an XML validation library that can be used as a workaround until a full patch can be released.

These include an XML attribute instability (CVE-2020-29509), an XML directive instability (CVE_2020-29510), and an XML element instability (CVE-2020-29511). In essence, if your application is processing information that has already gone through Go's decoder and encoder functions at least one time before, the application may be processing invalid data, since Go's decoder and encoder does not preserve the semantics of the data. The lack of integrity is a major issue in applications that require absolute semantic integrity in order to be secure, such as SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language). The notification indicates that the Go team cannot, at this time, reliably and reasonably address the issues. Only one of the issues is on the Go roadmap to be addressed in the foreseeable future. Mattermost is releasing an XML validation library that can be used as a workaround until a full patch can be released.

Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Vulnerability, Breach\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nAn investigation by Codecov led to the discovery of a supply-chain attack that has been occurring since January 2021. The maker of auditing tools stated a threat actor had modified Bash Uploader script and exposed sensitive information contained within customers' continuous integration (CI) environment. The company provide tools used to help developers ascertain how much source code is actually executed during testing. The attackers used a changed script to deliver the sensitive information to a server outside the Codecov infrastructure. Sensitive information exfiltrated possibly includes credentials, tokens, keys, datastores, code, and git remote information. The company has urged customers to re-roll credentials, tokens, and keys in environment variables that relied upon the Bash Uploader. Customers have also been advised to inspect local versions of the script to locate line 525, a copy of which can be found in the links below, and remove any attacker placed code. Searches for the compromised script have been found in several thousand projects using the script. Codecov has provided a new version of the bash script for immediate implementation.

The maker of auditing tools stated a threat actor had modified Bash Uploader script and exposed sensitive information contained within customers' continuous integration (CI) environment. The company provide tools used to help developers ascertain how much source code is actually executed during testing. The attackers used a changed script to deliver the sensitive information to a server outside the Codecov infrastructure. Sensitive information exfiltrated possibly includes credentials, tokens, keys, datastores, code, and git remote information. The company has urged customers to re-roll credentials, tokens, and keys in environment variables that relied upon the Bash Uploader. Customers have also been advised to inspect local versions of the script to locate line 525, a copy of which can be found in the links below, and remove any attacker placed code. Searches for the compromised script have been found in several thousand projects using the script. Codecov has provided a new version of the bash script for immediate implementation.

There is also reporting that indicates that initial access brokers (IAB) are utilizing BumbleBee as a way to obfuscate activities. IABs are groups of cyber threat actors that gain initial access to vulnerable networks and then offer that access on DarkWeb forums.\n\nIn the past, these groups have utilized well-known loaders such as Trickbot, Bazarloader, and Emotet. All of these variants of loaders have been utilized to deliver Cobalt Strike, but Bumblebee is using DLL files to deliver the payload. As part of the campaign, the threat actors create fake employee email addresses, and fake websites, and utilize public storage services to deliver the malicious ISO image file.

The vulnerability, if exploited, could lead to a local privilege escalation to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM. The vulnerability has been recorded as CVE-2020-27708. Origin allows 39 million users the ability to download and install games by the parent corporation, EA. In observing procmon from SysInternals, the team was able to see two system level services both looking for a missing directory, c:\\platforms. The team created the directory and inspected procmon again. This time, several functions were observed including a directory listing of the newly created directory. Using ProcessHacker, the team inspected a process called \"OriginWebHelperService.exe,\" which was running in the background. This service loads a DLL (qwindows.dll) from the created directory. Several issues arose during this process with the end result being two sections within the qwindows.dll standing out, .qtmetad and .gfids. Using their own malicious DLL, the team was able to escalate privileges using techniques from a white paper by Antonio Cocmazzi on breaking out of Local Service accounts. In essence, this vulnerability requires only a DLL path hijack for exploitation, which is a low-level exploitation technique. Vulnerable versions of the client are 10.5.77.42374 - 763270. The vendor has since patched the vulnerability with version 10.5.87.45080.

A .rar file that Netskope believes is likely delivered using phishing emails is the beginning of the infection chain. Inside the .rar file is a .mht file that in turn contains a malicious Word document. The document contains VBA code, which is password protected, and an embedded DLL disguised as a BMP file. Several actions are carried out by the VBA code including dropping the BMP file to disk then copies it to another location and renames it to background.dll. It also creates a new Word document which is a decoy displayed to the user and deletes the original document. The decoy document delivers a message that it cannot be opened due to the file being invalid. The VBA code uses one of two export functions, SaveProfile or OpenProfile, to execute the DLL. The DLL is then executed every ten minutes using a scheduled task named Winrar Update. The DLL unpacks and injects the final payload into another process. The payload in turn collects information about the system and then encrypts it and sends it to its C7C server. The campaign C&C servers are hosted on the cloud service, Glitch.

This group is performing extensive password spraying attacks on Office 365 tenants with a focus on US and Israeli defense companies, Persian Gulf ports of entry, or global maritime transportation companies with business presence in the Middle East. This behavior has led MSTIC to attribute this activity to Iran, as it matches previous techniques and targets of other actors based in Iran. The group tends to target two exchange endpoints - Autodiscover and ActiveSync - as a feature of the password spray tool they are using. The attacks come from an elaborate series of Tor IP addresses to hide their infrastructure and emulate a firefox browser to achieve this. They are seen to be most active between Sunday and Thursday during the daytime in Iranian time. On average, 150 to over 1000 Tor IPs are used in each attack against an organization. MSTIC has noted that accounts using multifactor authentication are resilient to these types of attacks. Due to the use of Tor IPs, IoCs are unavailable for these attacks. However, MSTIC has outlined several methods for detecting this campaign. Further information can be found in the article located within the Reference section below.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Enable multifactor authentication to mitigate compromised credentials (M1032). \n  * Block all incoming traffic from anonymizing services where possible (M1031).\n  * Proactively reset accounts that are known to be part of breached credentials either immediately, or after detecting bruteforce attempts (M1018).\n  * Set account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent passwords from being guessed.

The first wave uses either attachments with malicious macros or phishing pages created with the Mephistophilus phishing kit to infect users with the Vidar stealer. The second wave solely used Excel spreadsheets with malicious macros designed to download and execute the Raccoon stealer payload. Along with stealing sensitive data, this version of the Raccoon stealer also installed the AveMaria RAT to victim hosts. Notably, Raccoon was seen retrieving its C2 address from a Telegram channel. The third wave continued to use malicious macros in similarly-themed documents and also used Telegram and installed the AveMaria RAT. The distinction of this activity from the first wave is the use of a new set of domain registrations. Furthermore, researchers began to see the threat actor experimenting with the use of loaders, such as Buer and Smoke, to install Raccoon. Finally, in the fourth wave, the actor returned to also leveraging phishing pages built with Mephistophilus to distribute payloads. The targeting, timeline activity, use of Vidar and Mephistophilus (with an Adobe template), and the registrar used for registering the malicious domains leads Group-IB to conclude that the operators of FakeSecurity JS-sniffer are also running the Raccoon stealer campaigns.

This protocol has been found to have two separate vulnerabilities. The first prompts the host to conclude the data write failed. The data request contains a write value, address, and a MAC on those values. If the actor is able to intercept the request, they can modify it, which, subsequently, causes the MAC verification to fail. This action prevents the request from being committed to the RPMB. The adversary is then able to forward the initial request and intercept its status. The memory contents are updated without notification to the host. The second vulnerability allows the host to believe a portion of the data was, in fact, written. However, a different piece of data was written than initially thought. The attacker could cause the host to lose state, such as cutting power. The uncommitted write is kept with the attacker. Once online again, the host may attempt to issue an authenticated data write request to the previous location with different data. The attacker could intercept the new request and, instead, forward the old request.

The web inject module previously supported two modes: dynamic and static. The static inject mode would ultimately redirect users to an attacker-controlled copy of the target site.

The updated web inject module now has a single inject mode that performs injects by proxying traffic through a local SOCKS server if the victim accesses a URL on the list of target sites. Self-signed TLS certificates are used in man-in-the-middle TLS connections. Notably, the new web inject config file uses a Zeus-style format, which is widely used by the cybercrime community. While TrickBot previously performed fraud operations, it has more recently focused on targeted ransomware attacks.

Researchers have seen Raccoon Stealer and RIG exploit kit in their observations. The adult website, xhamster.com, has seen the largest malvertising campaign in more than a year. One malvertising actor was offering bids for ads on adult websites with the majority of victims located within the U.S. with 56% of the observed traffic. A popular ad network, ExoClick, was abused with redirection pages. The first domain used in the campaign was disguised as a web design agency; however the page was simply a decoy page. The actor used server-side cloaking to redirect victims to a Fallout exploit kit landing page. This page attempted to exploit CVE-2019-0752 and CVE-2018-15982. These CVEs attack Internet Explorer and Adobe's Flash Player respectively. Nearly two weeks later, a new domain was used and employed a 302 redirect. This instance used the RIG exploit kit to disseminate Raccoon Stealer. A second malvertiser (malsmoke) has been tracked for months and uses Smoke Loader malware. The actor placed their malicious ad on the xhamster.com website. This campaign used a different and more sophisticated redirection technique with client-side fingerprinting and connectivity checks in an effort to target only legitimate IP addresses. For this attack, both Raccoon Stealer and ZLoader were downloaded and deployed. This group has a propensity to switch ad networks with rapid pace to continually perform its malvertising campaigns. Due to the continued use of Internet Explorer, it is suspected that these attacks and campaigns will continue using the aforementioned CVEs.

What this means is that those who use ClouDNS for DNS lookups will be returned the IP addresses for domains as they are registered with ClouDNS, rather than the actual legitimate IP addresses for the domains.

    "instruction": "Tell me everything you know the following threat: AXA Attacked by Avaddon Group's Ransomware\nThe AXA Insurance company has been the victim of a ransomware and followup DDoS attack by the Avaddon Ransomware Group. Several news outlets have provided information on this attack.",
    "context": "",
    "output": "\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Ransomware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nAccording to several news outlets, insurance company AXA and, specifically, its operations in Asia have been the victim of a ransomware and DDoS attack by affiliates or the operators of the Avaddon Ransomware-as-a-Service. It is unknown how the attackers were able to gain access to the network, although typical delivery for Avaddon has focused on phishing emails containing malicious attachments as zip archives with malicious JavaScript contained therein. \n\nAt present, more than 3TB of, what is being classified as, \u201chighly sensitive data to include HIV and STD reports, customer and doctor ID documents, bank details, and more\" was purportedly encrypted and exfiltrated. Photos obtained by Heimdal Security show several Asia-based passports. These photos may or may not be related to the attack; however, the group has made every effort to prove the demands are real and they are willing to share this information on a larger scale. AXA was given 10 days from May 15, 2021 to comply with the ransom demands or face the prospect of a DDoS attack on its network. The threat group has released passport details in an effort to expedite payment. This is a customary tactic amongst ransomware groups to show the severity of the problem and reasoning behind the payment demand. The threat group posted a \u201cpress release\u201d stating the AXA is not willing to comply with the demands. As such, the threat group has stated the data cannot be decrypted without the decryptor. \n\nFirst identified in February 2019, the group has attacked more than 100 companies to date. There is no official word on how many of those companies actually paid the ransom. Unlike the DarkSide operators, who claim to have ceased operations, the Avaddon gang is actively searching for targets. \n\nSome have speculated that the attack was based on AXA\u2019s group statement they will no longer issue cyber-insurance policies in France. While this may seem related to the attack on AXA, X-Force believes this is coincidental and is not part of the reasoning behind the attack. The suspension only applies to France and does not affect existing policies. For this reason, we have concluded these attacks are not related. \n\nA report from the FBI as well as the ACSC (Australian Cyber Security Centre) states the average ransom demand is 0.73 bitcoin.

      "xfe_q": "AXA Attacked by Avaddon Group's Ransomware\nThe AXA Insurance company has been the victim of a ransomware and followup DDoS attack by the Avaddon Ransomware Group. Several news outlets have provided information on this attack.",
      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Ransomware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nAccording to several news outlets, insurance company AXA and, specifically, its operations in Asia have been the victim of a ransomware and DDoS attack by affiliates or the operators of the Avaddon Ransomware-as-a-Service. It is unknown how the attackers were able to gain access to the network, although typical delivery for Avaddon has focused on phishing emails containing malicious attachments as zip archives with malicious JavaScript contained therein. \n\nAt present, more than 3TB of, what is being classified as, \u201chighly sensitive data to include HIV and STD reports, customer and doctor ID documents, bank details, and more\" was purportedly encrypted and exfiltrated. Photos obtained by Heimdal Security show several Asia-based passports. These photos may or may not be related to the attack; however, the group has made every effort to prove the demands are real and they are willing to share this information on a larger scale. AXA was given 10 days from May 15, 2021 to comply with the ransom demands or face the prospect of a DDoS attack on its network. The threat group has released passport details in an effort to expedite payment. This is a customary tactic amongst ransomware groups to show the severity of the problem and reasoning behind the payment demand. The threat group posted a \u201cpress release\u201d stating the AXA is not willing to comply with the demands. As such, the threat group has stated the data cannot be decrypted without the decryptor. \n\nFirst identified in February 2019, the group has attacked more than 100 companies to date. There is no official word on how many of those companies actually paid the ransom. Unlike the DarkSide operators, who claim to have ceased operations, the Avaddon gang is actively searching for targets. \n\nSome have speculated that the attack was based on AXA\u2019s group statement they will no longer issue cyber-insurance policies in France. While this may seem related to the attack on AXA, X-Force believes this is coincidental and is not part of the reasoning behind the attack. The suspension only applies to France and does not affect existing policies. For this reason, we have concluded these attacks are not related. \n\nA report from the FBI as well as the ACSC (Australian Cyber Security Centre) states the average ransom demand is 0.73 bitcoin. This translates roughly to $40,000 USD at the time of the report. That number, based on trading today, is about $28,000 USD.\n\nAs always, X-Force is keeping a very close eye on this and will bring you further details as the story progresses.

Many of the functions in the tool are similar to most PHP shells, such as those for file modifications, downloading, executing PHP, and scanning files. The researchers highlight several functions that are more unique, including those to update or debug WordPress, restore files, and scan for malware. The malware scanning function in particular is interesting as it appears to scan for a common website malware based on filenames and regex strings. It is possible this is used to remove existing infections in order to reduce the chance of detection. Another interesting aspect of the main PHP file was the presence of a modified version of the hello.php WordPress file.

The exploit has been named Kerberos Bronze Bit. The attack uses S4U2self and S4U2proxy, which are added as AD Kerberos protocol extensions. This allows the attack to gain access to the service ticket of the target. The forwardable flag in the ticket is set to 1. The ticket is used in the S4U2proxy to obtain the service ticket for the targeted user to the targeted service. With the ticket obtained, impersonation can be used, requests can be sent to the service, and requests processed by the user's authority. This exploit bypasses Kerberos delegation, thus allowing the attacker to escalate privilege. This, then, allows the requests to proceed under the escalated authority. Microsoft is releasing a two-stage rollout. The first was released on December 8, 2020. The second is a forced enforcement on February 9, 2020.

    "output": "\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Ransomware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nA Sophos report provides information on a ransomware attack that targeted a US-based business in the hospitality sector. A new ransomware named Epsilon Red was used in the attack. The ransomware executable is named red.exe and is written in Go and contains some code from an open-source project name \"godirwalk\". It is described by Sophos as being a bare-bones package as it only handles the file encryption process with the other functions such as C&C communication being handled by PowerShell scripts. The report notes that the initial entry point into the enterprise is thought to be a compromised Exchange server. What vulnerability might have been exploited to achieve the compromise was not determined. Sophos describes the actual attack as being hand-controlled and involves more than twelve PowerShell scripts that are obfuscated in a rudimentary manner. A legitimate remote access tool named \"Remote Utilities\" was installed on some systems. In some instances, the Tor Browser was also installed. Epsilon Red is unusual in some respects in that it blocks access to all TCP ports on a system, except for RDP (3389) and the port used by Remote Utilities (5650). And, in the sample Sophos analyzed, there is no list of targeted or excluded file types, so it will encrypt all the files in a directory it encrypts. Files that are encrypted have the suffix .epsilonred appended to them. The ransom note left by the malware is similar to that left by the REvil ransomware, but there are no other obvious similarities between the two ransomware families. Sophos notes in its report that at least one victim paid a ransom of 4.29BTC (around $149,000 USD) on May 31.

Additionally, a new tool called DeMotet automates analysis of Emotet. As with previous versions, this version is a multi-stage malware unpacked in succession. In this version, the DLL is not the payload and doesn't communicate with the C2 servers. According to researchers, the entropy is high and thus most likely contains encrypted data. Using specified resources, a breakpoint is reached and, in turn, triggers the decryption stage that is placed in memory. The next stage is then loaded using a matching file size. Unlike past versions, this version has no imported API functions, very few strings, but does employ the same code obfuscation. Obfuscation is accomplished via Control Flow Flattening. The payload is concealed by hiding information used in static analysis. Using DeMotet, imported functions that have been added to the payload can be seen. The static unpacker can use name hashing and strings decryption algorithms found in previous versions making DeMotet a viable analysis option. Finally, the communication protocol has been changed to HTTPS as opposed to HTTP. More information can be found in the blog post located within the Reference section below.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * A complete list of IoCs can be found here: [ IoCs.txt](/download/attachments/74055751/Emotet%20Back%20After%2010%20Month%20Absence%20IoCs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1638888793633&api=v2)\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Train users to be aware of access or manipulation attempts by an adversary to reduce the risk of successful spearphishing, social engineering, and other techniques that involve user interaction.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Details\n\n  *  **Malware Type:** Malware Botnet\n  *  **Associated Threat Actors:** Unspecified\n  *  **Associated Payloads:** N/A\n  *  **Targets:** Various\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Usually via infected file from email\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Used for various functions\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nAfter being dormant for the past 10 months, Emotet is back with a new DLL and other features. Additionally, a new tool called DeMotet automates analysis of Emotet. As with previous versions, this version is a multi-stage malware unpacked in succession. In this version, the DLL is not the payload and doesn't communicate with the C2 servers. According to researchers, the entropy is high and thus most likely contains encrypted data. Using specified resources, a breakpoint is reached and, in turn, triggers the decryption stage that is placed in memory. The next stage is then loaded using a matching file size. Unlike past versions, this version has no imported API functions, very few strings, but does employ the same code obfuscation. Obfuscation is accomplished via Control Flow Flattening. The payload is concealed by hiding information used in static analysis. Using DeMotet, imported functions that have been added to the payload can be seen. The static unpacker can use name hashing and strings decryption algorithms found in previous versions making DeMotet a viable analysis option. Finally, the communication protocol has been changed to HTTPS as opposed to HTTP. More information can be found in the blog post located within the Reference section below.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * A complete list of IoCs can be found here: [ IoCs.txt](/download/attachments/74055751/Emotet%20Back%20After%2010%20Month%20Absence%20IoCs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1638888793633&api=v2)\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Train users to be aware of access or manipulation attempts by an adversary to reduce the risk of successful spearphishing, social engineering, and other techniques that involve user interaction. (M1017)\n  * Use intrusion detection signatures to block traffic at network boundaries. (M1031)\n  * Block execution of code on a system through application control, and/or script blocking. (M1038)\n  * Enforce binary and application integrity with digital signature verification to prevent untrusted code from executing. (M1045)\n  * Perform audits or scans of systems, permissions, insecure software, insecure configurations, etc. to identify potential weaknesses. (M1047)\n  * Use signatures or heuristics to detect malicious software. (M1049)\n  * Implement configuration changes to software (other than the operating system) to mitigate security risks associated to how the software operates.

Their assessment is that the ransomware may be distributed by email and forum posts that masquerade as updates on the Russian/Ukrainian conflict. Fortinet also assesses that there is a ransomware builder available that the latest version of Chaos came from. Indications are, based on reporting, that the perpetrator(s) of this ransomware have no intent on providing decryption keys. Fortinet believes that Chaos malware is being used to destroy information rather than for monetary gain.

The DFIR Report has published an analysis of an attack in which BazarLoader was used to deploy the Diavol ransomware. The initial compromise was achieved using a spearphishing email that contained a link to OneDrive which directed the victim to a ZIP file that contained an ISO file. Inside the ISO was an LNK file and a DLL, the victim executing the LNK file initiating the BazarLoader infection. Multiple rounds of reconnaissance were conducted using various tools and multiple Cobalt Strike beacons were deployed on the initially compromised host. Eventually, the actor moved laterally via RDP to a host that contained shared files and installed AnyDesk and Filezilla which was used to exfiltrate data. Multiple techniques were used in attempts to obtain credentials and the actor moved on to critical hosts such as domain controllers and backup servers. On many hosts, AnyDesk was installed, and RDP access to all endpoints from the compromised central file server was established. The actual act of encrypting drives took place some 40 hours after the initial compromise and began with the execution of a batch file that stopped all services on a host, removed the Volume Shadow copies, and disabled the Windows automatic startup repair. RDP was then used to copy the Diavol ransomware executable to each system and then executed manually.

The attackers began by performing vulnerability scans using the legitimate Acunetix web scanner. They queried election-related sites for PDF files and URLs containing the words \u201cvote\u201d or \u201cvoter\u201d and \u201cregistration.\u201d With target websites identified, the actors then attempted to use scripted CURL activity to obtain voter information from these sites. Other attempted methods of access included attempted exploitation of known vulnerabilities, directory traversal, Structured Query Language (SQL) injection, web shell uploads, and leveraging unique flaws in websites. At least one state fell victim to these attacks, and the obtained information was subsequently used in propaganda videos distributed by the APT.

The attackers began by performing vulnerability scans using the legitimate Acunetix web scanner. They queried election-related sites for PDF files and URLs containing the words \u201cvote\u201d or \u201cvoter\u201d and \u201cregistration.\u201d With target websites identified, the actors then attempted to use scripted CURL activity to obtain voter information from these sites. Other attempted methods of access included attempted exploitation of known vulnerabilities, directory traversal, Structured Query Language (SQL) injection, web shell uploads, and leveraging unique flaws in websites. At least one state fell victim to these attacks, and the obtained information was subsequently used in propaganda videos distributed by the APT. This points to the goal of using such information in election-related disinformation campaigns.

It has been known on rare occasions to have been used in campaigns targeting users in Mexico and Spain. According to ESET, The actor behind Numando has been active since 2018 however, Numando is not frequently updated and does not appear to be under continuous development. It provides features common to banking Trojans such as overlay windows and backdoor access to an infected system. Currently, Numando is distributed using malspam with a ZIP file containing an MSI installer attached to the emails. Inside the installer is a CAB archive that contains an injector, an encrypted DLL which is the Numando payload, and a legitimate application. The legitimate application is used to sideload the Numando DLL. One other infection chain that was used by Numando starts with a downloader that downloads a ZIP file but ignores its content. Instead, it extracts the ZIP file's comment which is a hex-encoded and encrypted string that when decrypted provides the URL of the actual ZIP file whose contents are used in the infection chain. Numando uses a remote configuration that is stored in either Pastebin or YouTube pages.

It has been known on rare occasions to have been used in campaigns targeting users in Mexico and Spain. According to ESET, The actor behind Numando has been active since 2018 however, Numando is not frequently updated and does not appear to be under continuous development. It provides features common to banking Trojans such as overlay windows and backdoor access to an infected system. Currently, Numando is distributed using malspam with a ZIP file containing an MSI installer attached to the emails. Inside the installer is a CAB archive that contains an injector, an encrypted DLL which is the Numando payload, and a legitimate application. The legitimate application is used to sideload the Numando DLL. One other infection chain that was used by Numando starts with a downloader that downloads a ZIP file but ignores its content. Instead, it extracts the ZIP file's comment which is a hex-encoded and encrypted string that when decrypted provides the URL of the actual ZIP file whose contents are used in the infection chain. Numando uses a remote configuration that is stored in either Pastebin or YouTube pages.

The next stage in the exploit chain uses two Windows vulnerabilities: an information disclosure vulnerability, CVE-2021-31955, and a buffer overflow vulnerability, CVE-2021-31956.

The first executable is a service that is used as a launcher for the second, a remote shell.

In the ministry attack, two Windows servers were compromised by a yet unknown infection vector. The malware used in the attack was called wAgent, a memory resident-only application that pulls additional modules, as needed, from a remote server. Persistence is achieved by downloading an additional module for this purpose.

Trend Micro Research discovered the operation which uses compromised hosts in watering hole attacks to infect victims. The compromised hosts that were analysed for the report were all running a South Korean CMS named GNUBOARD. It is thought the hosts were compromised by exploiting known RCE vulnerabilities in the CMS. Two different infections chains are used, depending on the victim's browser. In at least some cases, South Korean IP addresses were blocked from accessing a site. If the victim browser is Internet Explorer, the attack begins with attempting to exploit the vulnerability CVE-2020-0674. If successful, a PowerShell loader is run which carries out checks for specific security software and may install up to three different backdoors on the victim system. Privilege escalation may be attempted through downloading a binary which is used to exploit the vulnerability CVE-2019-1458. If successful, the backdoors are executed with system privileges. Another vulnerability, CVE-2016-0189, may also be exploited in the attacks. If the victim browser is Chrome, two vulnerabilities are chained together for exploitation. One is CVE-2019-5782, the second does not have a CVE number assigned to it. The attack code is based on publicly available proof of concept code. Checks are made for specific security software and the infection chain will result in up to three different backdoors being installed on the victim system. One of the changes to the SLUB malware is that instead of using Slack for communications, it now uses an open-source version of Mattermost which has functionality similar to Slack.

Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Phishing\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nTargeting everything from journalism to civil society organization, the Kimsuky group is ramping up their phishing efforts. Initial hypothesis indicates the group is harvesting credentials for espionage but also other objectives not yet known. A malicious document discussing North Korean defectors is used to lure victims. The document contains a UPX packed binary. The binary attempts to contact a C2 server. The document closely matches past documents in that it uses the same obfuscation technique, the C2 matches, contains VBA code similarities, and the digital signature signer name is dropped into the file. By all appearances, it looks as though the IP responsible for hosting the domain is dedicated to a single user. A secondary technique is to pivot from similar subdomains using unique strings. According to VirusTotal, the malicious document serves a specific link which is believed to be the pivot point. This pivot point leads to several other domains with each ending in a .work URL. These .work domains lead to several subdomains used in the campaign. Two entries containing rya in the domain are believed to lead to Radio Free Asia - a potential target. Another contains ohchr, believed to be the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Additional targets can be gleaned from the list of domains uncovered. Analysis uncovered efforts dating back as far as December 2019 and continuing as recently as August of this year.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Phishing\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nTargeting everything from journalism to civil society organization, the Kimsuky group is ramping up their phishing efforts. Initial hypothesis indicates the group is harvesting credentials for espionage but also other objectives not yet known. A malicious document discussing North Korean defectors is used to lure victims. The document contains a UPX packed binary. The binary attempts to contact a C2 server. The document closely matches past documents in that it uses the same obfuscation technique, the C2 matches, contains VBA code similarities, and the digital signature signer name is dropped into the file. By all appearances, it looks as though the IP responsible for hosting the domain is dedicated to a single user. A secondary technique is to pivot from similar subdomains using unique strings. According to VirusTotal, the malicious document serves a specific link which is believed to be the pivot point. This pivot point leads to several other domains with each ending in a .work URL. These .work domains lead to several subdomains used in the campaign. Two entries containing rya in the domain are believed to lead to Radio Free Asia - a potential target. Another contains ohchr, believed to be the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Additional targets can be gleaned from the list of domains uncovered. Analysis uncovered efforts dating back as far as December 2019 and continuing as recently as August of this year.

An error is then displayed indicating processing failed, and users are redirected to the legitimate checkout page. Interestingly, this skimmer uses a domain generation algorithm to produce the exfiltration domains.

One of the vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-30657) addressed in the updates for macOS Big Sur and Catalina has been independently reported as being exploited in the wild. Apple notes in their release details that the vulnerability may allow malicious applications to bypass Gatekeeper checks. A report from Jamf notes that a variant of the Shlayer malware is being spread through a malicious application.

Since at least 2014, Agent Tesla has seen a significant growth in use, possibly because cracked versions have been released. This year also marks a change in its delivery methods to include exploits, Covid-19 phishing campaigns, and advanced steganography. Additionally, innovative obfuscation techniques have been added to its arsenal. The spearphishing method is based on an RFQ (Request for Quote) order sent to employees who routinely process such requests. Even when the malicious email was quarantined by protection systems, some employees actually pulled it out of quarantine because they were convinced of its legitimacy. Such RFQ attachments are a known DDE exploit that pulls the next stage of infection from the malware's command and control server when opened. Two Equation Editor exploits, CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802, are also part of the infection chain. Successfully exploited, a small, obfuscated loader is downloaded and executed. This loader makes use of steganography by hiding the next stage in a PNG image to execute a second loader. This second loader is injected into a legitimate RegAsm application. The final payload is the main Agent Tesla Dark Stealer module, which is also run from the RegAsm application. Persistence is achieved through a scheduled task.

The first is the C&C communication method, which uses WSS (WebSocket over TLS). This may circumvent traffic detections currently used to detect Mirai C&C communications. The second notable feature is the addition of new functionality including the ability to modify an infected devices resolv.conf file, configure iptables, execute a reverse shell, report a device's information to the C&C server, upgrade the malware, and execute system commands.

Docker images, based on Alpine Linux, are being attacked. Should the attack be successful, the server is infected with a cryptominer and DDoS bot malware. Infection begins on an exposed Docker server by creating a Docker container and running a script that retrieves an XMI file, which is really a bash script inside the container. This script then attempts to move laterally across the network, targeting hosts listed in the known_hosts file in the .ssh directory.

Docker images, based on Alpine Linux, are being attacked. Should the attack be successful, the server is infected with a cryptominer and DDoS bot malware. Infection begins on an exposed Docker server by creating a Docker container and running a script that retrieves an XMI file, which is really a bash script inside the container. This script then attempts to move laterally across the network, targeting hosts listed in the known_hosts file in the .ssh directory.

This malware functions as a cryptostealer, that can exfiltrate wallet contents, stored passwords, and clipboard contents. The samples seen by the researchers were heavily obfuscated, and so the code had to be dumped from memory before it could be analyzed. Machines infected with BHUNT tended to have some form of crack for windows on their system, so the researchers speculate that this could be how the malware was introduced to the victim systems. Once installed, the malware checks for the existence of various crypto wallets, and sends this to the C2 server, along with victim host information. The malware has several methods for stealing data. It can read the contents of a wallet and directly exfiltrate it. It can also search for Firefox profiles that contain account tokens and exfiltrate them, before killing any Firefox processes.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Details\n\n  *  **Malware Type:** Cryptostealer\n  *  **Associated Threat Actors:** Unknown\n  *  **Associated Payloads:** BHUNT\n  *  **Targets:** Unknown\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Malicious Fake Installers **  \n**\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Data Theft\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nBitdefender has discovered a new family of malware they are calling BHUNT. This malware functions as a cryptostealer, that can exfiltrate wallet contents, stored passwords, and clipboard contents. The samples seen by the researchers were heavily obfuscated, and so the code had to be dumped from memory before it could be analyzed. Machines infected with BHUNT tended to have some form of crack for windows on their system, so the researchers speculate that this could be how the malware was introduced to the victim systems. Once installed, the malware checks for the existence of various crypto wallets, and sends this to the C2 server, along with victim host information. The malware has several methods for stealing data. It can read the contents of a wallet and directly exfiltrate it. It can also search for Firefox profiles that contain account tokens and exfiltrate them, before killing any Firefox processes. The C2 server used by the sample used a dynamic DNS server, meaning that the researchers can't obtain a persistent IP address used by the attackers.

First, ransomware attacks drove data breaches, making up 36% of data breaches as ransomware attackers incorporate data theft and leaks into their arsenal. In addition, manufacturing, government, and media/telecommunications appeared to be hit hardest by data breaches in 2020. Lastly, data breaches in 2020 appeared to peak in March, suggesting that breach trends may be loosely connected to COVID-19 pandemic trends as many organizations made abrupt changes to operations in March 2020. The full story and analysis is available to IBM X-Force Premier Threat Intelligence clients at the link below.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Review the source article for full details.\n\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * Premier Threat Intelligence clients can read more at: <https://station.trustar.co/constellation/reports/f62b5b9d-bddf-4a29-9fd9-864bc8f289b8>\n\n  * To learn more about X-Force Premier Threat Intelligence, visit: <https://www.ibm.com/security/services/threat-intelligence>"

The origin of LokiLocker isn't clear but there are some indicators that suggest it could be of Iranian origin, it's also possible that the developers may simply be trying to distract from its actual originating location. Early versions of LokiLocker were distributed inside Trojanized hacking tools used for brute-forcing credentials. Files are encrypted using AES and LokiLocker also provides wiper functionality that deletes files and overwrites the MBR. The wiper is used if the victim doesn't pay the demanded ransom by the due date.

The campaign specifically targeted a Docker container running Linux, although the initial access method to that container is not specified. Once on the system, the threat actor executed a shell script that, in turn, downloaded and executed a second-stage script. Performing similar actions, the second-stage attempts to download and execute the final shell script in the sequence.

Their research began when the operators of the SunCrypt ransomware contacted them directly and shared information regarding their involvement in the Maze cartel. Based on the conversation, it appears that the Maze ransomware group may provide its cartel members with access to victim networks in exchange for a portion of the ransom payment. In regards to the ransomware itself, the family appears to have been around since October 2019 but with minimal activity. Its payload, which comes in the form of a DLL, is installed via a heavily obfuscated PowerShell script. Once installed on the system, it connects to a URL and provides system information. Notably, the IP it connects to is known to be associated with Maze threat actors, indicating the group shares infrastructure with its cartel members. After checking in with the remote server, encryption takes place and a hexadecimal hash is appended to each encrypted file's name. Additionally, a ransom note is dropped in every folder. This ransom note directs victims to a Tor site where they can negotiate the ransom payment with the operators. A link to a leak site is also provided alongside a threat to publish the victim's data if the ransom is not paid. BleepingComputer notes that ransomware sample is still being analyzed so these are only preliminary findings.

The technique was implemented after the first two attempts to deliver the payload directly to the victim host were blocked. At this point, the operators instead dropped a virtual machine and an 11 year old copy of VirtualBox onto the system via an MSI installer. Running as a headless device, the VM executed a series of files stored on its virtual hard drive. First, a batch file is used to rename the VM's computer name and join the VM to the victim's network. Furthermore, shared network drives are mapped to the host and a shared folder is created and shared with the rest of the network. Persistence is established via the Startup folder on infected hosts. This technique was originally observed in use by the Ragnar Locker ransomware operators. The key difference between the two campaigns is that Ragnar Locker used a Windows XP machine whereas Maze used a Windows 7 image.

    "output": "\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Vulnerability\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\n  \nResearchers from Independent Security Evaluators have published a blog on their efforts to reverse engineer the popular dating app Bumble. The research has shown that an unverified user can bypass paying for some premium features. The attacker could also have the ability to dump the entire user-base with pictures. Some of the techniques have been mitigated, while others remain. Part of a mitigated issue is the use of sequential user IDs by Bumble as well as updating its encryption scheme. Additionally, providing distance to other users is no longer possible, which eliminates the possibility of using triangulation to locate a specific user. One technique is using an endpoint to obtain Facebook likes, pictures, and other profile information. One limitation is the attack must have the encrypted user ID available to them or one which they own. It is suspected that Bumble will address this vulnerability in the coming days. Bypassing other premium features is still functional. The use of REST APIs for inter-application communication can allow client-side communication in a stateless form. Using the Burp Suite, the team was able to explore API calls and perform the necessary functions to trigger the unintentional data leak. \n\n## Unlimited Votes\n\nBumble's mobile app limits the number of \"swipes\" a non-premium user can use per day. The request is done through an action called SERVER_ENCOUNTERS_VOTE. If the options are manipulated, an attacker could receive unlimited votes during a 24-hour period. Since there is no check on the APIs, the web application user could achieve this rather easily. \n\n## Backtrack\n\nShould a user accidentally swipe left (deny) a prospective match, the backtrack function allows for removing the parameter for exclusion. An API voting request directly would allow an attacker to change his vote from left to right (accept). \n\n## Beeline\n\nOne of the most useful functions to an attacker is the ability to see all those who've swiped right on them. Assigned user codes allow for the exploitation of this information and can be modified and used for other endpoints. \n\n## Enumeration\n\nFinally, perhaps the most useful feature is the ability to find users by employing unlimited filters.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Vulnerability\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\n  \nResearchers from Independent Security Evaluators have published a blog on their efforts to reverse engineer the popular dating app Bumble. The research has shown that an unverified user can bypass paying for some premium features. The attacker could also have the ability to dump the entire user-base with pictures. Some of the techniques have been mitigated, while others remain. Part of a mitigated issue is the use of sequential user IDs by Bumble as well as updating its encryption scheme. Additionally, providing distance to other users is no longer possible, which eliminates the possibility of using triangulation to locate a specific user. One technique is using an endpoint to obtain Facebook likes, pictures, and other profile information. One limitation is the attack must have the encrypted user ID available to them or one which they own. It is suspected that Bumble will address this vulnerability in the coming days. Bypassing other premium features is still functional. The use of REST APIs for inter-application communication can allow client-side communication in a stateless form. Using the Burp Suite, the team was able to explore API calls and perform the necessary functions to trigger the unintentional data leak. \n\n## Unlimited Votes\n\nBumble's mobile app limits the number of \"swipes\" a non-premium user can use per day. The request is done through an action called SERVER_ENCOUNTERS_VOTE. If the options are manipulated, an attacker could receive unlimited votes during a 24-hour period. Since there is no check on the APIs, the web application user could achieve this rather easily. \n\n## Backtrack\n\nShould a user accidentally swipe left (deny) a prospective match, the backtrack function allows for removing the parameter for exclusion. An API voting request directly would allow an attacker to change his vote from left to right (accept). \n\n## Beeline\n\nOne of the most useful functions to an attacker is the ability to see all those who've swiped right on them. Assigned user codes allow for the exploitation of this information and can be modified and used for other endpoints. \n\n## Enumeration\n\nFinally, perhaps the most useful feature is the ability to find users by employing unlimited filters. This could allow an attacker to limit search results to a certain radius. The results would also include pictures and Facebook (if connected) interests and pages liked by the victim. \n\nFurther technical information can be found in the blog post located within the Reference section below. \n\n# CVEs\n\n  * N/A\n\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Review the source article for full details.\n\n  * Apply applicable patches, updates, or workarounds as necessary. \n\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://blog.securityevaluators.com/reverse-engineering-bumbles-api-a2a0d39b3a87>"

This malware is deployed by either phishing campaigns or malvertising. Alternatively, it uses the PurpleFox exploit kit to exploit a machine and install the malware. Once installed, it can spread without any user interaction. The goal of this worm module is to look for and exploit several known vulnerabilities and install itself into the new machine. DirtyMoe generates targets using a pseudo-random IP generation algorithm, allowing it to expand to machines hidden behind NAT. The generated IPs are scanned for any known vulnerabilities.

This malware is deployed by either phishing campaigns or malvertising. Alternatively, it uses the PurpleFox exploit kit to exploit a machine and install the malware. Once installed, it can spread without any user interaction. The goal of this worm module is to look for and exploit several known vulnerabilities and install itself into the new machine. DirtyMoe generates targets using a pseudo-random IP generation algorithm, allowing it to expand to machines hidden behind NAT. The generated IPs are scanned for any known vulnerabilities. If the potential victim is deemed exploitable, an attack is prepared and launched. The majority of these infections have been in North America and Europe.

Hybrid campaigns were identified that targeted both Windows and Android users in Bangladesh and other countries. The campaigns were connected due to the use of shared C2 infrastructure between the Android and Windows samples. As with previous LodaRAT campaigns, the Windows payload was delivered via a malicious RTF document that uses a memory corruption exploit to download a malicious SCT file.

Hybrid campaigns were identified that targeted both Windows and Android users in Bangladesh and other countries. The campaigns were connected due to the use of shared C2 infrastructure between the Android and Windows samples. As with previous LodaRAT campaigns, the Windows payload was delivered via a malicious RTF document that uses a memory corruption exploit to download a malicious SCT file.

TunnelVision, an Iranian-aligned threat actor operating in the Middle East and United States, is known for their use of 1-day vulnerability exploits and tunneling tools. In recent cases, they have used the Log4Shell exploit to target VMware Horizon servers. The exploit is used to execute PowerShell commands that will download files and return command outputs via a webhook. The group additionally uses PowerShell reverse shells to perform further post-compromise actions.

TunnelVision, an Iranian-aligned threat actor operating in the Middle East and United States, is known for their use of 1-day vulnerability exploits and tunneling tools. In recent cases, they have used the Log4Shell exploit to target VMware Horizon servers. The exploit is used to execute PowerShell commands that will download files and return command outputs via a webhook. The group additionally uses PowerShell reverse shells to perform further post-compromise actions. Two different reverse shells were identified that ultimately provided backdoor access, allowing TunnelVision to execute recon commands, add a backdoor user, harvest credentials, tunnel RDP traffic, and deploy further reverse shells. The researchers noted an overlap between this group and those called Phosphorus by Microsoft and Charming Kitten or Nemesis Kitten by CrowdStrike.

    "output": "You are asking about a specific threat report. Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nCybercriminals have continually used the COVID-19 pandemic as a stepping stone for targeting both industry and work-from-home (WFH) users alike. From phishing emails to malware to ransomware, the attack vectors have remained the same with updates mostly pertaining to some sort of COVID-themed lure. Listed below are a few of the most observed threats.\n\n## Phishing Emails and Payloads\n\nPhishing in the time of the pandemic has evolved to include COVID themes. From targeted geographic areas to fake websites set up for credential gathering, actors take great care in the crafting of these campaigns. The threat actors use language-specific emails to lure users within a given geographic area into clicking on links, downloading infected documents, or providing sensitive information through simple replies. Most of the phishing emails reportedly use COVID within the subject line along with some other form of pertinent information such as protection information, attachments with victim lists, executable files, etc. In their research, GData has analyzed one particular email infected with malware. The malware within the attachment was GuLoader, the malware that downloads its payload from cloud storage services. This particular example downloaded the Parallax RAT, a backdoor used for administrative privileges on a target. The RAT can be used across the spectrum of Windows OS versions. Capabilities of this RAT include keylogging, credential theft, and remote command execution. In addition to Parallax, several other malware families were discovered in the research to include: Remcos, Nanocore, Netwire, Agent Tesla, and other trojans. \n\n## Wipers and Master Boot Record Modification\n\nWipers, malicious programs that destroy data on machines have been around since at least 2008. Unlike ransomware, there is no demand for payment in exchange for data recovery, the sole purpose of this malware is to destroy data beyond recovery. This malware is connected to COVID through its name, \"coronavirus.exe.\" By disabling features such as task manager, and User Access Controls, once executed, the machine is at the mercy of the attacker's malware. Before the victim can even respond, the MBR is being overwritten. Other variants of these types of malwares were also observed with slightly different functionality and features. \n\n## Jokerware\n\nA variant also discovered was a joke malware that tricks a user into thinking their MBR is being overwritten when, in fact, it's not. These types of malware may be harmless but they still cause panic among WFH users and could cause \"damage control mode\" to kick in. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe research conducted by the GData team shows a variety of methods threat actors will employ in an effort to invade unsuspecting user's computers and company networks. As long as the pandemic rages on, these actors will continue to employ any methods necessary to achieve their goal of financial gain, disruption, or even jokes. \n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report.   \n\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n  * Exercise caution with attachments and links in emails.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/global-pandemic-remcos-tesla-netwire>",

Once a foothold has been obtained, the attackers then searched for other containers that were operating inside the Kubernetes nodes and attempted to exploit them. A crypto mining script (xmrig) was installed in successfully compromised containers.

The sample they obtained was being distributed via crack websites that offer premium software that has supposedly been cracked to allow free access. Downloading a program from this site provides a ZIP file containing a password-protected archive, which, in turn, contains the dropper payload. This dropper is an executable that drops a stealer component that provides victim system information to the attacker. A second-stage payload is then downloaded that installs an AutoIT cryptominer and the DanaBot payload to the system. The DanaBot payload includes hardcoded configuration information, including the affiliate ID (two of which were discovered by Proofpoint), a version number, embedded hash values, C2 IPs and ports, and a Tor C2 domain. The malware can run in several alternative modes including a TOR mode, process injection mode, and a module mode. Proofpoint's analysis focuses on running mode 0, which is the main component. Available commands from the C2 response include those to get an updated list of C2 addresses, enable a stealer, change to Tor-based C2 communications, exfiltrate arbitrary information from the victim system, obtain a command shell, download and execute additional modules, and more.

This script includes a command to download and run the malicious docker image on the user's system. Within this image, there is a script called 'pause' which installs several utilities including masscan and zgrab, which are then used to scan for other docker nodes on the victim's subnet. If found, the script will install the image onto that node, and download the initial script to that node to begin the process again. Once this stage is complete, the script will then deploy a cryptominer and a backdoor which will then contact the C2 server. The bash script also includes a command to download a rootkit shell script.

The RAT, PyVil RAT is being distributed by the cyber group, Evilnum. The group has been active for at least the past two years using a variety of tools. The group has historically targeted the Financial Technology industry and uses the Know Your Customer procedure to begin infection. Included in the new malware are deviations from the infection chain, persistence, infrastructure, and tools observed including modified, legitimate executables, a multi-process delivery of the payload, and the PyVil RAT. The new infection chain begins with spearphishing emails with attached ZIP archives containing LNK files, which drop a JavaScript Trojan. The attached files masquerade as utility bills, credit card photos, and driver license photos. Upon execution, a JavaScript file is written and executed which, in turn, replaces the LNK file with a PDF. This JavaScript is merely a dropper and has no C2 communication capabilities. This is but the first step in the new infection chain that culminates with the delivery of the PyVil RAT. After the PDF is placed, the JS file is copied which leads to the execution of ddpp.exe embedded in the LNK file. A registry key is entered for persistence and a scheduled task is created. The scheduled task is responsible for retrieving payloads. The executable ddpp.exe is a Java Web Start Launcher that has been trojanized to execute malicious code. The functionality of ddpp.exe is that of a downloader for next stage infection. From this point, shellcode is unpacked and connects to a C2 using a GET request. The malware downloads another encrypted executable, saved as fplayer.exe, which is then executed with a new scheduled task. This downloaded executable acts as an additional downloader. The payload is loaded into memory and is a fileless RAT. Again, at this point, the file is executed with a scheduled task named \"Adobe Update Task.\" Several arguments are executed with this EXE file. This particular file appears to be a trojanized version of \"Stereoscopic 3D driver Installer.\" When this file is executed, further shellcode is unpacked and connects to the C2 via a GET request. A final payload is received, which is the PyVil RAT. This RAT is heavily obfuscated to prevent decompiling the payload. The RAT has several functions such as: keylogger, running cmd commands, taking screenshots, obtaining more Python scripts, dropping and unloading executables among others. C2 communications are accomplished by POST HTTP requests and are RC4 encrypted with hardcoded keys. The C2 domain changes frequently but appears to resolve to the same three IP addresses.

A Virtual Hard Drive is the delivery mechanism and requires the victims to use Windows 10 in order to access the malicious files. The malware is heavily obfuscated but attribution was made to the Sofacy threat actor through the use of forensics in samples obtained from prior campaigns. Sofacy, also known as APT28, FancyBear, and STRONTIUM, was responsible for the compromise of the Democratic National Committee. Originally written in Delphi, the malware has since been translated into several other programming languages, thus widening its footprint and possible targets. The malware works by having a user open a VHD which includes two files, a PDF and an executable masquerading as a Word document. The PDF is a copy of slides from a presentation about the Sinopharm International Corporation, a company based out of China and a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products. The company is currently working on a COVID-19 vaccination and presents an attractive lure to unsuspecting users. The second file is the actual malware, and only 9 of 70 anti-virus engines were able to detect it. The malware is obfuscated with gobfuscator and doesn't collect the same information as noted in prior campaigns. Instead, only the hostname and TEMP folder path are gathered. Screenshot code has been implemented by the author and does not use a third-party software to accomplish the task. Additionally, anti-debugging checks are performed through the use of the Windows API, IsDebuggerPresent. If present, the malware enters an infinite sleep. Screenshots are uploaded to a C2 server and, should the C2 return a second stage, the file is written to the target disk and executed.

The latest documents found in this campaign are using text that impersonates AhnLab to trick users into opening the document and allowing macros to be run. Each document has a financial or cryptocurrency-themed title as a lure. When the file is opened, a Word macro file is downloaded and executed after the user grants permission. Upon execution, the macro is set to execute whenever the openState property of the Windows Meda Player object is changed. It then downloads and executes malicious programs. System information is sent to a hardcoded C2 address, although at the time of writing this address was not accessible. Persistence for the downloaded malware is gained through the registry.

The issue is caused by how resource-based policies are validated. Specifically, a Principal field is used to identify the users and roles allowed to access a resource.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Information Leak\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nPalo Alto has published a blog post detailing how Amazon Web Services (AWS) APIs can be abused to leak information about target accounts. 22 APIs across 16 services, including Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Amazon Key Management Service (KMS) and Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), were found to be vulnerable to this technique. The issue is caused by how resource-based policies are validated. Specifically, a Principal field is used to identify the users and roles allowed to access a resource. If an API call is made that attempts to use a non-existent account to access the resource, an error message reveals that the account does not exist. This means that attackers could use a wordlist to attempt to identify users and roles present in the target environment, which could then be used in a variety of ways for further malicious activity.

The new method involves a lure document that uses a macro to extract an embedded SFX package, which is executed when the document is closed and installs the Foudre loader and backdoor. Foudre downloads and installs a new component named Tonnerre that provides functionality beyond that of Foudre. While Foudre and Tonnerre use HTTP to communicate with their C&C servers, Tonnerre uses FTP to exfiltrate data. The most recent version of Foudre covered in the report was observed in October 2020 and has some notable changes over past versions including a revised algorithm for generating domains, an RSA signature file is used to verify a C&C server, and the string \"Foudre\" was removed and replaced with \u201cForm1\u201d.

The group's targets include electronics manufacturers, governments, religious organizations, and universities, located in East Asia and the Middle East, and in the past, Taiwan. The group has only attacked a small number of victims. Gelsemium's toolkit includes its own malware which ESET has named Gelsemine, Gelsenicine, and Gelsevirine. Other malware known to have been used by the group includes Chrommme and OwlProxy. Gelsemine is a first-stage dropper that contains multiple binaries used in further stages. Gelsenicine is a loader that retrieves and executes the next stage, Gelsevirine, which is the last stage of the chain. ESET notes that recently, Gelsemium exploited an Exchange server vulnerability to install the ChinaChopper webshell, which was later used to execute the first stage dropper, Gelsemine. It is unclear which Exchange server vulnerability was exploited but ESET believes it may be CVE-2020-0688. A notable tactic employed by Gelsemium is the use of Dynamic DNS (DDNS) domain names for its C&C servers.

I need overview, related mitre attack informations if exists, IoCs, recommandations and possible references.",
    "context": "",
    "output": "You are asking about a specific threat report. Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Scam, Monetary Theft, Social Engineering\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nThose of us that have been in the computing world for a number of years are aware of the \"Microsoft Tech Support\" and \"Social Security\" scams. But there are those who, either from lack of participation on Social Media or age, may not be aware of the evil people do to make money. If a potential victim is taken in by the social engineering techniques, the intimidation and threats from these scams, they can potentially lose a good portion, if not all, of their life savings they have set aside for their retirement years. The following is the result of an interview with such a victim.\n\nShe and her husband had moved back to their home town area into an assisted living facility, to be near their sons. The husband was a victim of dementia and died from the disease about a year later. The two of them were, by no means, \"wealthy\", but she still retained enough income to live on and to purchase the occasional birthday and Christmas gifts. There was even enough money for a bowl of chili from Wendy's when her sons weren't around to pay for it.\n\nThen there was that faithful day, when the telephone rang with a number that appeared to be from Washington DC. The caller informed the lady that there had been an attempt by someone to take money out of her Social Security account and that her account had been frozen. Since the lady did not immediately hang up, the criminal on the line thought he may have just found a new victim. Using social engineering techniques, he was able to convince the lady that not only were there arrest warrants made out for her (after all, cocaine had been found in the trunk of her car), but that he might be able to assist her with getting the charges dropped if she paid the fine. He assured her that he would be right there to help her gather and transfer the money himself. The best way to transfer the money would be through gift cards that she would purchase in $200 increments. He warned her, not to tell anyone what was going on, because, after all, this was a federal investigation.\n\nThe next day, the caller once again contacted the lady and guided her through the steps she would be taking that day. First, she would go to the bank and withdraw $3,000 in cash, which would be used to purchase the gift cards. Then she would go to Kroger (a local grocery chain) for the first card purchases. Again she was warned not to tell anyone what she was doing or why. The staff at the assisted living facility, her family, her friends, no one was to be told of her secretive mission. And she must stay on the line with the criminal at all times so that he could walk her through what needed to be done.\n\nShe arrived at the bank just before noon and withdrew $3,000 from her account, money that otherwise would have been spent on her assisted living costs. Next she was to go to Kroger where she would purchase some E-Bay gift cards valued at $200 each. While keeping her line open at all times, she was to return to her car and scratch off the covering to the redemption code. For each card, she was to read off the thirteen digits found underneath to the criminal on the line. Next, she was to go to Walgreens for more purchases. This time the gift cards would be for Google Play, again for the same amount.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the assisted facility, those in charge were becoming worried about the lady. She was only supposed to be going to the bank and should have returned a while ago. So they called the point of contact to inform him of the missing lady. He, in turn, called his brother and they both began calling the lady, trying to get her to answer. At the time, she was not answering any calls other than from the criminal, what few times she wasn't already on the line with him. The two brothers, not knowing about the calls, were fearful something had happened to her. They even had contacted the police regarding a possible traffic accident involving her, since they were unaware of the scam taking place.\n\nJust as the brothers were about to reach the city limits, she finally called and told them she was at Walgreens and wanted to know if they were coming for a visit. Relieved that she appeared to be okay, they indicated that while the visit was not a planned one, yes, they were coming. She indicated she would be back at the facility shortly, then, for their visit. The brothers arrived first and waited. For thirty minutes. Since they had just passed Walgreens on the way to the facility and it was less than five minutes away, they returned to see what was wrong. The lady was acting strangely and was just getting into her car while trying to talk on the phone. They all drove back to the facility for a visit.\n\nWhile the brothers were explaining how concerned they were about her being gone for so long and not answering her phone, her phone rang and she promptly answered it. Her side of the conversation sounded strange, subdued, almost secretive. The older brother picked up the phone and asked who was on the other end. Upon hearing a foreign accent, he became concerned and asked what this call was in regards to. Upon hearing the words \"Social Security\", combined the secretive actions of the lady, he immediately arrived at the correct conclusion that the lady was being scammed and may have said a few things that would have required soap to wash out of his mouth in his youth.\n\nThe facts and events of the previous twenty-four hours were slowly drawn out of the lady. Her reluctance to hand over the cards, so their balances could be checked, shed some light on the brain washing and social engineering techniques used on her. They assured they lady that her Social Security account was not frozen, that there were not warrants out for her arrest, and that cocaine had not been discovered in her car.\n\nWhile this vile criminal may have gotten some money out of the lady's account, her inexperience in dealing with gift cards and her lack of knowledge of places of purchase the criminal was trying to lead her to at least allowed her to retain some of her purchased cards that day. An expensive lesson, but one hopefully her declining years will allow her to retain against another incident.\n\nTales such as these appear all the time on Social Media and often they are written off as slight exaggerations. When the \"lady\" is your own mother and you walk into the middle of what otherwise might have been a successful scam, it hits home and it hits deep.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Warn your elderly parents, relatives, and friends of the dangers of these types of scam calls\n  * Report attempts, especially successful attempts, to local law enforcement agencies\n  * Review the Social Security document warnings on such incidents\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://www.ssa.gov/scam/>",

Not only are the victim's files encrypted, but prior to encryption, they are exfiltrated back to the attackers. Thus, if the victim does not pay the ransom to decrypt their locked files, they are then threatened with the exposure of their files to the Internet at large.

A site on the Dark Web contains the list of current victims and potential links to their private data. MountLocker is generally installed in one of two ways - as a 32-bit or 64-bit Windows portable executable (PE) or as a Microsoft Installer (MSI) package. Prior to beginning encryption, MountLocker attempts to disable a number of security products as well as products known for keeping files open, such as databases or Microsoft Office applications.

It was assessed that threat actors were able to construct an artificial order billed to the target's physical home address. As planned, the target would then click the \u201cCancel Order\u201d option and be redirected to a pre-filled page containing their first name, last name, phone number, and physical address. Once that is done by selecting \u201cValidate\u201d option, the victim is directed to another page and duped into providing their credit card information for reimbursement.

As with before, the malware is delivered via infected Xcode projects and is used to steal information from various apps. Since previous reporting, analysts were able to identify the mechanism for stealing this information. The malware steals application files from the Application sandbox directory, which does not require admin privileges. The application files are archived in ZIP format and exfiltrated to a C2 server. Where administrator privileges are needed, a single command is used to prompt users to grant the permissions via a fake dialog box. The scripts leveraged by XCSSET show the capability to steal information from TElegram, Contacts, Evernote, Notes, Chrome, Opera, Skype, and WeChat. The researchers also provide a brief overview of recent C2 infrastructure changes.

As with before, the malware is delivered via infected Xcode projects and is used to steal information from various apps. Since previous reporting, analysts were able to identify the mechanism for stealing this information. The malware steals application files from the Application sandbox directory, which does not require admin privileges. The application files are archived in ZIP format and exfiltrated to a C2 server. Where administrator privileges are needed, a single command is used to prompt users to grant the permissions via a fake dialog box. The scripts leveraged by XCSSET show the capability to steal information from TElegram, Contacts, Evernote, Notes, Chrome, Opera, Skype, and WeChat. The researchers also provide a brief overview of recent C2 infrastructure changes. For more information, see the Trend Micro blog post in the Reference section.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report. \n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/g/updated-xcsset-malware-targets-telegram--other-apps.html>"

First, the .reg file is used to disable UAC and malware protection. Then the Babuk downloader is executed, which first launches the Allakore RAT to establish a C2 connection back to the attacker. After performing various defense evasion tactics, the downloader ultimately downloads and executes a BAT script and executable. The BAT script performs further defense evasion. The executable file is the final payload, the Babuk ransomware. Files are encrypted and data is stolen with a ransom being demanded in order to restore access and prevent data leak.

One of the tactics they use is to say that TikTok is available again in India and this is the new app. Another is that they need to install the app to register for a free Lenovo laptop being given out to students in India by the Government of India. The malicious app will display ads that provide revenue to the threat actor.

    "output": "Sure! Here is the information I have about the threat: Spearphishing Campaign Using Short-Lived Domains To Steal Credentials\nThe DomainTools Research team has published details of a spearphishing campaign that is targeting major organizations to steal SharePoint credentials.\n\n# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Spearphishing\n  *  **Target:** Major Corporatins in the Middle East\n  *  **Lure:** Finance Themed PDF\n  *  **Payload:** Phishing Link Via False Invoice PDF\n  *  **Compromised Data:** SharePoint Credentials\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nThe DomainTools Research team has discovered a spearphishing campaign that uses a SharePoint template to target employees at major corporations. The campaign seems to focus on companies in the Middle East. The campaign was originally identified when a malicious PDF document was discovered containing a legitimate email address, suggesting that it was part of a larger spearphishing campaign. Upon further investigation, the researchers discovered over 70 versions of this document, where each document had a unique email address and link. The one connection between all of these links was that it linked to a file named 'red.htm', hosted on different subdomains of 'glitch.me'. Glitch provides a tool for web application development that allows for the five-minute hosting of web applications. The temporary nature of this site makes it perfect for serving malicious content.

      "xfe_report": "# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Spearphishing\n  *  **Target:** Major Corporatins in the Middle East\n  *  **Lure:** Finance Themed PDF\n  *  **Payload:** Phishing Link Via False Invoice PDF\n  *  **Compromised Data:** SharePoint Credentials\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nThe DomainTools Research team has discovered a spearphishing campaign that uses a SharePoint template to target employees at major corporations. The campaign seems to focus on companies in the Middle East. The campaign was originally identified when a malicious PDF document was discovered containing a legitimate email address, suggesting that it was part of a larger spearphishing campaign. Upon further investigation, the researchers discovered over 70 versions of this document, where each document had a unique email address and link. The one connection between all of these links was that it linked to a file named 'red.htm', hosted on different subdomains of 'glitch.me'. Glitch provides a tool for web application development that allows for the five-minute hosting of web applications. The temporary nature of this site makes it perfect for serving malicious content. The researchers were able to find a live site that displays the phishing site, attempting to steal SharePoint credentials. Once the credentials are stolen, the user is redirected to the legitimate site. The earliest document from this campaign found by the researchers dates back to September 2021.
