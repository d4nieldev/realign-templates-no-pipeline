The attack begins with a phishing email containing a malicious link that will download a zip file. This contains an LNK file, that will download a DOT file on execution and place it in the Microsoft Word startup folder. At this stage, the user will be distracted by a decoy PDF file that will be displayed. After this, every time the user opens a Word document, the DOT file will load and execute a macro to download a second file and execute it. At this point, the researchers were unable to retrieve the final payload from the server. The decoy PDF files seen in this attack were related to international relations between Japan and South Korea.

The stealer is able to steal from many different browsers, as well as VPN, FTP, Messaging and Gaming apps. In addition to this, it can perform financial theft using keylogger functionality. The developer of the malware claims it is undetectable by security software. The malware is encoded using a rot13 cipher and executes in memory rather than dropping a payload. Upon execution, the malware first searches for files and steals them before stealing data from browsers. It can steal from almost all Chromium-based browsers, as well as MS Edge and Firefox-based browsers. It then moves onto other applications such as Telegram and Steam. All of this data is collated, along with system information and screenshots and is compressed into a folder. The stealer uses Telegram to retrieve the remote server IP and sends the compressed folder. The malware also contained unused functionality, such as a keylogger. This could be controlled using a builder which was provided by the TA, and allows customization of the malware.

Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Vulnerability\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\n  \nResearchers from Independent Security Evaluators have published a blog on their efforts to reverse engineer the popular dating app Bumble. The research has shown that an unverified user can bypass paying for some premium features. The attacker could also have the ability to dump the entire user-base with pictures. Some of the techniques have been mitigated, while others remain. Part of a mitigated issue is the use of sequential user IDs by Bumble as well as updating its encryption scheme. Additionally, providing distance to other users is no longer possible, which eliminates the possibility of using triangulation to locate a specific user. One technique is using an endpoint to obtain Facebook likes, pictures, and other profile information. One limitation is the attack must have the encrypted user ID available to them or one which they own. It is suspected that Bumble will address this vulnerability in the coming days. Bypassing other premium features is still functional. The use of REST APIs for inter-application communication can allow client-side communication in a stateless form. Using the Burp Suite, the team was able to explore API calls and perform the necessary functions to trigger the unintentional data leak. \n\n## Unlimited Votes\n\nBumble's mobile app limits the number of \"swipes\" a non-premium user can use per day. The request is done through an action called SERVER_ENCOUNTERS_VOTE. If the options are manipulated, an attacker could receive unlimited votes during a 24-hour period. Since there is no check on the APIs, the web application user could achieve this rather easily. \n\n## Backtrack\n\nShould a user accidentally swipe left (deny) a prospective match, the backtrack function allows for removing the parameter for exclusion. An API voting request directly would allow an attacker to change his vote from left to right (accept). \n\n## Beeline\n\nOne of the most useful functions to an attacker is the ability to see all those who've swiped right on them. Assigned user codes allow for the exploitation of this information and can be modified and used for other endpoints. \n\n## Enumeration\n\nFinally, perhaps the most useful feature is the ability to find users by employing unlimited filters. This could allow an attacker to limit search results to a certain radius. The results would also include pictures and Facebook (if connected) interests and pages liked by the victim. \n\nFurther technical information can be found in the blog post located within the Reference section below. \n\n# CVEs\n\n  * N/A\n\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Review the source article for full details.\n\n  * Apply applicable patches, updates, or workarounds as necessary. \n\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://blog.securityevaluators.com/reverse-engineering-bumbles-api-a2a0d39b3a87>",

Using domains that look like legitimate domains is a way for cyber criminals to entice victims to visit their sites. At present, Palo Alto has identified 13,857 squatting domains registered in December 2019. Of these, 2,595 were deemed to distribute malware or conduct phishing attacks via credential harvesting. Domains such as PayPal.com, apple.com, Facebook.com, Netflix.com, and others are prime targets, as these are some of the largest domains in terms of user visits. These cyber criminals choose a domain, PayPal.com for instance, and change the domain to something that is closely linked to the original domain like paypa1.com. Under scrutiny, this type of domain doesn't hold up; however, to the untrained user, this domain could be easily overlooked. In this instance, visiting this domain could lead to credential disclosure and, eventually, account takeover. A Samsung domain was mimicked to distribute Azorult malware in order to steal credit card information. Threat actors will also employ domains such as Microsoft-store-drm-server.com to conduct C2 attacks on entire networks. These examples are a small sample of the types of cybersquatting. Other techniques include typosquatting, combo squatting, homograph-squatting, soundsquatting, and others. Additional techniques employed to throw victims off is the use of legitimate certificates to provide a, seemingly, secure HTTPS connection. Cybersquatting domains serve a variety of purposes and have become more and more commonplace. The most common types of domains to be leveraged in cybersquatting campaigns are domain names that target financial, shopping, and banking domains, domains using frequently abused registrars, and domains that do not have validated SSL certificates.

Despite this, AT&T Alien Labs has discovered a number of PRISM variants that have been used in multiple smaller campaigns, by multiple actors, over a period of more than 3.5 years, which have remained largely undetected. They have named one of the variants WaterDrop, named for the string \"waterdropx\" which is used in the C&C domain name, and the User-Agent in its HTTP communications with its C&C server. The domain was registered in 2017 and remained online in August 2021. Other PRISM variants were also observed using the WaterDrop C&C server.

Using multiple web services, the attackers were able to operate under the radar. Different IPs and timeframes made for difficult for analysts to correlate activity that does not appear related. Microsoft 365 Defender's cross-domain feature was able to assist in the identification of this BEC campaign. A minimal footprint makes the cross-domain feature a necessary part of the identification process. Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) reported the activity to multiple cloud security teams and they, in turn, suspended the accounts used by threat actors thus eliminating the infrastructure. By employing multi-factor authentication (MFA), most of these types of attacks are thwarted since the attackers cannot log into those protected accounts. A phishing email sent to potential victims contained an HTML file as well as a voicemail lure. Shortly after these emails were sent, forwarding rules were created, presumably, by the threat actors. JavaScript within the HTML attachment showed an imitation of the Microsoft sign-in page. Upon entering a password, the user is shown animations and, after that, a \"File not found\" message.

They are a little-known threat actor who has been active since April 2018 and has become known for attacking telecommunications companies and critical systems in the Middle East. Since being originally discovered, researchers have noted that they have replaced their publicly documented payload known as 'DanBot', with new C++ backdoors and a PowerShell script that serve the same purpose. The script was discovered on VirusTotal in November 2020, and using the C2 server, the researchers were able to access the new C++ payloads. There are two main variants of the backdoor, named 'James' and 'Kevin', after the names of directories found with the variants. Both variants communicate with their C2 servers using DNS, but the 'James' variant also allows for communication over HTTP exfiltration. The domains used in the attack attempt to impersonate known services, by using keywords such as 'cloud', 'windows', or 'cdn'. The attackers also host their own nameservers, meaning they can decode the DNS queries received from the malware and respond using commands the malware can understand. Once a machine has been infected, the attackers use commands from the C2 server to perform local reconnaissance. They also drop a Mimikatz-based executable to harvest credentials from Google Chrome. Although this is an individual group, the researchers do comment on the similarities between Lyceum Group and APT34, so there could be a relationship between these groups.

The investigation suggested the firewall was compromised via the internet-exposed User Portal component.\u00a0 Researchers identified suspicious and repeated access targeting a valid JSP file (login.JSP). Further analysis of the firewall revealed that the threat actor established a webshell backdoor through modification of a legitimate component file. The threat actor utilized this webshell in order to establish multiple VPN user accounts and associated certificate pairs for legitimate network access persistence. The attacker also modified specific DNS responses on the compromised device to conduct Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks targeting hostnames, which belonged to the victim organization.\n\nThe MITM attacks allowed the attacker to conduct credential and session cookie theft from administrative access to the websites' content management systems (CMS).

The investigation suggested the firewall was compromised via the internet-exposed User Portal component.\u00a0 Researchers identified suspicious and repeated access targeting a valid JSP file (login.JSP). Further analysis of the firewall revealed that the threat actor established a webshell backdoor through modification of a legitimate component file. The threat actor utilized this webshell in order to establish multiple VPN user accounts and associated certificate pairs for legitimate network access persistence. The attacker also modified specific DNS responses on the compromised device to conduct Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks targeting hostnames, which belonged to the victim organization.\n\nThe MITM attacks allowed the attacker to conduct credential and session cookie theft from administrative access to the websites' content management systems (CMS). Veloxity's investigation identified multiple instances of successful access, via legitimate session cookies, to the client's CMS admin pages attributed to the attacker. These sessions were used to upload a variation of the Weevely webshell. These webshells then were used to upload additional malware.

Now word comes about the latest upgrade to the trojan, Ares. Ares is malware with new capabilities such as information exfiltration. Ares is used in conjunction with another variant dubbed Osiris. The two malwares utilize a packer written in C++ called DarkCrypter. This version of DarkCrypter should not be confused with the commercially available packer, also called DarkCrypter. In the new variant, the first 41 strings match older Kronos variants as well as the addition of eight new strings to detect analysis tools such as sandboxes. There are, at the time of this writing, two versions of the packer. The first decrypts using Blowfish. The key size for this decryption is not the standard Blowfish size - 4 through 56 bytes vs. 288 byte fixed length. The second variant uses an embedding technique that uses a compressed format rather than Blowfish encryption. This compression algorithm is identical to Ares. The packer shows itself to be a bitmap image header. This is an obvious ruse and can be seen in photos within the article. Additionally, the actor behind the malware uses BMPack, so named by Zscaler. This packer uses an XOR-based algorithm as well as RC4. Upon decryption, the file appears as a static bitmap. Each structure within the decompressed file holds a different section of a PE file that is stitched together by a custom loader and is, subsequently, executed. Ares itself is under development as evidenced by the constant testing of new plugins and web injects. An embedded DLL module is compressed and placed within the binary. An export is loaded and used to establish persistence by creating a scheduled task that executes every two hours. Though sharing most of the code with Kronos and Osiris, there are several differences. At present, most of the samples of Ares do not communicate with a C2 over TOR. The removal of the TOR component could be used to reduce the malware size. The Ares stealer attempts to extract information from FTP clients, VPN clients, web browsers, cryptocurrency wallets applications, instant messenger clients, and email clients. Ares supports the commands as Kronos and Osiris though some commands have been modified.

The first incident was part of the Kaseya VSA supply chain attack. In this case, the Kaseya agent was used to spawn cmd.exe. This was used to disable Windows Defender, create a copy of certutil, and use it to decode a payload file. The payload was then used to create a version of Windows Defender that is vulnerable to DLL side-loading. Finally, a ransomware payload was deployed. The second incident involved the use of a Desktop Central agent to deploy malware across an environment. A series of executables were used in this case to ultimately execute shell code in memory. This shell code reached out to a remote server, but the server was down at the time of investigation so the follow-on actions are unknown. Analysis of the main executable indicated it was likely a Cobalt Strike Beacon Malleable C&C stager.

The first incident was part of the Kaseya VSA supply chain attack. In this case, the Kaseya agent was used to spawn cmd.exe. This was used to disable Windows Defender, create a copy of certutil, and use it to decode a payload file. The payload was then used to create a version of Windows Defender that is vulnerable to DLL side-loading. Finally, a ransomware payload was deployed. The second incident involved the use of a Desktop Central agent to deploy malware across an environment. A series of executables were used in this case to ultimately execute shell code in memory. This shell code reached out to a remote server, but the server was down at the time of investigation so the follow-on actions are unknown. Analysis of the main executable indicated it was likely a Cobalt Strike Beacon Malleable C&C stager. For more information, see the Trend Micro blog post in the Reference section.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * A complete list of IoCs can be found here: [ IoCs.txt](/download/attachments/59540690/Recent%20Supply%20Chain%20Attacks%20IoCs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1628622486327&api=v2)\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Use anti-virus software and ensure software and associated files are up to date (M1049).\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs (M1031, M1035, M1037).\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level (M1051).\n  * Restrict Web-Based Content (M1021).\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/21/h/supply-chain-attacks-from-a-managed-detection-and-response-persp.html>"

According to the analyst, jdb.js contains the credential stealing RAT, njRAT. The npm package contained three files and conducts multiple malicious activities such as: data gathering, reconnaissance, and launching patch.exe which is the njRAT dropper. Before C2 communication is initiated, the malicious executable edits Windows firewall rules to avoid connection and communication issues. The db-json.js package eludes malicious intention by appearing to be a safe and legitimate JSON DB creation package but works in conjunction with the jdb.js package. According to the analyst, what was even more interesting, was the effective implementation of the db-json.js package. After infecting the desired target, the end-user\u2019s machine is then open to a multitude of nefarious acts, granting the attacker the ability to, log keystrokes, alter registry values, inaugurate system shutdown, initially granting a level of C2 to the attacker.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nOver the Thanksgiving holiday, Sonatype discovered two malicious npm packages named jdb.js and db-json.js. According to the analyst, jdb.js contains the credential stealing RAT, njRAT. The npm package contained three files and conducts multiple malicious activities such as: data gathering, reconnaissance, and launching patch.exe which is the njRAT dropper. Before C2 communication is initiated, the malicious executable edits Windows firewall rules to avoid connection and communication issues. The db-json.js package eludes malicious intention by appearing to be a safe and legitimate JSON DB creation package but works in conjunction with the jdb.js package. According to the analyst, what was even more interesting, was the effective implementation of the db-json.js package. After infecting the desired target, the end-user\u2019s machine is then open to a multitude of nefarious acts, granting the attacker the ability to, log keystrokes, alter registry values, inaugurate system shutdown, initially granting a level of C2 to the attacker.

Since 2018, the malware has only targeted users in Brazil; however, new variants have appeared in the Google Play store that include capabilities for targeting users in the US and Spain. The applications masquerade as security scanning apps. On installation, a fake scan is performed and, depending on the language of the device, a link to a supposed application is updated. Portuguese speakers are shown a PDF reader update, Spanish speakers are shown a WhatsApp update, and English speakers are shown a Google Chrome update. Regardless of the lure used, victims are provided instructions for allowing the application access to Accessibility Services. The malware then requests the user enter their pin in order to steal it for later use. A check-in to the C2 server is used to register the victim device, and in response the C2 server provides a list of targeted financial apps and the IP address and port for future C2 communication. The malware provides the attacker with a variety of remote access commands, such as screen capture, application launching, clipboard manipulation, and more. Additionally, if target financial apps are accessed, a phishing URL is used to steal banking credentials. The McAfee researchers also note the updated BRATA variant includes various new obfuscation and evasion techniques.

The researchers found newly registered domains that were spoofing the official Microsoft Windows 11 OS download portal. From these sites, the victims could download fake Windows 11 ISO files which are very large, and so can evade network security products. These files are signed with an expired certificate that is likely stolen during the 2019 AVAST compromise.

The researchers have been able to locate and analyze the installer, loader, and main payload, a backdoor with a TorSocket DLL. Although the backdoor has been in use since late-2018, the initial compromise vector is still unknown. Among the capabilities of the backdoor are file exfiltration, timestomping, information gathering, and other backdoor functionality. ESET has surmised the most likely intent of the operation is espionage. The Vyveva backdoor share code similarities with older Lazarus samples. For example, the Vyveva backdoor uses fake TLS in communication, command line execution chains, and encryption and Tor services. ESET can, with high confidence, attribute this activity to Lazarus. The presence of Vyveva indicates an earlier dropper which has not yet been identified. The installer creates a service for persistence of the backdoor loader and the storage of embedded, default backdoor configuration within the registry. The backdoor itself is the main component of Vyveva. This backdoor connects to the C2 servers and executes commands as issued by the threat actors. In their analysis, the researchers were able to identify 23 commands, most being ordinary commands used for file and process operations or information gathering. It also has the ability to upload files and exfiltrate directories recursively. Additionally, the backdoor can also filter on specific file types, such as Office documents only. Configuration is set by the installer and is read from a registry value created by the installer. If the configuration is modified by a C2 server command, the registry is subsequently updated.

The sample they obtained was being distributed via crack websites that offer premium software that has supposedly been cracked to allow free access. Downloading a program from this site provides a ZIP file containing a password-protected archive, which, in turn, contains the dropper payload. This dropper is an executable that drops a stealer component that provides victim system information to the attacker. A second-stage payload is then downloaded that installs an AutoIT cryptominer and the DanaBot payload to the system. The DanaBot payload includes hardcoded configuration information, including the affiliate ID (two of which were discovered by Proofpoint), a version number, embedded hash values, C2 IPs and ports, and a Tor C2 domain. The malware can run in several alternative modes including a TOR mode, process injection mode, and a module mode. Proofpoint's analysis focuses on running mode 0, which is the main component. Available commands from the C2 response include those to get an updated list of C2 addresses, enable a stealer, change to Tor-based C2 communications, exfiltrate arbitrary information from the victim system, obtain a command shell, download and execute additional modules, and more.

This malware is deployed by either phishing campaigns or malvertising. Alternatively, it uses the PurpleFox exploit kit to exploit a machine and install the malware. Once installed, it can spread without any user interaction. The goal of this worm module is to look for and exploit several known vulnerabilities and install itself into the new machine. DirtyMoe generates targets using a pseudo-random IP generation algorithm, allowing it to expand to machines hidden behind NAT. The generated IPs are scanned for any known vulnerabilities. If the potential victim is deemed exploitable, an attack is prepared and launched. The majority of these infections have been in North America and Europe.

This malware is deployed by either phishing campaigns or malvertising. Alternatively, it uses the PurpleFox exploit kit to exploit a machine and install the malware. Once installed, it can spread without any user interaction. The goal of this worm module is to look for and exploit several known vulnerabilities and install itself into the new machine. DirtyMoe generates targets using a pseudo-random IP generation algorithm, allowing it to expand to machines hidden behind NAT. The generated IPs are scanned for any known vulnerabilities. If the potential victim is deemed exploitable, an attack is prepared and launched. The majority of these infections have been in North America and Europe. The analysts also discovered one worming module in developments that exploited other vulnerabilities but were not yet armed for deployment.

Infy is also known as \u201cPrince of Persia\u201d. A new infection method was noted in the campaign. In the past, victims were enticed to click on a link to what was supposedly a video. The new method involves a lure document that uses a macro to extract an embedded SFX package, which is executed when the document is closed and installs the Foudre loader and backdoor. Foudre downloads and installs a new component named Tonnerre that provides functionality beyond that of Foudre. While Foudre and Tonnerre use HTTP to communicate with their C&C servers, Tonnerre uses FTP to exfiltrate data. The most recent version of Foudre covered in the report was observed in October 2020 and has some notable changes over past versions including a revised algorithm for generating domains, an RSA signature file is used to verify a C&C server, and the string \"Foudre\" was removed and replaced with \u201cForm1\u201d. The documents provided as examples in the report are in Persian, yet oddly for Infy campaigns, there are no victims located in Iran.

One of the new features added to the malware is a hex-encoded PowerShell keylogger. The infection vector in previous campaigns was a malicious Word document that attempted to exploit CVE-2017-11882. The current version of LodaRAT uses a malicious RAR archive as an attachment to phishing emails. Infection of a potential victim relies on the individual actually clicking on the executable within the archive. In the new versions, all obfuscation of the code has been removed. This may have been done since it did not provide a significant enough reduction in anti-virus detection to make it worthwhile. A VBS file, stored as a hex-encoded string, is used to search running processes to ensure only one copy of LodaRAT is running at any given time.

One of the new features added to the malware is a hex-encoded PowerShell keylogger. The infection vector in previous campaigns was a malicious Word document that attempted to exploit CVE-2017-11882. The current version of LodaRAT uses a malicious RAR archive as an attachment to phishing emails. Infection of a potential victim relies on the individual actually clicking on the executable within the archive. In the new versions, all obfuscation of the code has been removed. This may have been done since it did not provide a significant enough reduction in anti-virus detection to make it worthwhile. A VBS file, stored as a hex-encoded string, is used to search running processes to ensure only one copy of LodaRAT is running at any given time. For full comparisons of the differences between versions and additional technical details, please see the Talos link in the Reference section.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * A complete list of IoCs can be found here: [ IoCs.txt](/download/attachments/30770966/LodaRAT%20Still%20Active%20IoCs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1601416934301&api=v2)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n  * Exercise caution with attachments and links in emails.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2020/09/lodarat-update-alive-and-well.html>"

The threat actor behind this campaign leverages a combination of social engineering and fraudulent apps to turn a profit. First, a relationship is established with victims via dating apps and eventually messaging platforms. Once trust is established, the threat actor asks the user to install a fake cryptocurrency trading app; in this specific case, Bitfinex. In order to bypass Apple's App Store review process, the attacker abuses the Apple Developer Enterprise program, which requires the user to allow a new configuration profile to be installed on their device.

The threat actor behind this campaign leverages a combination of social engineering and fraudulent apps to turn a profit. First, a relationship is established with victims via dating apps and eventually messaging platforms. Once trust is established, the threat actor asks the user to install a fake cryptocurrency trading app; in this specific case, Bitfinex. In order to bypass Apple's App Store review process, the attacker abuses the Apple Developer Enterprise program, which requires the user to allow a new configuration profile to be installed on their device. Finally, the attacker attempts to convince the victim to make a small investment, continuing to social engineer them until they decide to make a large deposit. With the large transfer in place, the attacker attempts to extort the victim for more funds and eventually withdraws the money for themself.

Here is the information I have about the threat: Fake DarkSide Campaign Targets Energy and Food Sectors\nFollowing the DarkSide ransomware attack against Colonial Pipeline, Trend Micro has discovered threat actors attempting to use the event to social engineer companies into paying a fake ransom.\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Extortion\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\nTrend Micro published a blog post analyzing an extortion campaign attempting to use DarkSide's presence in the media to obtain ransom payments. The fraud attempts are carried out via email, either by directly emailing a victim or sending the content through web contact forms. Notably, the emails solely targeted companies in the energy and food sectors, across a range of geographies. The content of the message claims that the email is from the DarkSide operators and that they have hacked the recipient's company. The sender threatens to release sensitive data if a Bitcoin payment isn't sent to a provided wallet address. This wallet address is static across victims and has not yet received any payments.

The fraud attempts are carried out via email, either by directly emailing a victim or sending the content through web contact forms. Notably, the emails solely targeted companies in the energy and food sectors, across a range of geographies. The content of the message claims that the email is from the DarkSide operators and that they have hacked the recipient's company. The sender threatens to release sensitive data if a Bitcoin payment isn't sent to a provided wallet address. This wallet address is static across victims and has not yet received any payments.

The analysis, that began in May 2020, led Telsy to conclude with medium confidence that the attack is linked to the APT group commonly known as MuddyWater (also known as Mercury and Static Kitten). The attribution is based on code and infrastructure overlap. The targets of the attack were LinkedIn users located in Italy and working in the aerospace and avionics sectors. The attack began with the victim receiving a private message that asked them to download an archive file containing information about a job. The private messages came from an account that impersonated an HR recruiter for a company dealing in satellite imagery. The archive contained a vCard file (.vcf) file and a folder named http, which contained another file. If the victim opened the vCard file the infection chain is kicked off. The file exploited a vulnerability identified as ZDI-CAN-6920. The vulnerability allows for the vCard file to execute the file contained in the http folder. The executed file, in turn, opened the victim's web browser while downloading a PowerShell script in the background. There are several further stages in the infection chain, which culminates with a RAT being installed. Persistence is achieved using a Registry key and a Startup folder item. Certain information is collected and forwarded to a C&C server. At this stage, if the infected host is not considered relevant to the operation, the C&C server will respond with a command that will put the malware in an infinite sleep loop.

    "output": "\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Ransomware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nA Sophos report provides information on a ransomware attack that targeted a US-based business in the hospitality sector. A new ransomware named Epsilon Red was used in the attack. The ransomware executable is named red.exe and is written in Go and contains some code from an open-source project name \"godirwalk\". It is described by Sophos as being a bare-bones package as it only handles the file encryption process with the other functions such as C&C communication being handled by PowerShell scripts. The report notes that the initial entry point into the enterprise is thought to be a compromised Exchange server. What vulnerability might have been exploited to achieve the compromise was not determined. Sophos describes the actual attack as being hand-controlled and involves more than twelve PowerShell scripts that are obfuscated in a rudimentary manner. A legitimate remote access tool named \"Remote Utilities\" was installed on some systems. In some instances, the Tor Browser was also installed. Epsilon Red is unusual in some respects in that it blocks access to all TCP ports on a system, except for RDP (3389) and the port used by Remote Utilities (5650). And, in the sample Sophos analyzed, there is no list of targeted or excluded file types, so it will encrypt all the files in a directory it encrypts. Files that are encrypted have the suffix .epsilonred appended to them. The ransom note left by the malware is similar to that left by the REvil ransomware, but there are no other obvious similarities between the two ransomware families. Sophos notes in its report that at least one victim paid a ransom of 4.29BTC (around $149,000 USD) on May 31.

Gootkit loader is delivered via ZIP archive which is downloaded from a malicious website. The websites are typically found via search engine results. Users looking for programs such as games have been directed to these sites. By clicking on the link, victims are directed to the legitimate site that has been compromised to include the aforementioned malware. The ZIP file contains heavily encoded JavaScript file showing certain function calls with abnormally long content. The code attempts to read a registry key and, if it exists, the script fails since one variable is not set. This particular marker is used to check for previous execution on the host. The loader is capable of making a distinction between domain and non-domain hosts. Using this logic, the researchers changed a parameter in wscript.js. In doing so, a domain was revealed and is found in the IoCs section of this collection. Analyzed in that manner reveals random strings necessary for success are not present. Registry keys are present if the Gootkit has been deployed. If deployed, the code is loaded into memory. If saved to a file, the file is a .NET DLL.

The ransomware is sold on underground forums as a custom build for Windows Operating Systems. Unlike many modern ransomware families, Zeoticus does not contain any C2 mechanisms, allowing for it to run fully offline. Based on forum postings, the update to Zeoticus focuses on increasing speed and efficiency of the encryption processes. Additionally, the ability to target specific file extensions was added. Like most ransomware, the infection chain begins with processes that could interfere with encryption being killed. Zeoticus also covers its track by deleting its own binaries using the ping utility. As with previous versions, persistence continues to be established via a Registry Run key. While version 1.0 of the ransomware used a desktop wallpaper to provide the ransom note, this version mounts a new volume containing the note in an HTML file.

In January 2022, Hive0115 claimed responsibility for the disruption of SIC, the largest media conglomerate in Portugal. The attackers defaced numerous websites and disabled the internet streaming component of the victim's broadcasts. Hive0115 claims to have gained access to SIC\u2019s Amazon Web Services account. In December 2021, the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported being a victim of a cyber attack in which COVID vaccine databases were deleted and data was stolen. Hive0115 claimed responsibility for this attack. Hive0115 claimed to have unauthorized access to the Ministry of Health's Amazon Web Service cloud environment. In February 2022, technology company Nvidia acknowledged being the victim of a cyber attack involving the theft of proprietary company data. Hive0115 claimed responsibility for the attack and demanded that Nvidia make its device drivers open source and remove the LHR technology that makes it harder for crypto miners to utilize Nvidia GPUs. In March 2022, electronics manufacturer Samsung disclosed that a data breach has led to the theft of internal company data including the source code for Galaxy smartphones. This announcement came just days after Hive0115 posted 190GB of data belonging to Samsung.\n\nOn March 10, 2022, Hive0115 posted a message to their Telegram channel recruiting insiders willing to sell remote access to major corporate and internet service providers. This has led some researchers to believe that Hive0115 is gaining initial access via malicious corporate insiders. According to recent IBM research, in 40% of insider related incidents that X-Force responded to from 2018 through 2020, the insider was confirmed or likely had administrative access to some area of the network.\n\nOn March 20, 2022, Hive0115 claimed it had stolen source code from Microsoft for Bing, Cortana, and other projects. A day later, the group posted a zip archive containing at least partial source code for over 250 projects belonging to Microsoft. Additionally, the leak contained internal company emails and documentation.\n\nOn March 22, 2022, Hive0115 posted screenshots of what they claimed to be access to Okta's administrative console. Okta, being a provider for authentication and access management services, has a foothold in numerous organizations for which Hive0115 can use as a jump off point for further attacks. \n\nIt is speculated that another possible initial infection vector utilized by Hive0115 is phishing emails however that is not confirmed at this time. Early media reporting of Hive0115 activity suggested that the group was deploying ransomware in an attempt to extort victims. However, more recent evidence suggests that the group does not use ransomware as part of its operations. Instead, Hive0115 exfiltrates data and threatens victims with release or subsequent deletion of the original data set.\n\nHive0115 makes extensive use of Telegram to post updates about their activity. To date, they have over 33,000 subscribers and they use the platform to announce attacks, leaks, and requests to their followers.\n\n## Recent Activity:\n\nVictim\n\n| \n\nRegion/Country\n\n| \n\nIndustry\n\n| \n\nMonth/Year Reported  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \nBrazil Ministry of Health| Brazil| Government| December 2021  \nCorreios| Brazil| Government| December 2021  \nImpresa| Portugal| Media| January 2022  \nClaro| LATAM| Information - Wired and Wireless Telecommunications Carriers| January 2022  \nVodaphone PT| Portugal| Information - Wired and Wireless Telecommunications Carriers| February 2022  \nCofina| Portugal| Media| February 2022  \nMercado Libre| LATAM| E-commerce| March 2022  \nNvidia| Global| Semiconductor and Other Electronic Component Manufacturing| March 2022  \nSamsung| Global| Semiconductor and Other Electronic Component Manufacturing| March 2022  \nUbisoft| France| Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services| March 2022  \nMicrosoft| US| Information - Software Publishers| March 2022  \nLG Electronics| Korea| Communications Equipment Manufacturing| March 2022  \nOkta| US| Information - Software Publishers| March 2022  \n  \n# Conclusion\n\nHive0115 has been extremely active since first surfacing in December 2021. There has been increased reporting of this group conductingattacks targeting various organizations to include large organizations with mature security operations. At this time, we have not seen reports of Hive0115 using malware to conduct operations and instead it is likely relying on stolen credentials and/or insider access to gain initial access. Once inside, the attackers can masquerade as a legitimate user to exfiltrate data.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Utilize [zero trust approaches](https://www.ibm.com/security/zero-trust) and architectures to mitigate potential damages due to insider threats.\n  * Compartmentalize all information in an effort to keep those without a need to know from sensitive information.\n\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n  * Do not install unapproved apps on a device that has access to the corporate network.\n  * Exercise caution with attachments and links in emails.\n\n\n\n# References\n\n<https://therecord.media/lapsus-ransomware-gang-hits-sic-portugals-largest-tv-channel/>\n\n<https://www.reuters.com/technology/brazils-health-ministry-website-hit-by-hacker-attack-systems-down-2021-12-10/>\n\n<https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/1/22957212/nvidia-confirms-hack-proprietary-information-lapsus>\n\n<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-leak-190gb-of-alleged-samsung-data-source-code/>\n\n[https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/128912/cyber-crime/lapsus-ransomware-is-hiring.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=lapsus-ransomware-is-hiring](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/128912/cyber-crime/lapsus-ransomware-is-hiring.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=lapsus-ransomware-is-hiring)\n\n<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/lapsus-hackers-leak-37gb-of-microsofts-alleged-source-code/>\n\n[https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/YNAPDA6B](https://xfti-confluence.dal1a.cirrus.ibm.com/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=IIR&title=7&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=82641678)\n\n<https://www.wired.com/story/lapsus-hacking-group-extortion-nvidia-samsung/>\n\n[https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1484665958476271617?s=20&t=VULomNldDopDLa9jbbApJQ](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1484665958476271617?s=20&t=VULomNldDopDLa9jbbApJQ)\n\n<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/okta-investigating-claims-of-customer-data-breach-from-lapsus-group/>",

Instead, Hive0115 exfiltrates data and threatens victims with release or subsequent deletion of the original data set.\n\nHive0115 makes extensive use of Telegram to post updates about their activity. To date, they have over 33,000 subscribers and they use the platform to announce attacks, leaks, and requests to their followers.\n\n## Recent Activity:\n\nVictim\n\n| \n\nRegion/Country\n\n| \n\nIndustry\n\n| \n\nMonth/Year Reported  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \nBrazil Ministry of Health| Brazil| Government| December 2021  \nCorreios| Brazil| Government| December 2021  \nImpresa| Portugal| Media| January 2022  \nClaro| LATAM| Information - Wired and Wireless Telecommunications Carriers| January 2022  \nVodaphone PT| Portugal| Information - Wired and Wireless Telecommunications Carriers| February 2022  \nCofina| Portugal| Media| February 2022  \nMercado Libre| LATAM| E-commerce| March 2022  \nNvidia| Global| Semiconductor and Other Electronic Component Manufacturing| March 2022  \nSamsung| Global| Semiconductor and Other Electronic Component Manufacturing| March 2022  \nUbisoft| France| Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services| March 2022  \nMicrosoft| US| Information - Software Publishers| March 2022  \nLG Electronics| Korea| Communications Equipment Manufacturing| March 2022  \nOkta| US| Information - Software Publishers| March 2022  \n  \n# Conclusion\n\nHive0115 has been extremely active since first surfacing in December 2021. There has been increased reporting of this group conductingattacks targeting various organizations to include large organizations with mature security operations. At this time, we have not seen reports of Hive0115 using malware to conduct operations and instead it is likely relying on stolen credentials and/or insider access to gain initial access. Once inside, the attackers can masquerade as a legitimate user to exfiltrate data.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Utilize [zero trust approaches](https://www.ibm.com/security/zero-trust) and architectures to mitigate potential damages due to insider threats.\n  * Compartmentalize all information in an effort to keep those without a need to know from sensitive information.\n\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n  * Do not install unapproved apps on a device that has access to the corporate network.\n  * Exercise caution with attachments and links in emails.\n\n\n\n# References\n\n<https://therecord.media/lapsus-ransomware-gang-hits-sic-portugals-largest-tv-channel/>\n\n<https://www.reuters.com/technology/brazils-health-ministry-website-hit-by-hacker-attack-systems-down-2021-12-10/>\n\n<https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/1/22957212/nvidia-confirms-hack-proprietary-information-lapsus>\n\n<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-leak-190gb-of-alleged-samsung-data-source-code/>\n\n[https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/128912/cyber-crime/lapsus-ransomware-is-hiring.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=lapsus-ransomware-is-hiring](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/128912/cyber-crime/lapsus-ransomware-is-hiring.html?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=lapsus-ransomware-is-hiring)\n\n<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/lapsus-hackers-leak-37gb-of-microsofts-alleged-source-code/>\n\n[https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/YNAPDA6B](https://xfti-confluence.dal1a.cirrus.ibm.com/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=IIR&title=7&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=82641678)\n\n<https://www.wired.com/story/lapsus-hacking-group-extortion-nvidia-samsung/>\n\n[https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1484665958476271617?s=20&t=VULomNldDopDLa9jbbApJQ](https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1484665958476271617?s=20&t=VULomNldDopDLa9jbbApJQ)\n\n<https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/okta-investigating-claims-of-customer-data-breach-from-lapsus-group/>"

The payload delivered by Squirrelwaffle is Cobalt Strike. The infrastructure used to host Squirrelwaffle is known to have been used to distribute the Qakbot banking Trojan. The malspam is using an email thread hijacking technique that has been used in the distribution of Emotet and Qakbot. The spam emails contain a link that leads to an archive file that contains a malicious Word or Excel file. Macros in the documents either drop a VBS file used to download the Squirrelwaffle DLL or download the DLL directly. The DLL is executed by either rundll32.exe or regsvr.exe. Once executed Squirrelwaffle begins communicating with its C&C server and downloads a Cobalt Strike stager that in turn delivers a Cobalt Strike beacon.

This script then attempts to move laterally across the network, targeting hosts listed in the known_hosts file in the .ssh directory. Hosts listed in this file are systems this host / user has connected to in the past over an SSH connection. In some cases, the remote host might have this system's public key in their authorized_keys file, thus a connection could be made without knowing login credentials. The XMI script also downloads and executes other commands, such as those needed to set up cron jobs and services for persistence.

The initial payload is a malicious IMG file containing a decoy PDF document, a shortcut file, and executable. The decoy document uses a COVID-19 theme and is displayed upon execution of the shortcut. Meanwhile, the executable, which the researchers identified as PeppyRAT, runs in the background. The executable file uses embedded Python commands to load and run a Python script in memory.

The initial payload is a malicious IMG file containing a decoy PDF document, a shortcut file, and executable. The decoy document uses a COVID-19 theme and is displayed upon execution of the shortcut. Meanwhile, the executable, which the researchers identified as PeppyRAT, runs in the background. The executable file uses embedded Python commands to load and run a Python script in memory. The Python code subsequently gathers a list of running processes and other system information, which is exfiltrated to the attacker via an HTTP POST request.

    "context": "",
    "output": "\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, RAT, Exploit\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nBitdefender has published a blog post analyzing a new Golang RAT. This malware uses CVE-2019-2725, an Oracle WebLogic RCE vulnerability, as an initial infection vector. Although WebLogic servers typically should not be public facing, when the vulnerability was identified so were tens of thousands of exposed servers, many of which remain unpatched. Using this CVE, a Golang payload is downloaded to the system. This payload is responsible for downloading, executing, and updating the RAT. For updating, it monitors a remote URL to identify when changes have been made and the new version should be downloaded. Persistence is established using a startup script created by this initial payload. Additionally, it regularly checks that the RAT is still running and restarts it if not. The RAT payload sends a check-in message to its C2 that contains system information, such as the OS, hardware details, and IP address. It supports two commands, one to execute shell commands and the other to download and run a binary.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, RAT, Exploit\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nBitdefender has published a blog post analyzing a new Golang RAT. This malware uses CVE-2019-2725, an Oracle WebLogic RCE vulnerability, as an initial infection vector. Although WebLogic servers typically should not be public facing, when the vulnerability was identified so were tens of thousands of exposed servers, many of which remain unpatched. Using this CVE, a Golang payload is downloaded to the system. This payload is responsible for downloading, executing, and updating the RAT. For updating, it monitors a remote URL to identify when changes have been made and the new version should be downloaded. Persistence is established using a startup script created by this initial payload. Additionally, it regularly checks that the RAT is still running and restarts it if not. The RAT payload sends a check-in message to its C2 that contains system information, such as the OS, hardware details, and IP address. It supports two commands, one to execute shell commands and the other to download and run a binary. Although there are only a couple available commands, they allow for extensive capabilities, and the malware still appears to be in early development stages. Based on infrastructure and code overlap, Bitdefender believes this campaign is related to the previously reported PowerGhost campaign.

Here is the information I have about the threat: Emotet Chronicles\nKaspersky has published a report chronicling what is known about Emotet malware.\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Trojan\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, Emotet was first discovered in June 2014 by Trend Micro. Emotet is a malware package designed to steal banking credentials. Initial targets were German and Austrian bank users. At that time, the infection vector was bank-related spam with either weaponized attachments or links to ZIP files with the loader install. November of that year saw additional modules added that could modify HTTP(s) traffic, collect Outlook email addresses, and steal credentials in Mail PassView, among others. December saw unresponsive command and control servers as attacks dropped off. The following January saw a public RSA key and encrypted embedded strings. Swiss bank clients were also added to the victim list. June 2015 saw the beginning of another shutdown of the command and control servers. December of 2016 saw a new outlook for Emotet with the ability to infect victims using the RIG-E and RIG-V exploit kits. In February 2017, it was discovered that Emotet had included a spam module in its tool set. Banking clients in Poland were added in April's spam emails. May saw a change in the spam attachment used in the attack. This was the first time a weaponized Microsoft Word document (or a link to one) required the victim to enable macros. It was also the first time that Emotet began installing the banking Trojan Qbot (or QakBot), although the number of installs were not numerous. June saw Emotet begin to use a network spreading technique to infect other systems on the local network. In July, Emotet changed from using GET requests to using POST requests. The list of brute-force passwords used significantly increased in August. IBM X-Force announced in November that Emotet was now spreading IcedID. In January of 2018, Emotet began installing the banking Trojan Panda (also known as Zeus Panda). In April, Emotet added a module to spread laterally over wireless networks. In June, Emotet began a relationship with Trickbot (also known as Trickster). The ability to access computers behind NAT and convert them into command and control proxies was added in July. Installing Ryuk by Emotet began in August. October saw a brief suspension of command and control servers as well as an update to the Outlook exfiltration module. Another suspension of command and control servers began in November with a resumption beginning in January of 2019. March saw modifications to the HTTP protocol used in command and control communication. In April, data exfiltration (topics, mailing lists, message contents) began showing up in Emotet spam emails. From May until August, command and control servers went down once more. In November and February, additional minor changes were made to the headers in the HTTP protocol. Infections declined in February, not to resume until July. After starting back up in July, public reports indicated that the links in the spam emails were replaced with benign images and memes instead of the malicious Emotet payload. In a few days, this issue was corrected and Emotet began flowing again.

The exact infection vector is unknown, but targets will receive a link or file through social engineering. Upon execution, the Microscopia malware displays a politically-themed decoy document while establishing persistence via the Startup folder.

Here is the information I have about the threat: In-the-Wild Exploits Seen Targeting MS Exchange\nNew reports from Volexity and Microsoft detail an in-the-wild exploit being seen across multiple industries. Microsoft has released out of band updates to address the vulnerabilities.\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Vulnerability\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\n## ***UPDATE April 12, 2021***\n\nCISA has provided an analysis of further samples of the China Chopper Webshell, which may be in use against Microsoft Exchange servers. Further information can be found in the Reference section below or [here](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-102a).\n\n## ***UPDATE March 25, 2021***\n\n  \nUS-CISA and DHS have issued additional information about China Chopper Webshells which may be in use against Microsoft Offline Address books. These latest samples are inline with other samples previously examined. There are subtle differences in the code used for the creation of the shells. We recommend you read the reports and apply any and all patches available as well as examining your environment for any evidence of these or any other potentially nefarious webshells. Further information can be found in the Reference section below or [here](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-084a) and [here](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-084b). \n\n## ***UPDATE March 16, 2021***\n\n  \nYesterday, Microsoft released a one-click Exchange On-Premises Mitigation tool. This tool is not designed to replace patching of vulnerable servers, it is merely meant to help those who've not yet had opportunity to patch these systems. This tool includes the latest Microsoft Safety Scanner and will mitigate CVE-2021-26855. The tool performs three operations: mitigate against current known attacks using CVE-2021-26855 using a URL Rewrite configuration, scan the Exchange Server using the Microsoft Safety Scanner, and attempt to reverse any changes made by identified threats. Further detailed guidance can be found in the Reference section below or [here](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/15/one-click-microsoft-exchange-on-premises-mitigation-tool-march-2021/).\n\n## ***UPDATE March 15, 2021***\n\n  \nThe Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency released 7 malware analysis reports on webshells seen throughout its investigation. The findings indicate that each webshell observed also contains some form of backdoor as well as the webshells themselves. These webshells could, if implanted, allow attackers to execute JavaScript code on compromised servers. The reports are linked in the Reference section or just below this update.\n\n  * [https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072a](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072a)\n\n  * [https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072b](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072b)\n\n  * [https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072c](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072c)\n\n  * [https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072d](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072d)\n\n  * [https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072e](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072e)\n\n  * [https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072f](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072f)\n\n  * [https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072g](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072g)\n\n\n\n\n## ***UPDATE March 12, 2021***\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have published a joint advisory detailing further information on the Microsoft Exchange Server attacks. According to the FBI and CISA, multiple nation-state actors and cybercriminals are likely exploiting the previously mentioned vulnerabilities. Should these attackers successfully exploit these vulnerabilities, they have the ability to gain persistence and control of the affected network. The possibility exists of the sale of compromised network access on the dark web. These networks can contain valuable research, technology, PII, and sensitive information from multiple sectors. The agencies assess the attackers will continue to exploit these vulnerabilities in order to steal information, encrypt data for ransom, or, in a worst case scenario, execute a destructive attack against compromised networks. The report also notes the types of industries currently or previously having seen attacks as \"local governments, academic institutions, non-governmental organizations, and business entities in multiple industry sectors, including agriculture, biotechnology, aerospace, defense, legal services, power utilities, and pharmaceutical\". Additionally, this targeting is consistent with targeting activity by Chinese cyber actors. Further details can be found in the link located within the reference section below or [here](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/210310.pdf). \n\n## ***UPDATE #3 March 10, 2021***\n\nWeLiveSecurity is reporting that at least 10 APT groups are attacking the vulnerabilities in Exchange. Among the APTs and malware listed are: LuckyMouse, Tick, Winnti Group, Calypso, Websiic, Tonto Team (CactusPete), Mikroceen (Vicious Panda), ShadowPad (unconfirmed), \"Opera\" Cobalt Strike, and DLTMiner. There is also speculation that some of the ATPs and threat actors may be piggybacking off webshells left by other APTs who may have already successfully exploited the vulnerable servers, though this is unconfirmed. Further information can be found in the link located within the Reference section below or [here](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/10/exchange-servers-under-siege-10-apt-groups/). \n\n## ***UPDATE #2 March 10, 2021***\n\nRecorded Future reports on the evolution of the exploitation of the Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities. Indications are that the exploitation attempts are coming from multiple groups simultaneously. Some of the groups mentioned in the article are state-sponsored APTs while others are simply cybercrime groups. One such group has been using the flaws to insert webshells to install DLTminer malware for the purposes of cryptomining. According to the article, \"the ever-increasing number of attackers had moved into indiscriminate mass-exploitation against any Exchange server left connected to the internet without a patch, with the number of hacked servers being estimated in the realm of \u201castronomical\u201d and tens of thousands, per US government sources. Security agencies have observed intrusions in the Netherlands, Czech Republic, and Norway in addition to the U.S. Other, larger countries have issued national security alerts to patch on-premises servers as soon as possible in order to avoid exploitation. There is speculation these countries may already be seeing attempts to exploit the vulnerabilities. At present, at least 1,500 infected systems have been seen by at least one security firm. Further details can be found in the article located within the Reference section or [here](https://therecord.media/attacks-on-exchange-servers-expand-from-nation-states-to-cryptominers/). \n\n## ***UPDATE #1 March 10, 2021***\n\nPalo Alto's Unit 42 has released additional details on the China Chopper webshells and changes made to the shell during the exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Additionally, a Yara rule was released which helps to identify templates used for the China Chopper webshell as they exist in OAB configurations. This webshell is injected into a pre-existing OAB ASPX page. Researchers warn that any on-premises Exchange servers exposed to the internet should assume scanning is/has been accomplished numerous times. Indications from analysis show several clusters of threat actors are continuously attempting to exploit vulnerable servers. Further details can be found in the link located within the Reference section below or [here](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/china-chopper-webshell/).\n\n## ***UPDATE March 9, 2021***\n\nMicrosoft has released emergency updates for unsupported versions of Microsoft Exchange. Though unsupported, the company released these updates to address only the newest vulnerabilities as stated in this document. Further information can be found in the link below or [here](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-exchange-attacks-now-microsoft-rushes-out-a-patch-for-these-unsupported-exchange-servers-too/).\n\n  \n\n\n***UPDATE March 8, 2021***\n\nFireEye has [published](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/03/detection-response-to-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities.html) analysis of the processes and inner workings of the vulnerabilities and related malware. Researchers have identified a web shell named help.aspx which contained code to help identify endpoint security products such as FireEye xAgent, CarbonBlack, and CrowdStrike Falcon. A second web shell named iisstart.aspx was seen approximately twenty days after the first web shell. This web shell, partially obfuscated, has more capabilities, functions, and is generally more advanced than the previous shell. This particular version allowed for the execution of arbitrary commands and the upload, deletion, and viewing of files. The analysis confirmed the files indicate the signature match for China Chopper. One particular command seen was the attempt to delete the administrator user from Exchange Organizations administrators group. The team verified Microsoft's information regarding the post-exploitation activity such as credential theft by dumping LSASS, the use of 7-zip compression for exfiltration, the use of Exchange PowerShell Snap-ins for the exfiltration of mailbox data, and the use of offensive tools such as Covenant, Nishang, and PowerCat for remote access. Finally, analysis revealed the ever changing naming of the web shell on each intrusion. We will provide further details as they are presented.\n\n  \n\n\n***UPDATE March 6, 2021***\n\nAccording to CISA, Microsoft has released (CISA and Microsoft links below) an updated [script](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/tree/main/Security) for scanning the Exchange log files for IoCs for the vulnerabilities. We recommend running the script against any Exchange servers within your organization as soon as possible.\n\n## ***UPDATE March 5, 2021***\n\nIBM Security family PAM Content Update [4103.03231](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/xpu/XPU%204103.03231) contains 4 new events, 0 new moderate event responses, and 0 new aggressive event responses. The new signatures, HTTP_Exchange_Cookie_Auth_Bypass, HTTP_Exchange_VirtualDirectory_Cmd_Injection, HTTP_Exchange_Cookie_SSFR, and HTTP_Exchange_VirtualDirectory_Upload, apply to the Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065.\n\n## ***UPDATE #3 March 3, 2021***\n\nCISA has published an alert, AA21-062A, regarding the Exchange vulnerabilities. The URL is located in the Reference section below.\n\n## ***UPDATE #2 March 3, 2021***\n\nAn URL has been added to the Reference section for the Dubex report on the exploit.\n\n## ***UPDATE March 3, 2021***\n\nA blog from Rapid7 contains more details on this zero-day attack and how to address the issues allowing the zero-day to proliferate. In the blog, researchers reveal the tools employed in the attacks to be China Chopper Webshell and ProcDump being used against LSASS. Additionally, the team provided a link for the proof-of-concept code that allows for the exposure to the public internet. \n\n## ***Original Post - Update March 2, 2021***\n\nMultiple zero-day exploits targeting vulnerabilities in on-premises versions Microsoft Exchange servers have been used in attacks in the wild. Microsoft describe the attacks as limited and targeted. According to a report from Volexity, the attacks appear to have started as early as January 6, 2021. The report notes that the attackers are using a remotely exploitable server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability (CVE-2021-26855) to steal the contents of a victim's mailbox. The vulnerability does not require authentication. If the Exchange server is a single machine, the attacker must know the targeted user's domain SID in order to access the mailbox. In multiple server configurations, the attacker only needs the email address of the intended victim. In both cases, the attacker must know the FQDN of the internal Exchange servers. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the server with an XML SOAP payload. Volexity has also observed this attack being conducted on OWA. In addition, Volexity reports that the attackers chained the SSRF vulnerability with a remote code execution vulnerability in the Exchange servers and installed webshells on the compromised servers.\n\nMicrosoft, Volexity, and Dubex have collaborated on this research and attribute the activity to HAFNIUM, a Chinese state-sponsored group. Victimology and TTPs as the basis for attribution. According to Microsoft, HAFNIUM has primarily targeted entities in the United States. The targeted industry sectors include defense contractors, higher education institutions, infectious disease researchers, law firms, NGOs, and policy think tanks. HAFNIUM typically uses leased virtual private servers (VPS) located in the United States to conduct operations.\n\nMicrosoft has issued emergency out of band updates to address these critical vulnerabilities in Exchange. Microsoft is urging customers to update on-premises systems immediately. In keeping with Microsoft's recommendation, IBM also urges customers to immediately patch affected systems.\n\n  * [CVE-2021-26855](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26855) is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Exchange which allowed the attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests and authenticate as the Exchange server.\n  * [CVE-2021-26857](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26857) is an insecure deserialization vulnerability in the Unified Messaging service. Insecure deserialization is where untrusted user-controllable data is deserialized by a program. Exploiting this vulnerability gave HAFNIUM the ability to run code as SYSTEM on the Exchange server. This requires administrator permission or another vulnerability to exploit.\n  * [CVE-2021-26858](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26858) is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange. If HAFNIUM could authenticate with the Exchange server then they could use this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. They could authenticate by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate admin\u2019s credentials.\n  * [CVE-2021-27065](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-27065) is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange. If HAFNIUM could authenticate with the Exchange server then they could use this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. They could authenticate by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate admin\u2019s credentials.\n\n\n\n# CVEs\n\n  * A complete list of CVEs can be found here: [

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Vulnerability\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\n## ***UPDATE April 12, 2021***\n\nCISA has provided an analysis of further samples of the China Chopper Webshell, which may be in use against Microsoft Exchange servers. Further information can be found in the Reference section below or [here](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-102a).\n\n## ***UPDATE March 25, 2021***\n\n  \nUS-CISA and DHS have issued additional information about China Chopper Webshells which may be in use against Microsoft Offline Address books. These latest samples are inline with other samples previously examined. There are subtle differences in the code used for the creation of the shells. We recommend you read the reports and apply any and all patches available as well as examining your environment for any evidence of these or any other potentially nefarious webshells. Further information can be found in the Reference section below or [here](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-084a) and [here](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-084b). \n\n## ***UPDATE March 16, 2021***\n\n  \nYesterday, Microsoft released a one-click Exchange On-Premises Mitigation tool. This tool is not designed to replace patching of vulnerable servers, it is merely meant to help those who've not yet had opportunity to patch these systems. This tool includes the latest Microsoft Safety Scanner and will mitigate CVE-2021-26855. The tool performs three operations: mitigate against current known attacks using CVE-2021-26855 using a URL Rewrite configuration, scan the Exchange Server using the Microsoft Safety Scanner, and attempt to reverse any changes made by identified threats. Further detailed guidance can be found in the Reference section below or [here](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/15/one-click-microsoft-exchange-on-premises-mitigation-tool-march-2021/).\n\n## ***UPDATE March 15, 2021***\n\n  \nThe Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency released 7 malware analysis reports on webshells seen throughout its investigation. The findings indicate that each webshell observed also contains some form of backdoor as well as the webshells themselves. These webshells could, if implanted, allow attackers to execute JavaScript code on compromised servers. The reports are linked in the Reference section or just below this update.\n\n  * [https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072a](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072a)\n\n  * [https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072b](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072b)\n\n  * [https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072c](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072c)\n\n  * [https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072d](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072d)\n\n  * [https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072e](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072e)\n\n  * [https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072f](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072f)\n\n  * [https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072g](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-072g)\n\n\n\n\n## ***UPDATE March 12, 2021***\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have published a joint advisory detailing further information on the Microsoft Exchange Server attacks. According to the FBI and CISA, multiple nation-state actors and cybercriminals are likely exploiting the previously mentioned vulnerabilities. Should these attackers successfully exploit these vulnerabilities, they have the ability to gain persistence and control of the affected network. The possibility exists of the sale of compromised network access on the dark web. These networks can contain valuable research, technology, PII, and sensitive information from multiple sectors. The agencies assess the attackers will continue to exploit these vulnerabilities in order to steal information, encrypt data for ransom, or, in a worst case scenario, execute a destructive attack against compromised networks. The report also notes the types of industries currently or previously having seen attacks as \"local governments, academic institutions, non-governmental organizations, and business entities in multiple industry sectors, including agriculture, biotechnology, aerospace, defense, legal services, power utilities, and pharmaceutical\". Additionally, this targeting is consistent with targeting activity by Chinese cyber actors. Further details can be found in the link located within the reference section below or [here](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/News/2021/210310.pdf). \n\n## ***UPDATE #3 March 10, 2021***\n\nWeLiveSecurity is reporting that at least 10 APT groups are attacking the vulnerabilities in Exchange. Among the APTs and malware listed are: LuckyMouse, Tick, Winnti Group, Calypso, Websiic, Tonto Team (CactusPete), Mikroceen (Vicious Panda), ShadowPad (unconfirmed), \"Opera\" Cobalt Strike, and DLTMiner. There is also speculation that some of the ATPs and threat actors may be piggybacking off webshells left by other APTs who may have already successfully exploited the vulnerable servers, though this is unconfirmed. Further information can be found in the link located within the Reference section below or [here](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2021/03/10/exchange-servers-under-siege-10-apt-groups/). \n\n## ***UPDATE #2 March 10, 2021***\n\nRecorded Future reports on the evolution of the exploitation of the Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities. Indications are that the exploitation attempts are coming from multiple groups simultaneously. Some of the groups mentioned in the article are state-sponsored APTs while others are simply cybercrime groups. One such group has been using the flaws to insert webshells to install DLTminer malware for the purposes of cryptomining. According to the article, \"the ever-increasing number of attackers had moved into indiscriminate mass-exploitation against any Exchange server left connected to the internet without a patch, with the number of hacked servers being estimated in the realm of \u201castronomical\u201d and tens of thousands, per US government sources. Security agencies have observed intrusions in the Netherlands, Czech Republic, and Norway in addition to the U.S. Other, larger countries have issued national security alerts to patch on-premises servers as soon as possible in order to avoid exploitation. There is speculation these countries may already be seeing attempts to exploit the vulnerabilities. At present, at least 1,500 infected systems have been seen by at least one security firm. Further details can be found in the article located within the Reference section or [here](https://therecord.media/attacks-on-exchange-servers-expand-from-nation-states-to-cryptominers/). \n\n## ***UPDATE #1 March 10, 2021***\n\nPalo Alto's Unit 42 has released additional details on the China Chopper webshells and changes made to the shell during the exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Additionally, a Yara rule was released which helps to identify templates used for the China Chopper webshell as they exist in OAB configurations. This webshell is injected into a pre-existing OAB ASPX page. Researchers warn that any on-premises Exchange servers exposed to the internet should assume scanning is/has been accomplished numerous times. Indications from analysis show several clusters of threat actors are continuously attempting to exploit vulnerable servers. Further details can be found in the link located within the Reference section below or [here](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/china-chopper-webshell/).\n\n## ***UPDATE March 9, 2021***\n\nMicrosoft has released emergency updates for unsupported versions of Microsoft Exchange. Though unsupported, the company released these updates to address only the newest vulnerabilities as stated in this document. Further information can be found in the link below or [here](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-exchange-attacks-now-microsoft-rushes-out-a-patch-for-these-unsupported-exchange-servers-too/).\n\n  \n\n\n***UPDATE March 8, 2021***\n\nFireEye has [published](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/03/detection-response-to-exploitation-of-microsoft-exchange-zero-day-vulnerabilities.html) analysis of the processes and inner workings of the vulnerabilities and related malware. Researchers have identified a web shell named help.aspx which contained code to help identify endpoint security products such as FireEye xAgent, CarbonBlack, and CrowdStrike Falcon. A second web shell named iisstart.aspx was seen approximately twenty days after the first web shell. This web shell, partially obfuscated, has more capabilities, functions, and is generally more advanced than the previous shell. This particular version allowed for the execution of arbitrary commands and the upload, deletion, and viewing of files. The analysis confirmed the files indicate the signature match for China Chopper. One particular command seen was the attempt to delete the administrator user from Exchange Organizations administrators group. The team verified Microsoft's information regarding the post-exploitation activity such as credential theft by dumping LSASS, the use of 7-zip compression for exfiltration, the use of Exchange PowerShell Snap-ins for the exfiltration of mailbox data, and the use of offensive tools such as Covenant, Nishang, and PowerCat for remote access. Finally, analysis revealed the ever changing naming of the web shell on each intrusion. We will provide further details as they are presented.\n\n  \n\n\n***UPDATE March 6, 2021***\n\nAccording to CISA, Microsoft has released (CISA and Microsoft links below) an updated [script](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/tree/main/Security) for scanning the Exchange log files for IoCs for the vulnerabilities. We recommend running the script against any Exchange servers within your organization as soon as possible.\n\n## ***UPDATE March 5, 2021***\n\nIBM Security family PAM Content Update [4103.03231](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/xpu/XPU%204103.03231) contains 4 new events, 0 new moderate event responses, and 0 new aggressive event responses. The new signatures, HTTP_Exchange_Cookie_Auth_Bypass, HTTP_Exchange_VirtualDirectory_Cmd_Injection, HTTP_Exchange_Cookie_SSFR, and HTTP_Exchange_VirtualDirectory_Upload, apply to the Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065.\n\n## ***UPDATE #3 March 3, 2021***\n\nCISA has published an alert, AA21-062A, regarding the Exchange vulnerabilities. The URL is located in the Reference section below.\n\n## ***UPDATE #2 March 3, 2021***\n\nAn URL has been added to the Reference section for the Dubex report on the exploit.\n\n## ***UPDATE March 3, 2021***\n\nA blog from Rapid7 contains more details on this zero-day attack and how to address the issues allowing the zero-day to proliferate. In the blog, researchers reveal the tools employed in the attacks to be China Chopper Webshell and ProcDump being used against LSASS. Additionally, the team provided a link for the proof-of-concept code that allows for the exposure to the public internet. \n\n## ***Original Post - Update March 2, 2021***\n\nMultiple zero-day exploits targeting vulnerabilities in on-premises versions Microsoft Exchange servers have been used in attacks in the wild. Microsoft describe the attacks as limited and targeted. According to a report from Volexity, the attacks appear to have started as early as January 6, 2021. The report notes that the attackers are using a remotely exploitable server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability (CVE-2021-26855) to steal the contents of a victim's mailbox. The vulnerability does not require authentication. If the Exchange server is a single machine, the attacker must know the targeted user's domain SID in order to access the mailbox. In multiple server configurations, the attacker only needs the email address of the intended victim. In both cases, the attacker must know the FQDN of the internal Exchange servers. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the server with an XML SOAP payload. Volexity has also observed this attack being conducted on OWA. In addition, Volexity reports that the attackers chained the SSRF vulnerability with a remote code execution vulnerability in the Exchange servers and installed webshells on the compromised servers.\n\nMicrosoft, Volexity, and Dubex have collaborated on this research and attribute the activity to HAFNIUM, a Chinese state-sponsored group. Victimology and TTPs as the basis for attribution. According to Microsoft, HAFNIUM has primarily targeted entities in the United States. The targeted industry sectors include defense contractors, higher education institutions, infectious disease researchers, law firms, NGOs, and policy think tanks. HAFNIUM typically uses leased virtual private servers (VPS) located in the United States to conduct operations.\n\nMicrosoft has issued emergency out of band updates to address these critical vulnerabilities in Exchange. Microsoft is urging customers to update on-premises systems immediately. In keeping with Microsoft's recommendation, IBM also urges customers to immediately patch affected systems.\n\n  * [CVE-2021-26855](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26855) is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Exchange which allowed the attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests and authenticate as the Exchange server.\n  * [CVE-2021-26857](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26857) is an insecure deserialization vulnerability in the Unified Messaging service. Insecure deserialization is where untrusted user-controllable data is deserialized by a program. Exploiting this vulnerability gave HAFNIUM the ability to run code as SYSTEM on the Exchange server. This requires administrator permission or another vulnerability to exploit.\n  * [CVE-2021-26858](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26858) is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange. If HAFNIUM could authenticate with the Exchange server then they could use this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. They could authenticate by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate admin\u2019s credentials.\n  * [CVE-2021-27065](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-27065) is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange. If HAFNIUM could authenticate with the Exchange server then they could use this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. They could authenticate by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate admin\u2019s credentials.\n\n\n\n# CVEs\n\n  * A complete list of CVEs can be found here: [

    "context": "",
    "output": "\n# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Malware, Espionage.\n  *  **Targets:** Ukrainian government entities including the judiciary, law enforcement, and military as well as attacking non-profit organizations and NGOs.\n  *  **Malware Family/Families:** DinoTrain, DesertDown, DilongTrash, ObfuBerry, ObfuMerry, PowerPunch, Pterodo (S0147), QuietSieve.\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Spearphishing emails with malicious documents attached.\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Lateral movement, collection, and exfiltration of information.\n  *  **Additional TTPs:** See the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below.\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nACTINIUM is the name Microsoft has applied to a threat actor they previously tracked as DEV-0157 and is also known publicly as Gamaredon. ACTINIUM has been operating for close to 10 years. In the last 6 months, Microsoft has observed ACTINIUM targeting Ukrainian government entities including the judiciary, law enforcement, and military as well as attacking non-profit organizations and NGOs. The Ukrainian government has attributed ACTINIUM to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and has been operating from Crimea. Microsoft reports that ACTINIUM's objectives are cyber espionage, maintaining and using their access to move laterally into related organizations. While a number of vectors may be used to compromise their targets. Microsoft notes one method in its report, that being the use of spearphishing emails with malicious documents attached that use remote template injection to begin the infection chain. The spearphishing emails and documents are typically themed to an organization that is familiar to the target.

      "xfe_report": "# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Malware, Espionage.\n  *  **Targets:** Ukrainian government entities including the judiciary, law enforcement, and military as well as attacking non-profit organizations and NGOs.\n  *  **Malware Family/Families:** DinoTrain, DesertDown, DilongTrash, ObfuBerry, ObfuMerry, PowerPunch, Pterodo (S0147), QuietSieve.\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Spearphishing emails with malicious documents attached.\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Lateral movement, collection, and exfiltration of information.\n  *  **Additional TTPs:** See the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below.\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nACTINIUM is the name Microsoft has applied to a threat actor they previously tracked as DEV-0157 and is also known publicly as Gamaredon. ACTINIUM has been operating for close to 10 years. In the last 6 months, Microsoft has observed ACTINIUM targeting Ukrainian government entities including the judiciary, law enforcement, and military as well as attacking non-profit organizations and NGOs. The Ukrainian government has attributed ACTINIUM to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and has been operating from Crimea. Microsoft reports that ACTINIUM's objectives are cyber espionage, maintaining and using their access to move laterally into related organizations. While a number of vectors may be used to compromise their targets. Microsoft notes one method in its report, that being the use of spearphishing emails with malicious documents attached that use remote template injection to begin the infection chain. The spearphishing emails and documents are typically themed to an organization that is familiar to the target. A number of payloads are deployed and these include DesertDown, DinoTrain, DilongTrash, ObfuBerry, ObfuMerry, PowerPunch, Pterodo, QuietSieve. In some cases, UltraVNC has been deployed to provide more interactive remote access.

    "context": "",
    "output": "\nSummary\n=======\n\n\n\nThreat Details\n==============\n\n* **Malware Type:**\u00a0Implant\n* **Associated Threat Actors:**\u00a0POLONIUM\n* **Associated Payloads:** CreepyDrive, CreepyBox, CreepySnail\n* **Targets:** Israeli Organizations\n* **Initial Infection Vector:** Unknown\n* **Post-Compromise Actions:** Unknown\n* **Additional TTPs:**See the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below.\n\nOverview\n========\n\nMicrosoft has detected activity from a new threat group they are tracking as POLONIUM. This group is based in Lebanon and has targeted more than 20 organizations based in Israel. The researchers speculate that this group could be working on behalf of the Iranian government. The group seems to target IT companies to possibly compromise downstream companies, which can include law firms, aviation and defense organizations, and critical manufacturing. The group has been using cloud services, such as OneDrive for data exfiltration and C2 operations. They also use a series of custom implants which are called CreepyDrive and CreepyBox. CreepyDrive is a basic implant allowing for the upload and download of files and appears to have no persistence mechanism.

This group is based in Lebanon and has targeted more than 20 organizations based in Israel. The researchers speculate that this group could be working on behalf of the Iranian government. The group seems to target IT companies to possibly compromise downstream companies, which can include law firms, aviation and defense organizations, and critical manufacturing. The group has been using cloud services, such as OneDrive for data exfiltration and C2 operations. They also use a series of custom implants which are called CreepyDrive and CreepyBox. CreepyDrive is a basic implant allowing for the upload and download of files and appears to have no persistence mechanism. Beyond the custom tools, they also use commodity tools such as plink to set up a tunnel to the attacker infrastructure. Although the initial access method is not currently clear, nearly 80% of victims were using Fortinet appliances. This could suggest that a vulnerability was being exploited for access.

    "instruction": "Tell me everything you know the following threat: Gallium Expands Targeting With New PingPull Tool\nPalo Alto's Unit 42 has analyzed a new remote access Trojan named PingPull that is being utilized by a possibly state-sponsored APT group named Gallium.",
    "context": "",
    "output": "\nSummary\n=======\n\n\n\nThreat Details\n==============\n\n* **Malware Type:** Malware, Espionage\n* **Associated Threat Actors:** Gallium, aka Softcell\n* **Associated Payloads:** PingPull RAT\n* **Targets:** Organizations in the government, finance, and telecommunications sectors located in Africa, Europe, and Southeast Asia.\n* **Initial Infection Vector:** Unspecified\n* **Post-Compromise Actions:** Collection and exfiltration of information\n* **Additional TTPs:**See the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below.\n\nOverview\n========\n\nGallium is a threat group that has been targeting organizations in Africa, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Gallium has historically targeted the telecommunications sector but has expanded its targeting to include the finance and government sectors. According to a report from Palo Alto's Unit42, Gallium is likely to be a Chinese state-sponsored group. The new PingPull RAT used by Gallium comes in three main variants, each of which uses one of three protocols, HTTP(S), ICMP, or raw TCP, for C&C communications.

Gallium has historically targeted the telecommunications sector but has expanded its targeting to include the finance and government sectors. According to a report from Palo Alto's Unit42, Gallium is likely to be a Chinese state-sponsored group. The new PingPull RAT used by Gallium comes in three main variants, each of which uses one of three protocols, HTTP(S), ICMP, or raw TCP, for C&C communications. The use of ICMP helps PingPull helps hide its connections to C2 servers as few organizations monitor ICMP traffic. PingPull malware is coded in C++ and gives the threat actor the ability to execute commands and access a reverse shell on compromised hosts.

The researchers have received reflections that indicate that Cobalt Mirage has been conducting offensive cyber operations in Israel, the U.S., Europe, and Australia. Cobalt Mirage has been linked to the Iranian threat group Cobalt Illusion and past activities have also been reported as Phosphorous and TunnelVison. IBM X-Force has connected activities between these groups and tracks them as ITG18.\n\nSecureworks CTU is tracking separate clusters of activity involving Cobalt Mirage. Clusters A and B seem to have two separate goals for operational focus. Cluster A operations include BitLocker and DiskCryptor to conduct ransomware attacks for financial gain. Cluster B is assessed to be conducting targeted attacks to collect intelligence.

The TFlower ransomware is deployed using the MATA backdoor, which is a well-known Lazarus commodity. The latest variant has not previously been seen in campaigns to this point. In addition to the MATA backdoor, the threat actors behind TFlower employ MATA in order to clear forensic evidence and evade detection through identifying and tampering with security products that may be installed on the target system. The MATA backdoor consists of a three-pronged approach - an initial loader (EXE), loader (DLL), and the payload (DAT). The malware is loaded by the EXE file, which then injects the DLL into svchost.exe and also modifies the LSA security package to achieve persistence through a modified registry value. The loader then decrypts the payload stored within the DAT file, which is loaded on startup or when the AddSecurityPackage Windows API function is called. This file is loaded by lsass.exe to achieve persistence. Finally, the payload is an encrypted binary that implements backdoor functionality. C2 server addresses are encrypted within a binary configuration blob which is hard-coded within the DAT payload. More than 200 certificates and 130 IP addresses are affiliated with MATA. Analysis reveals that 95% of the functionality within the DLL match functions in the MATA framework.

Here is the information I have about the threat: Fake COVID-19 Survey Hides Ransomware\nThe Threat Intelligence Team at MalwarebytesLabs recently observed phishing attacks conducted by the APT group, Silent Librarian; targeting universities and colleges worldwide. An attack against the University of British Columbia (UBC) by Silent Librarian, unusually, involved ransomware.\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Phishing\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nThe APT group, Silent Librarian are well known for targeting educational facilities with phishing campaigns used to obtain user credentials. In an attack against the University of British Columbia (UBC) which MalwarebytesLabs attributes to Silent Librarian, instead of attempting to obtain user credentials, the goal was to install the Vaggen ransomware. The attackers leveraged mailproof.com services to create legitimate email accounts that were then used to register accounts in Box.net and Dropbox. The emails sent to victims contained a link to a malicious document hosted on the free services.

At present, the campaign has brought at least 209 Monero (XMR), or roughly $32K. Composed of mostly of Windows and Unix/Linux cloud instances, the operation has compromised and used at least 476 compromised computer systems. The miner is made up of a three-part GoLang binary set and bash or PowerShell script files. Each binary has a specific function with the first emulating the Linux watchdogd daemon, which ensures the actual mining doesn't hang, overload, or terminate. The second retrieves a list of IP address net ranges prior to enabling the targeted exploitation operations of vulnerable NIX or Windows systems. Finally, the last binary initiates the mining process on either of the aforementioned operating systems. This mining process is initiated via custom configurations from the bash or PowerShell script. As long as GoLang is installed on the target system, the miner can perform operations across operating systems, making it particularly effective in its infiltration across a network. Interestingly, WatchDog does not rely on a third-party host for its payload. This is how the campaign has remained active for more than two years. As of this writing, there is no indication of cloud compromise or credential theft; however, this not to say the attackers will not attempt to obtain such information.

The exploit allows for remote code execution, in this case for the purpose of downloading a script from a remote server. The initial script subsequently downloads a Trojan shell script and the Tsunami IRC backdoor.

The second exploit campaign observed involved the Kinsing botnet spreading via CVE-2020-14750, an Oracle WebLogic remote code execution vulnerability. As with the Muhstik infection, the initial exploit downloads a shell script. This shell script performs several defense evasion techniques and ultimately installs the Kinsing malware.

This port is commonly used by Supervisory Controls and Data Acquisition (SCADA) Modbus, an application layer messaging protocol used to provide client/server communication between connected Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) devices in an industrial network. Between January and April of 2021, IBM observed a 1,600 percent increase in this activity compared to the total volume of reconnaissance activity for all of 2020. This trend highlights the increasing threat to ICS-based networks, and we encourage clients to review risk mitigations for securing SCADA Modbus. The full report, including mitigation advice, is available to IBM X-Force Premier Threat Intelligence clients at the link below.\n\n# CVEs\n\n  * Associated CVEs can be found in the full report, available to IBM X-Force Premier Threat Intelligence clients at the link below.\n\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Review the source article for full details.\n\n  * Apply applicable patches, updates, or workarounds as necessary. \n\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * Premier Threat Intelligence clients can read more and see the indicators at: <https://station.trustar.co/constellation/reports/49ac3fb1-5414-4582-a5ab-1b0562be7a77>\n\n  * To learn more about X-Force Premier Threat Intelligence, visit: <https://www.ibm.com/security/services/threat-intelligence>"

The first set of activity reported on is related to Windows backdoors being spread through various malicious document types. These include RTF files that exploit the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability, LNK files, PDFs, Word Documents, and Zip archives. Regardless of the series of file types leveraged, all the infection chains lead to the execution of JavaScript code that drops a backdoor/stealer to the ProgramData folder, which will either be directly executed or run by a scheduled task. The backdoor uses DLL sideloading for execution of the malicious code. Once running on the system, it can perform its main function of downloading and executing a .NET executable, stealing system information and reporting it to the C2 server, and exfiltrating files. The second attack observed was a spear-phishing campaign. This campaign was discovered when the researchers identified subdomains on the servers hosting the aforementioned malicious documents that were mimicking mail servers associated with target organizations. Hosted on these domains were phishing pages that were based off of the legitimate version of the target organization's webmail login pages. After entering credentials, victims were redirected to either the legitimate webmail login page or to a document or website hosting news content regarding Covid-19 or South Asian territorial disputes. Also found on these servers were Android APK files. While some are benign applications that appear to be for testing, the themes indicate targeting of users in South Asia. Furthermore, applications developed using JavaPayload for Metasploit were observed. The applications load extra code from a remote server, however the researchers were unable to obtain this code at the time of investigation. Due to the lack of other components in this application, they believe the group is still developing these applications before use.

But with these arrests, the Clop ransomware gang is back in action after a brief hiatus. About a week after the arrests, new victim information was found on their ransomware data leak site, CLoP^-LEAKS. Authorities believe there were no arrests involving core actors behind the gang, thus allowing the group to continue operations. There is speculation that the unwanted law enforcement attention could lead to an abandonment or slowing of the group, as has been seen in other ransomware groups. The group has been operating since March 2019 and has used a variant of the CryptoMix ransomware. The gang gains a foothold into the victim network and spreads laterally while stealing documents and data. Once the data has been harvested, the ransomware encrypts the data on the victim hard drive. In its most recent reported attack, the gang stole data from Accellion FTA file transfer devices using a zero-day and demanded a $10+ million ransom. Victims of the attack included energy company Shell, cybersecurity firm Qualys, Flagstar Bank, the University of Miami, and the University of California.

While the delivery mechanism is not stated, the victim receives an archive file that contains multiple files, and in some cases an additional archive file.

Inside the email was a link to a file on Google\u2019s Feed Proxy service. The file was a malicious document. If the document was opened by a victim, and they either had macros enabled or fell for the lure which asked the victim to enable them, the document would download and execute a DLL file which was the Hancitor downloader. In turn, Hancitor downloaded three files, two of which were Cobalt Strike stagers, the third file was the FickerStealer malware. Cobalt Strike was then injected into multiple instances of svchost.exe launched by Hancitor. The attackers carried out a number of operations to facilitate lateral movement and also searched for backup systems. To provide remote access, Cobalt Strike beacons were deployed to each compromised host. The attackers executed another downloaded file, zero.exe, which was a custom exploit that targeted the Zerologon vulnerability, CVE-2020-1472, two of the domain controllers were vulnerable resulting in the attackers dumping the domain administrator\u2019s NTLM hash and installing Cobalt Strike beacons on both systems.

Inside the email was a link to a file on Google\u2019s Feed Proxy service. The file was a malicious document. If the document was opened by a victim, and they either had macros enabled or fell for the lure which asked the victim to enable them, the document would download and execute a DLL file which was the Hancitor downloader. In turn, Hancitor downloaded three files, two of which were Cobalt Strike stagers, the third file was the FickerStealer malware. Cobalt Strike was then injected into multiple instances of svchost.exe launched by Hancitor. The attackers carried out a number of operations to facilitate lateral movement and also searched for backup systems. To provide remote access, Cobalt Strike beacons were deployed to each compromised host. The attackers executed another downloaded file, zero.exe, which was a custom exploit that targeted the Zerologon vulnerability, CVE-2020-1472, two of the domain controllers were vulnerable resulting in the attackers dumping the domain administrator\u2019s NTLM hash and installing Cobalt Strike beacons on both systems. It took only two hours for the attackers to establish a foothold on all key systems. However, before the attackers were able to complete their final objectives, they were discovered and their access to the environment was terminated.

According to a report from Sygnia's Incident Response Team, the group is highly proficient with Java-based attacks and typically exploits Java-based applications, such as webservers that have well-known, possibly unpatched vulnerabilities. The CVE numbered vulnerabilities cited in the Sygnia report as having been used to compromise systems are CVE-2017-1000486, CVE-2015-7450, and CVE-2010-5326. The initial payload deployed during the initial compromise is typically a webshell. Using the initial foothold, the group may spend up to three months conducting reconnaissance and moving laterally through the environment before carrying out any fraudulent transactions. If a transaction is discovered or blocked, the group will go silent for up to a few months before attempting another transaction using a different system.

    "output": "You are asking about a specific threat report. Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Backdoor, DNS Tunneling\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nThe xHunt Campaign has been actively observed since at least July 2018. In the latest developments, Unit 42 has uncovered new techniques being employed to provide new C2 vectors. The campaign has focused its efforts mainly on the Kuwaiti government as well as the shipping and transportation industries. The latest information suggests the threat actors compromised a Microsoft Exchange server, belonging to an organization in Kuwait, on or before August 22, 2019. Analysts note two backdoors, called TriFive and Snugy by Unit 42, as well as a web shell called BumbleBee were discovered. The backdoors are PowerShell scripts that provide the threat actors with backdoor access to the compromised Exchange server. The backdoors each provide a different C2 channel with which the actors communicate. TriFive is a backdoor that utilizes an email-based channel using Exchange Web Services to create draft emails in the Deleted Items folder of a previously compromised email account. Snugy uses DNS tunneling to execute commands on the compromised server. In September 2020, analysts were notified of a breached organization in Kuwait. Suspicious commands were noted as being executed on the Exchange server by an Internet Information Services (IIS) process. Threat actors issued the commands using the BumbleBee web shell, which had been previously installed on the Exchange server. In reviewing the logs, the analysts were unable to find the initial infection vector. They were able to find two scheduled tasks, which were in place prior to the dates of the collected logs. These tasks executed PowerShell scripts, and although the analysts were unable to confirm, they believe the threat actors were able to access the server prior the creation of logging events. The naming of tasks was done in order to blend into other tasks and had names that, upon first glance, could appear to be normal functions. The threat actors were able to resolve hosts through these two scripts. The backdoors mentioned were executed at intervals not matching each other with TriFive occurring every 5 minutes and Snugy every 30 minutes. The hypothesis is that this is done to offer some form of stealth in order to avoid detection. The actor created a draft email with a specific subject that included the commands encrypted and encoded using a base64 format. The commands are executed when PowerShell is directed to the Deleted Items folder and searches for the aforementioned subject line. Persistence for this module is achieved via the scheduled task and not through a looping process. Snugy allows the actors to run commands as well as obtain the system's hostname. Snugy is a variant of the CASHY200 backdoor previously employed in xHunt campaigns. Significant overlap exists to suggest this claim. Snugy uses DNS tunneling to communicate with C2 servers using A record lookups to resolve custom subdomains of C2 domains controlled by the actor. The tunneling protocol only sends one byte of data per query. This speed makes the backdoor inefficient for the exfiltration of data. DNS tunneling allows for the receipt of four bytes of data making it a little more efficient. Further details of the TTPs of the actor and these tools can be found in the report located within the reference section below.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report.   \n\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n  * Exercise caution with attachments and links in emails.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/xhunt-campaign-backdoors/>",

Cyble Research Labs have published a report of their analysis of ERMAC 2.0 which has increased the number of applications it targets from 378 in version 1.0 to 467 in 2.0. ERMAC is installed through third-party sites. In Cyble's analysis, it was found on fake sites impersonating a Polish food delivery platform. A link to download what is purported to be the legitimate site's app is provided. It has also been observed masquerading as browser updates. The fake app seeks 43 different permissions when installed. Once installed, it sends a list of the applications installed on the infected device to its C&C servers. The C&C server responds with a list of targeted applications and an encrypted HTML phishing page ERMAC will use to carry out overlay injections. When the victim interacts with a targeted application, the overlay injection is used to obtain the victim's credentials which are then sent to the C&C server.

This malware utilized custom modules and targets Linux systems. It has been named FontOnLake and is being continually developed and includes functionality such as remote access and credential harvesting. Every instance of infection of FontOnLake has been accompanied by a rootkit which serves to conceal its presence. The malware also uses patched legitimate binaries such as the Linux 'cat' command, which are used to load components. The researchers theorized that this malware is only being used in targeted attacks because of the advanced design and low prevalence. FontOnLake consists of three main parts - trojanized applications, backdoors, and rootkits. The trojans are used to load the backdoors and rootkits and are also able to collect sensitive data. Three backdoors have been seen used in FontOnLake infections, and perform functions such as exfiltration, file manipulation, serving as a proxy, and executing shell commands and python scripts. Finally, the rootkit can conceal this behavior by hiding processes and files and hiding network connections, whilst also downloading and executing more malware. The samples of this malware seen in the wild, and the C2 server locations suggest that this malware is being used to target victims in Southeast Asia. All samples used unique C2 infrastructure with varying non-standard ports, which have been taken offline since being uploaded to VirusTotal.

Three backdoors have been seen used in FontOnLake infections, and perform functions such as exfiltration, file manipulation, serving as a proxy, and executing shell commands and python scripts. Finally, the rootkit can conceal this behavior by hiding processes and files and hiding network connections, whilst also downloading and executing more malware. The samples of this malware seen in the wild, and the C2 server locations suggest that this malware is being used to target victims in Southeast Asia. All samples used unique C2 infrastructure with varying non-standard ports, which have been taken offline since being uploaded to VirusTotal.

The attack likely began with a spearphishing email that had a password-protected ZIP file attached. The ZIP file contained a malicious document that, when opened, extracted and executed a malicious .HTA file that, in turn, downloaded a BazarLoader DLL which was then loaded into memory. Within two hours of the compromise, the attackers were manually gathering information about the environment. During the second day of the compromise, the attackers used RDP to access the backup server. In all, they spent four days carrying out their reconnaissance and using Rclone exfiltrated data of interest to the Mega file-sharing site.

The attack likely began with a spearphishing email that had a password-protected ZIP file attached. The ZIP file contained a malicious document that, when opened, extracted and executed a malicious .HTA file that, in turn, downloaded a BazarLoader DLL which was then loaded into memory. Within two hours of the compromise, the attackers were manually gathering information about the environment. During the second day of the compromise, the attackers used RDP to access the backup server. In all, they spent four days carrying out their reconnaissance and using Rclone exfiltrated data of interest to the Mega file-sharing site. On the fifth day, the backup server was used to deploy the Conti ransomware using a batch script that mounted the C$ dir of each host to be encrypted and drop the ransom note in each directory in which files were encrypted. Unusually, the attackers do not appear to have interacted with the Domain Controllers which would be the typical hosts used to deploy ransomware domain-wide.

Most recently, the groups have moved to almost exclusively targeting the U.S. The two groups, Nephos7 and eGobbler, have used similar TTPs in the campaigns such as the use of commercial ad servers to hide code, reverse proxies, JavaScript APIs, and WebGL-based fingerprinting. By the end of 2019, both groups had aligned patterns with large attacks in late-December 2019. In June 2020, both groups had switched focus to the U.S. The malvertising pages for both groups are very much similar in appearance. Beyond these similarities, there is no infrastructure overlap. Both groups use an .msi file with a signed installer dubbed Holcus Installer. Features of the installer include C2 server communications over HTTPS, RC4-type algorithms, PUA detection within Windows Defender, downloading and executing payloads, and communications with known C2 servers. Nephos7 was the largest digital marketer in Europe on May 24, 2020. Each group targets Windows-based machines and excludes Mac OS X. The mobile platform of choice for both is Android, although eGobbler started out as iOS targeting.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malvertising\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nBeginning in 2017, two malvertising groups have run campaigns against a myriad of targets. Most recently, the groups have moved to almost exclusively targeting the U.S. The two groups, Nephos7 and eGobbler, have used similar TTPs in the campaigns such as the use of commercial ad servers to hide code, reverse proxies, JavaScript APIs, and WebGL-based fingerprinting. By the end of 2019, both groups had aligned patterns with large attacks in late-December 2019. In June 2020, both groups had switched focus to the U.S. The malvertising pages for both groups are very much similar in appearance. Beyond these similarities, there is no infrastructure overlap. Both groups use an .msi file with a signed installer dubbed Holcus Installer. Features of the installer include C2 server communications over HTTPS, RC4-type algorithms, PUA detection within Windows Defender, downloading and executing payloads, and communications with known C2 servers. Nephos7 was the largest digital marketer in Europe on May 24, 2020. Each group targets Windows-based machines and excludes Mac OS X. The mobile platform of choice for both is Android, although eGobbler started out as iOS targeting.

It has some interesting characteristics not commonly seen with other RaaS offerings. It first appeared in the threat landscape at the end of April 2020. Similar to other ransomware services, a percentage of the profit made by the purchasers is provided to the operators in order to receive the payload and services. Additionally, the operators charge a registration fee, one that is quite a bit higher than those charged by competitors (.2 BTC or $1,800). One of the most unique features of SMAUG is its multi-platofrm support, allowing encryption of Windows, Linux and macOS systems. Additionally, when building the malicious payload, an option is provided to allow a single encryption key to be used across all victim hosts in a single company. Anti-analysis, offline execution, customizable campaigns are all features advertised in their forum posts. The payloads are generated via a web-based management interface as opposed to the more common offline builder. This web portal also allows victims to decrypt a single file for free. The generated payloads for Windows are obfuscated Go binaries. On Windows, persistence is established via the LoadAppInit_DLLs Registry key. A ransom note is dropped in all folders containing encrypted files. The researchers also note that the SMAUG portal provides detailed walkthroughs for victims and affiliates.

Anti-analysis, offline execution, customizable campaigns are all features advertised in their forum posts. The payloads are generated via a web-based management interface as opposed to the more common offline builder. This web portal also allows victims to decrypt a single file for free. The generated payloads for Windows are obfuscated Go binaries. On Windows, persistence is established via the LoadAppInit_DLLs Registry key. A ransom note is dropped in all folders containing encrypted files. The researchers also note that the SMAUG portal provides detailed walkthroughs for victims and affiliates.

The targeted entities include defense contractors, energy companies, government and military organizations, higher education institutions, law firms, logistics companies, media companies, political consultants and party organizations, and think tanks. The attacks are carried out using a Kubernetes cluster. The primary service targeted in the attacks has been Microsoft Office 365 cloud services, though other service providers and on-premise email servers are also targeted. If credentials are obtained they are typically used to gain an initial foothold before attempts are made to escalate privileges and move laterally. The attackers are also known to exploit vulnerabilities such as CVE-2020-0688 and CVE-2020-17144 for remote code execution or to further lateral movement within an environment. To anonymize the attacks, they are usually routed through Tor or VPN services, including those provided by CactusVPN, IPVanish, NordVPN, ProtonVPN, Surfshark, and WorldVPN.

This threat group is known to target organizations in the energy and telecommunication sectors located in the Middle East. The group has been using a .NET-based backdoor which is a modified version of the open-source tool, DIG.net. The modifications allow the backdoor to use DNS Hijacking to provide the backdoor's C&C communications. The backdoor uses DNS queries to a DNS server under the control of the attackers and the server's responses provide commands for the backdoor to carry out. In the campaign observed by Zscaler, the backdoor is delivered via a malicious Word document that uses the AutoOpen() and AutoClose() functions to drop the embedded backdoor onto the system. The backdoor, named \"DnsSystem\" is also copied to the system's startup folder to achieve persistence.

This threat group is known to target organizations in the energy and telecommunication sectors located in the Middle East. The group has been using a .NET-based backdoor which is a modified version of the open-source tool, DIG.net. The modifications allow the backdoor to use DNS Hijacking to provide the backdoor's C&C communications. The backdoor uses DNS queries to a DNS server under the control of the attackers and the server's responses provide commands for the backdoor to carry out. In the campaign observed by Zscaler, the backdoor is delivered via a malicious Word document that uses the AutoOpen() and AutoClose() functions to drop the embedded backdoor onto the system. The backdoor, named \"DnsSystem\" is also copied to the system's startup folder to achieve persistence.

    "context": "",
    "output": "\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Phishing, Data Theft\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nA phishing scheme involving the theft of Ledger cryptocurrency wallets is underway. The use of fake breach notifications serves are the initial lure for victims. The Ledger wallet is a hardware-based wallet used to store, manage, and trade cryptocurrency. Security for the wallets is in the form of a 24-word recovery phrase and can support other size phrases based on other wallets. Beginning in October 2020, Ledger stated fake emails regarding a new data breach were being received by users of the wallet. In order to avoid a breach on the wallet, users were instructed to install the latest version of Ledger Live and issue a new PIN. The phish uses a legitimate looking email with some obvious signs of its author's inept phishing skills. Capitalization, grammar errors, punctuation errors, and more are shown throughout the phish. The letter contains links to domain names with Punycode characters in the URLs thus allowing the attackers domain to, at first glance, appear legitimate. Should the victim download the fake version of Ledger Live, they're asked to enter their recovery phrase since they will be importing their legitimate wallet into a new version of the software.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Phishing, Data Theft\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nA phishing scheme involving the theft of Ledger cryptocurrency wallets is underway. The use of fake breach notifications serves are the initial lure for victims. The Ledger wallet is a hardware-based wallet used to store, manage, and trade cryptocurrency. Security for the wallets is in the form of a 24-word recovery phrase and can support other size phrases based on other wallets. Beginning in October 2020, Ledger stated fake emails regarding a new data breach were being received by users of the wallet. In order to avoid a breach on the wallet, users were instructed to install the latest version of Ledger Live and issue a new PIN. The phish uses a legitimate looking email with some obvious signs of its author's inept phishing skills. Capitalization, grammar errors, punctuation errors, and more are shown throughout the phish. The letter contains links to domain names with Punycode characters in the URLs thus allowing the attackers domain to, at first glance, appear legitimate. Should the victim download the fake version of Ledger Live, they're asked to enter their recovery phrase since they will be importing their legitimate wallet into a new version of the software. This trick only works on the desktop version of the software as the mobile version takes users to the legitimate page. The secret phrase is sent back to the attack, thus allowing them to access the wallet and steal all or part of the cryptocurrency in the wallet.

Password spraying attacks continue against administrator accounts identified on the victim host. Finally, with an administrator account compromised, a Cobalt Strike beacon is installed to be used for remote access instead of the initial remote access service that was abused. Scans are performed for network discovery, such as identifying proxy settings, hosts, services, and shares. Lateral movement occurs to compromise other hosts of interest, such as domain controllers, and obtain domain administrator credentials. On each victim host another Cobalt Strike beacon is installed; however, no persistence mechanism exists, so if the system is rebooted, the Cobalt Strike beacon will quit. Once lateral movement is complete, data of interest, such as intellectual property, emails, and personally identifiable information, on each host is identified and prepared for exfiltration. In some cases exfiltration occurs via the Cobalt Strike beacon, but in most cases the data is compressed with WinRAR and uploaded to an attacker-controlled cloud storage account, such as OneDrive.

According to a report from Kaspersky, one of the notable differences between BlackCat and other ransomware operators is that the BlackCat ransomware is written in the Rust language and provides variants for Linux and Windows. BlackCat uses the double extortion technique in their attacks and the tool used to exfiltrate data from a victim system is named Fendr, also known as ExMatter. This tool was previously associated with the BlackMatter ransomware group. Kaspersky notes that the modification and reuse of Fendr, and telemetry, suggests that some members of BlackCat are linked to the BlackMatter group. The version of the BlackCat ransomware analyzed by Kaspersky is a command-line application that accepts several arguments at runtime. Many of the operations it carries out, such as privilege escalation, deleting Windows shadow copies, and killing processes, are similar to other ransomware. For lateral movement, a compressed version of PsExec is used.

In order to reduce the amount of malicious code injected to a victim server, the attacker used cookie content to store the majority of the code. The initial code is injected into a file that will load on all pages on the WordPress site, such as wp-load.php. It first evaluates the presence of a cookie value defined by the attacker to ensure the backdoor web panel is not presented to regular users. If the correct cookie is present, a second cookie is checked. This second cookie contains the malicious PHP code to be executed. Since HTTP access logs don't record cookie data by default, it is unlikely a victim would be able to recover the malicious code, as was the case in Sucuri's investigation.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Backdoor\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nSucuri published a blog post analyzing a technique to gain backdoor access seen in a recent incident. In order to reduce the amount of malicious code injected to a victim server, the attacker used cookie content to store the majority of the code. The initial code is injected into a file that will load on all pages on the WordPress site, such as wp-load.php. It first evaluates the presence of a cookie value defined by the attacker to ensure the backdoor web panel is not presented to regular users. If the correct cookie is present, a second cookie is checked. This second cookie contains the malicious PHP code to be executed. Since HTTP access logs don't record cookie data by default, it is unlikely a victim would be able to recover the malicious code, as was the case in Sucuri's investigation. Any PHP code under 4096 bytes of the attacker's choice could be executed with this method though, such as retrieving a payload from a remote server. For more information, see the Sucuri blog post in the Reference section.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://blog.sucuri.net/2021/01/evaluating-cookies-to-hide-backdoors.html>"

Spectre is a Linux exploit, although there is a Windows version available. The binary has stripped its -h option and leaves a #define in order to avoid detection; however, files to leak or the kernel base address are still present. The authors have not taken the logging function out completely, which leaves strings that help in the reversing process. The exploit is a four-stage process. The first step is to find the superblock. The second step is to find inode of the file to dump. Third is to find the corresponding page address. Finally, the exploit dumps the content of the file in question. The default option is the /etc/shadow file. The content of this file is dumped into memory which only takes a couple of minutes to perform. The exploit checks for SMAP, and, if found, the process is aborted. The exploit uses cpuid as a serializing instruction, rdtsc for timing, and mfence / lfence as barriers. KASLR is bypassed by looking at /proc/kallsyms if available to unprivileged users or by using a generic prefetch side-channel. This method still works in up-to-date Linux installations. If the /proc/kallsym is not present, the exploit relies on hardcoded offsets. At present, only Fedora, ArchLinux, and Ubuntu are officially supported though there are functions to check for Debian and CentOS. There is not attribution listed in the article.

Initial infection is accomplished through said phishing email, which contains a Google document link, presumably, from the TrickBot gang. This link leads to the Bazar backdoor as well as the Buer loader. Trickbot has previously used different botnets, including Emotet, for the carrying out of its mission. Unlike most phishing emails, this contains no attachments, only a link to the aforementioned Google documents links. The body of the email states the recipient has been terminated and a link to the termination reasoning is included. In one such email, the reason for termination was positional redundancy. The link actually redirects to a URL used to download the malware payload. Most of the cases analyzed were instances where Bazar malware was downloaded; however, in some cases Buer loader was used. The packer for both is identical. The packed binaries contain an export function that is responsible for decryption and injection. First, a shell is deployed to decrypt a leaderless PE loader which contains the final payload. Using memory allocation, the payload is mapped into memory, given permissions, and transfers control. No self-injection is used. The Bazar backdoor is new malware and is part of TrickBot's toolkit. This is reserved for almost exclusively high profile targets. The Bazar loader is used to download and execute the backdoor, which, in turn, is used to execute binaries, scripts, modules, kill processes, and self removal. Control flow is obfuscated to hinder analysis. The Bazar loader is used to download the backdoor from a C2 using a URI format. This download was captured and analyzed. As with other Trickbot certificates, the certificates for Bazar were created in the same manner. It was also seen that the backdoor downloaded and executed the Cobalt Strike pentesting and post-exploit toolkit. It is hypothesized this is done so ransomware could be deployed, data stolen, or network access could be sold. Buer loader is sold on Russian underground forums.

One of the notable features of MoonBounce is that rather than being stored in the system's drives, it is implanted into the SPI flash located on the system's motherboard. This allows MoonBounce to survive the system's drives being formatted or replaced. MoonBounce's purpose is to provide the attackers the ability to deploy user-mode malware which in turn is used to deploy further payloads. The vector that was used to introduce MoonBounce into the system is as yet unknown however it is assumed that it was achieved remotely. Other malware, including Microcin, Mimikat_ssp, ScrambleCross, StealthMutant, and an unnamed and previously unknown backdoor written in Go, were found on other nodes in the same network but most of the malware has not been conclusively tied to the MoonBounce attack. Kaspersky attributes the attack, with medium to high confidence, to APT41. Other names that are associated with APT41 include Earth Baku and SparklingGoblin though these may be different groups who share resources and TTPs with APT41. There is also a potential, low confidence connection, between APT41 and a group named SixLittleMonkeys who may have been involved in the attack. APT41 is suspected to be a Chinese state-sponsored espionage group and the MoonBounce attack suggests espionage activity with lateral movement through the network and the exfiltration of data from certain systems.

According to Microsoft, a malware signature was added to Windows Defender and are conducting an internal investigation into how the driver could have passed through the signing process. An additional retrohunting Yara rule has been added to the Protection section below.\n\n### Original Post\n\nOn June 17th, a malware analyst at G DATA (@struppigel) posted on Twitter regarding a Netfilter rootkit sample that was code signed by Microsoft. Subsequently, multiple researchers, including Kevin Beaumont and Florian Roth, uncovered additional samples and related file and indicators of compromise. The earliest indicator discovered so far is a dropper sample submitted to VirusTotal on March 3rd, 2021. The Microsoft code signing signatures on the main rootkit payloads are verified as valid signatures. Kevin Beaumont notes that while anyone can apply for an EV signature for their drivers, that scenario would result in a co-signing by Microsoft, as opposed to them being the main signer, as seen in this case. Malware analysts have begun analyzing the payload. A thread by @jaydinbas dives into the infection chain and C2 communication. A few key characteristics he mentions are the ability to eavesdrop on SSL connections, IP redirection, and installing a root certificate. The researchers have noted that both C2 IP addresses identified so far are geo-located in China. This story is developing and we will provide updates to this report as further information is obtained.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report. \n\n# Recommendations\n\n    * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n    * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n    * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n    * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n    * Exercise caution with attachments and links in emails.\n\n# Reference\n\n    * <https://twitter.com/struppigel/status/1405483373280235520>\n\n    * <https://twitter.com/gossithedog/status/1405805536403243009?s=21>\n\n    * <https://twitter.com/jaydinbas/status/1406252350302527493>\n\n    * <https://twitter.com/cyb3rops/status/1405938448175964161>\n\n    * <https://www.fortiguard.com/threat-signal-report/3989/netfilter-rootkit-signed-with-a-valid-digital-certificate>\n    * <https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/microsoft-signed-a-malicious-netfilter-rootkit>",

An additional retrohunting Yara rule has been added to the Protection section below.\n\n### Original Post\n\nOn June 17th, a malware analyst at G DATA (@struppigel) posted on Twitter regarding a Netfilter rootkit sample that was code signed by Microsoft. Subsequently, multiple researchers, including Kevin Beaumont and Florian Roth, uncovered additional samples and related file and indicators of compromise. The earliest indicator discovered so far is a dropper sample submitted to VirusTotal on March 3rd, 2021. The Microsoft code signing signatures on the main rootkit payloads are verified as valid signatures. Kevin Beaumont notes that while anyone can apply for an EV signature for their drivers, that scenario would result in a co-signing by Microsoft, as opposed to them being the main signer, as seen in this case. Malware analysts have begun analyzing the payload. A thread by @jaydinbas dives into the infection chain and C2 communication. A few key characteristics he mentions are the ability to eavesdrop on SSL connections, IP redirection, and installing a root certificate. The researchers have noted that both C2 IP addresses identified so far are geo-located in China. This story is developing and we will provide updates to this report as further information is obtained.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report. \n\n# Recommendations\n\n    * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n    * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n    * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n    * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n    * Exercise caution with attachments and links in emails.\n\n# Reference\n\n    * <https://twitter.com/struppigel/status/1405483373280235520>\n\n    * <https://twitter.com/gossithedog/status/1405805536403243009?s=21>\n\n    * <https://twitter.com/jaydinbas/status/1406252350302527493>\n\n    * <https://twitter.com/cyb3rops/status/1405938448175964161>\n\n    * <https://www.fortiguard.com/threat-signal-report/3989/netfilter-rootkit-signed-with-a-valid-digital-certificate>\n    * <https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/microsoft-signed-a-malicious-netfilter-rootkit>"

According to Intel 471, the macro document is the most popular choice due to its lower price and compatibility with different versions of Microsoft Office. The document, when opened is a template that mimics a DocuSign document. This document leverages Excel 4.0 macros which are contained within a hidden sheet. These macros allow for the downloading of externally-hosted payloads and execution via regsvr32 or rundll32. After this implantation, other assorted malware can be downloaded and executed. The EtterSilent malware is being seen in several campaigns and was most recently used to drop an updated version of Trickbot. It's also been seen as part of a Bazar loader campaign. This particular campaign did not use the DocuSign template but, instead used the Excel spreadsheet which was named DocuSign. The maldoc downloaded the Bazar payload that, in turn, downloads a Bazar backdoor from another URL. Other malware seen using EtterSilent has been popular trojan banking apps BokBot, Gozi ISFB, and QBot. Those campaigns all use services run by Yalishanda, a notorious BPH provider.

A report from Sophos provides an analysis of SolarMarker and SEO campaigns that were used to distribute it throughout 2021. The SEO operations were, according to Sophos, were very effective with the results for their search phrases appearing high in the Google search results. To achieve the results the campaigns used three main methods, web pages and PDF documents hosted on compromised sites, and Google Groups discussions where the campaign operators would create fake conversations with between 500 and 600 entries. From the initial pages, a victim would be redirected to another site that has been known for hosting malware for some years. The victim would eventually be delivered an MSI installer that contained two files, a malicious PowerShell script, and a decoy executable. The decoy file was typically a legitimate installer for Wondershare's PDFelement or Adobe's Acrobat Pro DC. The SolarMarker payload is embedded in the PowerShell script, it is base64-encoded and encrypted. When the script is executed it carries out a number of operations including dropping the payload in the form of a DLL, establishing persistence, and creating a smokescreen directory that contains a large number of randomly named junk files, and a randomly named file which the payload is copied to. An LNK file is used to ultimately begin the process of decrypting the payload which is a DLL and then reflexively loading it.

A report from Cybereason's Nocturnus Team provides an analysis of a new PowerShell backdoor the group has begun using and has named it PowerLess. The report notes that PowerLess is run within a .NET context so powershell.exe is not executed. PowerShell is however executed by a section of the code when a request to kill a process is received from a C&C server. One of PowerLess' principal uses is the loading of further modules such as keyloggers and infostealers. In addition, the reports notes Cybereason's discovery of what may be new ransomware being developed by the group, as well as connections to the Memento ransomware.

This new malware has been seen in over 35,000 computers all around the world. Although there is no one focus that this malware is infecting, it does seem to be infecting a disproportionate amount of industrial control systems. This loader is delivered through a great variety of mechanisms, but the infection chain always begins with fake pirated software installer archives used to trick users. It is speculated that the slightly larger proportion of engineering systems infected could indicate that a possible objective of this campaign could be espionage. Overall, researchers discovered over 100 variants of the loader, which is being called \"PseudoManuscrypt Loader\", including a number of incomplete test builds. The malware performs extensive surveillance and data theft on victim machines and attempts to disable any antivirus solutions that may be running. Due to artifacts found in the code, it is possible that the developer behind the malware is a Chinese-speaking actor, supported by some of the libraries and times observed in the attacks.

The advisories also provide patches to fix the issues.\n\nXSA-333 addresses a denial of service vulnerability, CVE-2020-25602, resulting from the handling of guest access to MSR_MISC_ENABLE. They note that only x86 systems are vulnerable, not ARM systems. Additionally only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability, while x86 HVM/PVH guests cannot.\n\nXSA-334 addresses a denial of service vulnerability, CVE-2020-25598, resulting from a missing unlock in XENMEM_acquire_resource error path. This could allow a buggy or malicious HVM stubdomain to cause an RCU reference to be leaked. As stated by Xen, \"Only VMs using HVM stubdomains can exploit the vulnerability. VMs using PV stubdomains, or with emulators running in dom0 cannot exploit the vulnerability.\"\n\nXSA-336 addresses a denial of service vulnerability, CVE-2020-25604, resulting from a race when migrating timers between x86 HVM vCPU-s. This requires an x86 system with more than one vCPU and an x86 HVM guest account.\n\nXSA-337 addresses a denial of service vulnerability, CVE-2020-25595, due to PCI passthrough code reading back hardware registers. Risk of privilege escalation and information leaks also exists. Exploitation requires an x86 system that supports PCI passthrough, a guest account with guests with passed through PCI devices, and out-of-spec functionality.\n\nXSA-338 addresses a denial of service vulnerability, CVE-2020-25597, resulting from logic in the handling of event channel operations. Xen states \"only systems with untrusted guests permitted to create more than the default number of event channels are vulnerable.\"\n\nXSA-339 addresses a denial of service vulnerability, CVE-2020-25596, caused by the SYSENTER instruction leaving various state sanitization activities to software. Only x86 systems supporting the SYSENTER instruction in 64bit mode are vulnerable and only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.\n\nXSA-340 addresses a denial of service vulnerability, CVE-2020-25603, resulting from missing memory barriers when accessing/allocating an event channel. Risk of privilege escalation and information leaks also exists.\n\nXSA-342 addresses a denial of service vulnerability, CVE-2020-25600, resulting from out of bounds event channels available to 32-bit x86 domains. Only x86 32-bit domains servicing other domains are vulnerable.\n\nXSA-343 addresses a privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2020-25599, resulting from races with evtchn_reset(). Denial of service conditions and information leaks are also possible.\n\nXSA-344 addresses a denial of service vulnerability, CVE-2020-25601, due to lack of preemption in evtchn_reset().\n\nWe recommend reviewing the security advisories, linked to in the References section, and applying relevant patches as soon as possible.\n\n# CVEs\n\n  * A complete list of CVEs can be found here: [ CVEs.txt](/download/attachments/30769860/Xen%20Security%20Advisories%20-%20September%2022%2C%202020%20CVEs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1600876675426&api=v2)\n\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Review the source article for full details.\n\n  * Apply applicable patches, updates, or workarounds as necessary. \n\n\n\n\n# References\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-333.html>\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-334.html>\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-336.html>\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-337.html>\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-338.html>\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-339.html>\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-340.html>\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-342.html>\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-343.html>\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-344.html>",

During an investigation of an intrusion, Mandiant found that that the initial infection vector was a Trojanized application installer. The installer was downloaded from the legitimate site of a security camera PVR vendor. While Mandiant reported the compromised installers to the vendor, the attackers may also have been able to replace the Trojanized installers. The installer was downloaded in a .zip file and, when extracted and executed, created two files. One was a clean copy of the installer, which functioned normally. The other file launched a URL using the command line. The URL resulted in two more files that leveraged VBScript and PowerShell and attempted to download the SMOKEDHAM dropper. The dropper is used to install the SMOKEDHAM backdoor. Aside from providing the attackers the ability to execute commands on the victim system, it also logs keystrokes and uploads the captured data to a C&C server every five minutes. SMOKEDHAM was also observed downloading UltraVNC and an NGROK utility. UltraVNC was used to download and install a dropper for Cobalt Strike. Data was dumped from the LSASS process and the attackers were observed using RDP to move laterally to other systems. In this case, the attackers were prevented from installing the ransomware payload. Mandiant suspects that few victims were compromised via the Trojanized installers and attributes the attack to the Darkside affiliate UNC2465.

The installer was downloaded from the legitimate site of a security camera PVR vendor. While Mandiant reported the compromised installers to the vendor, the attackers may also have been able to replace the Trojanized installers. The installer was downloaded in a .zip file and, when extracted and executed, created two files. One was a clean copy of the installer, which functioned normally. The other file launched a URL using the command line. The URL resulted in two more files that leveraged VBScript and PowerShell and attempted to download the SMOKEDHAM dropper. The dropper is used to install the SMOKEDHAM backdoor. Aside from providing the attackers the ability to execute commands on the victim system, it also logs keystrokes and uploads the captured data to a C&C server every five minutes. SMOKEDHAM was also observed downloading UltraVNC and an NGROK utility. UltraVNC was used to download and install a dropper for Cobalt Strike. Data was dumped from the LSASS process and the attackers were observed using RDP to move laterally to other systems. In this case, the attackers were prevented from installing the ransomware payload. Mandiant suspects that few victims were compromised via the Trojanized installers and attributes the attack to the Darkside affiliate UNC2465. Further details are available from the report linked in the Reference section below.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report. \n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n  * Exercise caution with attachments and links in emails.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/06/darkside-affiliate-supply-chain-software-compromise.html>"

According to a report from Group-IB, the most active campaign Prometheus has been used in targeted individuals in Belgium. The second most active campaign targeted government organizations and companies involved in the banking, cybersecurity, education, energy, finance, healthcare, insurance, IT, mining, and retail sectors, in the United States. Prometheus TDS provides the operator an administration panel that allows them to configure the parameters for a campaign, including features such as filtering potential victims based on browser version, geolocation, and operating system. Compromised websites that are hosting a PHP file named Prometheus.Backdoor are used as intermediaries between the operator's administration panel and the victim. A victim first receives a malspam email that contains either an HTML file or links which lead the victim to either a compromised server with the Prometheus.Backdoor installed or to a Google Doc which contains a malicious link. Victims end up being directed to a Prometheus.Backdoor server that collects the user's data and passes it to the administration panel where checks such as geolocation are carried out. A victim will then be redirected to another URL, or a file will be sent directly to the victim. The files are typically Word or Excel documents, and ZIP or RAR archives. The malware that has been deployed in the campaigns includes Campo Loader, Hancitor, QBot, IcedID, Buer Loader, SocGholish, and some unidentified VBS Loaders. Further payloads including Cobalt Strike, Ficker Stealer, Send-Safe, TrickBot, and Ursnif, have also been downloaded. Prometheus TDS campaigns have also been observed directing victims to sites selling pharmaceutical products, and banking phishing sites. A Prometheus TDS subscription costs $250 per month. While investigating infrastructure that had hosted the Prometheus TDS administration panels, Group-IB observed that in some cases it had been replaced with another MaaS offering named BRChecker.

The attack has been attributed to a threat group that Ukraine's CERT identifies as UAC-0056. The spearphishing email had a malicious Word document that contained JavaScript attached. The JavaScript was an initial loader that in turn executed PowerShell code to download and install two payloads, a downloader named SaintBot and a document stealer named OutSteel. The theme of the phishing email was that the recipient had allegedly committed a crime.

The attack has been attributed to a threat group that Ukraine's CERT identifies as UAC-0056. The spearphishing email had a malicious Word document that contained JavaScript attached. The JavaScript was an initial loader that in turn executed PowerShell code to download and install two payloads, a downloader named SaintBot and a document stealer named OutSteel. The theme of the phishing email was that the recipient had allegedly committed a crime. Other attacks that targeted organizations in Ukraine that occurred in 2021 and have been attributed to UAC-0056 are also documented.

A report from Malwarebytes Labs looks at a recent campaign conducted by APT28 that targeted Ukraine and delivers a malicious document named \"Nuclear Terrorism A Very Real Threat.rtf\". While the report doesn't specify the delivery mechanism for the document, spearphishing emails would be the likely vector. The document exploits the Follina vulnerability to deliver and execute PowerShell code that deploys a variant of an unnamed infostealer that APT28 has used in previous attacks. The infostealer collects website credentials and cookies from the Chrome, Edge, and Firefox web browsers. The collected data is then exfiltrated using the IMAP protocol.

      "xfe_report": "Summary\n=======\n\n\n\nAttack Details\n==============\n\n* **Threat Type:** Malware\n* **Targets:** Individuals and organizations located in Ukraine\n* **Associated Threat Actors:** APT28, aka Sofacy, and Fancy Bear\n* **Malware Family/Families:** Unnamed infostealer\n* **Initial Infection Vector:** Malicious document exploiting the Follina vulnerability, CVE-2022-30190\n* **Post-Compromise Actions:** Collection and exfiltration of data\n* **Additional TTPs:**See the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below\n\nOverview\n========\n\nAPT28, also commonly referred to as Sofacy or Fancy Bear, is believed to be a Russian state-sponsored APT actor that is thought to have been active since at least 2004. A report from Malwarebytes Labs looks at a recent campaign conducted by APT28 that targeted Ukraine and delivers a malicious document named \"Nuclear Terrorism A Very Real Threat.rtf\". While the report doesn't specify the delivery mechanism for the document, spearphishing emails would be the likely vector. The document exploits the Follina vulnerability to deliver and execute PowerShell code that deploys a variant of an unnamed infostealer that APT28 has used in previous attacks. The infostealer collects website credentials and cookies from the Chrome, Edge, and Firefox web browsers. The collected data is then exfiltrated using the IMAP protocol.

After exploiting ProxyLogon (CVE-2021-27065) on vulnerable on-premise versions of Microsoft Exchange Server, the threat actor installed a webshell in order to allow further remote command execution. A PowerShell command was executed via this webshell to download and install the ransomware payload from a remote server. Analysis of the payload reveals that it is a Python script compiled into an executable using PyInstaller. It contains a list of folders to avoid encrypting and kills SQL services to unlock database files. The generated encryption key and ID are uploaded to a [mega.io](http://mega.io) account. Finally, encryption is performed by reading the original file, overwriting it with encrypted content, and renaming it. No indicators are added to the file to prevent the file from being encrypted again. After encryption completes, the mouse and keyboard are disabled and a full screen window displays a ransom note and a countdown timer. Sophos notes that review of the cryptocurrency transaction log reveals at least one victim has paid the ransom. For more information, see the Sophos blog post in the Reference section.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report. \n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/03/23/black-kingdom/>",

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Ransomware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nSophos published a blog post analyzing Black KingDom's use of the ProxyLogon exploit to distribute its ransomware payloads. After exploiting ProxyLogon (CVE-2021-27065) on vulnerable on-premise versions of Microsoft Exchange Server, the threat actor installed a webshell in order to allow further remote command execution. A PowerShell command was executed via this webshell to download and install the ransomware payload from a remote server. Analysis of the payload reveals that it is a Python script compiled into an executable using PyInstaller. It contains a list of folders to avoid encrypting and kills SQL services to unlock database files. The generated encryption key and ID are uploaded to a [mega.io](http://mega.io) account. Finally, encryption is performed by reading the original file, overwriting it with encrypted content, and renaming it. No indicators are added to the file to prevent the file from being encrypted again. After encryption completes, the mouse and keyboard are disabled and a full screen window displays a ransom note and a countdown timer. Sophos notes that review of the cryptocurrency transaction log reveals at least one victim has paid the ransom. For more information, see the Sophos blog post in the Reference section.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report. \n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/03/23/black-kingdom/>"

Several reports indicate the receipt of an email stating the product for which the customer may or may not have a legitimate license for has been seen in the wild. The email states that a subscription service offered by the company has been renewed at a rate much higher than the actual rate the company charges for this product. The threat actors show a charge of between $300-500. A typical yearly subscription for the product is actually about $100. The scam uses these emails in the hopes the victim will call and try to get the charges reversed. Should victims call, they're pointed to a website wherein a technician will remotely connect to their computer and 'uninstall' the product in question. Once the product is 'removed', the promise of a refund is given. Instead, the actors ask the victim to download TeamViewer and to share their ID and password to connect to the victim machine. The actors then install a second program to achieve persistence. In the same way as a tech support scheme, the threat actors use notepad to concoct a note telling the victim of the risks of not continuing with the product. Using SysKey, the actors place a password known only to them is installed on the computer. Should this be the case, a VBS script is downloaded and placed in the Startup folder. Upon completion of these acts, the scammers attempt to have the victim restart their machine in order to complete the 'uninstall' process. After restart, a Windows license expiration is displayed with a button to click. This button opens many browser windows to give the appearance of a malware infection.

This ransomware is very unsophisticated, with a low ransom demand, simple encryption routine, and no obfuscation. Upon execution, volume shadow copies are deleted to inhibit recovery.

The ransom note dropped on the system requests that victims purchase a prepaid voucher from Paysafecard in order to retrieve their files. The purchased voucher codes are requested via a decryption utility that is also dropped by the ransomware.

This ransomware is very unsophisticated, with a low ransom demand, simple encryption routine, and no obfuscation. Upon execution, volume shadow copies are deleted to inhibit recovery. Then the encryption process begins, with the name of every file encrypted being added to a custom registry key. The ransom note dropped on the system requests that victims purchase a prepaid voucher from Paysafecard in order to retrieve their files. The purchased voucher codes are requested via a decryption utility that is also dropped by the ransomware. The researchers point out that while the ransom note claims victim data was also stolen and will be leaked if the ransom is note paid, there is no evidence that the ransomware payload is capable of performing exfiltration. For more information, see the Minerva Labs blog post in the Reference section.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * A complete list of IoCs can be found here: [ IoCs.txt](/download/attachments/74056432/TimeTime%20Ransomware%20IoCs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1640628198948&api=v2)\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Use anti-virus software and ensure software and associated files are up to date (M1049).\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level (M1051).\n  * Train users to identify social engineering techniques and phishing emails (M1017).\n\n\n\n# References\n\n  * <https://blog.minerva-labs.com/meet-the-timetime-ransomware-the-ransomware-that-asks-for-100-via-paysafecard>\n\n\n\n# MITRE ATT&CK Framework\n\n **Resource Development - TA0042**  \nT1587 - Develop Capabilities  \nT1587.001 - Malware  \n  \n **Impact - TA0040**  \nT1486 - Data Encrypted for Impact  \nT1490 - Inhibit System Recovery"

The DFIR Report has published an analysis of an attack in which BazarLoader was used to deploy the Diavol ransomware. The initial compromise was achieved using a spearphishing email that contained a link to OneDrive which directed the victim to a ZIP file that contained an ISO file. Inside the ISO was an LNK file and a DLL, the victim executing the LNK file initiating the BazarLoader infection. Multiple rounds of reconnaissance were conducted using various tools and multiple Cobalt Strike beacons were deployed on the initially compromised host. Eventually, the actor moved laterally via RDP to a host that contained shared files and installed AnyDesk and Filezilla which was used to exfiltrate data. Multiple techniques were used in attempts to obtain credentials and the actor moved on to critical hosts such as domain controllers and backup servers. On many hosts, AnyDesk was installed, and RDP access to all endpoints from the compromised central file server was established. The actual act of encrypting drives took place some 40 hours after the initial compromise and began with the execution of a batch file that stopped all services on a host, removed the Volume Shadow copies, and disabled the Windows automatic startup repair. RDP was then used to copy the Diavol ransomware executable to each system and then executed manually.

The analysis mainly focuses on the communications between the malware and the C2 server, and details three different modes of communication. If the machine does not have internet access, the malware will open a named pipe and use it to connect to another machine in the network which does have internet access and use this as a proxy to exfiltrate data. There is a command for an instance of MiniDuke to set up a named pipe and listen for connections if another machine in the network requires it.

In recent cases, they have used the Log4Shell exploit to target VMware Horizon servers. The exploit is used to execute PowerShell commands that will download files and return command outputs via a webhook. The group additionally uses PowerShell reverse shells to perform further post-compromise actions. Two different reverse shells were identified that ultimately provided backdoor access, allowing TunnelVision to execute recon commands, add a backdoor user, harvest credentials, tunnel RDP traffic, and deploy further reverse shells. The researchers noted an overlap between this group and those called Phosphorus by Microsoft and Charming Kitten or Nemesis Kitten by CrowdStrike.

    "output": "Sure! Here is the information I have about the threat: Ransomware Ads Being Banned at a Rapid Pace\nHot on the heels of the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, cybercrime forums, threat groups, and others are reevaluating their business model. According to several reports of varying sources, even Darkside has claimed to have taken itself offline.\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Ransomware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nDue to what is being described as indiscriminate targeting, many forums, repos, and even some threat groups are taking steps to ensure a \"proper vetting\" of targets occurs prior to attack. The forums and repos have gone so far as to ban any ransomware ads placed on the sites. Any type of ad touting ransomware is removed. Leading the way in this effort is the XSS Russian-speaking forum. RaaS gangs such as REvil, LockBit, DarkSide, Netwalker, Nefilim, Babuk, and others have been using these forums to recruit new members, partners, and affiliates. The owner of XSS feels that ransomware is bringing \"unwanted attention to the site and has become dangerous and toxic,\" according to a quote obtained by Bleeping Computer. Many of the RaaS gangs are purportedly leaving the forums for others that are more welcoming of their type of activity, such as exploit.in. This move will, most likely, be a temporary one as more and more forums are banning these gangs/actors. Forum admins have also stated they will remove all ransomware-related topics as well as affiliate programs. \n\nIn a surprise move, DarkSide has claimed to have ceased operations. This closure is a result of the attack on the Colonial Pipeline that caused major interruptions in the flow of petroleum to large sections of the eastern United States. DarkSide has released a \"press release\" stating they are apolitical and will vet targets before any future attacks. Colonial Pipeline reportedly paid nearly $5M in cryptocurrency to obtain a decryption key from the actors. One well-known threat actor, UNKN, stated the operations ceased due to the loss of access to the public data leak site, payment servers, and CDN servers \"at the request of law enforcement agencies,\" and cryptocurrency being moved to an unknown wallet. DarkSide has confirmed UNKN's claims. DarkSide also announced the requirement of providing decryption keys to each target that have been attacked and would compensate all financial obligations by May 23, 2021. \n\nREvil has imposed new restrictions on the targeting of entities.

      "xfe_q": "Ransomware Ads Being Banned at a Rapid Pace\nHot on the heels of the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, cybercrime forums, threat groups, and others are reevaluating their business model. According to several reports of varying sources, even Darkside has claimed to have taken itself offline.",
      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Ransomware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nDue to what is being described as indiscriminate targeting, many forums, repos, and even some threat groups are taking steps to ensure a \"proper vetting\" of targets occurs prior to attack. The forums and repos have gone so far as to ban any ransomware ads placed on the sites. Any type of ad touting ransomware is removed. Leading the way in this effort is the XSS Russian-speaking forum. RaaS gangs such as REvil, LockBit, DarkSide, Netwalker, Nefilim, Babuk, and others have been using these forums to recruit new members, partners, and affiliates. The owner of XSS feels that ransomware is bringing \"unwanted attention to the site and has become dangerous and toxic,\" according to a quote obtained by Bleeping Computer. Many of the RaaS gangs are purportedly leaving the forums for others that are more welcoming of their type of activity, such as exploit.in. This move will, most likely, be a temporary one as more and more forums are banning these gangs/actors. Forum admins have also stated they will remove all ransomware-related topics as well as affiliate programs. \n\nIn a surprise move, DarkSide has claimed to have ceased operations. This closure is a result of the attack on the Colonial Pipeline that caused major interruptions in the flow of petroleum to large sections of the eastern United States. DarkSide has released a \"press release\" stating they are apolitical and will vet targets before any future attacks. Colonial Pipeline reportedly paid nearly $5M in cryptocurrency to obtain a decryption key from the actors. One well-known threat actor, UNKN, stated the operations ceased due to the loss of access to the public data leak site, payment servers, and CDN servers \"at the request of law enforcement agencies,\" and cryptocurrency being moved to an unknown wallet. DarkSide has confirmed UNKN's claims. DarkSide also announced the requirement of providing decryption keys to each target that have been attacked and would compensate all financial obligations by May 23, 2021. \n\nREvil has imposed new restrictions on the targeting of entities. Affiliates are now required to obtain permission in order to target an organization. According to the representative of REvil, health care, education, etc. are all prohibited targets as are government sectors of any country.

According to ESET the major change in the bootkit was the move to targeting UEFI systems with little other change in ESPecter's components. The sample analyzed by ESET was found on a compromised system. Also found was a user-mode client component that has the ability to log keystrokes and steal documents. ESET believes that ESPecter is primarily used for espionage. The method used to distribute ESPecter remains unknown. To achieve the infection of a system, a legitimate Windows Boot Manager binary is modified to allow the attacker to execute ESPecter early in the boot process and provides the ability to bypass Windows Driver Signature Enforcement allowing ESPecter to load its unsigned driver. However, Secure Boot must be disabled for this to work on Windows 8 and later. Secure Boot is not supported on versions of Windows prior to Windows 8. ESET has been unable to determine how the attackers were able to disable Secure Boot but note that they could have achieved it through having physical access to the system, Secure Boot may have already been disabled, or by exploiting a vulnerability in the UEFI firmware. The driver is used to load two user-mode payloads, WinSys.dll and Client.dll, which are used to log keystrokes, take screenshots, collect and exfiltrate documents, handle C&C communications, and can download further payloads. ESET was not able to attribute ESPecter to a known threat actor but given that there are debug messages in Chinese in the user-mode client component, it is possibly the work of an unknown Chinese-speaking actor.

Its affiliates are provided access to a control panel and the operators offer many services including DDoS attacks. AvosLocker initially offered Windows ransomware but has also added a variant that targets Linux machines. A report from Qualys notes that AvosLocker is spread using spam emails, earlier reporting from another vendor notes that in January the AvosLocker operators or affiliates were exploiting the Microsoft Exchange Proxyshell vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-31206, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-31207) to gain access to systems. The Qualys report provides a listing of the command line options available for both the Linux and Windows versions and details of the encryption process, data from the victim system is exfiltrated prior to encryption.

Its affiliates are provided access to a control panel and the operators offer many services including DDoS attacks. AvosLocker initially offered Windows ransomware but has also added a variant that targets Linux machines. A report from Qualys notes that AvosLocker is spread using spam emails, earlier reporting from another vendor notes that in January the AvosLocker operators or affiliates were exploiting the Microsoft Exchange Proxyshell vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-31206, CVE-2021-34523, and CVE-2021-31207) to gain access to systems. The Qualys report provides a listing of the command line options available for both the Linux and Windows versions and details of the encryption process, data from the victim system is exfiltrated prior to encryption. The ransom notes left on the encrypted systems provide a unique ID for the victim and instructions to connect to the AvosLocker TOR site to make a payment to obtain a decryption key.

The new variant is delivered using phishing emails with a malicious Excel file attached. The sample email shown in the FortiGuard report purports to be about updated US Import Tariffs. If the recipient opens the attached Excel file, and macros are enabled, data from certain cells in the Excel sheet are written to a local file. This file is an .hta file. The Excel file contains both an auto-run VBA macro and an Excel 4.0 Macro.

This activity has been ongoing since late August 2021, with attacks occurring as recently as October. Researchers have attributed this activity to the same actors as were reported by ESET in 2020. The campaign involves a banking trojan, which is prevalent in South American cybercrime. The trojan will sit on the victim's computer and monitor their online activities. Once the user navigates to a URL that matches a hardcoded list of URLs, it will replace the web page with a false login screen in an attempt to harvest the victim's banking credentials. The initial infection vector is unknown, but it is speculated that this will have come from a phishing campaign or malvertising. From these links, the victims are then redirected to an AWS URL, where an MSI file is downloaded. If the victim runs this file, a secondary C2 server is contacted to download a zip file containing a malicious DLL, as well as other legitimate executables. This malicious DLL is a large file to avoid scanning by antivirus software and uses search-order hijacking to load the malicious code.

Once installed, the malware can perform a wide array of functions. At its core, it can steal usernames, passwords, cookies, saved credentials, and credit card information from browsers. It can also gather files from cryptocurrency cold wallets and other locations. Beyond that, RedLine Stealer is capable of performing basic download and execute functions, meaning it can be used as a loader in a multi-stage attack. RedLine is being continually developed by a competent C# developer, and so new versions of this malware are being released regularly.

    "output": "You are asking about a specific threat report. Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nResearchers at Morphisec have analyzed a highly sophisticated CaaS that is used in the delivery of numerous RATs onto target machines. The crypter employs advanced detection bypass techniques, including executing PowerShell code with remotesigned parameter, validating the existence of Windows Sandbox and VMWare virtualization, using Pastebin and top4top for staging, and compiling RunPE loaders on the endpoint in runtime. The name Snip3 comes from the username found in current and previous variants of the malware. First observed in early-February and still ongoing, the variant has proven to be evasive and very few security products are able to detect it. The first stage of the crypter is a VB Script that loads and moves execution on to the second-stage, a PowerShell script. At present, four versions containing 11 sub-versions have been seen in this first stage. The second stage, a PowerShell script, contains similarities to the VBS versions and appears to be dynamic, based on configuration data seen in this stage. The script is able to detect script execution within various sandbox environments, such as Microsoft Sandbox, VMWare, and others. If a virtual environment is detected, the script is terminated and the RAT is not loaded. Interestingly, the malware author has built in a script that can detect the elusive Microsoft Sandbox environment by extracting the Manufacturer string.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nResearchers at Morphisec have analyzed a highly sophisticated CaaS that is used in the delivery of numerous RATs onto target machines. The crypter employs advanced detection bypass techniques, including executing PowerShell code with remotesigned parameter, validating the existence of Windows Sandbox and VMWare virtualization, using Pastebin and top4top for staging, and compiling RunPE loaders on the endpoint in runtime. The name Snip3 comes from the username found in current and previous variants of the malware. First observed in early-February and still ongoing, the variant has proven to be evasive and very few security products are able to detect it. The first stage of the crypter is a VB Script that loads and moves execution on to the second-stage, a PowerShell script. At present, four versions containing 11 sub-versions have been seen in this first stage. The second stage, a PowerShell script, contains similarities to the VBS versions and appears to be dynamic, based on configuration data seen in this stage. The script is able to detect script execution within various sandbox environments, such as Microsoft Sandbox, VMWare, and others. If a virtual environment is detected, the script is terminated and the RAT is not loaded. Interestingly, the malware author has built in a script that can detect the elusive Microsoft Sandbox environment by extracting the Manufacturer string. The second stage RAT observed by Morphisec contains GZIP source code and is executed in runtime. The third stage RAT payloads are chosen by the user and executed within memory. Most often ASyncRAT or RevengeRAT are observed as the RAT payloads. There was one instance each of Agent Tesla and NetWire RATs seen in analysis.

The attack chain begins with widespread credential phishing and brute force attacks against public facing email, LDAP, Microsoft Autodiscover, SMB, and SQL servers. The compromised accounts are then used to send out spear phishing emails to their true targets. The specific campaign Trend Micro focused on in the blog post begins with a phishing email that attempts to convince a user to open an RAR file containing a self-extracting archive. The self-extracting archive, in turn, contained two executables. The first one is a decoy file that requests a password for decryption, but regardless of the entered password, an error message is displayed. The second file is the malicious payload. After establishing persistence via the Startup directory, it is able to function as a RAT that communicates via Google Drive. It periodically polls a Google Drive account for the presence of a command file. If discovered, the contained commands are executed, the output is saved to a Google Drive file in the same account, and the command file is deleted. A keylogger was also observed being installed. Collected keystrokes are saved locally, but exfiltration is not built in and would have to be performed by the RAT. Trend Micro notes that they also observed samples of similar RATs that communicated over IMAP instead of Google Drive. Furthermore, the malware has been improved to add improvements such as encryption.

Network traffic to bank sites - Privat Bank and Oschad Bank - was seen spiking as the the attack commenced along with customer reports of the websites being unavailable. Some Privat Bank customers in the Ukraine received SMS messages crafted by adversaries warning that ATMs would not work on February 15th. In addition, a BGP hijack against the Privat Bank's IP space caused traffic routing issues for users. The report also mentions other components to the attack such as DDoS attacks against .gov.ua DNS servers. The news outlet, tsn.ua, named zsu.gov.ua and mil.gov.ua as specific Ukrainian government victims. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense also confirmed the attack via Twitter. The report calls out Mirai and derivative Katana as likely botnets used to launch the attack. It goes on to name exploited Avtech network cameras as the launch point for the attacks. Overall, Cado Security's report calls these attacks moderately impactful. They were not particularly successful but the combination of methods suggests there is a base level of sophistication coordinated by the adversary.

      "xfe_report": "# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Malware\n  *  **Targets:** Ukrainian Financial and Government Organizations\n  *  **Malware Family/Families:** Katana bot (derivative of Mirai) \n  * **Initial Infection Vector:** Botnet \n  * **Post-Compromise Actions:** DDoS\n  *  **Additional TTPs:** See the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below.\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nCado Security reports that between February 15-16th a number of Financial, Government, and Military websites fell victim to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. Network traffic to bank sites - Privat Bank and Oschad Bank - was seen spiking as the the attack commenced along with customer reports of the websites being unavailable. Some Privat Bank customers in the Ukraine received SMS messages crafted by adversaries warning that ATMs would not work on February 15th. In addition, a BGP hijack against the Privat Bank's IP space caused traffic routing issues for users. The report also mentions other components to the attack such as DDoS attacks against .gov.ua DNS servers. The news outlet, tsn.ua, named zsu.gov.ua and mil.gov.ua as specific Ukrainian government victims. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense also confirmed the attack via Twitter. The report calls out Mirai and derivative Katana as likely botnets used to launch the attack. It goes on to name exploited Avtech network cameras as the launch point for the attacks. Overall, Cado Security's report calls these attacks moderately impactful. They were not particularly successful but the combination of methods suggests there is a base level of sophistication coordinated by the adversary.

I need overview, related mitre attack informations if exists, IoCs, recommandations and possible references.",
    "context": "",
    "output": "You are asking about a specific threat report. Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, RAT\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nA new RAT has been observed by Cybereason's Nocturnus team. The RAT, PyVil RAT is being distributed by the cyber group, Evilnum. The group has been active for at least the past two years using a variety of tools. The group has historically targeted the Financial Technology industry and uses the Know Your Customer procedure to begin infection. Included in the new malware are deviations from the infection chain, persistence, infrastructure, and tools observed including modified, legitimate executables, a multi-process delivery of the payload, and the PyVil RAT. The new infection chain begins with spearphishing emails with attached ZIP archives containing LNK files, which drop a JavaScript Trojan. The attached files masquerade as utility bills, credit card photos, and driver license photos. Upon execution, a JavaScript file is written and executed which, in turn, replaces the LNK file with a PDF. This JavaScript is merely a dropper and has no C2 communication capabilities. This is but the first step in the new infection chain that culminates with the delivery of the PyVil RAT. After the PDF is placed, the JS file is copied which leads to the execution of ddpp.exe embedded in the LNK file. A registry key is entered for persistence and a scheduled task is created. The scheduled task is responsible for retrieving payloads. The executable ddpp.exe is a Java Web Start Launcher that has been trojanized to execute malicious code. The functionality of ddpp.exe is that of a downloader for next stage infection. From this point, shellcode is unpacked and connects to a C2 using a GET request. The malware downloads another encrypted executable, saved as fplayer.exe, which is then executed with a new scheduled task. This downloaded executable acts as an additional downloader. The payload is loaded into memory and is a fileless RAT. Again, at this point, the file is executed with a scheduled task named \"Adobe Update Task.\" Several arguments are executed with this EXE file. This particular file appears to be a trojanized version of \"Stereoscopic 3D driver Installer.\" When this file is executed, further shellcode is unpacked and connects to the C2 via a GET request. A final payload is received, which is the PyVil RAT. This RAT is heavily obfuscated to prevent decompiling the payload. The RAT has several functions such as: keylogger, running cmd commands, taking screenshots, obtaining more Python scripts, dropping and unloading executables among others. C2 communications are accomplished by POST HTTP requests and are RC4 encrypted with hardcoded keys. The C2 domain changes frequently but appears to resolve to the same three IP addresses.

This is but the first step in the new infection chain that culminates with the delivery of the PyVil RAT. After the PDF is placed, the JS file is copied which leads to the execution of ddpp.exe embedded in the LNK file. A registry key is entered for persistence and a scheduled task is created. The scheduled task is responsible for retrieving payloads. The executable ddpp.exe is a Java Web Start Launcher that has been trojanized to execute malicious code. The functionality of ddpp.exe is that of a downloader for next stage infection. From this point, shellcode is unpacked and connects to a C2 using a GET request. The malware downloads another encrypted executable, saved as fplayer.exe, which is then executed with a new scheduled task. This downloaded executable acts as an additional downloader. The payload is loaded into memory and is a fileless RAT. Again, at this point, the file is executed with a scheduled task named \"Adobe Update Task.\" Several arguments are executed with this EXE file. This particular file appears to be a trojanized version of \"Stereoscopic 3D driver Installer.\" When this file is executed, further shellcode is unpacked and connects to the C2 via a GET request. A final payload is received, which is the PyVil RAT. This RAT is heavily obfuscated to prevent decompiling the payload. The RAT has several functions such as: keylogger, running cmd commands, taking screenshots, obtaining more Python scripts, dropping and unloading executables among others. C2 communications are accomplished by POST HTTP requests and are RC4 encrypted with hardcoded keys. The C2 domain changes frequently but appears to resolve to the same three IP addresses.

Analysis by VMWare unveils capabilities associated with the malware. TigerRAT has the ability to manipulate files, execute remote commands, log keystrokes, and remotely view and control the victim machine. The RAT originates from a loader app. Within the sample analyzed, configuration data for C2 communication is stored in encrypted form in the malware. This communication is disguised to appear as normal HTTP web traffic using port 443. The payload is structured in a 4-byte size, 16-byte key, and base64 encoded.

      "xfe_q": "TigerRAT - New RAT on the Block\nVMWare has published a blog detailing TigerRAT, a new malware that shares similarities with malware previously used by Andariel, a subset of Lazarus.",
      "xfe_report": "# Threat Details\n\n  *  **Malware Type:** RAT\n  *  **Associated Threat Actors:** Unknown though shares similarities with Andariel\n  *  **Associated Payloads:** TigerRAT\n  *  **Targets:** N/A\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Unknown\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Manipulate files, execute remote commands, log keystrokes, remote control over victim machine\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nTigerRAT is a new RAT discovered by the Korean Internet & Security Agency (KISA). Analysis by VMWare unveils capabilities associated with the malware. TigerRAT has the ability to manipulate files, execute remote commands, log keystrokes, and remotely view and control the victim machine. The RAT originates from a loader app. Within the sample analyzed, configuration data for C2 communication is stored in encrypted form in the malware. This communication is disguised to appear as normal HTTP web traffic using port 443. The payload is structured in a 4-byte size, 16-byte key, and base64 encoded. Decryption of the payload executes the malware in memory. C2s are decrypted using CryptorDES. Various commands can be sent and received from the C2, such as those for gathering victim machine information as well as module updates.

Around 2018, the focus had shifted to include Android in its repertoire. The spyware initially targeted the Indian armed forces but appears, now, to be more indiscriminate in its targeting of Indian users. Using several Android apps, the spyware is targeting users of mobile platform travel apps such as: Travel Mate, used for travellers in India. This particular app is a legitimate app on the Google Play store. The modified version appears to have been modified for the sole purpose of installing the spyware; the code for Travel Mate is available on Github. Once modified, attackers change the name to Travel Mate Pro. Upon installation, the app attempts to gain access to photos, media, and files stored on the victim's device. The functionality is of the typical garden variety spyware. Exfiltration of device data, contact lists, email addresses, call, and text logs is the purpose of this instance. The code used is not based on any similar code or other spyware apps. The C2 address is hardcoded and is used to download files of varying types to the device. The spyware issues commands to obtain system info, search for doc types files, list running processes, log keystrokes, and more. New versions of GravityRAT are written in .NET and Python; the .NET versions target Sharify and MelodyMate, and the Python version targets GoZap. Multiplatform versions include StrongBox, TeraSpace, OrangeVault, and CvStyler. Android versions include SavitaBhabi (also a Windows version). An assumption can be made that the current version of GravityRAT uses similar infection methods to previous versions - targeting users by sending them links to the malicious apps.

In addition, the alert advises that in some cases, victims have been threatened that a DDoS attack will be launched on their public website should the ransom not be paid within the specified timeframe. The DDoS threat is on top of the typical threat of publication of the victim's sensitive data. The Flash also notes that Hello Kitty is known to have achieved their initial compromises through exploiting vulnerabilities in SonicWall products (CVE-2021-20016, CVE-2021-20021, CVE-2021-20022, CVE-2021-20023) or using compromised credentials.

A report from Check Point provides an analysis of a campaign being carried out by the threat actors known as MalSmoke that is distributing Zloader. The report notes that the countries most affected by the campaign are the United States followed by Canada though there are victims in at least twenty other countries, with a total of 2170 unique victim IP addresses as of January 2nd. How the MalSmoke actors gain initial access to a victim system is not provided in the report. The documented infection chain begins with the installation of Atera's legitimate remote management application which is used to deploy an agent which provides full access to the system. A series of .bat files are then uploaded to the victim system which carries out a number of operations that include modifying Windows Defender preferences and disabling Windows tools such as cmd.exe and Taskmgr.exe that can be used to detect and investigate malicious activity. Perhaps the most interesting feature of the attack is the use of mshta.exe to load appContast.dll, which has a valid Microsoft signature but has been modified. An explanation of how the modification of the file while retaining the valid signature is provided in the Check Point report. The Zloader payload is in the form of a DLL and is loaded using regsvr32.exe.
