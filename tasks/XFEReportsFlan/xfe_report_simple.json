Additionally, ITG14 is reportedly behind the DarkSide RaaS operation. In this change of focus, the group has shifted from highly targeted, to more indiscriminate targeting of victims. Since March 2020, the group has been using VBS loaders to download the GRIFFON JScript backdoor, the JSSLoader .NET backdoor, and PowerShell loaders called TAKEOUT, SCRAMBLELOADER, and CLEARLOADER.

The email claims that a linked ZIP file contains tax documents that need to be viewed by the recipient. Visiting the link downloads a ZIP archive containing an MSI file and GIF image. The researchers note that the domain the archive is downloaded from a domain that was registered on the same day of the campaign with a registrant country of Brazil.

The tools have been observed in use since February 2021. BoomBox is a downloader that downloads components from Dropbox. It also uploads reconnaissance information to Dropbox. EnvyScout is also a dropper typically delivered to the victim as an attachment to a spearphishing email. It has multiple components including an obfuscated ISO, and others the carry out functions such as credential-harvesting, tracking, and deobfuscating files and writing them to disk. Multiple variants of EnvyScout are detailed in the blog post. NativeZone is a loader that uses rundll32.exe to load components. VaporRage is described as a shellcode downloader that contacts a legitimate, but compromised, Wordpess site, and registers the system as compromised. If the system is of interest to the attackers, it downloads a shellcode blob from the same site, decodes, and executes it in memory. In addition, Microsoft notes that NOBELIUM use a number of custom Cobalt Strike Beacon loaders which Microsoft will track under the name NativeZone.

The malware is capable of stealing information such as passwords, emails, credit card information, and more. It can also be used as a downloader for other malware, including ransomware packages. Commands from the bot controller can cause Qbot, on the infected system, to connect and make financial transactions with the victim's credentials. Additionally, Qbot can use stolen emails to send replies to other potential victims, making such replies appear legitimate. In July, Check Point observed an Emotet campaign that dropped a newer copy of Qbot on victims' systems. August saw a new malspam campaign distributing Qbot. The majority of the victims in this campaign resided in the US and Europe, with government, military, and manufacturing industries being the most targeted. The infection vector is an email, possibly an email thread stolen from a previous victim, with a malicious attachment or URL. A Visual Basic Script (VBS) stored in a malicious archive is used to start the infection process. Using VBS as a standalone script is relatively new (since April 2020) for malware. Normally, VBS is used as the macro in a weaponized Word document for installation. The VBS file is padded with NULL bytes to make it larger than 35 megabytes, a figure most sandboxes ignore. Once activated, the script sleeps for a period of time, also in an attempt to bypass sandbox environments. Obfuscation is used, as well as a number of anti-virtual machine and anti-debugging techniques, to avoid detection. Persistence is gained through registry keys and a scheduled task.

The malicious module is capable of running on IIS servers that expose Exchange's Outlook Web Access (OWA). When loaded, it is capable of stealing credentials from the OWA login page as well as run commands issued by the attacker. It hooks an ISS event to inspect the content of HTTP requests, and when a successful OWA authentication attempt is observed, the credentials are encrypted and logged to a file on the system. This file can later be retrieved by the attacker. To issue commands, the attacker submits specific usernames to the OWA authentication page. Depending on what username is submitted, the malware will either exfiltrate the log file, delete the contents of the log file, or execute the contents of the password field via PowerShell, the results of which is sent back to the attacker. Victimology includes government organizations in Malaysia, Mongolia, Indonesia and the Philippines.

The malicious module is capable of running on IIS servers that expose Exchange's Outlook Web Access (OWA). When loaded, it is capable of stealing credentials from the OWA login page as well as run commands issued by the attacker. It hooks an ISS event to inspect the content of HTTP requests, and when a successful OWA authentication attempt is observed, the credentials are encrypted and logged to a file on the system. This file can later be retrieved by the attacker. To issue commands, the attacker submits specific usernames to the OWA authentication page. Depending on what username is submitted, the malware will either exfiltrate the log file, delete the contents of the log file, or execute the contents of the password field via PowerShell, the results of which is sent back to the attacker. Victimology includes government organizations in Malaysia, Mongolia, Indonesia and the Philippines. The researchers were unable to attribute the activity to a known threat actor but provide their analysis of potential related personas and payloads based on PDB paths observed.

Interestingly, the victim site was not an e-commerce platform; however, due to the skimmer looking for a \"my-account\" keyword which was present on the site, it successfully loaded. When the keyword condition is met, JavaScript code inserted into the themes header.php file is executed and loads malicious JavaScript from a remote server. The domain hosting this malicious code masquerades as a jquery resource to evade detection. The JavaScript is responsible for rendering a fake checkout form that exfiltrates entered credit card details to the remote server.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Details\n\n  *  **Malware Type:** Skimmer\n  *  **Associated Threat Actors:** Unknown\n  *  **Associated Payloads:** Malicious JavaScript code\n  *  **Targets:** E-commerce customers\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Compromised admin credentials\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Data theft\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nSucuri published a blog post analyzing a WooCommerce skimmer spoofing a checkout page for the purpose of credit card detail theft. Interestingly, the victim site was not an e-commerce platform; however, due to the skimmer looking for a \"my-account\" keyword which was present on the site, it successfully loaded. When the keyword condition is met, JavaScript code inserted into the themes header.php file is executed and loads malicious JavaScript from a remote server. The domain hosting this malicious code masquerades as a jquery resource to evade detection. The JavaScript is responsible for rendering a fake checkout form that exfiltrates entered credit card details to the remote server. The incident investigation determined the likely infection vector was brute-forcing of a WordPress admin account. Additionally, a malicious user was found logged into the WordPress database at the time of investigation. For more information, see the Sucuri blog post in the Reference section.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * A complete list of IoCs can be found here: [ IoCs.txt](/download/attachments/70222180/WooCommerce%20Skimmer%20Spoofs%20Checkout%20Page%20IoCs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1636473577897&api=v2)\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Use anti-virus software and ensure software and associated files are up to date (M1049).\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs (M1031, M1035, M1037).\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level (M1051).\n  * Use multi-factor authentication wherever possible.

The botnet uses implicit trust, application exploits, and weak passwords to gain a foothold into databases, cloud-based applications, and IT admin tools. The botnet is using XMRig to mine for Monero currency and appears to be operating out of Russia or Eastern Europe. The botnet uses an ELF binary to set up the environment, infecting systems, downloading new modules, and deploying XMRig. The ELF binary is packed using UPX and a modified header and footer. This obfuscation reduces file sizes and hides the malware code. Most of the C2 components are hosted through TOR or anonymous file sharing services that use HTTP as its transport protocol. The main component spreads through SSH and is downloaded over HTTP when the exploit is successful. The module contains seven shell scripts with each performing a different action. Persistence is achieved via x() functionality in the creation of a cron job. This script will download the latest version of the malware.

    "output": "Sure! Here is the information I have about the threat: Magnitude Exploit Kit Distributing Magniber Ransomware\nAvast has published a report on current activity involving the Magnitude exploit kit that targets Internet Explorer users in South Korea and results in the deployment of the Magniber ransomware.\n\n# Threat Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Ransomware\n  *  **Targets:** Internet Explorer Users\n  *  **Ransomware Family:** Magniber\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** CVE-2021-26411 **,** Initial Access (TA0001, T1189), Execution(TA0002, T1059.007, T1203, T1204, T1204.001)\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Privilege Escalation (TA0004, T1068, T1055), Defense Evasion (T1140, T1574, T1027, T1027.002, T1055), Impact (TA0040, T1486)\n  *  **Additional TTPs:** Resource Development (TA0042, T1583.001, T1583, T1587, T1587.001, T1588, T1588.005, T1608, T1608.005)\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nDue to past laws in South Korea which mandated the use of ActiveX controls for government and e-commerce sites, there remains a significant number of Internet Explorer users. The Magnitude exploit kit used to target Internet Explorer has been around for many years. To take advantage of the significant number of Internet Explorer users in South Korea, its operators are buying popunder ads on adult sites and pay only for those displayed to South Korean visitors to the sites. If a visitor to the site clicks on one of the ads, they are first redirected to a page that provides a legitimate-looking ad. The next redirection takes the victim to a second domain that is hosting an obfuscated JavaScript exploit for CVE-2021-26411. The second domain is short-lived, being rotated every thirty minutes, and domains are not reused. The JavaScript exploit used is one that is publicly available but includes custom shellcode, three versions of shellcode are used depending on the version of Windows the victim is using. If the exploit is successful, another vulnerability, CVE-2020-0986, is exploited to elevate privileges, and if successful, the Magniber ransomware is then injected into another process. Unlike the high profile big game hunting ransomware, Magniber does not employ the double extortion model of exfiltrating data to publish if the ransom is not paid. A ransom note is left in each directory in which files were encrypted. The ransom note contains a .onion URL that includes a subdomain that is generated dynamically, for each victim. Further information is available from the report linked in the Reference section below.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * A complete list of IoCs can be found here: [ IoCs.txt](/download/attachments/59540312/Magnitude%20Exploit%20Kit%20Distributing%20Magniber%20Ransomware%20IoCs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1628222547230&api=v2)\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Use anti-virus software and ensure software and associated files are up to date ([M1049](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1049/)).\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs ([M1031](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1031/), [M1035](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1035/), [M1037](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1037/)).\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level ([M1051](https://attack.mitre.org/mitigations/M1051/)).\n\n\n\n# References\n\n  * <https://decoded.avast.io/janvojtesek/magnitude-exploit-kit-still-alive-and-kicking/>",

I need overview, related mitre attack informations if exists, IoCs, recommandations and possible references.",
    "context": "",
    "output": "You are asking about a specific threat report. Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Phishing Email\n  *  **Target:** Renewable Energy, Industrial Control Systems Companies and Industries\n  *  **Lure:** Password expired email\n  *  **Payload:** Malicious link\n  *  **Compromised Data:** Usernames and Passwords\n  *  **Additional TTPs:** See the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below.\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nAccording to a blog post from Bushidotoken, a campaign is underway that targets renewable energy and industrial tech organizations focusing mainly on Bulgaria. Organizations offering operational technology and industrial control systems from vendors such as Schneider Electric and Honeywell have been noted in the blog. Other companies and universities are also named as targets in the blog. The use of a custom \u2018Mail Box\u2019 phishing kit is used to collect the passwords of victims who visit the site. The kits are generic in nature and lead to a second stage of the kit. This stage consists of a \"Your Mail Box storage is full\" phishing email. This activity is purportedly connected to two APT groups: APT28 (FancyBear) and Konni. Several discovered hostnames and infrastructure similarities led researchers to the conclusion these activities could be related to the above-noted threat groups.

Organizations offering operational technology and industrial control systems from vendors such as Schneider Electric and Honeywell have been noted in the blog. Other companies and universities are also named as targets in the blog. The use of a custom \u2018Mail Box\u2019 phishing kit is used to collect the passwords of victims who visit the site. The kits are generic in nature and lead to a second stage of the kit. This stage consists of a \"Your Mail Box storage is full\" phishing email. This activity is purportedly connected to two APT groups: APT28 (FancyBear) and Konni. Several discovered hostnames and infrastructure similarities led researchers to the conclusion these activities could be related to the above-noted threat groups. For example, APT28 Konni both used Zetta Hosting for the phishing domains as well for C2 domains. At present, there is no hard evidence pointing to a definitive crossover of campaigns with previously noted campaigns.

There is a significant increase in Mirai variants that target Linux systems that enterprise environments use as servers and networking endpoints. Crowdstrike research indicates that threat actors are targeting the Linux x86 monoculture because it is easier to target these devices as the Mirai code does not have to be continually updated.

There is a significant increase in Mirai variants that target Linux systems that enterprise environments use as servers and networking endpoints. Crowdstrike research indicates that threat actors are targeting the Linux x86 monoculture because it is easier to target these devices as the Mirai code does not have to be continually updated. Additionally, the targeting and compromise of Linux servers provide more computing \u201cpower\u201d for the botnet. The researchers at Crowdstrike go on to point out that the Mirai variants still utilize brute force attacks to gain initial access, but also exploit new vulnerabilities like the recent vulnerability in Log4j.

The most common distribution method is through Trojanized software packages ranging from games and game cheats to security-related software, downloaded in torrent files. In at least one case, an unofficial, Trojanized ISO image of Windows 11 was used. In some cases, CoinHelper has been deployed using the MyKings clipboard stealer by replacing a URL on the victim's clipboard with a malicious one. CoinHelper itself consists of multiple compiled AutoIt binaries that carry out a number of functions including gathering information about the victim system that is used for profiling and installing a Tor binary that is used to download payloads from .onion URLs. The main cryptominer deployed is XMRig with the most frequently mined currency being Monero. CoinHelper will also do some checks for competing cryptominers and if found, terminate them.

Here is the information I have about the threat: Digital-Only Banks Targeted In New Phishing Campaign\nDigital-only banks are becoming more prevalent, and with this, they are becoming targets for scams and fraud. This blog post on Bushido Token Threat Intel explores one campaign targeting a bank in the UK.\n\n# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Phishing\n  *  **Target:** Monzo Customers\n  *  **Lure:** Monzo Login Page\n  *  **Compromised Data:** Banking Credentials\n  *  **Post-compromise Actions:** Unknown\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nThreat actors are targeting digital only banks as they are becoming more and more common. Bushido Token Threat Intel has published a blog post exploring one campaign targeting the online bank Monzo. The attack targets the mechanism by which a customer verifies their device for use with the bank - using a \"golden link\" which allows for the first login. The attack follows common phishing patterns, with the page copying Monzo's pages to get the users to enter their credentials and PIN. Along with the victim's name and phone number, the attacker will be able to access the compromised account.

Bushido Token Threat Intel has published a blog post exploring one campaign targeting the online bank Monzo. The attack targets the mechanism by which a customer verifies their device for use with the bank - using a \"golden link\" which allows for the first login. The attack follows common phishing patterns, with the page copying Monzo's pages to get the users to enter their credentials and PIN. Along with the victim's name and phone number, the attacker will be able to access the compromised account.

    "output": "You are asking about a specific threat report. Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, RAT\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nCyCraft has expanded on their previous research into attacks against the Taiwanese government by delving into the Owlproxy malware and use of skeleton keys. The Owlproxy malware, its name based on a PDB file project name, acts as a tunnel to bridge the internet and intranet so that the threat actor could have backdoor functionality. It allows the attacker to send backdoor commands over HTTP (port 80). The second part of the blog posts discusses an interesting TTP - the use of skeleton keys to gain network-wide authentication. This technique starts with an executable that, in turn, drops three files. The first file is an DLL that installs itself and deletes the original executable.

The Owlproxy malware, its name based on a PDB file project name, acts as a tunnel to bridge the internet and intranet so that the threat actor could have backdoor functionality. It allows the attacker to send backdoor commands over HTTP (port 80). The second part of the blog posts discusses an interesting TTP - the use of skeleton keys to gain network-wide authentication. This technique starts with an executable that, in turn, drops three files. The first file is an DLL that installs itself and deletes the original executable. A custom version of Mimikatz is then executed and injects the Skeleton Key into lsass, leveraging a kernel driver install to unprotect lsass if necessary. With this technique, Active Directory authentication can be bypassed.

Microsoft's OneDrive is leveraged as the lure for recipients to retrieve a file from the service. This file is a dummy tax return PDF, which is enticing to a victim due to its sensitive nature.

TypeForm allows users to create a multitude of products such as forms, quizzes, surveys, and other products. TypeForm being a free service makes it attractive to threat actors to use as a phishing service. In order to make the form, the threat actor used a login screen with a W-2 tax form as the background image. The threat actor added a question to the form prior to opening that stated \"Adobe Secure Document\" and a description of \"Sign in with your email address.\" Similarly, the tactic is used again when requesting the user's password. The user is requested to enter the password twice, a common requirement when opening secure documents in order to confirm the correct password. Once the password is collected, the user is presented with a \"View Document\" button. Should the user click this button, the responses to the questions previously asked are sent back to the threat actor for harvesting. Upon successful exfiltration, the user is informed their identity could not be verified, and they are redirected to the first step of entering their email. This repetition allows the actor to confirm the email and password.

The vulnerability was originally identified by GitLab as an authenticated vulnerability caused by passing user-supplied photos to the service's embedded version of ExifTool. ExifTool's mishandling of the files could allow a remote attacker to run arbitrary commands as the git user. Since being published, the vulnerability has been upgraded to critical, as it has become clear that authentication is not required to exploit it. There have since been multiple exploits for CVE-2021-22205 published, and it is being actively exploited in the wild. Patches for the GitLab vulnerability have been available for over six months. However, an examination of GitLab instances that are accessible via the internet indicates that a significant proportion are still susceptible. GitLab users should update to the most recent version as soon as possible. Furthermore, GitLab should ideally not be an internet-facing service.

Since being published, the vulnerability has been upgraded to critical, as it has become clear that authentication is not required to exploit it. There have since been multiple exploits for CVE-2021-22205 published, and it is being actively exploited in the wild. Patches for the GitLab vulnerability have been available for over six months. However, an examination of GitLab instances that are accessible via the internet indicates that a significant proportion are still susceptible. GitLab users should update to the most recent version as soon as possible. Furthermore, GitLab should ideally not be an internet-facing service. Consider putting your GitLab behind a VPN if you need to access it from the internet.

    "output": "You are asking about a specific threat report. Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Phishing, Backdoor\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nTrend Micro has published a blog post analyzing recent SideWinder activities targeting Nepalese and Afghan government and military organizations. The first set of activity reported on is related to Windows backdoors being spread through various malicious document types. These include RTF files that exploit the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability, LNK files, PDFs, Word Documents, and Zip archives. Regardless of the series of file types leveraged, all the infection chains lead to the execution of JavaScript code that drops a backdoor/stealer to the ProgramData folder, which will either be directly executed or run by a scheduled task. The backdoor uses DLL sideloading for execution of the malicious code. Once running on the system, it can perform its main function of downloading and executing a .NET executable, stealing system information and reporting it to the C2 server, and exfiltrating files. The second attack observed was a spear-phishing campaign. This campaign was discovered when the researchers identified subdomains on the servers hosting the aforementioned malicious documents that were mimicking mail servers associated with target organizations. Hosted on these domains were phishing pages that were based off of the legitimate version of the target organization's webmail login pages. After entering credentials, victims were redirected to either the legitimate webmail login page or to a document or website hosting news content regarding Covid-19 or South Asian territorial disputes. Also found on these servers were Android APK files. While some are benign applications that appear to be for testing, the themes indicate targeting of users in South Asia. Furthermore, applications developed using JavaPayload for Metasploit were observed. The applications load extra code from a remote server, however the researchers were unable to obtain this code at the time of investigation. Due to the lack of other components in this application, they believe the group is still developing these applications before use.

The group has been particularly active in 2020, and Trend Micro reports on several tactics they have observed in use by the group this year.",
      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Phishing, Backdoor\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nTrend Micro has published a blog post analyzing recent SideWinder activities targeting Nepalese and Afghan government and military organizations. The first set of activity reported on is related to Windows backdoors being spread through various malicious document types. These include RTF files that exploit the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability, LNK files, PDFs, Word Documents, and Zip archives. Regardless of the series of file types leveraged, all the infection chains lead to the execution of JavaScript code that drops a backdoor/stealer to the ProgramData folder, which will either be directly executed or run by a scheduled task. The backdoor uses DLL sideloading for execution of the malicious code. Once running on the system, it can perform its main function of downloading and executing a .NET executable, stealing system information and reporting it to the C2 server, and exfiltrating files. The second attack observed was a spear-phishing campaign. This campaign was discovered when the researchers identified subdomains on the servers hosting the aforementioned malicious documents that were mimicking mail servers associated with target organizations. Hosted on these domains were phishing pages that were based off of the legitimate version of the target organization's webmail login pages.

Once installed, Joker connects to its C2 server in order to retrieve the configuration and additional components. The main purpose of this variant of Joker is to subscribe users to premium mobile services. It does this via a hidden browser window and intercepts SMS messages in order to obtain required subscription confirmation codes. Furthermore, Joker exfiltrates copies of all incoming SMS messages.

While it is not absolutely certain, it is believed that the initial compromise was gained through a malicious document attached to a spearphishing email. A short time after the initial compromise, the actor was observed using standard Microsoft utilities for discovery and a Cobalt Strike beacon was installed shortly thereafter. While attempting to enumerate the network, the actor mistyped a lot of commands. In addition, they were seen to be following the instructions, in order, from some documents that are provided to Conti affiliates. In some cases, even using the same passwords from the documents for accounts they created. Adfind, native Windows utilities, and the Cobalt Strike beacon were used for further discovery. Credentials used for privilege escalation were obtained by dumping LSASS. When satisfied with their discovery phase the actor, using a reverse proxy, connected to the compromised host using RDP. Next, they moved laterally to the domain controller using RDP, downloaded and executed AdFind, executed two separate Cobalt Strike beacons, created two local administrator accounts, and installed a copy of the AnyDesk remote access software. They continued enumerating the network using PowerSploit and began searching for documents of interest on hosts connected to the domain. Another tool, the Advanced IP Scanner was used to scan for other subnets on the LAN. Later, they again enumerated the domain controller, this time using Seatbelt and then pivoted to another domain controller and carried out the same steps as they had done on the previous domain controller. After a period of inactivity, the actor returned to the system and used Rclone to exfiltrate the data they had collected to the public file-sharing service, Mega. Their access to the system was terminated not long after this. Amongst the data the actor collected, was an active directory backup they created, made in \u201cIFM\u201d media mode. All these steps and the apparent use of Conti affiliate instructions suggest the intended outcome of the attack was the deployment of the Conti ransomware, prevented in the case when the actor was evicted from the systems prior to Conti deployment.

The stealer is able to steal from many different browsers, as well as VPN, FTP, Messaging and Gaming apps. In addition to this, it can perform financial theft using keylogger functionality. The developer of the malware claims it is undetectable by security software. The malware is encoded using a rot13 cipher and executes in memory rather than dropping a payload. Upon execution, the malware first searches for files and steals them before stealing data from browsers. It can steal from almost all Chromium-based browsers, as well as MS Edge and Firefox-based browsers. It then moves onto other applications such as Telegram and Steam. All of this data is collated, along with system information and screenshots and is compressed into a folder. The stealer uses Telegram to retrieve the remote server IP and sends the compressed folder. The malware also contained unused functionality, such as a keylogger. This could be controlled using a builder which was provided by the TA, and allows customization of the malware.

Here is the information I have about the threat: Ukrainian Organizations Targeted by Destructive Malware\nA report from Microsoft outlines an attack that is targeting Ukrainian organizations with destructive malware that overwrites the MBR of an infected system.\n\n# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Malware, overwrites MBR and files.\n  *  **Targets:** Government, information technology, and non-profit organizations located in Ukraine.\n  *  **Malware Family/Families:** WhisperGate.\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Unspecified.\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Overwriting the system MBR and files.\n  *  **Additional TTPs:** See the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below.\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nUkrainian organizations are being targeted with destructive malware that overwrites the MBR of an infected system according to a report from Microsoft. No notable associations between these attacks which began on January 13th and attacks by known threat groups have been located by Microsoft and they are tracking the actor behind this activity as DEV-0586. Microsoft has named the malware WhisperGate. There is no information in the Microsoft report as to the vector used to deploy the malware onto systems. The malware itself pretends to be ransomware and is executed in two stages, the first of which is executed when the system is powered down and overwrites the system's MBR with a fake ransom note. In all cases, the ransom notes ask for $10,000 and contain the same Bitcoin wallet address and Tox chat ID.

No notable associations between these attacks which began on January 13th and attacks by known threat groups have been located by Microsoft and they are tracking the actor behind this activity as DEV-0586. Microsoft has named the malware WhisperGate. There is no information in the Microsoft report as to the vector used to deploy the malware onto systems. The malware itself pretends to be ransomware and is executed in two stages, the first of which is executed when the system is powered down and overwrites the system's MBR with a fake ransom note. In all cases, the ransom notes ask for $10,000 and contain the same Bitcoin wallet address and Tox chat ID. WhisperGate's second stage is a downloader that is used to download a file corrupter which searches the system for files that match a hard-coded list of specific extensions and when found overwrites the file's content with a fixed number of 0xCC bytes and changes the file's extension to what appears to be a random four-byte extension.

    "output": "Sure! Here is the information I have about the threat: The NetDooka Malware Framework\nA report from Trend Micro documents a new malware framework they discovered and named NetDooka. This malware is being distributed through a pay-per-install service using a modular downloader named PrivateLoader.\n\n# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Malware\n  *  **Targets:** Downloaders of pirated software.\n  *  **Malware Family/Families:** NetDooka Malware Framework, PrivateLoader\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Pirated software that contains PrivateLoader.\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Typical RAT functions.\n  *  **Additional TTPs:** See the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below.\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nThe NetDooka malware framework, discovered and named by Trend Micro, contains multiple elements including a dropper, a loader, a protection driver, and a remote access Trojan (RAT). Distribution of NetDooka is being carried out by a pay-per-install service using a modular downloader named PrivateLoader that is typically delivered to victims in pirated software. PrivateLoader executes the first of the NetDooka malware, a dropper that is used to download the next stage, NetDooka's loader. The loader carries out a number of tasks including checking that it isn't running in a virtual environment, creating a new virtual desktop that it uses to uninstall a number of anti-virus products, and may also install a kernel driver.

The group doesn't follow typical protocol with regard to other ransomware actors. Mount Locker first steals a victim's files, then they encrypt those files, and finally leave a ransom note demanding millions of dollars to decrypt those files. This is key because the group threatens to release the unencrypted version of the files to the victim's competitors, the media, and others should the ransom not be paid. In fact, one company received such demands but refused to pay. Subsequently, the files were released to a ransomware data leak site. At present, the site lists four victim companies with only one's files being leaked. A sample of the malware was analyzed, and it was found the ransomware uses ChaCha 20 to perform encryption as well as an RSA-2048 public key to encrypt the encryption key. As with other ransomware, the Mount Locker ransomware appends a custom extension to the files. The ransomware registers the extension in the Registry so if a file is clicked, the ransom note is loaded automatically. The ransom note contains instructions on how to access a Tor site in order to communicate with the threat actors. This site is merely a chat service to negotiate ransom or inquire as to how to pay.

The malware masquerades as an Android booking application for a Malaysian cleaning company. Once on the device various intrusive permissions are requested, with the RECEIVE_SMS permissions being heavily abused in particular. The payload abuses this permission to listen for incoming messages and upload any that are received to a C2 server. Additionally, the fake application is designed to steal victim data. It uses the cleaner booking application theme to request payment details, specifically via online banking. Navigating to the payment screen provides victims with a list of Malaysian banks to choose from. Selecting a bank then leads to a fake version of its login page. Any entered credentials are subsequently exfiltrated to the attacker.

The malware masquerades as an Android booking application for a Malaysian cleaning company. Once on the device various intrusive permissions are requested, with the RECEIVE_SMS permissions being heavily abused in particular. The payload abuses this permission to listen for incoming messages and upload any that are received to a C2 server. Additionally, the fake application is designed to steal victim data. It uses the cleaner booking application theme to request payment details, specifically via online banking. Navigating to the payment screen provides victims with a list of Malaysian banks to choose from. Selecting a bank then leads to a fake version of its login page. Any entered credentials are subsequently exfiltrated to the attacker. For more information, see the Cyble blog post in the References section.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * A complete list of IoCs can be found here: [ IoCs.txt](/download/attachments/74055785/Android%20Trojan%20Targets%20Banking%20Users%20In%20Malaysia%20IoCs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1638820789074&api=v2)\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Install security updates (M1001).\n  * Users should be encouraged to only install apps from authorized app stores, which are less likely to contain malicious repackaged apps (M1011).\n  * Implement an enterprise mobility management (EMM), also known as mobile device management (MDM) (M1012).\n  * Train users to identify social engineering techniques (M1017).\n  * Use anti-virus software and ensure software and associated files are up to date (M1049).\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n\n\n\n# References\n\n  * <https://blog.cyble.com/2021/12/01/banking-trojan-targets-banking-users-in-malaysia/>\n\n\n\n# MITRE ATT&CK Framework\n\n **Initial Access - TA0027**  \nT1444 - Masquerade as Legitimate Application  \nT1476 - Deliver Malicious App via Other Means  \n  \n **Execution - TA0041**  \nT1575 - Native Code  \n  \n **Persistence - TA0028**  \nT1402 - Broadcast Receivers  \n  \n **Credential Access - TA0031**  \nT1411 - Input Prompt  \n  \n **Collection - TA0035**  \nT1412 - Capture SMS Messages  \n  \n **Exfiltration - TA0036**  \nT1437 - Standard Application Layer Protocol  \n  \n **Impact - TA0034**  \nT1400 - Modify System Partition"

Several other ties to TeamTNT were discovered, such as shared hosting infrastructure and lookalike domains. One of the scripts used by WatchDog was also discovered within a known TeamTNT malware repository. While some TTPs were mimicked, newer TeamTNT TTPs were not observed in use in the WatchDog scripts, such as container targeting, credential exfiltration, and network scanning using zgrab. Another notable change is WatchDog is no longer using their GoLang binaries in these scripts.

IBM X-Force tracks NOBELIUM as Hive0099. A report from Microsoft provides an analysis of a new backdoor which Microsoft has named FoggyWeb that has been used by NOBELIUM since at least April 2021. It is a passive backdoor that is specifically targeted to Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) servers. FoggyWeb is installed deployed on compromised AD FS servers by dropping two files onto the system. One file, a DLL is a loader that is executed by Microsoft.IdentityServer.ServiceHost.exe through search order hijacking. In turn, the loader is responsible for decrypting and loading the second of the two files which is the FoggyWeb backdoor. Once active, FoggyWeb configures HTTP listeners that listen for specific URIs defined by the actor. These specific URIs are what provide instructions to the backdoor. FoggyWeb is used to collect and exfiltrate data from the infected server and can install additional payloads. \n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * A complete list of IoCs can be found here: [ IoCs.txt](/download/attachments/64129463/New%20NOBELIUM%20Backdoor%20-%20FoggyWeb%20IoCs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1633403936443&api=v2)\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Use anti-virus software and ensure software and associated files are up to date (M1049).\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs (M1031, M1035, M1037).\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level (M1051).\n  * Restrict Web-Based Content (M1021).\n\n\n\n# References\n\n  * <https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/27/foggyweb-targeted-nobelium-malware-leads-to-persistent-backdoor/>\n\n\n\n# MITRE ATT&CK Framework\n\n **Persistence - TA0003**  \nT1574 - Hijack Execution Flow  \nT1574.001 - DLL Search Order Hijacking  \n  \n **Defense Evasion - TA0005**  \nT1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information  \nT1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information  \nT1574 - Hijack Execution Flow  \nT1574.001 - DLL Search Order Hijacking  \n  \n **Collection - TA0009**  \nT1005 - Data from Local System  \nT1074 - Data Staged  \nT1074.001 - Local Data Staging  \nT1560 - Archive Collected Data  \n  \n **Exfiltration - TA0010**  \nT1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n  \n **Command and Control - TA0011**  \nT1001 - Data Obfuscation  \nT1071 - Application Layer Protocol  \nT1071.001 - Web Protocols",

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Details\n\n  *  **Malware Type:** Backdoor\n  *  **Associated Threat Actors:** NOBELIUM, ITG11\n  *  **Associated Payloads:** FoggyWeb\n  *  **Targets:** Compromised Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) servers.\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** FoggyWeb is a post-exploitation tool.\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Deploy FoggyWeb, Collect and Exfiltrate data.\n  *  **Additional TTPs:** See MITRE ATT&CK Framework below.\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nNOBELIUM is a threat actor known by many names including APT29, Cozy Bear, CozyDuke, Cozys, Dark Halo, Duke Group, Hammertoss, Minis, Office Monkeys, Pitty Tiger, Spikerrush, StellarParticle, TEMP.Monkey, TEMP.Noble, The Dukes, TG-4127, UNC2452, and Yttrium. IBM X-Force tracks NOBELIUM as Hive0099. A report from Microsoft provides an analysis of a new backdoor which Microsoft has named FoggyWeb that has been used by NOBELIUM since at least April 2021. It is a passive backdoor that is specifically targeted to Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) servers. FoggyWeb is installed deployed on compromised AD FS servers by dropping two files onto the system. One file, a DLL is a loader that is executed by Microsoft.IdentityServer.ServiceHost.exe through search order hijacking. In turn, the loader is responsible for decrypting and loading the second of the two files which is the FoggyWeb backdoor. Once active, FoggyWeb configures HTTP listeners that listen for specific URIs defined by the actor. These specific URIs are what provide instructions to the backdoor. FoggyWeb is used to collect and exfiltrate data from the infected server and can install additional payloads. \n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * A complete list of IoCs can be found here: [ IoCs.txt](/download/attachments/64129463/New%20NOBELIUM%20Backdoor%20-%20FoggyWeb%20IoCs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1633403936443&api=v2)\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Use anti-virus software and ensure software and associated files are up to date (M1049).\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs (M1031, M1035, M1037).\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level (M1051).\n  * Restrict Web-Based Content (M1021).\n\n\n\n# References\n\n  * <https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/27/foggyweb-targeted-nobelium-malware-leads-to-persistent-backdoor/>\n\n\n\n# MITRE ATT&CK Framework\n\n **Persistence - TA0003**  \nT1574 - Hijack Execution Flow  \nT1574.001 - DLL Search Order Hijacking  \n  \n **Defense Evasion - TA0005**  \nT1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information  \nT1140 - Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information  \nT1574 - Hijack Execution Flow  \nT1574.001 - DLL Search Order Hijacking  \n  \n **Collection - TA0009**  \nT1005 - Data from Local System  \nT1074 - Data Staged  \nT1074.001 - Local Data Staging  \nT1560 - Archive Collected Data  \n  \n **Exfiltration - TA0010**  \nT1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n  \n **Command and Control - TA0011**  \nT1001 - Data Obfuscation  \nT1071 - Application Layer Protocol  \nT1071.001 - Web Protocols"

Here is the information I have about the threat: Emotet Chronicles\nKaspersky has published a report chronicling what is known about Emotet malware.\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Trojan\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, Emotet was first discovered in June 2014 by Trend Micro. Emotet is a malware package designed to steal banking credentials. Initial targets were German and Austrian bank users. At that time, the infection vector was bank-related spam with either weaponized attachments or links to ZIP files with the loader install. November of that year saw additional modules added that could modify HTTP(s) traffic, collect Outlook email addresses, and steal credentials in Mail PassView, among others. December saw unresponsive command and control servers as attacks dropped off. The following January saw a public RSA key and encrypted embedded strings. Swiss bank clients were also added to the victim list. June 2015 saw the beginning of another shutdown of the command and control servers. December of 2016 saw a new outlook for Emotet with the ability to infect victims using the RIG-E and RIG-V exploit kits. In February 2017, it was discovered that Emotet had included a spam module in its tool set. Banking clients in Poland were added in April's spam emails. May saw a change in the spam attachment used in the attack. This was the first time a weaponized Microsoft Word document (or a link to one) required the victim to enable macros. It was also the first time that Emotet began installing the banking Trojan Qbot (or QakBot), although the number of installs were not numerous. June saw Emotet begin to use a network spreading technique to infect other systems on the local network. In July, Emotet changed from using GET requests to using POST requests. The list of brute-force passwords used significantly increased in August. IBM X-Force announced in November that Emotet was now spreading IcedID. In January of 2018, Emotet began installing the banking Trojan Panda (also known as Zeus Panda). In April, Emotet added a module to spread laterally over wireless networks. In June, Emotet began a relationship with Trickbot (also known as Trickster). The ability to access computers behind NAT and convert them into command and control proxies was added in July.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Trojan\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, Emotet was first discovered in June 2014 by Trend Micro. Emotet is a malware package designed to steal banking credentials. Initial targets were German and Austrian bank users. At that time, the infection vector was bank-related spam with either weaponized attachments or links to ZIP files with the loader install. November of that year saw additional modules added that could modify HTTP(s) traffic, collect Outlook email addresses, and steal credentials in Mail PassView, among others. December saw unresponsive command and control servers as attacks dropped off. The following January saw a public RSA key and encrypted embedded strings. Swiss bank clients were also added to the victim list. June 2015 saw the beginning of another shutdown of the command and control servers. December of 2016 saw a new outlook for Emotet with the ability to infect victims using the RIG-E and RIG-V exploit kits. In February 2017, it was discovered that Emotet had included a spam module in its tool set. Banking clients in Poland were added in April's spam emails. May saw a change in the spam attachment used in the attack. This was the first time a weaponized Microsoft Word document (or a link to one) required the victim to enable macros. It was also the first time that Emotet began installing the banking Trojan Qbot (or QakBot), although the number of installs were not numerous. June saw Emotet begin to use a network spreading technique to infect other systems on the local network. In July, Emotet changed from using GET requests to using POST requests. The list of brute-force passwords used significantly increased in August. IBM X-Force announced in November that Emotet was now spreading IcedID. In January of 2018, Emotet began installing the banking Trojan Panda (also known as Zeus Panda). In April, Emotet added a module to spread laterally over wireless networks. In June, Emotet began a relationship with Trickbot (also known as Trickster). The ability to access computers behind NAT and convert them into command and control proxies was added in July. Installing Ryuk by Emotet began in August. October saw a brief suspension of command and control servers as well as an update to the Outlook exfiltration module. Another suspension of command and control servers began in November with a resumption beginning in January of 2019. March saw modifications to the HTTP protocol used in command and control communication. In April, data exfiltration (topics, mailing lists, message contents) began showing up in Emotet spam emails.

Google Security has taken necessary steps to remove any identified malicious apps from its store. With its latest update, Zscaler has identified 17 different samples uploaded in September 2020.

The subject of the report centers around how Joker-infected apps are able to circumvent the vetting processes in place for the Play Store. In some instances, the payload is delivered by direct URL from the C2 server. The string containing the URL is obfuscated and hidden, thus giving the actors a leg up in the vetting process. Upon installation, the app contacts the C2 server and receives the URL for final payload. The JSON file has class name information needed to be executed from the payload for malicious activity execution. Other apps use a stager payload that is encoded into the app's code using AES encryption. The stager payload is delivered rather than the final payload and then downloads the final payload from a URL within the stager and executes it. In a few cases, the final payload URL is seen in plaintext. The last method involves a two-stage download. These apps used an infected app to contact a C2 for a stage one payload URL hidden within the response to the request. This URL then downloads stage two, which loads the end result of the Joker malware. In each of these differing types of download, the final result is the Joker infection of the target device.

A posting to the Deutsche Telekom blog provides an analysis of a Flubot smishing campaign. Flubot is spread using SMS messages sent to contacts obtained from infected devices. A victim receives an SMS message from someone they know and provides a link. In the recent cases observed by Deutsche Telekom, the SMS messages claimed to be a missed call notification or a notification from DHL. In the past, Flubot campaigns are known to have used other brands such as FedEx and Correos in their SMS messages. Through compromised sites (frequently WordPress blogs) that host redirects, the link in the message leads to a site themed to the service or brand being used in the lure which tells the need victim they need to download and install an app to access the missed call or notification, etc. The theme and lure changed every month or so. The names of the APK files are also changed at certain intervals and hashes of the APK's change frequently. The links are generated per victim and a number of techniques are used to bypass a carrier's SMS content filters. One interesting technique used by Flubot to spread to other countries is having infected devices in one country and sending SMS messages to a neighboring country, in the neighboring countries language. In some cases, the payload distributed in the campaigns is Teabot.

This variant is built to specifically target Lilin security camera DVR devices and has been named \"Lillin Scanner\". This sample was not detected as malware by any detection engines as the portion of the malicious code is quite small and focuses on a single task. Current reporting indicates that the original code containing over 30 exploits had been removed. The scanner receives IP addresses to scan and attempts to use hardcoded user-password pairs to try and authenticate with the target in order to exploit for remote code execution. The vulnerability used was discovered in 2020 and has since been patched by the vendor.

This variant is built to specifically target Lilin security camera DVR devices and has been named \"Lillin Scanner\". This sample was not detected as malware by any detection engines as the portion of the malicious code is quite small and focuses on a single task. Current reporting indicates that the original code containing over 30 exploits had been removed. The scanner receives IP addresses to scan and attempts to use hardcoded user-password pairs to try and authenticate with the target in order to exploit for remote code execution. The vulnerability used was discovered in 2020 and has since been patched by the vendor. The attack downloads a malicious file and executes it to download several executables for multiple architectures.

According to ESET the major change in the bootkit was the move to targeting UEFI systems with little other change in ESPecter's components. The sample analyzed by ESET was found on a compromised system. Also found was a user-mode client component that has the ability to log keystrokes and steal documents. ESET believes that ESPecter is primarily used for espionage. The method used to distribute ESPecter remains unknown. To achieve the infection of a system, a legitimate Windows Boot Manager binary is modified to allow the attacker to execute ESPecter early in the boot process and provides the ability to bypass Windows Driver Signature Enforcement allowing ESPecter to load its unsigned driver. However, Secure Boot must be disabled for this to work on Windows 8 and later. Secure Boot is not supported on versions of Windows prior to Windows 8. ESET has been unable to determine how the attackers were able to disable Secure Boot but note that they could have achieved it through having physical access to the system, Secure Boot may have already been disabled, or by exploiting a vulnerability in the UEFI firmware. The driver is used to load two user-mode payloads, WinSys.dll and Client.dll, which are used to log keystrokes, take screenshots, collect and exfiltrate documents, handle C&C communications, and can download further payloads. ESET was not able to attribute ESPecter to a known threat actor but given that there are debug messages in Chinese in the user-mode client component, it is possibly the work of an unknown Chinese-speaking actor.

A sample of this malware was previously reported on by the FBI and tied to the Iranian threat group APT39. While the YARA rule provided in the FBI's report did not lead to the identification of further samples, ReversingLabs was able to find additional Rana malware based on the signing certificate associated with the initial sample. Specifically, they uncovered three previously unidentified samples. One of these did not include the obfuscation seen in the majority of the samples, making analysis of the malware family simple. ReversingLabs highlighted a few commands specific to surveillance purposes that had not previously been mentioned. First is the ability to take camera photos at login success or failure, giving the attackers the ability to identify who is attempting to access a device. Second is advanced recording capabilities allowing for detailed configurations regarding when and for how long the device should record. Finally, the malware schedules a device boot to ensure the malware will re-activate even if the user turns off the device. Most commands included with the malware are common to Android backdoors, but a couple relatively unique commands were identified. These include the ability to add and connect to a custom WiFi point, and a capability allowing calls from specific phone numbers to be answered, which provides a backup method for audio tapping. The newest function that has been added is the use of accessibility services to steal contents of messages from instant messaging apps, some of which are specific to Iran. All of these commands are issued with intercepted SMS messages. ReversingLabs also investigated the C2 infrastructure in an attempt to identify related domains tied to the threat actor.

ReversingLabs highlighted a few commands specific to surveillance purposes that had not previously been mentioned. First is the ability to take camera photos at login success or failure, giving the attackers the ability to identify who is attempting to access a device. Second is advanced recording capabilities allowing for detailed configurations regarding when and for how long the device should record. Finally, the malware schedules a device boot to ensure the malware will re-activate even if the user turns off the device. Most commands included with the malware are common to Android backdoors, but a couple relatively unique commands were identified. These include the ability to add and connect to a custom WiFi point, and a capability allowing calls from specific phone numbers to be answered, which provides a backup method for audio tapping. The newest function that has been added is the use of accessibility services to steal contents of messages from instant messaging apps, some of which are specific to Iran. All of these commands are issued with intercepted SMS messages. ReversingLabs also investigated the C2 infrastructure in an attempt to identify related domains tied to the threat actor.

Intezer reports on the use of the pandemic to deliver the malware known as Zebrocy.\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Phishing\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nZebrocy, malware used against government and commercial organizations engaged in foreign efforts, has been seen being delivered via documents about a COVID-19 vaccine company. A Virtual Hard Drive is the delivery mechanism and requires the victims to use Windows 10 in order to access the malicious files. The malware is heavily obfuscated but attribution was made to the Sofacy threat actor through the use of forensics in samples obtained from prior campaigns. Sofacy, also known as APT28, FancyBear, and STRONTIUM, was responsible for the compromise of the Democratic National Committee. Originally written in Delphi, the malware has since been translated into several other programming languages, thus widening its footprint and possible targets. The malware works by having a user open a VHD which includes two files, a PDF and an executable masquerading as a Word document. The PDF is a copy of slides from a presentation about the Sinopharm International Corporation, a company based out of China and a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products. The company is currently working on a COVID-19 vaccination and presents an attractive lure to unsuspecting users. The second file is the actual malware, and only 9 of 70 anti-virus engines were able to detect it. The malware is obfuscated with gobfuscator and doesn't collect the same information as noted in prior campaigns. Instead, only the hostname and TEMP folder path are gathered. Screenshot code has been implemented by the author and does not use a third-party software to accomplish the task. Additionally, anti-debugging checks are performed through the use of the Windows API, IsDebuggerPresent. If present, the malware enters an infinite sleep. Screenshots are uploaded to a C2 server and, should the C2 return a second stage, the file is written to the target disk and executed.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Phishing\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nZebrocy, malware used against government and commercial organizations engaged in foreign efforts, has been seen being delivered via documents about a COVID-19 vaccine company. A Virtual Hard Drive is the delivery mechanism and requires the victims to use Windows 10 in order to access the malicious files. The malware is heavily obfuscated but attribution was made to the Sofacy threat actor through the use of forensics in samples obtained from prior campaigns. Sofacy, also known as APT28, FancyBear, and STRONTIUM, was responsible for the compromise of the Democratic National Committee. Originally written in Delphi, the malware has since been translated into several other programming languages, thus widening its footprint and possible targets. The malware works by having a user open a VHD which includes two files, a PDF and an executable masquerading as a Word document. The PDF is a copy of slides from a presentation about the Sinopharm International Corporation, a company based out of China and a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products. The company is currently working on a COVID-19 vaccination and presents an attractive lure to unsuspecting users. The second file is the actual malware, and only 9 of 70 anti-virus engines were able to detect it. The malware is obfuscated with gobfuscator and doesn't collect the same information as noted in prior campaigns. Instead, only the hostname and TEMP folder path are gathered. Screenshot code has been implemented by the author and does not use a third-party software to accomplish the task. Additionally, anti-debugging checks are performed through the use of the Windows API, IsDebuggerPresent. If present, the malware enters an infinite sleep. Screenshots are uploaded to a C2 server and, should the C2 return a second stage, the file is written to the target disk and executed. Further information can be found in the report located within the Reference section below.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report.   \n\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n  * Exercise caution with attachments and links in emails.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://www.intezer.com/blog/research/russian-apt-uses-covid-19-lures-to-deliver-zebrocy/>"

The exploit has since been patched with version 3.9.23. The exploit used a missing parameter that allowed for the bypass of checking for a user's level of access. This missing parameter is included in the patched version of the software. The weakness in the platform could allow an attacker to replace an actual ACL with one specifically written by the actor using the 'save' function. The vulnerability works by creating users with different privileges. A new category is created and given permission to the site manager. All permissions, however, are set to 'denied' for administrators. With this technique employed, the administrator can perform any function on the created folder because permissions are missing.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Vulnerability\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nA Joomla security advisory has been disclosed that shows a vulnerability in the ACL of versions from 1.7.0 to 3.9.22. The exploit has since been patched with version 3.9.23. The exploit used a missing parameter that allowed for the bypass of checking for a user's level of access. This missing parameter is included in the patched version of the software. The weakness in the platform could allow an attacker to replace an actual ACL with one specifically written by the actor using the 'save' function. The vulnerability works by creating users with different privileges. A new category is created and given permission to the site manager. All permissions, however, are set to 'denied' for administrators. With this technique employed, the administrator can perform any function on the created folder because permissions are missing. The manager can edit the created page and a new ACL is set allowing total access to administrators. An edited POST function can allow all of these actions to take place.

This works by making the negotiation URL something that is passed as a command-line argument when executed, meaning the URL is harder to discover by researchers who may be tracking ransomware on open source sandboxes such as VirusTotal. They have also switched to using the Rust programming language, making it more difficult to reverse engineer.

The lure uses the common \"Payment Order\" theme but, uniquely, includes a statement at the top of the email claiming that Mimecast was used to share large files with the recipient. Opening the attachment, as requested in the body of the email, provides users with a legitimate Mimecast link. The Mimecast link both provides users with a sense of legitimacy and evades email security appliances performing URL scanning. If a user falls victim and downloads and opens the HTML file from Mimecast, they will be redirected to a phishing page.

The lure uses the common \"Payment Order\" theme but, uniquely, includes a statement at the top of the email claiming that Mimecast was used to share large files with the recipient. Opening the attachment, as requested in the body of the email, provides users with a legitimate Mimecast link. The Mimecast link both provides users with a sense of legitimacy and evades email security appliances performing URL scanning. If a user falls victim and downloads and opens the HTML file from Mimecast, they will be redirected to a phishing page.

IBM X-Force tracks the activities of the group using the identifier Hive0022. The threat group is believed to be Arabic-speaking, politically motivated, and acting in the interests of the Palestinian Territories. The campaigns typically began with phishing emails that contained links that, in two of the three analyzed cases, led to a host that used geolocation to redirect connections that did not originate from the target countries to a news site. Of the two examples that used the redirection based on geolocation, one used a website masquerading as Quora on an attacker-controlled domain, and the other involved an actor-controlled domain and WordPress site that carried out the redirections. In the third case, the group was using Dropbox to host the malicious files but were unable to conduct the geolocation redirection due to not having control of the domain. Dropbox was also used for C&C services in some cases. If a connection originated from one of the targeted countries, the victim was led to an RAR file that contained malicious executables. The payload was a new Trojan developed by TA402 that Proofpoint has named NimbleMamba and has features typical of malware used in intelligence gathering and initial access.

The campaign uses malspam to deliver weaponized PowerPoint documents. The malspam emails have been sent in at least six waves, the most recent listed in Yoroi's report being sent in the second week of June. The malicious PowerPoint document uses shortened URLs that point to Blogspot pages that contain obfuscated JavaScript code executed using MSHTA. In turn, this leads to malicious PowerShell scripts that have been stored in the Wayback Machine's pages. The PowerShell scripts are used to deliver the final payload which is typically either Agent Tesla or Oski information stealers or the Cobian RAT. Persistence is achieved using registry keys and a scheduled task. A registry key is used to trigger the download of a PowerShell script which is used to disable system protection mechanisms including the Firewall, Windows Defender, UAC controls, and whitelisted processes needed by the malware. Yoroi attributes the campaign to a threat actor they refer to as Aggah that may be associated with the Gorgon group.

The campaign uses malspam to deliver weaponized PowerPoint documents. The malspam emails have been sent in at least six waves, the most recent listed in Yoroi's report being sent in the second week of June. The malicious PowerPoint document uses shortened URLs that point to Blogspot pages that contain obfuscated JavaScript code executed using MSHTA. In turn, this leads to malicious PowerShell scripts that have been stored in the Wayback Machine's pages. The PowerShell scripts are used to deliver the final payload which is typically either Agent Tesla or Oski information stealers or the Cobian RAT. Persistence is achieved using registry keys and a scheduled task. A registry key is used to trigger the download of a PowerShell script which is used to disable system protection mechanisms including the Firewall, Windows Defender, UAC controls, and whitelisted processes needed by the malware. Yoroi attributes the campaign to a threat actor they refer to as Aggah that may be associated with the Gorgon group.

    "context": "",
    "output": "\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Ransomware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nYoroi has recently observed the JobCrypter ransomware active in campaigns across Italy, despite its relative simplicity to the larger, double extortion ransomware groups widely discussed across the cyber landscape. This ransomware family often spreads via email attachments sent to victims enticing them to open the file in order to initiate the infection. The researchers' analysis begins with the JavaScript loader employed by the threat actors. Inside the script is a hex-obfuscated payload that is dropped into the user's %TEMP% folder and subsequently executed. The payload is packed using a .NET packers and employs anti-debugging checks before performing its primary malicious activities. If anti-debugging checks pass, a configuration file is decrypted for use by the malware. Persistence is then established via a JavaScript file in the Startup folder that simply launches the ransomware executable. Plaintext SMTP is used in order to send the decryption key to be used to the attacker's C2 server.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Ransomware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nYoroi has recently observed the JobCrypter ransomware active in campaigns across Italy, despite its relative simplicity to the larger, double extortion ransomware groups widely discussed across the cyber landscape. This ransomware family often spreads via email attachments sent to victims enticing them to open the file in order to initiate the infection. The researchers' analysis begins with the JavaScript loader employed by the threat actors. Inside the script is a hex-obfuscated payload that is dropped into the user's %TEMP% folder and subsequently executed. The payload is packed using a .NET packers and employs anti-debugging checks before performing its primary malicious activities. If anti-debugging checks pass, a configuration file is decrypted for use by the malware. Persistence is then established via a JavaScript file in the Startup folder that simply launches the ransomware executable. Plaintext SMTP is used in order to send the decryption key to be used to the attacker's C2 server. This means that if an organization is capturing the contents of outbound emails, the decryption key could be obtained and used without paying the ransom. Finally, Triple DES encryption is performed and a ransom note requesting the victim email the attacker's to pay the ransomware is dropped on the system.

Now word comes about the latest upgrade to the trojan, Ares. Ares is malware with new capabilities such as information exfiltration. Ares is used in conjunction with another variant dubbed Osiris. The two malwares utilize a packer written in C++ called DarkCrypter. This version of DarkCrypter should not be confused with the commercially available packer, also called DarkCrypter. In the new variant, the first 41 strings match older Kronos variants as well as the addition of eight new strings to detect analysis tools such as sandboxes. There are, at the time of this writing, two versions of the packer. The first decrypts using Blowfish. The key size for this decryption is not the standard Blowfish size - 4 through 56 bytes vs. 288 byte fixed length. The second variant uses an embedding technique that uses a compressed format rather than Blowfish encryption. This compression algorithm is identical to Ares. The packer shows itself to be a bitmap image header. This is an obvious ruse and can be seen in photos within the article. Additionally, the actor behind the malware uses BMPack, so named by Zscaler. This packer uses an XOR-based algorithm as well as RC4. Upon decryption, the file appears as a static bitmap. Each structure within the decompressed file holds a different section of a PE file that is stitched together by a custom loader and is, subsequently, executed. Ares itself is under development as evidenced by the constant testing of new plugins and web injects. An embedded DLL module is compressed and placed within the binary. An export is loaded and used to establish persistence by creating a scheduled task that executes every two hours. Though sharing most of the code with Kronos and Osiris, there are several differences. At present, most of the samples of Ares do not communicate with a C2 over TOR. The removal of the TOR component could be used to reduce the malware size. The Ares stealer attempts to extract information from FTP clients, VPN clients, web browsers, cryptocurrency wallets applications, instant messenger clients, and email clients. Ares supports the commands as Kronos and Osiris though some commands have been modified.

The group is also known, to a lesser degree, to have targeted telecommunication companies in the aforementioned geographies. BackdoorDiplomacy typically exploits vulnerabilities in Internet-accessible web-based applications and the management interfaces of network equipment to gain initial access to an environment and install a webshell. Examples of the vulnerabilities exploited by the group include an F5 BIP-IP vulnerability (CVE-2020-5902), unspecified Microsoft Exchange server vulnerabilities, and a misconfigured Plesk server. The webshell is used to install the group's principle backdoor which ESET refers to as Turian. The group's preferred method for installing Turian is to hijack DLL search orders. There are Windows and Linux versions of Turian and ESET notes that Turian is likely to be an evolution of the Quarian backdoor which has been previously used in attacks against diplomatic entities. Another binary installed by the group is used to detect removable media and copy their contents to the recycle bin on the system's main drive. Once a foothold has been established, a number of well-known tools are used to facilitate reconnaissance and lateral movement. The toolset is known to include EarthWorm, Mimikatz, SafetyKatz, Nbtscan, NetCat, PortQry, SMBTouch, EternalBlue, DoublePulsar, EternalRocks, and EternalSynergy.

Successfully exploited, the vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute code arbitrary code on a victim system.  The scans began after proof-of-concept code for the vulnerability was made public. The honeypots that detected the scans do not at the time report as vulnerable, so they received no follow on attempts to exploit the vulnerability.

The vulnerability is in the Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center application and allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine. In the observed Linux attack, the vulnerability was used to inject a loading script that downloaded a bash file from a C2 folder and executed it. The script gains persistence and then attempts to move laterally using stolen SSH credentials, spreading itself throughout a network. The final payload is a crypto miner which steals system resources. The Windows attack worked similarly but did not automatically spread laterally.

The threat actors are using this to target both Windows and Linux servers, with the intent to install crypto-mining malware.",
      "xfe_report": "Summary\n=======\n\n\n\nAttack Details\n==============\n\n* **Threat Type:** Cryptominer\n* **Targets:** Windows and Linux Machines Running Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center application\n* **Malware Family/Families:** Unknown\n* **Initial Infection Vector:** Exploitation of CVE-2022-26134 vulnerability\n* **Post-Compromise Actions:** Lateral movement, resource hijacking\n* **Additional TTPs:**See the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below\n\nOverview\n========\n\nCheck Point researchers have reported seeing the critical Atlassian vulnerability (CVE-2022-26134) first disclosed on 31 May 2022 being exploited in the wild. The vulnerability is in the Atlassian Confluence Server and Data Center application and allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine. In the observed Linux attack, the vulnerability was used to inject a loading script that downloaded a bash file from a C2 folder and executed it. The script gains persistence and then attempts to move laterally using stolen SSH credentials, spreading itself throughout a network. The final payload is a crypto miner which steals system resources. The Windows attack worked similarly but did not automatically spread laterally.

Based on open graph source code within the webpage it appears one method of distribution was via Facebook. Furthermore, install paths seen associated with the malware indicate another infection vector was WhatsApp messages. In terms of the payload, its data stealing functionality remains largely the same. The code, however, has been modified in a couple of aspects. Firstly, it now uses Base64 encoding of strings in the code in order to evade detection. Secondly, it uses retrofit2 and FireBase for C2 communication instead of Socket. The researchers hypothesize there may be hundreds of victims, with the main targets located in Pakistan and the Kashmir region. From what little stolen data could be analyzed, it appears a number of the victims have a military background.

Now in its third version, the loader has been previously spread using phishing emails with the malware in a zip attachment. The malware sets itself to run on startup to gain persistence and seems to have incomplete functionality. This allows IceXLoader to set up mutexes to ensure only one instance will load on startup, but this function is not yet working.

Microsoft patched this vulnerability in their August patch release. The Active Directory server he used was fully patched up to Microsoft's July release. Ports 135 (MS-RPC), 445 (SMB), and RPC high ports were left open to the Internet while all other ports were blocked. On September 26th, his server received hundreds of login attempts that closely matched the ZeroLogon exploit chain. These attempts were successful in resetting the domain controller's admin password to a blank password. All of the attempts were from the same IP address, listed in the IoCs section below.

Impersonating regulatory organizations, a metallurgical company, an industrial plant, a dental clinic, and media holdings company, the group uses a variety of techniques to infiltrate these and other industries within Russia. The first attack was against a large medical company using a phishing email claiming to be from the media holding company. Upon opening of the phishing email, a custom malware called TinyNode is installed. This malware is used as a backdoor and to load additional malware. The group performs reconnaissance, collection of data, and propagation. Additionally, the group uses Cobalt Strike to ensure post-exploitation is effective. The group moves laterally in an effort to obtain domain administrator credentials as well as creates a new account with privileges to perform administrative actions in case the original account is deleted or blocked. A backup of the data was unsuccessful as it was later revealed the attackers had deleted the organization's backups. Within hours, the ransomware TinyCryptor was spread throughout the network. A note of interest is each campaign uses a different email address. A demand of $50,000 worth of cryptocurrency was made in exchange for decrypting the encrypted files. The group was first observed between late-March and early-April. The group used a custom Trojan called TinyPosh. After a two week break, the group changed tactics and employed a fake email from a journalist to take part in research activities. The email used proper grammar as well as imitating the media's holding style. The fake journalist offered a 30-minute interview and uploaded questions to the cloud. Upon clicking the link, the TinyPosh Trojan was downloaded to a victim's computer. Persistence was set and the privileges of the account were obtained. Additionally, Cobalt Strike Beacon was launched and, in order to hide the actual C2 address, the group used a Cloudflare Workers server. The group took a hiatus until August 2020 when two large-scales campaigns were launched using the Russian media holding company as a front.

    "output": "Sure! Here is the information I have about the threat: UNC1945 - Threat Actor that Targets Solaris and Telecommunications Companies\nUNC1945 is a threat actor that Mandiant has been tracking since 2018. UNC1945 has primarily targeted exposed Solaris servers in the networks of telecommunications entities. Mandiant has published a report on the activities of UNC1945 throughout the time period they have been tracking the threat actor.\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, APT\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nA report from Mandiant tracks the activities of a threat actor Mandiant has named UNC1945 that has been targeting telecommunications entities. To gain access to a network, UNC1945 has exploited vulnerabilities in the Solaris operating system. The first compromise of a Solaris host by UNC1945 which is noted in the report occurred in late 2018. A backdoor named SLAPSTICK was installed on the compromised host. In mid 2020, Mandiant observed a remote exploitation tool named EVILSUN being deployed by UNC1945. EVILSUN contained an exploit, for what at the time, was a 0-day vulnerability in Solaris, which is now identified as CVE-2020-14871. Oracle provided a patch for this vulnerability in its October 2020 Critical Patch Update. An exploit for the vulnerability had been advertised for sale on black-market website in April 2020. Once the initial foothold was established, UNC1945 installed a number of tools, including a QEMU Virtual Machine that contained a version of Tiny Core Linux. A number of techniques and tools were used to facilitate lateral movement to HP-UX, Linux, and Windows hosts, and to third-party environments. UNC1945 takes a number of steps to evade detection including the scrubbing of log files. No data exfiltration was detected in the UNC1945 attacks but in one case, ransomware was deployed.

UNC1945 has primarily targeted exposed Solaris servers in the networks of telecommunications entities. Mandiant has published a report on the activities of UNC1945 throughout the time period they have been tracking the threat actor.",
      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, APT\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nA report from Mandiant tracks the activities of a threat actor Mandiant has named UNC1945 that has been targeting telecommunications entities. To gain access to a network, UNC1945 has exploited vulnerabilities in the Solaris operating system. The first compromise of a Solaris host by UNC1945 which is noted in the report occurred in late 2018. A backdoor named SLAPSTICK was installed on the compromised host. In mid 2020, Mandiant observed a remote exploitation tool named EVILSUN being deployed by UNC1945. EVILSUN contained an exploit, for what at the time, was a 0-day vulnerability in Solaris, which is now identified as CVE-2020-14871. Oracle provided a patch for this vulnerability in its October 2020 Critical Patch Update. An exploit for the vulnerability had been advertised for sale on black-market website in April 2020. Once the initial foothold was established, UNC1945 installed a number of tools, including a QEMU Virtual Machine that contained a version of Tiny Core Linux. A number of techniques and tools were used to facilitate lateral movement to HP-UX, Linux, and Windows hosts, and to third-party environments. UNC1945 takes a number of steps to evade detection including the scrubbing of log files. No data exfiltration was detected in the UNC1945 attacks but in one case, ransomware was deployed. Mandiant does not attribute the ransomware to UNC1945 and instead suggests that access to the compromised system may have been sold to a third-party. Tools and malware associated with UNC1945 includes LEMONSTICK, OKSOLO, PUPYRAT, SLAPSTICK, TINYSHELL which all provide some level of backdoor capabilities, STEELCORGI which is a packer for Linux ELF programs, the reconnaissance tool OPENSHACKLE, LOGBLEACH which is used for scrubbing log files, and ProxyChains.

It has some interesting characteristics not commonly seen with other RaaS offerings. It first appeared in the threat landscape at the end of April 2020. Similar to other ransomware services, a percentage of the profit made by the purchasers is provided to the operators in order to receive the payload and services. Additionally, the operators charge a registration fee, one that is quite a bit higher than those charged by competitors (.2 BTC or $1,800). One of the most unique features of SMAUG is its multi-platofrm support, allowing encryption of Windows, Linux and macOS systems. Additionally, when building the malicious payload, an option is provided to allow a single encryption key to be used across all victim hosts in a single company. Anti-analysis, offline execution, customizable campaigns are all features advertised in their forum posts. The payloads are generated via a web-based management interface as opposed to the more common offline builder. This web portal also allows victims to decrypt a single file for free. The generated payloads for Windows are obfuscated Go binaries. On Windows, persistence is established via the LoadAppInit_DLLs Registry key. A ransom note is dropped in all folders containing encrypted files. The researchers also note that the SMAUG portal provides detailed walkthroughs for victims and affiliates.

After exploiting ProxyLogon (CVE-2021-27065) on vulnerable on-premise versions of Microsoft Exchange Server, the threat actor installed a webshell in order to allow further remote command execution. A PowerShell command was executed via this webshell to download and install the ransomware payload from a remote server. Analysis of the payload reveals that it is a Python script compiled into an executable using PyInstaller. It contains a list of folders to avoid encrypting and kills SQL services to unlock database files. The generated encryption key and ID are uploaded to a [mega.io](http://mega.io) account. Finally, encryption is performed by reading the original file, overwriting it with encrypted content, and renaming it. No indicators are added to the file to prevent the file from being encrypted again. After encryption completes, the mouse and keyboard are disabled and a full screen window displays a ransom note and a countdown timer. Sophos notes that review of the cryptocurrency transaction log reveals at least one victim has paid the ransom. For more information, see the Sophos blog post in the Reference section.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report. \n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/03/23/black-kingdom/>",

To achieve this, the malware employs techniques to reduce the possibility of detection and competition.

These particular attacks target the Alibaba Elastic Computing Service, which comes with a preinstalled security agent. Upon infection, many cryptojacking samples will attempt to uninstall this to avoid detection. This is not uncommon behavior for malware, but in this example, specific code was identified which creates firewall rules to drop packets coming from internal Alibaba zones and regions. Alibaba ECS also makes a good target as it provides root access to the instance, which many cloud providers do not. Since the threat actor can gain the highest possible privilege, the possibility of advanced payloads such as kernel module rootkits and system service persistence can be established.

The LockBit group announced the release of the variant on an underground forum back in October 2021 and shortly after samples appeared in the wild. When executing the payload, the operator can provide various parameters that will modify how the ransomware operates, such as how much of a file is encrypted and whether logging should occur. The commands necessary for encrypting VM images on ESXi servers are also included. These include those for gathering a list of VMs, shutting them down, and enabling SSH. The ransom note is similar to those observed in Windows variants. Along with demanding a ransom in exchange for the decryption key, it also threatens to release stolen data and attempts to recruit potential insiders.

Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Adware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nA new adware program dubbed Convuster has been seen in the wild. The adware is written in a little known programming language called Rust. Analysts were able to identify the language through the use of Rust specific language and the file extension .rs. The malware works by checking for keys needed to run the adware. The program obtains a device ID, system version, fitness and forwards that data to a C2 server. A JSON file is sent and sends a request to the host specified within the JSON file. In response, a Bash script is sent and executed. After the script retrieves the Bash shell, it is removed from the system. Upon analysis of the C2 server, a DMG disk image with the Convuster executable written in Swift was found. The malware is stored in a macOS Gatekeeper security system. This helps to prevent analysis from security professionals.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Adware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nA new adware program dubbed Convuster has been seen in the wild. The adware is written in a little known programming language called Rust. Analysts were able to identify the language through the use of Rust specific language and the file extension .rs. The malware works by checking for keys needed to run the adware. The program obtains a device ID, system version, fitness and forwards that data to a C2 server. A JSON file is sent and sends a request to the host specified within the JSON file. In response, a Bash script is sent and executed. After the script retrieves the Bash shell, it is removed from the system. Upon analysis of the C2 server, a DMG disk image with the Convuster executable written in Swift was found. The malware is stored in a macOS Gatekeeper security system. This helps to prevent analysis from security professionals. If certain checks are successful, the user is shown a window prompting the installation of FlashPlayer. If the checks fail, the program provides a window informing the victim to try later. The actual malware is run through LaunchAgents but does not write itself to run on startup. Based on the behavior of the malware, SecureList has classified it as malware.

They are a little-known threat actor who has been active since April 2018 and has become known for attacking telecommunications companies and critical systems in the Middle East. Since being originally discovered, researchers have noted that they have replaced their publicly documented payload known as 'DanBot', with new C++ backdoors and a PowerShell script that serve the same purpose. The script was discovered on VirusTotal in November 2020, and using the C2 server, the researchers were able to access the new C++ payloads. There are two main variants of the backdoor, named 'James' and 'Kevin', after the names of directories found with the variants. Both variants communicate with their C2 servers using DNS, but the 'James' variant also allows for communication over HTTP exfiltration. The domains used in the attack attempt to impersonate known services, by using keywords such as 'cloud', 'windows', or 'cdn'. The attackers also host their own nameservers, meaning they can decode the DNS queries received from the malware and respond using commands the malware can understand. Once a machine has been infected, the attackers use commands from the C2 server to perform local reconnaissance. They also drop a Mimikatz-based executable to harvest credentials from Google Chrome. Although this is an individual group, the researchers do comment on the similarities between Lyceum Group and APT34, so there could be a relationship between these groups.

The threat actors utilize the PHP function fsockopen() to connect to other malicious PHP functions containing the URL to the SEO spam infrastructure. In conclusion, SEO spam attacks can be dangerous and generate copious amounts of revenue for threat actors. The researchers highlight the usage of remote site scanning tools, such as SiteCheck, to help end-users detect security issues, malware, infected files and, blacklist status.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Review the source article for full details.\n\n  * Apply applicable patches, updates, or workarounds as necessary. \n\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://blog.sucuri.net/2020/11/hidden-seo-spam-link-injections-on-wordpress-sites.html>"

A report from Kaspersky indicates that Roaming Mantis has now added two European countries, France and Germany, to its primary target list. The most affected countries in the last year have been China, France, Germany, India, Japan, and Korea. The current smishing campaign targets Android devices and deploys malware named Wroba. The smishing messages usually contain a brief description and a link to a landing page where iOS devices were redirected to the Apple website whereas Wroba would be downloaded onto Android devices. The code in the landing page is obfuscated, uses geolocation to reject IP addresses that are not in the targeted region and delivers them a fake 404 error page, and uses user-agent checks to differentiate between iOS and Android devices. Significant updates have been made to the loader used to deliver Wroba. It has been rewritten from Java to use the Kotlin language and uses multiple stages to deliver the payload.

This group leverages PlugX, Winnti, and Shadowpad during their attacks. They are known for their targeting of the computer gaming industry to steal in-game digital items to sell for profit. Recently though, they also targeted a telecoms organization in Taiwan using a modified version of Winnti. The groups appear to be connected based on two individuals, charged as part of the indictments, that appear to have worked with both groups on various operations.

The payload is a small executable capable of monitoring the clipboard and replacing its contents when certain conditions are meant. It attempts to replace cryptocurrency wallet addresses, PayPal email addresses, and Steam trade offers URLs present on the clipboard with those controlled by the attacker. The C2 URL and attacker's replacement data are encrypted and stored in the PE resources. Upon connecting to the C2 URL, the server confirms that the operator of the malware is a valid customer.

DirtyMoe focuses on carrying out cryptojacking and DDoS attacks. Most of the samples they captured were delivered onto victims' machines by the PurpleFox exploit kit. The article takes a deeper look at 2 MSI installer packages. The newest version consists of two parts where one is the MSI package itself and the other part is a separate CAB file that contains the malicious payloads. The registry is used to disable antispyware and file protection features.

    "output": "\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Vulnerability\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\n  \nResearchers from Independent Security Evaluators have published a blog on their efforts to reverse engineer the popular dating app Bumble. The research has shown that an unverified user can bypass paying for some premium features. The attacker could also have the ability to dump the entire user-base with pictures. Some of the techniques have been mitigated, while others remain. Part of a mitigated issue is the use of sequential user IDs by Bumble as well as updating its encryption scheme. Additionally, providing distance to other users is no longer possible, which eliminates the possibility of using triangulation to locate a specific user. One technique is using an endpoint to obtain Facebook likes, pictures, and other profile information. One limitation is the attack must have the encrypted user ID available to them or one which they own. It is suspected that Bumble will address this vulnerability in the coming days. Bypassing other premium features is still functional. The use of REST APIs for inter-application communication can allow client-side communication in a stateless form. Using the Burp Suite, the team was able to explore API calls and perform the necessary functions to trigger the unintentional data leak. \n\n## Unlimited Votes\n\nBumble's mobile app limits the number of \"swipes\" a non-premium user can use per day. The request is done through an action called SERVER_ENCOUNTERS_VOTE. If the options are manipulated, an attacker could receive unlimited votes during a 24-hour period. Since there is no check on the APIs, the web application user could achieve this rather easily. \n\n## Backtrack\n\nShould a user accidentally swipe left (deny) a prospective match, the backtrack function allows for removing the parameter for exclusion. An API voting request directly would allow an attacker to change his vote from left to right (accept). \n\n## Beeline\n\nOne of the most useful functions to an attacker is the ability to see all those who've swiped right on them. Assigned user codes allow for the exploitation of this information and can be modified and used for other endpoints. \n\n## Enumeration\n\nFinally, perhaps the most useful feature is the ability to find users by employing unlimited filters. This could allow an attacker to limit search results to a certain radius. The results would also include pictures and Facebook (if connected) interests and pages liked by the victim. \n\nFurther technical information can be found in the blog post located within the Reference section below. \n\n# CVEs\n\n  * N/A\n\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Review the source article for full details.\n\n  * Apply applicable patches, updates, or workarounds as necessary. \n\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://blog.securityevaluators.com/reverse-engineering-bumbles-api-a2a0d39b3a87>",

Bypassing other premium features is still functional. The use of REST APIs for inter-application communication can allow client-side communication in a stateless form. Using the Burp Suite, the team was able to explore API calls and perform the necessary functions to trigger the unintentional data leak. \n\n## Unlimited Votes\n\nBumble's mobile app limits the number of \"swipes\" a non-premium user can use per day. The request is done through an action called SERVER_ENCOUNTERS_VOTE. If the options are manipulated, an attacker could receive unlimited votes during a 24-hour period. Since there is no check on the APIs, the web application user could achieve this rather easily. \n\n## Backtrack\n\nShould a user accidentally swipe left (deny) a prospective match, the backtrack function allows for removing the parameter for exclusion. An API voting request directly would allow an attacker to change his vote from left to right (accept). \n\n## Beeline\n\nOne of the most useful functions to an attacker is the ability to see all those who've swiped right on them. Assigned user codes allow for the exploitation of this information and can be modified and used for other endpoints. \n\n## Enumeration\n\nFinally, perhaps the most useful feature is the ability to find users by employing unlimited filters. This could allow an attacker to limit search results to a certain radius. The results would also include pictures and Facebook (if connected) interests and pages liked by the victim. \n\nFurther technical information can be found in the blog post located within the Reference section below. \n\n# CVEs\n\n  * N/A\n\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Review the source article for full details.\n\n  * Apply applicable patches, updates, or workarounds as necessary. \n\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://blog.securityevaluators.com/reverse-engineering-bumbles-api-a2a0d39b3a87>"

The threat actors operate on a double-extortion model, threatening to release stolen data on a TOR site if the ransom is not paid. It is unknown at this time whether an affiliate model exists.

The kit allows anyone to develop lures for this campaign through the use of the control panel previously mentioned. Lures created by a variety of actors have the potential to be quite lucrative depending on the sophistication of the lures. The campaign uses a high-quality phishing page, an optional, masked gateway to the control panel, and the actual control panel to which the stolen credentials are exfiltrated. Lures for this campaign are split into two parts: an SMS message containing a link to a fake login page to the victim's bank. One of the more interesting aspects of the SMS message is that is a type-0 SMS, typically used to display emergency messages. The type-0 message displays over any open window or application making it particularly enticing to recipients. The link in the SMS leads to a cloned copy of the actual bank page in question and drops a cookie to advise the attacker of subsequent visits to the page. Attackers are able to organize the phishing kit to block or redirect victims who do not click on the link, or security professionals attempting to ascertain where the stolen information is exfiltrated. The masked gateway allows victims to only see the gateway should they attempt to find the actual control panel. Should anyone attempt to track the control panel, they are only able to see the masked gateway information. Once a victim visits a lure, a beacon is sent to the control panel, which triggers visual and audio alerts to the attacker allowing them to take actions to phish the intended victim. This particular kit allows for the creation of multiple lures for multiple banks, seemingly, to provide the widest net for trapping victims. If the lure or logs are removed by anyone other than the attacker, all credentials found during that session are lost. The kit contains a configured email address to which the kit will send obtained credentials. The 2FA bypass works by providing its own 2FA with fake information and a challenge screen in which victims are to enter specific pieces of information from the fake 2FA provided. Once the victim enters the information and clicks the \"Next\" button, all details are passed to the attacker's control panel.

According to the FBI's Flash alert, it has been involved in the compromising of some forty-nine entities as of early November 2021. The compromised entities exist mainly in five critical infrastructure sectors, financial, government, healthcare, information technology, and manufacturing. Cuba is typically deployed by the Hancitor malware which is a dropper used to deploy a variety of malware including RATs and other ransomware. Hancitor itself uses a number of infection vectors including exploiting Exchange vulnerabilities, compromised credentials, phishing, and RDP. Once Cuba is deployed, Cobalt Strike beacons are installed on compromised hosts and MimiKatz is used to obtain credentials that allow the attacker to connect to other hosts using RDP. Compromised hosts are able to communicate directly with the Cuba C&C servers to download and deploy files used in the next stage of the attack. When Cuba encrypts files it adds a .cuba extension to the filename. The Flash makes no mention of exfiltration of data although the sample ransom note shown in the alert mentions the downloading of data to attacker-controlled servers. The Flash notes that the Cuba operators have demanded ransoms that total at least $74 million USD, and have received a minimum, $43.9 million USD in payments.

The backdoor operates on Windows hosts, is written in Delphi, and dates back to at least 2017. Upon execution, the malware points to the MZ header to run embedded shell code. The shell code is responsible for calling a reflective loader function that loads the binary and jumps to its entry point. Unlike most Windows backdoors that beacon to a C2 server to retrieve commands, CrimsonIAS simply opens a listener that waits to receive commands from the attacker. There are three available commands an attacker can pass to the backdoor: run a command, receive a file, or send a file. Researchers believe that this backdoor could potentially be attributed to the Mustang Panda APT due to a few key similarities. First, the payload is encrypted with an XOR key that is prepended to the binary. Additionally, it leverages the MZ header to store shell code. Lastly, an exported library named Loader is used to reflectively load the binary. This also means that existing Mustang Panda PlugX archives could be used to launch CrimsonIAS instead of a PlugX DLL.

Google Play Store links to fake copies of legitimate applications are being shared via TikTok and Instagram. The types of applications vary and include custom keyboards, photo editors, games, and more. Once on the system, the fake app gathers system information to determine the location of the victim, which will determine the language and area code that should be used. Upon opening the app, users are presented with a location-specific prompt requesting a phone number.

Google Play Store links to fake copies of legitimate applications are being shared via TikTok and Instagram. The types of applications vary and include custom keyboards, photo editors, games, and more. Once on the system, the fake app gathers system information to determine the location of the victim, which will determine the language and area code that should be used. Upon opening the app, users are presented with a location-specific prompt requesting a phone number.

The third campaign mainly uses imitations of Microsoft pages and obfuscates variable names in the code by hex-encoding them, and JavaScript Obfuscator is also used. The fourth campaign uses JavaScript obfuscation and embedded Base64 images.

    "output": "You are asking about a specific threat report. Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Android Malware\n  *  **Targets:** Users of 467 various Android apps.\n  *  **Malware Family/Families:** ERMAC\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector: Fake app.**\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Credential stealing.\n  *  **Additional TTPs:** See the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below.\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nERMAC is credential-stealing malware for Android devices. Version 1.0 of ERMAC was discovered in August 2021 with the actor behind ERMAC renting it out for $3,000 per month with version 2.0 becoming available around March 2022, now being rented for $5,000 per month. Cyble Research Labs have published a report of their analysis of ERMAC 2.0 which has increased the number of applications it targets from 378 in version 1.0 to 467 in 2.0. ERMAC is installed through third-party sites. In Cyble's analysis, it was found on fake sites impersonating a Polish food delivery platform. A link to download what is purported to be the legitimate site's app is provided. It has also been observed masquerading as browser updates. The fake app seeks 43 different permissions when installed. Once installed, it sends a list of the applications installed on the infected device to its C&C servers. The C&C server responds with a list of targeted applications and an encrypted HTML phishing page ERMAC will use to carry out overlay injections. When the victim interacts with a targeted application, the overlay injection is used to obtain the victim's credentials which are then sent to the C&C server. Further information is available from the link in the Reference section below.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\nAssociated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * For a list of mitigative recommendations, please see the MITRE ATT&CK Framework matrix below.\n\n\n\n\n# References\n\n  * <https://blog.cyble.com/2022/05/25/ermac-back-in-action/>\n\n\n\n# MITRE ATT&CK Framework\n\n **Tactics and Techniques:**\n\n **Initial Access - TA0027**  \nT1444 - Masquerade as Legitimate Application  \nT1476 - Deliver Malicious App via Other Means  \n  \n **Defense Evasion - TA0030**  \nT1406 - Obfuscated Files or Information  \n  \n **Credential Access - TA0031**  \nT1412 - Capture SMS Messages  \n  \n **Discovery - TA0032**  \nT1421 - System Network Connections Discovery  \n  \n **Collection - TA0035**  \nT1432 - Access Contact List  \nT1507 - Network Information Discovery  \n  \n **Command and Control - TA0037**  \nT1571 - Non-Standard Port  \nT1573 - Encrypted Channel\n\n **Mitigations:**\n\n **M1001:** Security Updates -Install security updates in response to discovered vulnerabilities. Purchase devices with a vendor and/or mobile carrier commitment to provide security updates in a prompt manner for a set period of time. Decommission devices that will no longer receive security updates. Limit or block access to enterprise resources from devices that have not installed recent security updates. On Android devices, access can be controlled based on each device's security patch level. On iOS devices, access can be controlled based on the iOS version.  \n **M1005:** Application Vetting - Enterprises can vet applications for exploitable vulnerabilities or unwanted (privacy-invasive or malicious) behaviors. Enterprises can inspect applications themselves or use a third-party service. Enterprises may impose policies to only allow pre-approved applications to be installed on their devices or may impose policies to block use of specific applications known to have issues. In Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) environments, enterprises may only be able to impose these policies over an enterprise-managed portion of the device. Application Vetting is not a complete mitigation. Techniques such as Evade Analysis Environment exist that can enable adversaries to bypass vetting.  \n **M1006:** Use Recent OS Version - New mobile operating system versions bring not only patches against discovered vulnerabilities but also often bring security architecture improvements that provide resilience against potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that have not yet been discovered. They may also bring improvements that block use of observed adversary techniques.  \n **M1011:** User Guidance - Describes any guidance or training given to users to set particular configuration settings or avoid specific potentially risky behaviors.  \n **M1012:** Enterprise Policy - An enterprise mobility management (EMM), also known as mobile device management (MDM), system can be used to provision policies to mobile devices to control aspects of their allowed behavior.",

      "xfe_report": "# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Android Malware\n  *  **Targets:** Users of 467 various Android apps.\n  *  **Malware Family/Families:** ERMAC\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector: Fake app.**\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Credential stealing.\n  *  **Additional TTPs:** See the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below.\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nERMAC is credential-stealing malware for Android devices. Version 1.0 of ERMAC was discovered in August 2021 with the actor behind ERMAC renting it out for $3,000 per month with version 2.0 becoming available around March 2022, now being rented for $5,000 per month. Cyble Research Labs have published a report of their analysis of ERMAC 2.0 which has increased the number of applications it targets from 378 in version 1.0 to 467 in 2.0. ERMAC is installed through third-party sites. In Cyble's analysis, it was found on fake sites impersonating a Polish food delivery platform. A link to download what is purported to be the legitimate site's app is provided. It has also been observed masquerading as browser updates. The fake app seeks 43 different permissions when installed. Once installed, it sends a list of the applications installed on the infected device to its C&C servers. The C&C server responds with a list of targeted applications and an encrypted HTML phishing page ERMAC will use to carry out overlay injections. When the victim interacts with a targeted application, the overlay injection is used to obtain the victim's credentials which are then sent to the C&C server. Further information is available from the link in the Reference section below.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\nAssociated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * For a list of mitigative recommendations, please see the MITRE ATT&CK Framework matrix below.\n\n\n\n\n# References\n\n  * <https://blog.cyble.com/2022/05/25/ermac-back-in-action/>\n\n\n\n# MITRE ATT&CK Framework\n\n **Tactics and Techniques:**\n\n **Initial Access - TA0027**  \nT1444 - Masquerade as Legitimate Application  \nT1476 - Deliver Malicious App via Other Means  \n  \n **Defense Evasion - TA0030**  \nT1406 - Obfuscated Files or Information  \n  \n **Credential Access - TA0031**  \nT1412 - Capture SMS Messages  \n  \n **Discovery - TA0032**  \nT1421 - System Network Connections Discovery  \n  \n **Collection - TA0035**  \nT1432 - Access Contact List  \nT1507 - Network Information Discovery  \n  \n **Command and Control - TA0037**  \nT1571 - Non-Standard Port  \nT1573 - Encrypted Channel\n\n **Mitigations:**\n\n **M1001:** Security Updates -Install security updates in response to discovered vulnerabilities. Purchase devices with a vendor and/or mobile carrier commitment to provide security updates in a prompt manner for a set period of time. Decommission devices that will no longer receive security updates. Limit or block access to enterprise resources from devices that have not installed recent security updates. On Android devices, access can be controlled based on each device's security patch level. On iOS devices, access can be controlled based on the iOS version.  \n **M1005:** Application Vetting - Enterprises can vet applications for exploitable vulnerabilities or unwanted (privacy-invasive or malicious) behaviors. Enterprises can inspect applications themselves or use a third-party service. Enterprises may impose policies to only allow pre-approved applications to be installed on their devices or may impose policies to block use of specific applications known to have issues. In Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) environments, enterprises may only be able to impose these policies over an enterprise-managed portion of the device. Application Vetting is not a complete mitigation. Techniques such as Evade Analysis Environment exist that can enable adversaries to bypass vetting.  \n **M1006:** Use Recent OS Version - New mobile operating system versions bring not only patches against discovered vulnerabilities but also often bring security architecture improvements that provide resilience against potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that have not yet been discovered. They may also bring improvements that block use of observed adversary techniques.  \n **M1011:** User Guidance - Describes any guidance or training given to users to set particular configuration settings or avoid specific potentially risky behaviors.  \n **M1012:** Enterprise Policy - An enterprise mobility management (EMM), also known as mobile device management (MDM), system can be used to provision policies to mobile devices to control aspects of their allowed behavior."

Previously, the APT has used Hangui Office documents as its targeting mechanism, which is commonly used in South Korea. First introduced in 2016, the self-decoding process uses a macro within a macro that is decoded and executed. The technique uses an IF/THEN series of instructions to decode and execute the payload. In order to check for the possibility of execution, the macro checks for bypass ability within VBOM. If an exception is triggered in the checks process, VBOM needs to be bypassed. This is the IF clause. If no exception exists, the ELSE clause kicks in and allows for dynamic macro execution. Once VBOM is bypassed, a mutex is created in the victim's machine.

The DLL was injected into multiple instances of svchost.exe which, in turn, injected a Cobalt Strike beacon into multiple instances of rundll32.exe. Attempts were made to download further malware, including Ficker Stealer, which is commonly installed by Hancitor. The attacker did manage to compromise another system on the network by using the SMB protocol to copy a batch script and DLL to the system. The batch file was then executed by a remote service and executed the Cobalt Strike shellcode embedded in the DLL.

The DLL was injected into multiple instances of svchost.exe which, in turn, injected a Cobalt Strike beacon into multiple instances of rundll32.exe. Attempts were made to download further malware, including Ficker Stealer, which is commonly installed by Hancitor. The attacker did manage to compromise another system on the network by using the SMB protocol to copy a batch script and DLL to the system. The batch file was then executed by a remote service and executed the Cobalt Strike shellcode embedded in the DLL. The attacker was discovered and evicted from the systems before their objective became clear. Further details are available from the link in the Reference section below.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report. \n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n  * Exercise caution with attachments and links in emails.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://thedfirreport.com/2021/06/28/hancitor-continues-to-push-cobalt-strike/>"

The unauthorized access occurred through the company's email system via a phishing attack. The attack resulted in two staff email accounts and a shared file folder being compromised. Among the data compromised are names, email addresses, residential addresses, driver's licenses, Medicare information, tax file numbers, and signatures. This data could be potentially harmful to the victims affected as it introduces the possibility of identity theft or even personal attack. \"The investigation found that correspondence relating to a number of individuals associated with Scouts Victoria is among the data potentially accessed by unauthorized third parties,\" a statement from a Scouts Victoria spokesperson said.

The malware uses the names and icons of legitimate applications to trick users into executing them. Upon installation, the malware requests 18 different permissions which are abuses to collect sensitive data from the device and control mobile features such as audio recording. Upon the first launch, the icon gets hidden from the menu and runs silently in the background. The malware then monitors the user's clipboard and steals any data found there, exfiltrating it to the C2 server.

The malware uses the names and icons of legitimate applications to trick users into executing them. Upon installation, the malware requests 18 different permissions which are abuses to collect sensitive data from the device and control mobile features such as audio recording. Upon the first launch, the icon gets hidden from the menu and runs silently in the background. The malware then monitors the user's clipboard and steals any data found there, exfiltrating it to the C2 server. The malware also performs a number of data collection operations to collect device technical information, which is also exfiltrated. The RAT can receive commands from the C2 server, allowing it to capture audio, take pictures using the device camera, collect device location, and take screenshots.

Bitdefender notes that there are several Chinese threat actors involved in distributing FiveSys and they target several domestic Chinese games. So far, the spread of FiveSys appears to be limited to China. The primary function of FiveSys is to redirect HTTP/S traffic to a proxy server and achieves this by acting as a local Proxy Autoconfguration Script. To avoid generating browser warnings, a custom root certificate is installed. FiveSys attempts to block other malicious drivers by maintaining a blocklist of digital signatures used by other malware groups. FiveSys also protects modifications it makes to the system registry. While not mentioned in the Bitdefender report, comments in a media article suggest that FiveSys is distributed by bundling it with cracked software downloads.

As this is a long-standing operation, with advanced capabilities and no known affinity to existing threat groups, the researchers have named this group GhostEmperor. This group has been observed using several initial infection vectors, but most commonly, they exploit public-facing servers to gain initial access. They have recently been observed exploiting the ProxyLogon vulnerability. Once initial access is gained, the group deploys a series of malware starting with a PowerShell dropper, which installs the second stage as a service and executes it. This second stage then initiates a third stage payload as an in-memory implant. The third stage is in charge of facilitating a communication channel with a C2 server, where traffic can be masqueraded under the guise of legitimate communications with a benign service. The final stage is injected into the winlogon.exe process by the previous stage, which provides the attacker remote control over the system. In addition to the final stage, the implant also deploys a Windows kernel-mode driver which serves as a rootkit with the sole purpose of concealing malware artifacts. Analysts have named this rootkit Demodex, as it has not been seen before. Once this malware has been established, the attackers perform internal reconnaissance using public tools such as NBTscan, as well as tools from the Sysinternals suite such as PsExec and ProcDump. GhostEmperor mainly targets government entities and telecommunication companies in southeast Asia, with multiple high-profile entities targeted in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.

Additionally, PRISM's C&C communications are HTTP-based and clearly identifiable. Despite this, AT&T Alien Labs has discovered a number of PRISM variants that have been used in multiple smaller campaigns, by multiple actors, over a period of more than 3.5 years, which have remained largely undetected.

The researchers found newly registered domains that were spoofing the official Microsoft Windows 11 OS download portal. From these sites, the victims could download fake Windows 11 ISO files which are very large, and so can evade network security products. These files are signed with an expired certificate that is likely stolen during the 2019 AVAST compromise.

According to a report from Mandiant, the group targets employees working in the fields of acquisitions, corporate development, mergers, IT security staff, or that deal with large corporate transactions. Mandiant notes that UNC3524's targeting suggests a financial motivation, the level of tradecraft displayed by the group is more suggestive of an espionage actor. How UNC3524 gain their initial access to an organization is, at the time Mandiant's report was published, unknown. Once the group has gained access, they typically install a backdoor named QUIETEXIT on devices such as load balancers, SAN arrays, and wireless access point controllers. QUIETEXIT establishes an SSH connection to a C&C server, and once connected QUIETEXIT provides the functionality of an SSH server. It is also capable of setting up a SOCKS tunnel that allows the attackers to execute their tools on their local system thus leaving no traces of tools on the compromised systems. The C&C servers used by the group are a botnet of compromised IoT devices. The IoT devices are typically legacy conference room camera systems from a specific vendor. The IP addresses of the C&C servers are typically obtained using Dynamic DNS providers though an IP address and port can be specified in the command-line arguments used when executing QUIETEXIT.

      "xfe_report": "# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Malware, Espionage.\n  *  **Targets:** Employees involved in acquisitions, corporate development, mergers, IT security staff, or that deal with large corporate transactions.\n  *  **Malware Family/Families:** QUIETEXIT\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Unknown\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Collection of emails.\n  *  **Additional TTPs:** See the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below.\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nUNC3524 is a newly discovered threat group that focuses on collecting the emails of its targets. According to a report from Mandiant, the group targets employees working in the fields of acquisitions, corporate development, mergers, IT security staff, or that deal with large corporate transactions. Mandiant notes that UNC3524's targeting suggests a financial motivation, the level of tradecraft displayed by the group is more suggestive of an espionage actor. How UNC3524 gain their initial access to an organization is, at the time Mandiant's report was published, unknown. Once the group has gained access, they typically install a backdoor named QUIETEXIT on devices such as load balancers, SAN arrays, and wireless access point controllers. QUIETEXIT establishes an SSH connection to a C&C server, and once connected QUIETEXIT provides the functionality of an SSH server. It is also capable of setting up a SOCKS tunnel that allows the attackers to execute their tools on their local system thus leaving no traces of tools on the compromised systems. The C&C servers used by the group are a botnet of compromised IoT devices. The IoT devices are typically legacy conference room camera systems from a specific vendor. The IP addresses of the C&C servers are typically obtained using Dynamic DNS providers though an IP address and port can be specified in the command-line arguments used when executing QUIETEXIT.

This malware is normally distributed via phishing emails, as well as over social media. It has also been found masquerading as legitimate programs, including as an installer for Telegram. Once installed, the malware can perform a wide array of functions. At its core, it can steal usernames, passwords, cookies, saved credentials, and credit card information from browsers. It can also gather files from cryptocurrency cold wallets and other locations. Beyond that, RedLine Stealer is capable of performing basic download and execute functions, meaning it can be used as a loader in a multi-stage attack. RedLine is being continually developed by a competent C# developer, and so new versions of this malware are being released regularly.

The compressed file contains a file called Game..exe which is not the game at all but is a malware launcher. A second Game.exe (differs from Game..exe) file is used to run the actual games. Once the process completes, Game..exe is automatically hidden. Further files are created including one that poses as an uninstaller but is actually another type of malware. Connections to a C2 server are used to obtain the URL of further malware to be downloaded. ASEC researchers were unable to obtain the download URL and therefore cannot speak to the operation of the malware.

According to Netlab 360 who discovered and named the new variant, it targets a previously unknown vulnerability in KGUARD DVR firmware. Probing for this vulnerability began as early as March. A matter of days after the discovery of mirai_ptea, and another variant named mirai_aurora were detected exploiting the KGUARD vulnerability. Netlab 360's report notes that the vulnerability appears to have been addressed in versions of the KGUARD firmware.

According to Netlab 360 who discovered and named the new variant, it targets a previously unknown vulnerability in KGUARD DVR firmware. Probing for this vulnerability began as early as March. A matter of days after the discovery of mirai_ptea, and another variant named mirai_aurora were detected exploiting the KGUARD vulnerability. Netlab 360's report notes that the vulnerability appears to have been addressed in versions of the KGUARD firmware. The vulnerability is due to the firmware listening on an unspecified port which will allows an attacker to execute system commands without any authentication. Command and control communications are handled by mirai_ptea connecting to a Tor server through a proxy node. The botnet is used to carry out DDoS attacks.

The HTA file downloads a spyware payload that steals logins from browsers and files from user folders to exfiltrate back to the C2 server. Additionally, the server hosted many credential phishing landing pages targeting various Nepalese government organizations. These pages leveraged the legitimate versions of login pages to load resources in order to make it appear more realistic. One of the most interesting pages was that created for a new target, the Election Commission of Nepal. This is noteworthy given recent news associated with the upcoming Nepalese elections.

This malware is written in Go and does not target any specific architectures or end devices, it simply brute forces any discovered Telnet services. The payload is delivered to a system via a malicious shell script. Once executed on a victim system it launches three functional modules: a propagation module, local HTTP service module, and a P2P module. The propagation module works by randomly generating IP addresses, identifying whether Telnet is open on that IP address, and, if so, brute forcing the service with a hardcoded list of usernames and passwords. The HTTP module starts an HTTP server on port 80 through which the payload can be obtained. The P2P module is the module capable of interacting with other botnet peers and executing commands. It is able to perform pings to each member of the botnet and issue updates to the peer list. Its UDP service component is used to receive and execute commands received from other peers. Available commands include those for restarting the bot, executing shell commands, and self destructing the device by wiping disk contents. An attack command is also present but does not contain any code, likely indicating the malware is still in development.

The researchers note that malware source code is written is such a way that other attackers are likely to use it as a starting point for their own malware. There are two primary aspects to the malware's functionality. First, it is able to install a reverse shell and telnet loader in order to create a backdoor for remote command execution.

The researchers note that malware source code is written is such a way that other attackers are likely to use it as a starting point for their own malware. There are two primary aspects to the malware's functionality. First, it is able to install a reverse shell and telnet loader in order to create a backdoor for remote command execution. The second part of the malware is the scanner and exploits allowing for the compromise of additional systems.

This stealer was first seen in June 2021 and is for sale on underground forums. The malware aims to steal credentials stored on the victim machine, as well as any cryptocurrency wallets. The most common method of distribution was spam email with the malware either attached or stored in a link. The actors are also paying for Google ads to push these malicious links to the top of Google search results. The researchers found the admin panel for the malware and were able to view stolen information. It seemed that the vast majority of the victims were in Canada.

This stealer was first seen in June 2021 and is for sale on underground forums. The malware aims to steal credentials stored on the victim machine, as well as any cryptocurrency wallets. The most common method of distribution was spam email with the malware either attached or stored in a link. The actors are also paying for Google ads to push these malicious links to the top of Google search results. The researchers found the admin panel for the malware and were able to view stolen information. It seemed that the vast majority of the victims were in Canada.

This APT group has been stealing sensitive documents from a number of government agencies within that area. Agencies affected include military, Ministries of Foreign Affairs, and private organizations. The group's method of initial attack appears to be through spear-phishing. Within the email, either an attachment or a malicious link begins the infection process. At the end of June, the group began using an exploit for Internet Explorer, CVE-2020-0968. In this case, the command and control server sent a malicious RTF instead of an archive attachment with a .LNK file. CVE-2020-0968 was patched by Microsoft in their April release. At least twice this year, the group sent out COVID-19 themed emails. A downloader called XDDown is the main malware component. Its job is to download additional modules and gain persistence through a Run key. Communication with the command and control server is through the HTTP protocol and modules downloaded are encrypted during transfer. Additional modules available for download are listed below.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Espionage\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nESET researchers disclose information about an espionage group, XDSpy, that has been operating in Eastern Europe and the Balkans since 2011. This APT group has been stealing sensitive documents from a number of government agencies within that area. Agencies affected include military, Ministries of Foreign Affairs, and private organizations. The group's method of initial attack appears to be through spear-phishing. Within the email, either an attachment or a malicious link begins the infection process. At the end of June, the group began using an exploit for Internet Explorer, CVE-2020-0968. In this case, the command and control server sent a malicious RTF instead of an archive attachment with a .LNK file. CVE-2020-0968 was patched by Microsoft in their April release. At least twice this year, the group sent out COVID-19 themed emails. A downloader called XDDown is the main malware component. Its job is to download additional modules and gain persistence through a Run key. Communication with the command and control server is through the HTTP protocol and modules downloaded are encrypted during transfer. Additional modules available for download are listed below. For full details, please refer to the URL in the Reference section below.\n\n# Modules\n\n  * XDRecon - retrieves system information\n  * XDList - searches C: for files of interest\n  * XDMonitor - searches removable drives for files of interest\n  * XDUpload - exfiltrates files and data to the command and control server\n  * XDLoc - exfiltrates SSIDs found\n  * XDPass - steals passwords from various applications\n\n\n\n# CVEs\n\n  * A complete list of CVEs can be found here: [ CVEs.txt](/download/attachments/32145605/Espionage%20Group%20XDSpy%20Undetected%20For%20Nine%20Years%20CVEs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1602017791119&api=v2)\n\n\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * A complete list of IoCs can be found here: [ IoCs.txt](/download/attachments/32145605/Espionage%20Group%20XDSpy%20Undetected%20For%20Nine%20Years%20IoCs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1602017721289&api=v2)\n\n\n\n# Protection\n\n## IBM\n\n  * CVE-2020-0968: Script_IE_Memory_Corruption_210\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n  * Exercise caution with attachments and links in emails.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/10/02/xdspy-stealing-government-secrets-since-2011/>"

Gootloader is a delivery mechanism for implanting REvil, Gootkit, Kronos, and Cobalt Strike.

The methodology proves adept at evading detection, however, the actual malicious activity associated with the loader and payloads are typically seen by detection systems and rules. The process of attacking is quite involved. The actors must maintain servers that host hacked, legitimate websites. Sophos estimates about 400 servers active at any one time. In one such instance, a medical site was hacked and serves real estate information. Through the use of a specific Google search term about real estate, the medical site was listed first in the results. Should a visitor click the link, they are presented with a page that answers the question stated in the search query. Within that page also exists a direct download link which contains the Gootloader malware initial infector. This is the only time during the process in which a file is written to the filesystem. From this point, everything done is run entirely in memory. Also of note is the loader's check of specific pieces of information the threat actors are targeting such as OS, language, and localization settings. The attacker may also be using IP geolocation for these purposes. As long as the IP address being targeted has not visited the requested site, the process is permitted to continue.

Three variants were released in May, Kekpop, Kekware, and YourCyanide. Trend Micro has published an analysis of YourCyanide that describes it as sophisticated. Its download routine includes the utilizing of Discord, Microsoft document links, and Pastebin. The first stage of the infection chain is an LNK file that contains PowerShell code that downloads and executes a file from Discord that in turn creates and executes a CMD file. The CMD file downloads and executes a heavily obfuscated CMD script from Pastebin. This file carries out a number of operations including creating a registry entry for persistence, attempting to add a user to the Administrators group, disabling Task Manager, terminating certain services and security applications, and enabling RDP. It also checks the machine for certain usernames used by malware researchers and sandbox systems that are to be avoided. YourCyanide can also move laterally by sending emails containing itself as an attachment and copying itself to other drives and directories. Several other files are also downloaded and executed throughout the attack. Of note, is that files are not encrypted and instead are just renamed. A ransom note is left on the system and the report also notes that all users in the compromised network may be messaged with a warning.

BlackTech is being tracked by IBM as Hive0090. Recently, they have been observed using a new piece of malware, called Gh0stTimes. This malware has been analyzed by researchers at JPCERT who found that it was an updated version of the existing remote access tool known as Gh0st RAT. This new variant has been used since 2020. In this variant, many functions remain the same, but Gh0stTimes has improved communications, more commands, and a control panel for controlling infected machines. Just as in the original malware, Gh0stTimes communicates with C2 servers using a custom protocol to obfuscate what is sent. However, the malware now exchanges encryption keys with the C2 server that it then uses to encrypt all further communications. Once the encryption is set up, the malware communicates pertinent host information to the C2 server which can be viewed in the control panel GUI. The new variant also contains dummy code to inhibit static analysis, which the researchers stated was ineffective. Once the malware has been installed, it can perform file operations, act as a remote shell, change C2 servers and act as a proxy for further attacks.

The researchers have seen this malware in use in attacks from 2020, and have analyzed it to understand the new functionality and impact it may have on victims.",
      "xfe_report": "# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Malware\n  *  **Associated Threat Actors** \\- BlackTech (G0098), Hive0090\n  *  **Targets:** Japanese Organisations, Technology\n  *  **Malware Family/Families:** Gh0st RAT (S0032), Gh0stTimes\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Unknown\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Unknown\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nThe threat group BlackTech has been operating since 2018 in east Asia, intending to steal technology from their targets. BlackTech is being tracked by IBM as Hive0090. Recently, they have been observed using a new piece of malware, called Gh0stTimes. This malware has been analyzed by researchers at JPCERT who found that it was an updated version of the existing remote access tool known as Gh0st RAT. This new variant has been used since 2020. In this variant, many functions remain the same, but Gh0stTimes has improved communications, more commands, and a control panel for controlling infected machines. Just as in the original malware, Gh0stTimes communicates with C2 servers using a custom protocol to obfuscate what is sent. However, the malware now exchanges encryption keys with the C2 server that it then uses to encrypt all further communications. Once the encryption is set up, the malware communicates pertinent host information to the C2 server which can be viewed in the control panel GUI. The new variant also contains dummy code to inhibit static analysis, which the researchers stated was ineffective. Once the malware has been installed, it can perform file operations, act as a remote shell, change C2 servers and act as a proxy for further attacks.

In the second quarter of 2021, a new variant was observed that has been rewritten in the Rust language. Buer is known to have been used to deliver a range of malware payloads including TrickBot and Ryuk. Buer's deployment options are configurable using its control panel. Since August 2019 and through to the second quarter of 2021, the majority of Buer detections have been in India (40%) and Israel (30%) with the most affected industry sectors being banking, healthcare, and telecommunications. Buer has typically been delivered through malicious documents attached to emails or via an exploit kit such as Fallout. To help avoid detection and make analysis more difficult, Buer uses multiple techniques including obfuscation, time-based evasion, dummy code loops, and checks for sandboxes and analysis tools. In 2021, the most commonly used theme in Buer campaigns was the ubiquitous COVID-19. Perhaps the most common payloads of Buer in 2021 were ransomware or Cobalt Strike.

In 2021, the most commonly used theme in Buer campaigns was the ubiquitous COVID-19. Perhaps the most common payloads of Buer in 2021 were ransomware or Cobalt Strike.

Nine Iranians associated with the Mabna Institute were indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2018 for a number of attacks on universities and companies, and the Mabna Institute was alleged to be a state sponsored operation. RiskIQ has identified a series of attacks against some twenty universities that occurred through the second half of this year. The TTPs used in the attacks are similar to those associated with the Mabna Institute attacks. RiskIQ notes that despite the similarities, they are insufficient to attribute the attacks to the Mabna Institute. RiskIQ has dubbed the actors behind the attacks as Shadow Academy. RiskIQ's investigation began when an attack against the Louisiana State University was identified. The attack consisted of a spoofed login page used by students. Domain shadowing, carried out by obtaining a domain's account credentials and using them to register subdomains, was used in the attack. In this case a subdomain was used to host the phishing pages. The objective of the attacks is to obtain sensitive information and conduct espionage operations. The universities targeted in the attacks were located in Afghanistan, Australia, the UK, and the USA. Other URLs used by Shadow Academy were aimed at credential and financial theft and targeted services such as online banking, Amazon, and Instagram. RiskIQ also identified another attack named Murrez who is believed to be associated with a group named W4coders, and may be a competitor to Shadow Academy.

The ransomware was discovered due to a hit on a Babuk payload signature. The reason it was detected as Babuk is because it was based on leaked Babuk source code. The Bitcoin address, actor email addresses, and ransomware name were edited for the actor's purpose, but the payload remained the same. McAfee notes that prior to leveraged leaked Babuk code, the actor attempted to write their own ransomware but it was simple and easy to analyze. Investigating domains contacted by the payload led to the discovery of an open directory containing additional tools, such as scripts for defense evasion and privilege escalation. Further pivoting on the network infrastructure led to what is likely the initial infection vector, fake Flash and AnyDesk installers, along with an exfiltration tool and other payloads.

      "xfe_q": "Delta Plus Ransomware\nWhile investigating smaller ransomware actors, McAfee researchers uncovered an actor distributing a ransomware payload dubbed \"Delta Plus.\"",
      "xfe_report": "# Threat Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Ransomware\n  *  **Targets:** Unknown\n  *  **Ransomware Family:** Delta Plus\n  *  **RaaS Operation:** No\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Fake application installers\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Data Encryption, Data Theft\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nMcAfee published a blog post analyzing the Delta Plus ransomware as a part of an investigation into small ransomware actors. The ransomware was discovered due to a hit on a Babuk payload signature. The reason it was detected as Babuk is because it was based on leaked Babuk source code. The Bitcoin address, actor email addresses, and ransomware name were edited for the actor's purpose, but the payload remained the same. McAfee notes that prior to leveraged leaked Babuk code, the actor attempted to write their own ransomware but it was simple and easy to analyze. Investigating domains contacted by the payload led to the discovery of an open directory containing additional tools, such as scripts for defense evasion and privilege escalation. Further pivoting on the network infrastructure led to what is likely the initial infection vector, fake Flash and AnyDesk installers, along with an exfiltration tool and other payloads. For more information, see the McAfee blog post in the Reference section.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * A complete list of IoCs can be found here: [

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nSilver Sparrow is macOS malware, two versions of which have been analysed by Red Canary. The first version surfaced in August 2020, the second version appearing a month later. Both versions contained Mach-O binaries. However, the Mach-O binary in the second version is compiled for the Intel x86_64 and M1 ARM64 architectures. Silver Sparrow has been distributed using malvertising with links that lead to malicious DMG or PKG installers. Between them, the two versions of Silver Sparrow are reported to have infected almost 30,000 systems. Once installed, Silver Sparrow contacts its C&C every hour. As of yet, no actual payload is known to have been delivered to the infected systems. Silver Sparrow can completely remove itself from infected systems. While the actual purpose of Silver Sparrow is unknown, and there is no current payload, the operators of Silver Sparrow could issue instructions to the malware at a time of their choosing.

Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Trojan\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nApplications on the Google Play store have become targets for threat actors to implant their wares. Cerberus is a banking Trojan that has been found within numerous applications located on the store. Using machine learning algorithms, detection of these applications began as early as February 2020 with the most recent being found mere days ago. Popularity amongst these applications ranges from little to the most popular having more than 10,000 downloads. The applications in question usually contain at least part of the functionality expected. Behind the scenes, these applications communicate with C2 servers and, provided they meet prerequisites, download malicious APKs. In order to perform its intended actions, the application requests administrative rights from the victim. If approved, the application will install the payload and use the admin rights to enable the malicious actions. Several items of interest are communicated back to C2 servers including country, package name, build release, and build model. A token is sent to the app and is used for all future communication with the C2 server. The applications delivered are based on the parameters provided in the vetting process. This makes tracing the applications more difficult. Once the app is successfully installed and the subsequent payload downloaded, the first app is no longer used for malicious actions. Given that the apps have been given administrative permissions, they interact with malicious applications in the Cerberus family and perform the typical Cerberus actions. It is at this point that the malware has full control of the device, making it especially disconcerting to security professionals. At present, there are two different versions of the malware. The first is less obfuscated and uses Base64 encryption. Communication was simpler and lacked the registration process seen in version 2. The second version uses different obfuscation techniques and contains very little of the debugging information from version 1. Additionally, communication is more advanced, which allows for more precise control of the payload and its installation. Further hindering investigations is the use of several developer accounts with a vague pattern emerging in the email addresses. Droppers are mainly located in Europe and specifically Spain.

Earlier this year, the owners of this malware commented that they were shutting down operations and putting the source code up for sale. Less than two weeks after this statement, Phorpiex reappeared with some new functionality. It is unclear whether it was sold and redeveloped or if the original threat actors decided to continue development. The main difference was that this new variant was able to function without any C2 servers, operating in a peer-to-peer mode to communicate with other infected machines. The malware also appears to be more successful at using the crypto-stealing technique known as crypto-clipping. This technique replaces any copied cryptocurrency address with the attacker's wallet when pasted. Since the addresses are long and random, the victim doesn't notice the replacement and authorizes the payment to the victim's wallet. The total value of currency stolen this way is almost half a million dollars, with the largest single transaction totaling 26 Etherium. The malware also has a new method for communicating with the C2 server. It uses a custom, encrypted protocol which uses a hash value to guarantee message integrity, which is more sophisticated than the original malware used. This new variant is called 'Twizt' and is steadily increasing in prevalence with most infections occurring in African countries. There is some evidence the operators of this malware are Ukrainian, as the malware will not run on machines in Ukraine.

    "output": "\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, APT, Espionage, RAT\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nProofpoint has published their analysis of recent activity being carried out by TA413. The first campaign they report on targeted European diplomatic and legislative bodies, non-profit policy research organizations, and global organizations dealing with economic affairs, which is not the usual target of this group. However, infrastructure and TTP overlaps allow for attribution to the APT. These targets received COVID-19 themed phishing emails with weaponsized RTF documents. An RTF exploit is used to drop a WMF file, which, in turn, drops and installs the Sepulcher malware. The WMF file is also responsible for setting up persistence via a scheduled task. The second campaign was aimed towards the group's more common target, the Tibetan community. Once again, infrastructure and TTPs from older TA413 campaigns were leveraged in this campaign. The initial attachment, however, was a malicious PPTX attachment that downloads the Sepulcher malware from a remote server and executes it. Upon execution, the Sepulcher malware reaches out to its C2 server, which is defined in a configuration saved to the Registry. After initial communication is established, Sepulcher provides basic RAT functionality to the operator. This includes capabilities such as file operations, reconnaissance, spawning a shell, and interacting with services and processes.
