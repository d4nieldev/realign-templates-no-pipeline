A handful of samples were obtained and it was determined the VBA code will use either PowerShell or ActiveX to download the payload. These payloads are hosted on various websites. There is a common pattern to the second stage downloader. The stage 2 EXE loads a DLL. This DLL extracts and decodes steganography encoded images from the EXE. Finally, the DLL loads the stage 3 EXE.

These capabilities were mainly related to evasion tactics to avoid detection from web application firewalls and IDS systems. First verifiable usage of the new version came in March 2020 on a compromised website. Other changes included a different packer/obfuscator and the addition of random ASCII characters, which makes the PHP code difficult to read without proper editing tools.

Like most ransomware, the infection chain begins with processes that could interfere with encryption being killed. Zeoticus also covers its track by deleting its own binaries using the ping utility. As with previous versions, persistence continues to be established via a Registry Run key.

The entire attack took about 5 hours to complete. Initially, a phishing email with an attached password-protected ZIP file is used as a lure. The ZIP file is actually a macro-infected Word document. The document downloads the IcedID Trojan from a malicious URL. IcedID uses steganography to deliver the payload by using a PNG file. Once decrypted, the payload is injected into memory and persistence is accomplished via a scheduled task that runs hourly by using regsvr32.exe to execute the malicious DLL. Once Cobalt Strike is deployed, it attempts to connect to the C2 server. This step then collects machine information and moves laterally.

This malware is being spread through websites that are pretending to be legitimate sites for Commerzbank, a major bank in Germany. A number of these false sites were registered to the same IP address, and where the user can download a false banking app. The application, titled 'Commerzbank Security', requests 21 different permissions. These include dangerous permissions, such as 'REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES' which allows the threat actor to install applications without user interaction. With these permissions granted, Hydra can steal contact details, steal credentials, spy on user activities, and send bulk SMSs to the victim's contacts. The original variant of this malware behaved like a normal Banking bot by creating an overlay on targeted apps to capture input. The variant seen in this campaign has additional capabilities. One new piece of functionality is the ability to provide the attacker a TeamViewer style view of the screen by abusing the Accessibility feature to cast the screen and allow the attacker to interact with it. Another unique feature of this variant is that it uses TOR as a proxy, which hosts the C2 URL encoded in Base64. This campaign is one of an increasing number noted by the Cyble researchers, as the COVID19 pandemic has forced more users to interact with their banks solely online, opening them up to falling for the phishing domains and becoming infected.

The EwDoor malware attempts to exploit a vulnerability (CVE-2017-6079) in Edgewater Edgemarc devices, specifically in this campaign, the EdgeMarc Enterprise Session Border Controller. The vulnerability, which was patched in 2017, could allow a remote attacker, using default credentials, to obtain root access to an affected device. According to Netlab's report, at one point there were just under 6K infections, all of which were on devices using AT&T IP addresses and located in the United States. Netlab notes the use of an unusual command in the EwDoor payload that is used to mount a filesystem. Once access has been gained to a device and the payload delivered, the victim's device info is sent to a C&C server and it joins the botnet. The infected devices can be used as botnet clients in DDoS attacks and the attackers can gather sensitive data from the infected devices. The addresses and port numbers for EwDoor C&C servers are obtained from BitTorrent trackers using one of two methods. Once the C&C details have been obtained EwDoor will then begin communicating with the C&C server.

The target was a product safety testing organization, meaning that a lot of IP was at risk of being stolen or destroyed.",
    "context": "",
    "output": "\nSummary\n=======\n\n\n\nAttack Details\n==============\n\n* **Threat Type:** Ransomware\n* **Targets:** Product safety testing organization\n* **Malware Family/Families:** Hello, Mimikatz (S0002), Cobalt Strike (S0154)\n* **Initial Infection Vector:** Vulnerable SharePoint server\n* **Post-Compromise Actions:**Domain reconnaissance\n\nOverview\n========\n\nResearchers at eSentire have disrupted a potential ransomware attack targeting a product safety testing company that they have attributed to the Chinese espionage group known as Emissary Panda or APT27. IBM X-Force tracks APT27 as Hive0006. It is speculated that this could be part of a false flag campaign as the attack uses many public tools and techniques that are of perceived low quality, but it could be the case that this attack was being used to mask the attacker's true activities in the network. In this attack, initial access was obtained by exploiting a vulnerable Sharepoint server. This has been observed in previous attacks by APT27, and so supports the theory that they may be the perpetrators of the attack. Once access had been gained, they used PowerShell to download and launch a Cobalt Strike beacon, disguising the execution as a Kaspersky service to bypass security controls via application allowlists. After this, the attackers attempted to escalate privileges before attempting to disable security monitoring using another PowerShell call. Finally, Mimikatz was used to configure the system to capture credentials from future logins. Once this was established, some post-compromise domain reconnaissance was observed before the attack was disrupted.

      "xfe_q": "APT27 Ransomware Attack Disrupted\nAn attack in progress was disrupted by researchers at eSentire, using many TTPs that suggest that this was meant to be a ransomware attack by the China-based group APT27. The target was a product safety testing organization, meaning that a lot of IP was at risk of being stolen or destroyed.",
      "xfe_report": "Summary\n=======\n\n\n\nAttack Details\n==============\n\n* **Threat Type:** Ransomware\n* **Targets:** Product safety testing organization\n* **Malware Family/Families:** Hello, Mimikatz (S0002), Cobalt Strike (S0154)\n* **Initial Infection Vector:** Vulnerable SharePoint server\n* **Post-Compromise Actions:**Domain reconnaissance\n\nOverview\n========\n\nResearchers at eSentire have disrupted a potential ransomware attack targeting a product safety testing company that they have attributed to the Chinese espionage group known as Emissary Panda or APT27. IBM X-Force tracks APT27 as Hive0006. It is speculated that this could be part of a false flag campaign as the attack uses many public tools and techniques that are of perceived low quality, but it could be the case that this attack was being used to mask the attacker's true activities in the network. In this attack, initial access was obtained by exploiting a vulnerable Sharepoint server. This has been observed in previous attacks by APT27, and so supports the theory that they may be the perpetrators of the attack. Once access had been gained, they used PowerShell to download and launch a Cobalt Strike beacon, disguising the execution as a Kaspersky service to bypass security controls via application allowlists. After this, the attackers attempted to escalate privileges before attempting to disable security monitoring using another PowerShell call. Finally, Mimikatz was used to configure the system to capture credentials from future logins. Once this was established, some post-compromise domain reconnaissance was observed before the attack was disrupted. Although no ransomware was deployed here, all of this behavior is consistent with previous Hello ransomware attacks that have been attributed to China-based actors.

Purchase devices with a vendor and/or mobile carrier commitment to provide security updates in a prompt manner for a set period of time. Decommission devices that will no longer receive security updates. Limit or block access to enterprise resources from devices that have not installed recent security updates.

Enterprises can inspect applications themselves or use a third-party service. Enterprises may impose policies to only allow pre-approved applications to be installed on their devices or may impose policies to block use of specific applications known to have issues.

Purchase devices with a vendor and/or mobile carrier commitment to provide security updates in a prompt manner for a set period of time. Decommission devices that will no longer receive security updates. Limit or block access to enterprise resources from devices that have not installed recent security updates. On Android devices, access can be controlled based on each device's security patch level. On iOS devices, access can be controlled based on the iOS version.  \n **M1005:** Application Vetting - Enterprises can vet applications for exploitable vulnerabilities or unwanted (privacy-invasive or malicious) behaviors. Enterprises can inspect applications themselves or use a third-party service. Enterprises may impose policies to only allow pre-approved applications to be installed on their devices or may impose policies to block use of specific applications known to have issues. In Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) environments, enterprises may only be able to impose these policies over an enterprise-managed portion of the device. Application Vetting is not a complete mitigation. Techniques such as Evade Analysis Environment exist that can enable adversaries to bypass vetting.  \n **M1006:** Use Recent OS Version - New mobile operating system versions bring not only patches against discovered vulnerabilities but also often bring security architecture improvements that provide resilience against potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that have not yet been discovered. They may also bring improvements that block use of observed adversary techniques.  \n **M1011:** User Guidance - Describes any guidance or training given to users to set particular configuration settings or avoid specific potentially risky behaviors.  \n **M1012:** Enterprise Policy - An enterprise mobility management (EMM), also known as mobile device management (MDM), system can be used to provision policies to mobile devices to control aspects of their allowed behavior."

This threat group is known to target organizations in the energy and telecommunication sectors located in the Middle East. The group has been using a .NET-based backdoor which is a modified version of the open-source tool, DIG.net. The modifications allow the backdoor to use DNS Hijacking to provide the backdoor's C&C communications. The backdoor uses DNS queries to a DNS server under the control of the attackers and the server's responses provide commands for the backdoor to carry out. In the campaign observed by Zscaler, the backdoor is delivered via a malicious Word document that uses the AutoOpen() and AutoClose() functions to drop the embedded backdoor onto the system. The backdoor, named \"DnsSystem\" is also copied to the system's startup folder to achieve persistence.

Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Phishing, Ransomware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nA new Russian threat group is wreaking havoc on various Russian industries. Using a variety of techniques, the group seeks to phish credentials, implant malware, and deploy ransomware. The group is made up of Russian speakers who break the untold rule of not working within Russia and post-Soviet countries. Impersonating regulatory organizations, a metallurgical company, an industrial plant, a dental clinic, and media holdings company, the group uses a variety of techniques to infiltrate these and other industries within Russia. The first attack was against a large medical company using a phishing email claiming to be from the media holding company. Upon opening of the phishing email, a custom malware called TinyNode is installed. This malware is used as a backdoor and to load additional malware. The group performs reconnaissance, collection of data, and propagation. Additionally, the group uses Cobalt Strike to ensure post-exploitation is effective. The group moves laterally in an effort to obtain domain administrator credentials as well as creates a new account with privileges to perform administrative actions in case the original account is deleted or blocked. A backup of the data was unsuccessful as it was later revealed the attackers had deleted the organization's backups. Within hours, the ransomware TinyCryptor was spread throughout the network. A note of interest is each campaign uses a different email address. A demand of $50,000 worth of cryptocurrency was made in exchange for decrypting the encrypted files. The group was first observed between late-March and early-April. The group used a custom Trojan called TinyPosh. After a two week break, the group changed tactics and employed a fake email from a journalist to take part in research activities. The email used proper grammar as well as imitating the media's holding style. The fake journalist offered a 30-minute interview and uploaded questions to the cloud. Upon clicking the link, the TinyPosh Trojan was downloaded to a victim's computer. Persistence was set and the privileges of the account were obtained. Additionally, Cobalt Strike Beacon was launched and, in order to hide the actual C2 address, the group used a Cloudflare Workers server. The group took a hiatus until August 2020 when two large-scales campaigns were launched using the Russian media holding company as a front. Within days, the decoy email was edited to address protests in Belarus. Using several themes the group continued to launch TinyPosh backdoor attacks. These emails contained malicious emails with malicious ZIP files attached.

The OLX is similar to eBay. VMRay named the kit due to a Telegram user name they located within the kit's server-side code. The kit is used to create a fake payment confirmation website for an item listed for sale on the OLX. The seller is then advised that their item has been sold, and they are provided the link to the fake payment site through which they can receive their payment. The fake site asks for the victim's credit card information and then attempts to match the bank that the credit card belongs to. The kit contains templates for seven banks, plus a generic template for other banks, and directs the victim to a fake bank login page. The kit also requests the victim's SMS 2FA verification code.

The OLX is similar to eBay. VMRay named the kit due to a Telegram user name they located within the kit's server-side code. The kit is used to create a fake payment confirmation website for an item listed for sale on the OLX. The seller is then advised that their item has been sold, and they are provided the link to the fake payment site through which they can receive their payment. The fake site asks for the victim's credit card information and then attempts to match the bank that the credit card belongs to. The kit contains templates for seven banks, plus a generic template for other banks, and directs the victim to a fake bank login page. The kit also requests the victim's SMS 2FA verification code. All the information collected by the kit is sent to Telegram chats. Further information is available from the VMRay report linked in the Reference section below.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * A complete list of IoCs can be found here: [ IoCs.txt](/download/attachments/61374574/The%20Blackhat_Coder%20Phishing%20Kit%20IoCs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1629177189725&api=v2)\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Use anti-virus software and ensure software and associated files are up to date (M1049).\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs (M1031, M1035, M1037).\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level (M1051).\n  * Train users to identify social engineering techniques and phishing emails (M1017).\n  * Restrict Web-Based Content (M1021).\n\n\n\n# References\n\n  * <https://www.vmray.com/cyber-security-blog/blackhatcoder-phishing-kit-malware-analysis-spotlight/>"

Additionally, a PowerShell script is available [here](https://blog.truesec.com/2021/06/30/fix-for-printnightmare-cve-2021-1675-exploit-to-keep-your-print-servers-running-while-a-patch-is-not-available/) that will implement ACL restrictions for the system print spooler. The aforementioned script was not developed by IBM X-Force and should be run at your own risk. Further information will be made available as it is disclosed.\n\n# CVEs\n\n  * CVE-2021-1675\n\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Review the source article for full details.\n\n  * Apply applicable patches, updates, or workarounds as necessary.\n\n  * Disable Microsoft Print Spooler service\n  * Restrict the ACLs on the \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers\" directory to prevent malicious DLLs from being introduced to the print spooler service (PowerShell Script available [here](https://blog.truesec.com/2021/06/30/fix-for-printnightmare-cve-2021-1675-exploit-to-keep-your-print-servers-running-while-a-patch-is-not-available/)).\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/383432>\n\n  * <https://blog.truesec.com/2021/06/30/fix-for-printnightmare-cve-2021-1675-exploit-to-keep-your-print-servers-running-while-a-patch-is-not-available/>\n  * <https://msandbu.org/printnightmare-cve-2021-1675/>\n  * <https://community.ibm.com/community/user/security/blogs/gladys-koskas1/2021/07/01/printnightmare-critical-windows-print-spooler-vuln>"

According to a report from Group-IB, the most active campaign Prometheus has been used in targeted individuals in Belgium. The second most active campaign targeted government organizations and companies involved in the banking, cybersecurity, education, energy, finance, healthcare, insurance, IT, mining, and retail sectors, in the United States. Prometheus TDS provides the operator an administration panel that allows them to configure the parameters for a campaign, including features such as filtering potential victims based on browser version, geolocation, and operating system. Compromised websites that are hosting a PHP file named Prometheus.Backdoor are used as intermediaries between the operator's administration panel and the victim. A victim first receives a malspam email that contains either an HTML file or links which lead the victim to either a compromised server with the Prometheus.Backdoor installed or to a Google Doc which contains a malicious link. Victims end up being directed to a Prometheus.Backdoor server that collects the user's data and passes it to the administration panel where checks such as geolocation are carried out. A victim will then be redirected to another URL, or a file will be sent directly to the victim. The files are typically Word or Excel documents, and ZIP or RAR archives. The malware that has been deployed in the campaigns includes Campo Loader, Hancitor, QBot, IcedID, Buer Loader, SocGholish, and some unidentified VBS Loaders. Further payloads including Cobalt Strike, Ficker Stealer, Send-Safe, TrickBot, and Ursnif, have also been downloaded. Prometheus TDS campaigns have also been observed directing victims to sites selling pharmaceutical products, and banking phishing sites. A Prometheus TDS subscription costs $250 per month. While investigating infrastructure that had hosted the Prometheus TDS administration panels, Group-IB observed that in some cases it had been replaced with another MaaS offering named BRChecker.

The second is an executable file that decrypts the PowerShell script and installs it as a scheduled task which runs every ten minutes. The executable also shows an error message to the user to trick them into thinking the installation of their pirated software failed. The chrome extension is highly obfuscated and seems to be serving advertisements to victims, which are fetched from the C2 server every thirty minutes. The malware also hijacks search requests made to popular search engines. Evert three hours, metrics on the user's activity are sent to the C2 server.

This year also marks a change in its delivery methods to include exploits, Covid-19 phishing campaigns, and advanced steganography. Additionally, innovative obfuscation techniques have been added to its arsenal. The spearphishing method is based on an RFQ (Request for Quote) order sent to employees who routinely process such requests. Even when the malicious email was quarantined by protection systems, some employees actually pulled it out of quarantine because they were convinced of its legitimacy. Such RFQ attachments are a known DDE exploit that pulls the next stage of infection from the malware's command and control server when opened. Two Equation Editor exploits, CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802, are also part of the infection chain. Successfully exploited, a small, obfuscated loader is downloaded and executed. This loader makes use of steganography by hiding the next stage in a PNG image to execute a second loader. This second loader is injected into a legitimate RegAsm application.

Ranzy will encrypt multiple file types while avoiding encrypting system files. Like many ransomware families, Ranzy will delete shadow copies and modifies boot options.

In addition to the malware, the compromise tool is being promoted on a Facebook group along with a tutorial video. The malware, however, is distributed with a backdoor installer that allows the authors access to other bad actor's computer systems. The code is obfuscated using differing layers and code checks. Deobfuscation is not an easy feat as it's not just text that is encoded and compressed. Upon deobfuscation of the code, the symchanger.php name is seen. Cross-contamination is accomplished via a popular symlink method so long as the site is hosted by the same user as the compromised website. A tool is used to search for configuration files for various website publication platforms such as WordPress and others. If detected, a .txt file is generated so the file can be downloaded. If /etc/passwd is accessible, the file is read and a list of existing users is gathered. A loop is then used to run the list of users from passwd against the various publication system's configuration files to extract the matching credentials. The malware then reads SQL connection information and connects to the associated database, where it adds a malicious administrative user to any databases to which it can successfully connect. Once the script has finished, the results are displayed to the threat actor. Without deobfuscation, the malware appears to be what the attacker claims it to be. The malware sends five emails to multiple addresses which contain sensitive data for the compromised website(s).

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nSymchanger malware is a \"free\" malware being distributed by bad to other bad actors under the guise of free malware. In addition to the malware, the compromise tool is being promoted on a Facebook group along with a tutorial video. The malware, however, is distributed with a backdoor installer that allows the authors access to other bad actor's computer systems. The code is obfuscated using differing layers and code checks. Deobfuscation is not an easy feat as it's not just text that is encoded and compressed. Upon deobfuscation of the code, the symchanger.php name is seen. Cross-contamination is accomplished via a popular symlink method so long as the site is hosted by the same user as the compromised website. A tool is used to search for configuration files for various website publication platforms such as WordPress and others. If detected, a .txt file is generated so the file can be downloaded. If /etc/passwd is accessible, the file is read and a list of existing users is gathered. A loop is then used to run the list of users from passwd against the various publication system's configuration files to extract the matching credentials. The malware then reads SQL connection information and connects to the associated database, where it adds a malicious administrative user to any databases to which it can successfully connect. Once the script has finished, the results are displayed to the threat actor. Without deobfuscation, the malware appears to be what the attacker claims it to be. The malware sends five emails to multiple addresses which contain sensitive data for the compromised website(s).

The group has been using cloud services, such as OneDrive for data exfiltration and C2 operations. They also use a series of custom implants which are called CreepyDrive and CreepyBox. CreepyDrive is a basic implant allowing for the upload and download of files and appears to have no persistence mechanism. Beyond the custom tools, they also use commodity tools such as plink to set up a tunnel to the attacker infrastructure.

Aside from the aforementioned phishing, PhoneSpy can also list the apps installed on the device, steal documents, images, contacts, call logs, and SMS messages. It can also take photos and record real-time video and audio using the device's camera, and provide the PhoneSpy operators with the device's GPS location, and remote control of the device.

If successfully exploited, an unauthenticated attacker on the network could execute an HTTP API method bypassing authentication. This could be used to cause a denial-of-service condition in some cases.\n\nICSA-20-324-02 addresses two buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Paradox IP150 devices. The first, a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability, if successfully exploited, could allow an unauthenticated attacker to perform remote code execution. The second is a classic buffer overflow vulnerability that could allow an authenticated attacker to remotely execute code.\n\nICSA-20-324-03 addresses a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Real Time Automation EtherNet/IP source code. Potential impacts, if successfully exploited, include denial-of-service and remote code execution.\n\nICSA-20-324-04 addresses nine vulnerabilities in Schneider Electric Interactive Graphical SCADA System (IGSS).

Able Desktop is widely used by Mongolian government agencies. Beginning around December in 2017, Trojanized installers were used to deliver the malware. The report further notes that Able's update system was probably compromised and also used to deliver malware. The malware included a backdoor named HyperBro and two RATs, Korplug (PlugX) and Tmanger.

The Trojanized installers were used to deliver HyperBro or Korplug. The group known as LuckyMouse appear to be behind the campaign. LuckyMouse is a Chinese threat group and is also known by several other names including APT27, Bronze Union, Emissary Panda, Hippo, Iodine, Iron Tiger, and TG-3390. IBM X-Force tracks LuckyMouse as Hive0006. ESET also discovered relationships between LuckyMouse and TA428 due to one of the Tmanger C&C server addresses also being used by the ShadowPad backdoor.

Bandook is a thirteen year old backdoor Trojan. Bandook was used in a 2015 campaign called \"Operation Manul\u201d and in a 2017 campaign called \"Dark Caracal\u201c. Supposedly, these campaigns had been carried out by the Kazakh and the Lebanese governments. In 2020, Check Point has seen dozens of digitally signed variants of Bandook. The infection chain of the attack is constantly evolving, so Check Point selected one from July. This version starts with a ZIP file attachment that contains a weaponized Microsoft Word document. Upon opening, the malicious macros begin their work by dropping the second stage of the attack. There is an encrypted PowerShell script inside the Word document that downloads and executes the Bandook backdoor. The version of Bandook examined had only eleven commands as opposed to more than a hundred commands found in other versions of Bandook. Sectors targeted by this Bandook include government, financial, energy, food industry, healthcare, education, IT and legal institutions. Countries targeted include Singapore, Cyprus, Chile, Italy, USA, Turkey, Switzerland, Indonesia and Germany.

Mobile provides cellular plans that piggyback on major networks for a discounted cost to consumers. Malwarebytes reports on their discovery of an injection to the provider's website with a one-line code containing a Base64-encoded URL, which then loads a JavaScript library. The code loads a Google analytics script taken from another fake website mimicking PayPal. The code is a card skimmer checking for input fields from which to exfiltrate entered data.

Researchers at the Bitdefender Antispam Lab noticed singular tactics integrating social engineering and phishing techniques. Furthermore, researchers uncovered several phishing attempts associated with the campaign from banks world-wide like Bank of America, Standard Bank, Wells Fargo, La Banque Postale, and HSBC Bank, as well as the money transaction services PayPal and Western Union. According to researchers, the most intriguing of all phishing attacks is the one involving the La Banque Postale, where 97.69% of incoming emails associated with the bank were marked as spam.

Researchers at the Bitdefender Antispam Lab noticed singular tactics integrating social engineering and phishing techniques. Furthermore, researchers uncovered several phishing attempts associated with the campaign from banks world-wide like Bank of America, Standard Bank, Wells Fargo, La Banque Postale, and HSBC Bank, as well as the money transaction services PayPal and Western Union. According to researchers, the most intriguing of all phishing attacks is the one involving the La Banque Postale, where 97.69% of incoming emails associated with the bank were marked as spam. Scammers attempted to dupe the end-user into accessing a malicious link, allowing them to listen in on communications received from the bank.

The investigation suggested the firewall was compromised via the internet-exposed User Portal component.\u00a0 Researchers identified suspicious and repeated access targeting a valid JSP file (login.JSP). Further analysis of the firewall revealed that the threat actor established a webshell backdoor through modification of a legitimate component file. The threat actor utilized this webshell in order to establish multiple VPN user accounts and associated certificate pairs for legitimate network access persistence. The attacker also modified specific DNS responses on the compromised device to conduct Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks targeting hostnames, which belonged to the victim organization.\n\nThe MITM attacks allowed the attacker to conduct credential and session cookie theft from administrative access to the websites' content management systems (CMS). Veloxity's investigation identified multiple instances of successful access, via legitimate session cookies, to the client's CMS admin pages attributed to the attacker. These sessions were used to upload a variation of the Weevely webshell. These webshells then were used to upload additional malware.

The name is short for \"Silently running Facebook ADs with Exploits\".",
    "context": "",
    "output": "\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nFacebook researchers believe that malware named SilentFade, and the creators and operators of it, came onto the scene in early 2016. Since then, the SilentFade malware has been consistently improved with additional features and has been expanded to target other social networks and services. SilentFade is typically installed through a downloader that is bundled with pirated software. There are usually three or four components, including the downloader, that make up the SilentFade package. The downloader installs the payload as either a standalone component, or as a Windows service. Successfully installed, SilentFade will obtain the victim's Facebook credentials along with cookies from various browsers.

Since then, the SilentFade malware has been consistently improved with additional features and has been expanded to target other social networks and services. SilentFade is typically installed through a downloader that is bundled with pirated software. There are usually three or four components, including the downloader, that make up the SilentFade package. The downloader installs the payload as either a standalone component, or as a Windows service. Successfully installed, SilentFade will obtain the victim's Facebook credentials along with cookies from various browsers.

Operating continuously since 2007, Gozi has infected millions of machines and done untold damage to all types of industries and users. At its core, Gozi variants carry similar traits across the board. Some of the similarities between versions are strings contained within the binary's .bss section, man-in-the-browser attack, specific C2 check-in format, obfuscation of the C2 check-in, keylogging, email, FTP, IM accounts data and certificate grabbing, among others. Some of the specific strains carry differences that could easily be overlooked as most of the functionality of the RAT remains the same across the board. Goziat, an older variant, makes use of built-in Windows utilities and uses a different resource directory instead of the standard \"images\" directory. This can be configured during the build phase. Additionally, this variant typically targets .at top-level domains. Another variant, Gozi2RM3 or Gozi IAP2.0, has changes to the C2 structure. Communication is set in two stages. Stage 1 contains a hardcoded C2 in the initial infection binary. An ISP/geolocation deny list is also employed to pre-filter connections that could be researchers. Once the first stage is passed, the second stage pushes the main payload and true configuration. There appears to be a connection between Goziat and Gozi2RM3. Both variants use additional encryption steps by adding a serpent key in addition to the server's RSA key. Goziv3 RM3 targets mostly Australia, Italy, and the U.S. Some significant differences between this version include the use of a PX format, WD structure as opposed to Joined Resources (JJ), a word list is kept in one of the WD structs for generation of registry key names, the use of forfiles.exe for APC injection, and the communications method uses the request body instead of the URI for check-in. As with Gozi2RM3, a geofencing solution is in place. This particular variant has been bundled with a loader used by Emotet and Dridex. There are several variants of Gozi which have become unused. These include Dreambot, Saigon, and ISFB3/Ursnif-A.

A Check Point report which provides an analysis of the attacks notes that malicious executables were used to trigger the playing of the videos or audio files. In addition, wiper malware was used in the attacks in an effort to disrupt the state broadcasting networks.

Initial infection is accomplished through said phishing email, which contains a Google document link, presumably, from the TrickBot gang. This link leads to the Bazar backdoor as well as the Buer loader. Trickbot has previously used different botnets, including Emotet, for the carrying out of its mission. Unlike most phishing emails, this contains no attachments, only a link to the aforementioned Google documents links. The body of the email states the recipient has been terminated and a link to the termination reasoning is included. In one such email, the reason for termination was positional redundancy. The link actually redirects to a URL used to download the malware payload. Most of the cases analyzed were instances where Bazar malware was downloaded; however, in some cases Buer loader was used. The packer for both is identical. The packed binaries contain an export function that is responsible for decryption and injection. First, a shell is deployed to decrypt a leaderless PE loader which contains the final payload. Using memory allocation, the payload is mapped into memory, given permissions, and transfers control. No self-injection is used. The Bazar backdoor is new malware and is part of TrickBot's toolkit. This is reserved for almost exclusively high profile targets. The Bazar loader is used to download and execute the backdoor, which, in turn, is used to execute binaries, scripts, modules, kill processes, and self removal. Control flow is obfuscated to hinder analysis. The Bazar loader is used to download the backdoor from a C2 using a URI format. This download was captured and analyzed. As with other Trickbot certificates, the certificates for Bazar were created in the same manner. It was also seen that the backdoor downloaded and executed the Cobalt Strike pentesting and post-exploit toolkit. It is hypothesized this is done so ransomware could be deployed, data stolen, or network access could be sold. Buer loader is sold on Russian underground forums.

The first uses a security alert theme combined with an attached HTML form. The form attempts to gather as much information as possible, including account login details, credit card and account numbers, contact information, and personally identifiable information (PII), such as social security numbers and date of birth. The second campaign instead claims the user can get a gift card in exchange for participating in a survey. A link in the email takes users to the fake survey, which requests contact information and credit card details. For more information, see the Bitdefender blog post in the Reference section.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Exercise caution with attachments and links in emails.\n  * Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://www.bitdefender.com/blog/hotforsecurity/watch-out-for-these-ongoing-bank-of-america-phishing-campaigns-targeting-customers-in-the-us>"

The initial compromise is via a Microsoft Word document attached to the phishing emails.

Once SVCReady is executed it collects certain system information and sends it to the C&C server using HTTP.\u00a0 Initially, the C&C communications were unencrypted but in May, SVCReady began using RC4 to encrypt them. The malware then sets a registry key used to provide persistence but due to an apparent coding error, the malware does not execute after a system reboot. SVCReady then collects the same system information again but this time also includes a screenshot and sends it to the C&C server.

TunnelVision, an Iranian-aligned threat actor operating in the Middle East and United States, is known for their use of 1-day vulnerability exploits and tunneling tools. In recent cases, they have used the Log4Shell exploit to target VMware Horizon servers. The exploit is used to execute PowerShell commands that will download files and return command outputs via a webhook. The group additionally uses PowerShell reverse shells to perform further post-compromise actions. Two different reverse shells were identified that ultimately provided backdoor access, allowing TunnelVision to execute recon commands, add a backdoor user, harvest credentials, tunnel RDP traffic, and deploy further reverse shells. The researchers noted an overlap between this group and those called Phosphorus by Microsoft and Charming Kitten or Nemesis Kitten by CrowdStrike.

Proofpoint attributes the campaigns to a threat group they refer to as TA402 who is also known as Molerats and the Gaza Cybergang. IBM X-Force tracks the activities of the group using the identifier Hive0022. The threat group is believed to be Arabic-speaking, politically motivated, and acting in the interests of the Palestinian Territories. The campaigns typically began with phishing emails that contained links that, in two of the three analyzed cases, led to a host that used geolocation to redirect connections that did not originate from the target countries to a news site. Of the two examples that used the redirection based on geolocation, one used a website masquerading as Quora on an attacker-controlled domain, and the other involved an actor-controlled domain and WordPress site that carried out the redirections. In the third case, the group was using Dropbox to host the malicious files but were unable to conduct the geolocation redirection due to not having control of the domain. Dropbox was also used for C&C services in some cases. If a connection originated from one of the targeted countries, the victim was led to an RAR file that contained malicious executables. The payload was a new Trojan developed by TA402 that Proofpoint has named NimbleMamba and has features typical of malware used in intelligence gathering and initial access. In some cases, a second payload, the BrittleBush Trojan, was also deployed.

The advisories also provide patches to fix the issues.\n\nXSA-333 addresses a denial of service vulnerability, CVE-2020-25602, resulting from the handling of guest access to MSR_MISC_ENABLE. They note that only x86 systems are vulnerable, not ARM systems. Additionally only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability, while x86 HVM/PVH guests cannot.\n\nXSA-334 addresses a denial of service vulnerability, CVE-2020-25598, resulting from a missing unlock in XENMEM_acquire_resource error path. This could allow a buggy or malicious HVM stubdomain to cause an RCU reference to be leaked. As stated by Xen, \"Only VMs using HVM stubdomains can exploit the vulnerability. VMs using PV stubdomains, or with emulators running in dom0 cannot exploit the vulnerability.\"\n\nXSA-336 addresses a denial of service vulnerability, CVE-2020-25604, resulting from a race when migrating timers between x86 HVM vCPU-s. This requires an x86 system with more than one vCPU and an x86 HVM guest account.\n\nXSA-337 addresses a denial of service vulnerability, CVE-2020-25595, due to PCI passthrough code reading back hardware registers. Risk of privilege escalation and information leaks also exists. Exploitation requires an x86 system that supports PCI passthrough, a guest account with guests with passed through PCI devices, and out-of-spec functionality.\n\nXSA-338 addresses a denial of service vulnerability, CVE-2020-25597, resulting from logic in the handling of event channel operations. Xen states \"only systems with untrusted guests permitted to create more than the default number of event channels are vulnerable.\"\n\nXSA-339 addresses a denial of service vulnerability, CVE-2020-25596, caused by the SYSENTER instruction leaving various state sanitization activities to software. Only x86 systems supporting the SYSENTER instruction in 64bit mode are vulnerable and only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.\n\nXSA-340 addresses a denial of service vulnerability, CVE-2020-25603, resulting from missing memory barriers when accessing/allocating an event channel. Risk of privilege escalation and information leaks also exists.\n\nXSA-342 addresses a denial of service vulnerability, CVE-2020-25600, resulting from out of bounds event channels available to 32-bit x86 domains. Only x86 32-bit domains servicing other domains are vulnerable.\n\nXSA-343 addresses a privilege escalation vulnerability, CVE-2020-25599, resulting from races with evtchn_reset(). Denial of service conditions and information leaks are also possible.\n\nXSA-344 addresses a denial of service vulnerability, CVE-2020-25601, due to lack of preemption in evtchn_reset().\n\nWe recommend reviewing the security advisories, linked to in the References section, and applying relevant patches as soon as possible.\n\n# CVEs\n\n  * A complete list of CVEs can be found here: [ CVEs.txt](/download/attachments/30769860/Xen%20Security%20Advisories%20-%20September%2022%2C%202020%20CVEs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1600876675426&api=v2)\n\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Review the source article for full details.\n\n  * Apply applicable patches, updates, or workarounds as necessary. \n\n\n\n\n# References\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-333.html>\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-334.html>\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-336.html>\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-337.html>\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-338.html>\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-339.html>\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-340.html>\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-342.html>\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-343.html>\n\n  * <http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-344.html>",

For example, the Vyveva backdoor uses fake TLS in communication, command line execution chains, and encryption and Tor services. ESET can, with high confidence, attribute this activity to Lazarus. The presence of Vyveva indicates an earlier dropper which has not yet been identified. The installer creates a service for persistence of the backdoor loader and the storage of embedded, default backdoor configuration within the registry. The backdoor itself is the main component of Vyveva. This backdoor connects to the C2 servers and executes commands as issued by the threat actors. In their analysis, the researchers were able to identify 23 commands, most being ordinary commands used for file and process operations or information gathering. It also has the ability to upload files and exfiltrate directories recursively. Additionally, the backdoor can also filter on specific file types, such as Office documents only.

Instead of one large file, IceRat consists of several small files which means the context of the individual files may not be apparent. Initially, the downloader is in a Trojanized dropper within another dropper.

The malware has mostly been seen in Eastern Europe and Russia. According to analysts, IceRat is a PHP implementation for Java VMs and uses .phb files instead of Java .class files, a type of file usually not supported or noticed by antivirus products. Instead of one large file, IceRat consists of several small files which means the context of the individual files may not be apparent. Initially, the downloader is in a Trojanized dropper within another dropper. Analysts also noted that although the malware is infamously known as a RAT, IceRat is more appropriately described as a backdoor, with the capability of stealing credentials from popular browsers like Chrome and Firefox.

The malware, dubbed MehCrypter, is a two-part malware. The first part of the malware is the crypter. This crypter is a multi-stage part and is distributed as a compiled Autoit script. The script looks for bytes that determine file format and obfuscation with affecting functionality. The second part of the malware is a password stealer, called Meh, hence the name of the malware in totality. The stealer is also capable of stealing clipboard contents and cryptocurrency wallets, keylogging and downloading files from torrent sites. The password stealer will be the subject of part two of this series. The files for the malware are retrieved from a hardcoded dropper C2 server address. Upon downloading, the files are saved to a directory and one of the downloaded files is executed. This file downloads a second file which is the password stealer. The dropper cleans up after itself by terminating processes which may be running, such as notepad.exe, systeminfo.exe, calc.exe, and others. These processes are required for the execution of process injection. The installation folder is also removed at this stage. The first file downloaded contains two parts: a shellcode call and an unencrypted binary file. The MehCrypter is written in Borland Delphi and used to decrypt one of the previously downloaded files using an XOR cipher. The campaign employing this malware targets mostly Spain and Argentina with more than 82,000 users affected combined. As previously mentioned, a second part of the report will be released soon.

The sample involved in this campaign is unique as it includes strings for domain names tied to Polish, Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian government organizations. Vidar is capable of stealing and exfiltrating sensitive data, such as credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser cookies. This sample obtains its C2 addresses via Mastadon profiles.

The sample involved in this campaign is unique as it includes strings for domain names tied to Polish, Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian government organizations. Vidar is capable of stealing and exfiltrating sensitive data, such as credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser cookies. This sample obtains its C2 addresses via Mastadon profiles. After credentials are gathered, the list is checked for any used on the aforementioned domains. If a match is found, a secondary C2 is used as an exfiltration point instead of the primary one.

Infection typically is fast if the stalker has physical access to the victim's device(s). Speculation is that most of these threat actors are someone within the victim's family or social/work circles. The stalker must also have unlock capabilities or the device must have PINs or patterns disable. Finally, the stalker must deactivate the protection measures on the device in order to achieve their goal, whatever that may be. The stalker must configure the app and synchronize it with their monitoring service, and, presumably, root permissions must be obtained. It should be noted that there are actually three components to stalkerware. One is the attacker, another the stalker, and finally the victim. The attacker uses the stalker's account and obtained information to carry out further actions on the device.

Infection typically is fast if the stalker has physical access to the victim's device(s). Speculation is that most of these threat actors are someone within the victim's family or social/work circles. The stalker must also have unlock capabilities or the device must have PINs or patterns disable. Finally, the stalker must deactivate the protection measures on the device in order to achieve their goal, whatever that may be. The stalker must configure the app and synchronize it with their monitoring service, and, presumably, root permissions must be obtained. It should be noted that there are actually three components to stalkerware. One is the attacker, another the stalker, and finally the victim. The attacker uses the stalker's account and obtained information to carry out further actions on the device.

The attacker could hypothetically use this to download a next-stage payload onto the system for further malicious activities. By pivoting on the C2 domain used by this malware, the researchers were able to find additional documents targeting a variety of countries, including Azerbaijan, Cyprus, India, Italy, Lithuania, Ukraine, and the Vatican.

The ransomware was discovered due to a hit on a Babuk payload signature. The reason it was detected as Babuk is because it was based on leaked Babuk source code. The Bitcoin address, actor email addresses, and ransomware name were edited for the actor's purpose, but the payload remained the same. McAfee notes that prior to leveraged leaked Babuk code, the actor attempted to write their own ransomware but it was simple and easy to analyze. Investigating domains contacted by the payload led to the discovery of an open directory containing additional tools, such as scripts for defense evasion and privilege escalation. Further pivoting on the network infrastructure led to what is likely the initial infection vector, fake Flash and AnyDesk installers, along with an exfiltration tool and other payloads.

      "xfe_q": "Delta Plus Ransomware\nWhile investigating smaller ransomware actors, McAfee researchers uncovered an actor distributing a ransomware payload dubbed \"Delta Plus.\"",
      "xfe_report": "# Threat Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Ransomware\n  *  **Targets:** Unknown\n  *  **Ransomware Family:** Delta Plus\n  *  **RaaS Operation:** No\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Fake application installers\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Data Encryption, Data Theft\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nMcAfee published a blog post analyzing the Delta Plus ransomware as a part of an investigation into small ransomware actors. The ransomware was discovered due to a hit on a Babuk payload signature. The reason it was detected as Babuk is because it was based on leaked Babuk source code. The Bitcoin address, actor email addresses, and ransomware name were edited for the actor's purpose, but the payload remained the same. McAfee notes that prior to leveraged leaked Babuk code, the actor attempted to write their own ransomware but it was simple and easy to analyze. Investigating domains contacted by the payload led to the discovery of an open directory containing additional tools, such as scripts for defense evasion and privilege escalation. Further pivoting on the network infrastructure led to what is likely the initial infection vector, fake Flash and AnyDesk installers, along with an exfiltration tool and other payloads. For more information, see the McAfee blog post in the Reference section.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * A complete list of IoCs can be found here: [

Past reporting indicates that the Emotet botnet malware has been utilized by a number of threat actors to compromise endpoints and networks. Emotet has also been utilized to create a botnet that is marketed as malware as a service (MaaS). After the international law enforcement operation known as Ladybird, it was assessed that the botnet and the adjacent infrastructure had been taken down. TrendMicro now believes that the Emotet botnet malware returned and is once again operational. The newest version of Emotet now utilizes Excel 4.0 to execute downloads.

Past reporting indicates that the Emotet botnet malware has been utilized by a number of threat actors to compromise endpoints and networks. Emotet has also been utilized to create a botnet that is marketed as malware as a service (MaaS). After the international law enforcement operation known as Ladybird, it was assessed that the botnet and the adjacent infrastructure had been taken down. TrendMicro now believes that the Emotet botnet malware returned and is once again operational. The newest version of Emotet now utilizes Excel 4.0 to execute downloads. Emotet malware has continued to change and uses several techniques to avoid detection. Two techniques employed by the latest version of Emotet include using .ocx on the file extension and deploying carets in URLs.

One of the main differentiators between these and other attacks is the use of SMTP for one-way C&C communications. Often, the C&C server is an SMTP server that was compromised in a prior attack. Spearphishing and internal spearphishing from a compromised server or email account are the usual infections vectors. One interesting aspect of these campaigns when using a compromised email account is the attacker's apparent reliance on C&C email traffic being detected as spam with the offending emails being automatically moved to a separate folder where the victim user may not notice them.

The technique involves the use of a legitimate driver, in this case, Avast's Anti Rootkit kernel driver, to terminate a number of AV and EDR processes.

The developer of the malware claims it is undetectable by security software. The malware is encoded using a rot13 cipher and executes in memory rather than dropping a payload. Upon execution, the malware first searches for files and steals them before stealing data from browsers.

All of this data is collated, along with system information and screenshots and is compressed into a folder. The stealer uses Telegram to retrieve the remote server IP and sends the compressed folder. The malware also contained unused functionality, such as a keylogger.

One of their findings was related to malicious coinminers, which were found being implemented via multiple methods. The first involved injecting Coinhive mining code directly into a compromised site. Unlike most attackers who typically configure coinminers to use a minimal amount of CPU in order to avoid detection, these actors barely throttled the mining activity, leading the battery of the victim device to be drained quickly. Another method of coinmining activity involved redirecting users from a legitimate used car website to a malicious link hosting the JSEcoin miner.

One of their findings was related to malicious coinminers, which were found being implemented via multiple methods. The first involved injecting Coinhive mining code directly into a compromised site. Unlike most attackers who typically configure coinminers to use a minimal amount of CPU in order to avoid detection, these actors barely throttled the mining activity, leading the battery of the victim device to be drained quickly. Another method of coinmining activity involved redirecting users from a legitimate used car website to a malicious link hosting the JSEcoin miner. Since the JSEcoin miner shut down, the scripts will run but the operators will not receive any currency.

This group is performing extensive password spraying attacks on Office 365 tenants with a focus on US and Israeli defense companies, Persian Gulf ports of entry, or global maritime transportation companies with business presence in the Middle East. This behavior has led MSTIC to attribute this activity to Iran, as it matches previous techniques and targets of other actors based in Iran. The group tends to target two exchange endpoints - Autodiscover and ActiveSync - as a feature of the password spray tool they are using. The attacks come from an elaborate series of Tor IP addresses to hide their infrastructure and emulate a firefox browser to achieve this. They are seen to be most active between Sunday and Thursday during the daytime in Iranian time. On average, 150 to over 1000 Tor IPs are used in each attack against an organization. MSTIC has noted that accounts using multifactor authentication are resilient to these types of attacks. Due to the use of Tor IPs, IoCs are unavailable for these attacks. However, MSTIC has outlined several methods for detecting this campaign. Further information can be found in the article located within the Reference section below.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Enable multifactor authentication to mitigate compromised credentials (M1032). \n  * Block all incoming traffic from anonymizing services where possible (M1031).\n  * Proactively reset accounts that are known to be part of breached credentials either immediately, or after detecting bruteforce attempts (M1018).\n  * Set account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent passwords from being guessed. Too strict a policy may create a denial of service condition and render environments un-usable, with all accounts used in the brute force being locked-out (M1036).\n\n\n\n# References\n\n  * <https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/10/11/iran-linked-dev-0343-targeting-defense-gis-and-maritime-sectors/>\n\n\n\n# MITRE ATT&CK Framework\n\n **Reconnaissance - TA0043**  \nT1589 - Gather Victim Identity Information  \nT1590 - Gather Victim Network Information  \n  \n **Initial Access - TA0001**  \nT1078 - Valid Accounts  \n  \n **Credential Access - TA0006**  \nT1110 - Brute Force  \nT1110.003 - Password Spraying",

      "xfe_report": "# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Reconnaissance\n  *  **Targets:** Microsoft Exchange, Middle-East\n  *  **Malware Family/Families:** o365spray\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Unknown\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Unknown\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nThe Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has been tracking a potential new threat group they are currently calling DEV-0343. This group is performing extensive password spraying attacks on Office 365 tenants with a focus on US and Israeli defense companies, Persian Gulf ports of entry, or global maritime transportation companies with business presence in the Middle East. This behavior has led MSTIC to attribute this activity to Iran, as it matches previous techniques and targets of other actors based in Iran. The group tends to target two exchange endpoints - Autodiscover and ActiveSync - as a feature of the password spray tool they are using. The attacks come from an elaborate series of Tor IP addresses to hide their infrastructure and emulate a firefox browser to achieve this. They are seen to be most active between Sunday and Thursday during the daytime in Iranian time. On average, 150 to over 1000 Tor IPs are used in each attack against an organization. MSTIC has noted that accounts using multifactor authentication are resilient to these types of attacks. Due to the use of Tor IPs, IoCs are unavailable for these attacks. However, MSTIC has outlined several methods for detecting this campaign. Further information can be found in the article located within the Reference section below.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Enable multifactor authentication to mitigate compromised credentials (M1032). \n  * Block all incoming traffic from anonymizing services where possible (M1031).\n  * Proactively reset accounts that are known to be part of breached credentials either immediately, or after detecting bruteforce attempts (M1018).\n  * Set account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent passwords from being guessed. Too strict a policy may create a denial of service condition and render environments un-usable, with all accounts used in the brute force being locked-out (M1036).\n\n\n\n# References\n\n  * <https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/10/11/iran-linked-dev-0343-targeting-defense-gis-and-maritime-sectors/>\n\n\n\n# MITRE ATT&CK Framework\n\n **Reconnaissance - TA0043**  \nT1589 - Gather Victim Identity Information  \nT1590 - Gather Victim Network Information  \n  \n **Initial Access - TA0001**  \nT1078 - Valid Accounts  \n  \n **Credential Access - TA0006**  \nT1110 - Brute Force  \nT1110.003 - Password Spraying"

The attacks use RTF documents to deliver dcRAT and QuasarRAT by exploiting CVE-2017-11882 \u2014 a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Office \u2014 and AndroidRAT to target mobile devices. The campaign consists of two parts: a reconnaissance phase and an attack phase. The reconnaissance phase starts with the malicious RTF document, which exploits a vulnerability to execute a malicious PowerShell command to extract and execute a PowerShell script. This script decodes a loader and activates it on the victim machine. The loader establishes persistence and loads the final payload of this phase. It consists of C# code and is a file enumerator and infector. It can weaponize benign documents with malicious OLE objects it can use to propagate the attack to other hosts. The attack phase is the same, except instead of the final payload, it uses a BAT file to download and execute commodity malware. The researchers have attributed this campaign to a threat actor called \"A.R. Bunse\". They use a front company to procure the infrastructure used in the attacks. Their actions indicate that although they are using commodity malware, their custom tools suggest they are moving away from this approach.

      "xfe_report": "# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Malware\n  *  **Targets:** Afghanistan, India\n  *  **Malware Family/Families:** dcRAT, QuasarRAT (S0262), AndroidRAT (S0292)\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Phishing **  \n**\n  * **Post-Compromise Actions:** Persistence, Lateral Movement\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nCisco Talos has observed a new campaign targeting Afghanistan and India using malicious documents to deliver a variety of malware to victims. The attacks use RTF documents to deliver dcRAT and QuasarRAT by exploiting CVE-2017-11882 \u2014 a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Office \u2014 and AndroidRAT to target mobile devices. The campaign consists of two parts: a reconnaissance phase and an attack phase. The reconnaissance phase starts with the malicious RTF document, which exploits a vulnerability to execute a malicious PowerShell command to extract and execute a PowerShell script. This script decodes a loader and activates it on the victim machine. The loader establishes persistence and loads the final payload of this phase. It consists of C# code and is a file enumerator and infector. It can weaponize benign documents with malicious OLE objects it can use to propagate the attack to other hosts. The attack phase is the same, except instead of the final payload, it uses a BAT file to download and execute commodity malware. The researchers have attributed this campaign to a threat actor called \"A.R. Bunse\". They use a front company to procure the infrastructure used in the attacks. Their actions indicate that although they are using commodity malware, their custom tools suggest they are moving away from this approach.

In this version, the DLL is not the payload and doesn't communicate with the C2 servers. According to researchers, the entropy is high and thus most likely contains encrypted data. Using specified resources, a breakpoint is reached and, in turn, triggers the decryption stage that is placed in memory. The next stage is then loaded using a matching file size. Unlike past versions, this version has no imported API functions, very few strings, but does employ the same code obfuscation. Obfuscation is accomplished via Control Flow Flattening. The payload is concealed by hiding information used in static analysis. Using DeMotet, imported functions that have been added to the payload can be seen.

The CAB file contained .bat files, an RAR file and a copy of WinRAR to unpack it, and an executable binary. The .bat files are the primary controllers of the attack which culminates in the wiping of the system's disk. The wiper has been named MeteorExpress by SentinelLabs. There is conjecture that the malware may be related to NotPetya due to the same sectors of the MBR being overwritten. SentinelLabs provides no attribution for the attack but the attackers were familiar with their target before commencing the destructive attack. The report further notes that the actors behind the malware have an intermediate skill level but the quality of code and design ranges from \"clunky and rudimentary to slick and well-developed\". While MeteorExpress has not been observed to have been used in any other attacks, it is configurable which suggests it could be used in other attacks.

A check-in to the C2 server is used to register the victim device, and in response the C2 server provides a list of targeted financial apps and the IP address and port for future C2 communication. The malware provides the attacker with a variety of remote access commands, such as screen capture, application launching, clipboard manipulation, and more.

However, like many current ransomware models, the DarkSide ransomware also attempts to steal sensitive data and threatens to publish this data if the ransom isn't paid. This means that even with free file recovery, there is still a risk of a data leak. See the Bitdefender blog post in the reference section for instructions on using their decryption tool.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Review the source article for full details.\n\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://labs.bitdefender.com/2021/01/darkside-ransomware-decryption-tool/>\n\n  * <https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkside-ransomware-decryptor-recovers-victims-files-for-free/>"

On September 6th, 2021, an update for ADSelfService Plus was released and it addressed an authentication bypass vulnerability, CVE-2021-40539. On September 16th, a joint alert from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United States Coast Guard Cyber Command (CGCYBER), and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) was published that noted reports of exploitation of the vulnerability as early as August 2021 and that APT actors were likely among those exploiting the vulnerability. Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center and Palo Alto's Unit 42 have both produced reports concerning campaigns they observed that began exploiting the vulnerability on September 22nd. Unit 42 notes in their report that as early as September 17 an actor was leveraging leased infrastructure located in the United States to scan the internet for vulnerable instances of ADSelfService Plus. If a compromise was achieved, post-exploitation activities carried out by the attackers include credential dumping and deploying malware to maintain persistence and move laterally within the environment. While Unit 42 provides no specific attribution, they do note similarities between this campaign and the tactics and tooling used by Threat Group 3390, also known as APT27, Emissary Panda, and TG-3390. Microsoft however attributes the activity directly to a Chinese threat actor they refer to as DEV-0322. Targets of the global campaign have included organizations in the consulting, defense, education, energy, healthcare, and technology sectors. The objective of the campaign appears to be the collection and exfiltration of sensitive data.

If a compromise was achieved, post-exploitation activities carried out by the attackers include credential dumping and deploying malware to maintain persistence and move laterally within the environment. While Unit 42 provides no specific attribution, they do note similarities between this campaign and the tactics and tooling used by Threat Group 3390, also known as APT27, Emissary Panda, and TG-3390. Microsoft however attributes the activity directly to a Chinese threat actor they refer to as DEV-0322. Targets of the global campaign have included organizations in the consulting, defense, education, energy, healthcare, and technology sectors. The objective of the campaign appears to be the collection and exfiltration of sensitive data.

While the exact infection vector is unknown, they believe it likely used exploitation techniques similar to those used by other miners. This miner most commonly targets database servers as those types of servers typically provide more performance and resources, which is beneficial to cryptomining. After initial access to the victim server is gained, a downloader Trojan is executed on the system. This downloader simply retrieves a ZIP archive masquerading as a DLL from a remote server. Inside the ZIP archive is a configuration file, the miner payload, and a kernel-level device driver used to obtain the access level needed by the miner to perform certain malicious activities. By investigating the infrastructure related to the domain in the miner config, Sophos was able to identify various other ZIP archives containing copies of the miner, ELF executables, and other domains hosting the payloads. Additionally, Github repos containing the payloads were also identified. Sophos believes the Iranian domain used to host the malware was not compromised but that, instead, the company behind the domain assisted in the distribution of the malware.

Upon installation, the application, named \"TikTok Pro,\" distracts the user by displaying a fake notification and subsequently hiding its icon, in the hopes users will believe it was a faulty install. Once hidden though, the malicious activity begins. First, persistence is established by creating broadcast receivers that will execute the malware both when the device is booted and every three minutes. Additionally, a broadcast receiver is triggered during phone calls in order to capture MP3 recordings of incoming and outgoing calls, which can later be exfiltrated by the attacker. With persistence established, the malware can begin receiving commands from its C2 server. Available commands include those capable of stealing and sending SMS messages, getting device information, capturing screenshots, and opening applications. One of the more unique features of this Spyware is the functionality to display a fake Facebook login page and capture entered credentials. The researchers note that they were able to find some similarities to the Spynote and Spymax spyware families; however, the Facebook credential stealing functionality appears to be unique to this new variant.

After establishing persistence via the Startup directory, it is able to function as a RAT that communicates via Google Drive. It periodically polls a Google Drive account for the presence of a command file.

I need overview, related mitre attack informations if exists, IoCs, recommandations and possible references.",

    "output": "You are asking about a specific threat report. Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Details\n\n  *  **Malware Type:** Banking Trojan\n  *  **Associated Threat Actors:** Unknown\n  *  **Associated Payloads:** Flubot\n  *  **Targets:** Users of Various Banks\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Phishing\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Overlay Attacks, Data Theft, Propogation\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nResearchers from F5 labs have written a report on the newest version of Flubot and the techniques used by the developers. Flubot first appeared in early 2020 and infects Android devices to completely take control of them, with the ability to access all the data stored on the device and its functions. The main way Flubot is spread is via SMS messages that include a link to track a fake parcel by a delivery company. The link sends the user to a compromised site that is hosting the malicious application. Flubot abuses Android's accessibility service and attempts to perform overlay attacks on banking applications to steal credentials. It also monitors text messages, presumably to steal one-time passwords. Once Flubot is installed from the phishing site, it accesses the victim's contact list and sends it to the C2 server, which is then used to continue the attack.

      "xfe_q": "An Analysis of Flubot 5.2\nF5 Labs has published an article on the updates that the Flubot developers have made in the newest version. This Android is being spread via phishing messages and uses the stolen contact lists of victims to propagate.",
      "xfe_report": "# Threat Details\n\n  *  **Malware Type:** Banking Trojan\n  *  **Associated Threat Actors:** Unknown\n  *  **Associated Payloads:** Flubot\n  *  **Targets:** Users of Various Banks\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Phishing\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Overlay Attacks, Data Theft, Propogation\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nResearchers from F5 labs have written a report on the newest version of Flubot and the techniques used by the developers. Flubot first appeared in early 2020 and infects Android devices to completely take control of them, with the ability to access all the data stored on the device and its functions. The main way Flubot is spread is via SMS messages that include a link to track a fake parcel by a delivery company. The link sends the user to a compromised site that is hosting the malicious application. Flubot abuses Android's accessibility service and attempts to perform overlay attacks on banking applications to steal credentials. It also monitors text messages, presumably to steal one-time passwords. Once Flubot is installed from the phishing site, it accesses the victim's contact list and sends it to the C2 server, which is then used to continue the attack. In this newest version, the developers added a command which allows the attacker to remotely update the seed used to find and communicate with a C2 server. This allows the new version of Flubot to use 30 TLDs, compared to 3 in previous versions.

This activity appears to be targeting the technology and manufacturing sectors, and compromise begins with an infected removable drive introduced into the victim's network. The drive contains a false file pretending to be a folder, which when clicked will execute a script to begin infection. One of the commands executed is msiexec, which is used to connect to malicious domains for C2 purposes. In many cases, this utility is used to download and install further malicious files, such as malicious DLLs used to achieve persistence. Further commands are executed and malicious processes are launched at elevated privileges. One of the utilities used has a 'regsvr' flag, which can be used to execute DLLs and bypass application controls.

This activity appears to be targeting the technology and manufacturing sectors, and compromise begins with an infected removable drive introduced into the victim's network. The drive contains a false file pretending to be a folder, which when clicked will execute a script to begin infection. One of the commands executed is msiexec, which is used to connect to malicious domains for C2 purposes. In many cases, this utility is used to download and install further malicious files, such as malicious DLLs used to achieve persistence. Further commands are executed and malicious processes are launched at elevated privileges. One of the utilities used has a 'regsvr' flag, which can be used to execute DLLs and bypass application controls. These utilities are then used to connect to IP addresses associated with TOR nodes for further communication with the threat actors.

The commands necessary for encrypting VM images on ESXi servers are also included. These include those for gathering a list of VMs, shutting them down, and enabling SSH. The ransom note is similar to those observed in Windows variants.

This vulnerability has been seen as being exploited in the wild. File Manager, the plugin in question, is designed to assist site managers with files on websites. The vulnerability exists wherein the plugin renames the extension of the elFinder library's connector.minimal.php.dist to .PHP.

Without access controls, this plugin could be accessed by anyone and be used to initiate an elFinder command.

Furthermore, install paths seen associated with the malware indicate another infection vector was WhatsApp messages. In terms of the payload, its data stealing functionality remains largely the same. The code, however, has been modified in a couple of aspects. Firstly, it now uses Base64 encoding of strings in the code in order to evade detection. Secondly, it uses retrofit2 and FireBase for C2 communication instead of Socket. The researchers hypothesize there may be hundreds of victims, with the main targets located in Pakistan and the Kashmir region. From what little stolen data could be analyzed, it appears a number of the victims have a military background.

While skimming campaigns typically target one e-commerce platform, this campaign leverages a skimmer that targets multiple platforms including Shopify, BigCommerce, Zencart, and Woocommerce. Given these hosted platforms don't allow custom JavaScript, the attackers inject the skimmer into the victim website before users are taken to the legitimate checkout page. The skimmer presents a fake PayPal form that gathers and exfiltrates entered details. An error is then displayed indicating processing failed, and users are redirected to the legitimate checkout page. Interestingly, this skimmer uses a domain generation algorithm to produce the exfiltration domains.

While skimming campaigns typically target one e-commerce platform, this campaign leverages a skimmer that targets multiple platforms including Shopify, BigCommerce, Zencart, and Woocommerce. Given these hosted platforms don't allow custom JavaScript, the attackers inject the skimmer into the victim website before users are taken to the legitimate checkout page. The skimmer presents a fake PayPal form that gathers and exfiltrates entered details. An error is then displayed indicating processing failed, and users are redirected to the legitimate checkout page. Interestingly, this skimmer uses a domain generation algorithm to produce the exfiltration domains. For more information, see the Sansec blog post in the Reference section.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * Associated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report.   \n\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date.\n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n\n\n\n# Reference\n\n  * <https://sansec.io/research/skimmer-dynamic-exfiltration-shopify-bigcommerce>"

This behavior involved highly sophisticated methods and hitherto unseen malware, suggesting that this is a very capable threat group. The researchers have traced this activity back to July 2020. As this is a long-standing operation, with advanced capabilities and no known affinity to existing threat groups, the researchers have named this group GhostEmperor. This group has been observed using several initial infection vectors, but most commonly, they exploit public-facing servers to gain initial access. They have recently been observed exploiting the ProxyLogon vulnerability. Once initial access is gained, the group deploys a series of malware starting with a PowerShell dropper, which installs the second stage as a service and executes it. This second stage then initiates a third stage payload as an in-memory implant. The third stage is in charge of facilitating a communication channel with a C2 server, where traffic can be masqueraded under the guise of legitimate communications with a benign service. The final stage is injected into the winlogon.exe process by the previous stage, which provides the attacker remote control over the system. In addition to the final stage, the implant also deploys a Windows kernel-mode driver which serves as a rootkit with the sole purpose of concealing malware artifacts. Analysts have named this rootkit Demodex, as it has not been seen before. Once this malware has been established, the attackers perform internal reconnaissance using public tools such as NBTscan, as well as tools from the Sysinternals suite such as PsExec and ProcDump. GhostEmperor mainly targets government entities and telecommunication companies in southeast Asia, with multiple high-profile entities targeted in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia.

While it is not absolutely certain, it is believed that the initial compromise was gained through a malicious document attached to a spearphishing email. A short time after the initial compromise, the actor was observed using standard Microsoft utilities for discovery and a Cobalt Strike beacon was installed shortly thereafter. While attempting to enumerate the network, the actor mistyped a lot of commands. In addition, they were seen to be following the instructions, in order, from some documents that are provided to Conti affiliates. In some cases, even using the same passwords from the documents for accounts they created. Adfind, native Windows utilities, and the Cobalt Strike beacon were used for further discovery. Credentials used for privilege escalation were obtained by dumping LSASS. When satisfied with their discovery phase the actor, using a reverse proxy, connected to the compromised host using RDP. Next, they moved laterally to the domain controller using RDP, downloaded and executed AdFind, executed two separate Cobalt Strike beacons, created two local administrator accounts, and installed a copy of the AnyDesk remote access software. They continued enumerating the network using PowerSploit and began searching for documents of interest on hosts connected to the domain. Another tool, the Advanced IP Scanner was used to scan for other subnets on the LAN. Later, they again enumerated the domain controller, this time using Seatbelt and then pivoted to another domain controller and carried out the same steps as they had done on the previous domain controller. After a period of inactivity, the actor returned to the system and used Rclone to exfiltrate the data they had collected to the public file-sharing service, Mega. Their access to the system was terminated not long after this. Amongst the data the actor collected, was an active directory backup they created, made in \u201cIFM\u201d media mode. All these steps and the apparent use of Conti affiliate instructions suggest the intended outcome of the attack was the deployment of the Conti ransomware, prevented in the case when the actor was evicted from the systems prior to Conti deployment.

Upon execution, resources and functions are decrypted, revealing various attack methods and remote domains. To obtain its TOR proxy and C2 information, hardcoded remote domains are queried to identify data in their DNS TXT records. The first DNS TXT record provides a string used to obtain the subdomains used for generating the next domain list. The second DNS TXT record is from one of the domains in the aforementioned list and returns the TOR proxy addresses. Finally, the last TXT record provides the TOR C2 address. At this point C2 communication is fully established and the bot can receive instructions for getting group information, performing a heartbeat, or carrying out a DDos attack.

A popular ad network, ExoClick, was abused with redirection pages. The first domain used in the campaign was disguised as a web design agency; however the page was simply a decoy page. The actor used server-side cloaking to redirect victims to a Fallout exploit kit landing page. This page attempted to exploit CVE-2019-0752 and CVE-2018-15982. These CVEs attack Internet Explorer and Adobe's Flash Player respectively. Nearly two weeks later, a new domain was used and employed a 302 redirect. This instance used the RIG exploit kit to disseminate Raccoon Stealer. A second malvertiser (malsmoke) has been tracked for months and uses Smoke Loader malware. The actor placed their malicious ad on the xhamster.com website. This campaign used a different and more sophisticated redirection technique with client-side fingerprinting and connectivity checks in an effort to target only legitimate IP addresses. For this attack, both Raccoon Stealer and ZLoader were downloaded and deployed. This group has a propensity to switch ad networks with rapid pace to continually perform its malvertising campaigns.

There are consistent tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the threat actor across all their intrusions, including their method of initial access. The actor begins by using compromised usernames and passwords in a password spraying attack against remote services, such as webmail. Once valid credentials are identified, they are used to access a remote access service, such as a VPN to obtain a foothold in the victim network. Password spraying attacks continue against administrator accounts identified on the victim host. Finally, with an administrator account compromised, a Cobalt Strike beacon is installed to be used for remote access instead of the initial remote access service that was abused. Scans are performed for network discovery, such as identifying proxy settings, hosts, services, and shares. Lateral movement occurs to compromise other hosts of interest, such as domain controllers, and obtain domain administrator credentials. On each victim host another Cobalt Strike beacon is installed; however, no persistence mechanism exists, so if the system is rebooted, the Cobalt Strike beacon will quit. Once lateral movement is complete, data of interest, such as intellectual property, emails, and personally identifiable information, on each host is identified and prepared for exfiltration. In some cases exfiltration occurs via the Cobalt Strike beacon, but in most cases the data is compressed with WinRAR and uploaded to an attacker-controlled cloud storage account, such as OneDrive.

The forums and repos have gone so far as to ban any ransomware ads placed on the sites. Any type of ad touting ransomware is removed. Leading the way in this effort is the XSS Russian-speaking forum.

The owner of XSS feels that ransomware is bringing \"unwanted attention to the site and has become dangerous and toxic,\" according to a quote obtained by Bleeping Computer. Many of the RaaS gangs are purportedly leaving the forums for others that are more welcoming of their type of activity, such as exploit.in.

According to Malwarebytes Labs, Patchwork typically uses spear-phishing as their infection vector, and their most recent campaign was carried out between late November and early December 2021 using malicious documents themed to appear to be from Pakistani authorities. The targets of the attack were researchers involved in molecular medicine and biological science, this campaign was the first time Patchwork has been observed targeting personnel in these fields. The document analyzed by Malwarebytes exploited a vulnerability in the Microsoft Equation Editor. The payload was the Ragnatela RAT which is a variant of the BadNews RAT. The objective of the campaign was cyberespionage. However, the actors also managed to infect themselves with their own RAT which allowed Malwarebytes to obtain screenshots and keystrokes from Patchwork's own systems.

      "xfe_report": "# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Malware, Espionage.\n  *  **Targets:** Researchers involved in molecular medicine and biological science.\n  *  **Malware Family/Families:** Ragnatela RAT.\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Malicious documents attached to spear-phishing emails.\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** Data collection and exfiltration.\n  *  **Additional TTPs:** See the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below for the TTPs typically used by Patchwork.\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nThe Indian APT group known as Patchwork has been active for many years, typically attacking Pakistani targets. According to Malwarebytes Labs, Patchwork typically uses spear-phishing as their infection vector, and their most recent campaign was carried out between late November and early December 2021 using malicious documents themed to appear to be from Pakistani authorities. The targets of the attack were researchers involved in molecular medicine and biological science, this campaign was the first time Patchwork has been observed targeting personnel in these fields. The document analyzed by Malwarebytes exploited a vulnerability in the Microsoft Equation Editor. The payload was the Ragnatela RAT which is a variant of the BadNews RAT. The objective of the campaign was cyberespionage. However, the actors also managed to infect themselves with their own RAT which allowed Malwarebytes to obtain screenshots and keystrokes from Patchwork's own systems.

The report notes that the SPM55 offerings have a high rate of success in comparison to other phishing kits.

The operator also offer add-ons for credit card checkers, account validators, and what is described as an \"antibot.\" The antibot is used to help evade detection by redirecting sessions to benign sites if they do not appear to be from a valid phishing target. SPM55 prefers Indonesian-speaking customers and payments from OVO and DANA, which are Indonesian payment services. Payments can also be made using Bitcoin and Ethereum. The typical lures used in target emails claim a recipient's account has been disabled. Aside from seeking a victim's credentials the phishing pages can also include fields to capture other personal information.

Further information can be found in the Reference section below or [here](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-102a).\n\n## ***UPDATE March 25, 2021***\n\n  \nUS-CISA and DHS have issued additional information about China Chopper Webshells which may be in use against Microsoft Offline Address books. These latest samples are inline with other samples previously examined. There are subtle differences in the code used for the creation of the shells. We recommend you read the reports and apply any and all patches available as well as examining your environment for any evidence of these or any other potentially nefarious webshells. Further information can be found in the Reference section below or [here](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-084a) and [here](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-084b). \n\n## ***UPDATE March 16, 2021***\n\n  \nYesterday, Microsoft released a one-click Exchange On-Premises Mitigation tool. This tool is not designed to replace patching of vulnerable servers, it is merely meant to help those who've not yet had opportunity to patch these systems. This tool includes the latest Microsoft Safety Scanner and will mitigate CVE-2021-26855. The tool performs three operations: mitigate against current known attacks using CVE-2021-26855 using a URL Rewrite configuration, scan the Exchange Server using the Microsoft Safety Scanner, and attempt to reverse any changes made by identified threats. Further detailed guidance can be found in the Reference section below or [here](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/15/one-click-microsoft-exchange-on-premises-mitigation-tool-march-2021/).\n\n## ***UPDATE March 15, 2021***\n\n  \nThe Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency released 7 malware analysis reports on webshells seen throughout its investigation.

According to the FBI and CISA, multiple nation-state actors and cybercriminals are likely exploiting the previously mentioned vulnerabilities. Should these attackers successfully exploit these vulnerabilities, they have the ability to gain persistence and control of the affected network. The possibility exists of the sale of compromised network access on the dark web. These networks can contain valuable research, technology, PII, and sensitive information from multiple sectors. The agencies assess the attackers will continue to exploit these vulnerabilities in order to steal information, encrypt data for ransom, or, in a worst case scenario, execute a destructive attack against compromised networks. The report also notes the types of industries currently or previously having seen attacks as \"local governments, academic institutions, non-governmental organizations, and business entities in multiple industry sectors, including agriculture, biotechnology, aerospace, defense, legal services, power utilities, and pharmaceutical\". Additionally, this targeting is consistent with targeting activity by Chinese cyber actors.

Researchers have identified a web shell named help.aspx which contained code to help identify endpoint security products such as FireEye xAgent, CarbonBlack, and CrowdStrike Falcon. A second web shell named iisstart.aspx was seen approximately twenty days after the first web shell. This web shell, partially obfuscated, has more capabilities, functions, and is generally more advanced than the previous shell. This particular version allowed for the execution of arbitrary commands and the upload, deletion, and viewing of files. The analysis confirmed the files indicate the signature match for China Chopper. One particular command seen was the attempt to delete the administrator user from Exchange Organizations administrators group. The team verified Microsoft's information regarding the post-exploitation activity such as credential theft by dumping LSASS, the use of 7-zip compression for exfiltration, the use of Exchange PowerShell Snap-ins for the exfiltration of mailbox data, and the use of offensive tools such as Covenant, Nishang, and PowerCat for remote access. Finally, analysis revealed the ever changing naming of the web shell on each intrusion. We will provide further details as they are presented.\n\n  \n\n\n***UPDATE March 6, 2021***\n\nAccording to CISA, Microsoft has released (CISA and Microsoft links below) an updated [script](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/tree/main/Security) for scanning the Exchange log files for IoCs for the vulnerabilities.

In the blog, researchers reveal the tools employed in the attacks to be China Chopper Webshell and ProcDump being used against LSASS. Additionally, the team provided a link for the proof-of-concept code that allows for the exposure to the public internet. \n\n## ***Original Post - Update March 2, 2021***\n\nMultiple zero-day exploits targeting vulnerabilities in on-premises versions Microsoft Exchange servers have been used in attacks in the wild. Microsoft describe the attacks as limited and targeted. According to a report from Volexity, the attacks appear to have started as early as January 6, 2021. The report notes that the attackers are using a remotely exploitable server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability (CVE-2021-26855) to steal the contents of a victim's mailbox. The vulnerability does not require authentication. If the Exchange server is a single machine, the attacker must know the targeted user's domain SID in order to access the mailbox. In multiple server configurations, the attacker only needs the email address of the intended victim. In both cases, the attacker must know the FQDN of the internal Exchange servers. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the server with an XML SOAP payload. Volexity has also observed this attack being conducted on OWA. In addition, Volexity reports that the attackers chained the SSRF vulnerability with a remote code execution vulnerability in the Exchange servers and installed webshells on the compromised servers.\n\nMicrosoft, Volexity, and Dubex have collaborated on this research and attribute the activity to HAFNIUM, a Chinese state-sponsored group. Victimology and TTPs as the basis for attribution. According to Microsoft, HAFNIUM has primarily targeted entities in the United States. The targeted industry sectors include defense contractors, higher education institutions, infectious disease researchers, law firms, NGOs, and policy think tanks. HAFNIUM typically uses leased virtual private servers (VPS) located in the United States to conduct operations.\n\nMicrosoft has issued emergency out of band updates to address these critical vulnerabilities in Exchange. Microsoft is urging customers to update on-premises systems immediately. In keeping with Microsoft's recommendation, IBM also urges customers to immediately patch affected systems.\n\n  * [CVE-2021-26855](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26855) is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Exchange which allowed the attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests and authenticate as the Exchange server.\n  * [CVE-2021-26857](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26857) is an insecure deserialization vulnerability in the Unified Messaging service. Insecure deserialization is where untrusted user-controllable data is deserialized by a program. Exploiting this vulnerability gave HAFNIUM the ability to run code as SYSTEM on the Exchange server. This requires administrator permission or another vulnerability to exploit.\n  * [CVE-2021-26858](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26858) is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange. If HAFNIUM could authenticate with the Exchange server then they could use this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. They could authenticate by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate admin\u2019s credentials.\n  * [CVE-2021-27065](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-27065) is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange. If HAFNIUM could authenticate with the Exchange server then they could use this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. They could authenticate by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate admin\u2019s credentials.\n\n\n\n# CVEs\n\n  * A complete list of CVEs can be found here: [

Further information can be found in the Reference section below or [here](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-102a).\n\n## ***UPDATE March 25, 2021***\n\n  \nUS-CISA and DHS have issued additional information about China Chopper Webshells which may be in use against Microsoft Offline Address books. These latest samples are inline with other samples previously examined. There are subtle differences in the code used for the creation of the shells. We recommend you read the reports and apply any and all patches available as well as examining your environment for any evidence of these or any other potentially nefarious webshells. Further information can be found in the Reference section below or [here](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-084a) and [here](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/analysis-reports/ar21-084b). \n\n## ***UPDATE March 16, 2021***\n\n  \nYesterday, Microsoft released a one-click Exchange On-Premises Mitigation tool. This tool is not designed to replace patching of vulnerable servers, it is merely meant to help those who've not yet had opportunity to patch these systems. This tool includes the latest Microsoft Safety Scanner and will mitigate CVE-2021-26855. The tool performs three operations: mitigate against current known attacks using CVE-2021-26855 using a URL Rewrite configuration, scan the Exchange Server using the Microsoft Safety Scanner, and attempt to reverse any changes made by identified threats. Further detailed guidance can be found in the Reference section below or [here](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/15/one-click-microsoft-exchange-on-premises-mitigation-tool-march-2021/).\n\n## ***UPDATE March 15, 2021***\n\n  \nThe Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency released 7 malware analysis reports on webshells seen throughout its investigation.

We will provide further details as they are presented.\n\n  \n\n\n***UPDATE March 6, 2021***\n\nAccording to CISA, Microsoft has released (CISA and Microsoft links below) an updated [script](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS-Exchange/tree/main/Security) for scanning the Exchange log files for IoCs for the vulnerabilities. We recommend running the script against any Exchange servers within your organization as soon as possible.\n\n## ***UPDATE March 5, 2021***\n\nIBM Security family PAM Content Update [4103.03231](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/xpu/XPU%204103.03231) contains 4 new events, 0 new moderate event responses, and 0 new aggressive event responses. The new signatures, HTTP_Exchange_Cookie_Auth_Bypass, HTTP_Exchange_VirtualDirectory_Cmd_Injection, HTTP_Exchange_Cookie_SSFR, and HTTP_Exchange_VirtualDirectory_Upload, apply to the Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065.\n\n## ***UPDATE #3 March 3, 2021***\n\nCISA has published an alert, AA21-062A, regarding the Exchange vulnerabilities. The URL is located in the Reference section below.\n\n## ***UPDATE #2 March 3, 2021***\n\nAn URL has been added to the Reference section for the Dubex report on the exploit.\n\n## ***UPDATE March 3, 2021***\n\nA blog from Rapid7 contains more details on this zero-day attack and how to address the issues allowing the zero-day to proliferate. In the blog, researchers reveal the tools employed in the attacks to be China Chopper Webshell and ProcDump being used against LSASS. Additionally, the team provided a link for the proof-of-concept code that allows for the exposure to the public internet. \n\n## ***Original Post - Update March 2, 2021***\n\nMultiple zero-day exploits targeting vulnerabilities in on-premises versions Microsoft Exchange servers have been used in attacks in the wild. Microsoft describe the attacks as limited and targeted. According to a report from Volexity, the attacks appear to have started as early as January 6, 2021. The report notes that the attackers are using a remotely exploitable server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability (CVE-2021-26855) to steal the contents of a victim's mailbox. The vulnerability does not require authentication. If the Exchange server is a single machine, the attacker must know the targeted user's domain SID in order to access the mailbox. In multiple server configurations, the attacker only needs the email address of the intended victim. In both cases, the attacker must know the FQDN of the internal Exchange servers. The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the server with an XML SOAP payload. Volexity has also observed this attack being conducted on OWA. In addition, Volexity reports that the attackers chained the SSRF vulnerability with a remote code execution vulnerability in the Exchange servers and installed webshells on the compromised servers.\n\nMicrosoft, Volexity, and Dubex have collaborated on this research and attribute the activity to HAFNIUM, a Chinese state-sponsored group. Victimology and TTPs as the basis for attribution. According to Microsoft, HAFNIUM has primarily targeted entities in the United States. The targeted industry sectors include defense contractors, higher education institutions, infectious disease researchers, law firms, NGOs, and policy think tanks. HAFNIUM typically uses leased virtual private servers (VPS) located in the United States to conduct operations.\n\nMicrosoft has issued emergency out of band updates to address these critical vulnerabilities in Exchange. Microsoft is urging customers to update on-premises systems immediately. In keeping with Microsoft's recommendation, IBM also urges customers to immediately patch affected systems.\n\n  * [CVE-2021-26855](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26855) is a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Exchange which allowed the attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests and authenticate as the Exchange server.\n  * [CVE-2021-26857](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26857) is an insecure deserialization vulnerability in the Unified Messaging service. Insecure deserialization is where untrusted user-controllable data is deserialized by a program. Exploiting this vulnerability gave HAFNIUM the ability to run code as SYSTEM on the Exchange server. This requires administrator permission or another vulnerability to exploit.\n  * [CVE-2021-26858](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26858) is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange. If HAFNIUM could authenticate with the Exchange server then they could use this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. They could authenticate by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate admin\u2019s credentials.\n  * [CVE-2021-27065](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-27065) is a post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange. If HAFNIUM could authenticate with the Exchange server then they could use this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. They could authenticate by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate admin\u2019s credentials.\n\n\n\n# CVEs\n\n  * A complete list of CVEs can be found here: [

During an investigation of an intrusion, Mandiant found that that the initial infection vector was a Trojanized application installer. The installer was downloaded from the legitimate site of a security camera PVR vendor. While Mandiant reported the compromised installers to the vendor, the attackers may also have been able to replace the Trojanized installers. The installer was downloaded in a .zip file and, when extracted and executed, created two files. One was a clean copy of the installer, which functioned normally. The other file launched a URL using the command line. The URL resulted in two more files that leveraged VBScript and PowerShell and attempted to download the SMOKEDHAM dropper. The dropper is used to install the SMOKEDHAM backdoor. Aside from providing the attackers the ability to execute commands on the victim system, it also logs keystrokes and uploads the captured data to a C&C server every five minutes. SMOKEDHAM was also observed downloading UltraVNC and an NGROK utility. UltraVNC was used to download and install a dropper for Cobalt Strike. Data was dumped from the LSASS process and the attackers were observed using RDP to move laterally to other systems. In this case, the attackers were prevented from installing the ransomware payload.

Earlier this year, the owners of this malware commented that they were shutting down operations and putting the source code up for sale. Less than two weeks after this statement, Phorpiex reappeared with some new functionality. It is unclear whether it was sold and redeveloped or if the original threat actors decided to continue development. The main difference was that this new variant was able to function without any C2 servers, operating in a peer-to-peer mode to communicate with other infected machines. The malware also appears to be more successful at using the crypto-stealing technique known as crypto-clipping. This technique replaces any copied cryptocurrency address with the attacker's wallet when pasted. Since the addresses are long and random, the victim doesn't notice the replacement and authorizes the payment to the victim's wallet. The total value of currency stolen this way is almost half a million dollars, with the largest single transaction totaling 26 Etherium. The malware also has a new method for communicating with the C2 server. It uses a custom, encrypted protocol which uses a hash value to guarantee message integrity, which is more sophisticated than the original malware used. This new variant is called 'Twizt' and is steadily increasing in prevalence with most infections occurring in African countries.

The group has used various methods of initial access, starting with phishing links that exploit browser vulnerabilities, but since moving to Trojanized installation packages. Regardless of the initial infection vector, a malicious backdoor is eventually installed on the victim host. It first collections system information, which is sent to a C2 server that, in return, provides commands to be executed.

    "output": "You are asking about a specific threat report. Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nResearchers at Lacework assessed the exploitation of the DDoS botnet Moobot, leveraged by threat actors and used as a payload in order to target vulnerable Docker APIs. Researchers uncovered that Moobot does this by modifying the existing image, running a cron job, then downloading Mirai. According to analysts at Lacework, it can be difficult to differentiate Moobot from the Moobot Mirai-variant due to the identical artifacts. However, analysts at Lacework were able to dissect the two variants by analyzing malware configuration and behavior.

They are a little-known threat actor who has been active since April 2018 and has become known for attacking telecommunications companies and critical systems in the Middle East. Since being originally discovered, researchers have noted that they have replaced their publicly documented payload known as 'DanBot', with new C++ backdoors and a PowerShell script that serve the same purpose. The script was discovered on VirusTotal in November 2020, and using the C2 server, the researchers were able to access the new C++ payloads. There are two main variants of the backdoor, named 'James' and 'Kevin', after the names of directories found with the variants. Both variants communicate with their C2 servers using DNS, but the 'James' variant also allows for communication over HTTP exfiltration. The domains used in the attack attempt to impersonate known services, by using keywords such as 'cloud', 'windows', or 'cdn'. The attackers also host their own nameservers, meaning they can decode the DNS queries received from the malware and respond using commands the malware can understand. Once a machine has been infected, the attackers use commands from the C2 server to perform local reconnaissance. They also drop a Mimikatz-based executable to harvest credentials from Google Chrome. Although this is an individual group, the researchers do comment on the similarities between Lyceum Group and APT34, so there could be a relationship between these groups.

The campaign involves a banking trojan, which is prevalent in South American cybercrime. The trojan will sit on the victim's computer and monitor their online activities.

The initial infection vector is unknown, but it is speculated that this will have come from a phishing campaign or malvertising. From these links, the victims are then redirected to an AWS URL, where an MSI file is downloaded. If the victim runs this file, a secondary C2 server is contacted to download a zip file containing a malicious DLL, as well as other legitimate executables.

As with other Agent Tesla campaigns, the initial infection vector is a phishing email. In this recent campaign, however, the actors have changed to delivering the payload within a .daa file. Interestingly, this file type, Direct Access Archive, cannot be opened on default Windows installations and requires a special tool. If the file is able to be opened by the target, an executable file will be extracted. The executable file is an Agent Tesla payload. It operates as usual except for it now leverages the Telegram API to exfiltrate stolen data. For more information, see the SANS ISC diary in the Reference section.\n\n# Indicators of Compromise\n\n  * A complete list of IoCs can be found here: [ IoCs.txt](/download/attachments/57312711/Agent%20Tesla%20Dropped%20via%20.daa%20Attachment%20IoCs.txt?version=1&modificationDate=1627413384425&api=v2)\n\n\n\n# Recommendations\n\n  * Ensure anti-virus software and associated files are up to date. \n  * Search for existing signs of the indicated IoCs in your environment.\n  * Consider blocking and or setting up detection for all URL and IP based IoCs.\n  * Keep applications and operating systems running at the current released patch level.\n  * Exercise caution with attachments and links in search results.\n\n\n\n# References\n\n  * <https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/27666>"

They initially used brute-forced credentials to access an account, and then enrolled a new device in the organization's MFA. This victim had been unenrolled after being dormant, so the attacker was able to use this to enroll the new device. The attackers then exploited the \"PrintNightmare\" vulnerability to elevate their access. They then disabled MFA for active domain accounts. Using this, the attackers were able to collect more credentials and move laterally to the victim's cloud storage and email, which was the goal of the attack.

      "xfe_report": "# Attack Details\n\n  *  **Threat Type:** Espionage\n  *  **Targets:** American NGO\n  *  **Malware Family/Families:** Unknown\n  *  **Initial Infection Vector:** Compromised Credentials\n  *  **Post-Compromise Actions:** : Data Theft\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nIn early May 2021, the FBI observed Russian state-sponsored actors exploiting MFA protocols and vulnerabilities to gain access to an NGO. They initially used brute-forced credentials to access an account, and then enrolled a new device in the organization's MFA. This victim had been unenrolled after being dormant, so the attacker was able to use this to enroll the new device. The attackers then exploited the \"PrintNightmare\" vulnerability to elevate their access. They then disabled MFA for active domain accounts. Using this, the attackers were able to collect more credentials and move laterally to the victim's cloud storage and email, which was the goal of the attack.

The analysis carried out by Unit 42 suggests that the group developed and maintain the three malware families known as Defray777 ransomware, PyXie RAT, and Vatet loader. The group is reportedly financially motivated and known to have carried out ransomware attacks on organizations in the education, government, healthcare, and technology sectors. In some instances, the group obtained their initial foothold in a victim organization using the well known IcedID or Trickbot banking Trojans. The Vatet loader is used to deliver payloads including PyXie and Cobalt Strike. A version of PyXie Unit 42 refer to as PyXie Lite is used for reconnaissance and to exfiltrate potentially sensitive files from within a victim organization.

The analysis carried out by Unit 42 suggests that the group developed and maintain the three malware families known as Defray777 ransomware, PyXie RAT, and Vatet loader. The group is reportedly financially motivated and known to have carried out ransomware attacks on organizations in the education, government, healthcare, and technology sectors. In some instances, the group obtained their initial foothold in a victim organization using the well known IcedID or Trickbot banking Trojans. The Vatet loader is used to deliver payloads including PyXie and Cobalt Strike. A version of PyXie Unit 42 refer to as PyXie Lite is used for reconnaissance and to exfiltrate potentially sensitive files from within a victim organization.

This ransomware is very unsophisticated, with a low ransom demand, simple encryption routine, and no obfuscation. Upon execution, volume shadow copies are deleted to inhibit recovery. Then the encryption process begins, with the name of every file encrypted being added to a custom registry key. The ransom note dropped on the system requests that victims purchase a prepaid voucher from Paysafecard in order to retrieve their files.

This ransomware is very unsophisticated, with a low ransom demand, simple encryption routine, and no obfuscation. Upon execution, volume shadow copies are deleted to inhibit recovery. Then the encryption process begins, with the name of every file encrypted being added to a custom registry key. The ransom note dropped on the system requests that victims purchase a prepaid voucher from Paysafecard in order to retrieve their files. The purchased voucher codes are requested via a decryption utility that is also dropped by the ransomware.

It also attempts to terminate any processes that might interfere with its encryption of files, such as backup software, monitoring software, or software that may hold files open like database applications. Information, such as user name, computer name, and client key, is sent via email to its command and control server. In addition to deleting shadow copies and disabling recovery mode, Beserker goes the extra mile by attempting to remove backup files based on a list of backup extensions. This does leave open the possibility of deleting data that cannot be restored, such as non-backup data on virtual drives. After a file is encrypted, a \".HOR\" extension is added to the name.

    "output": "You are asking about a specific threat report. Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nThe MapperState malware was found installed in a Confient honeypot. It had been installed by a combination of the OSX/Bundlore loader which installed OSX/Tarmac that in turn installed MapperState. Both MapperState and Tarmac use similar techniques to slow analysis. Of note is that the OSX/Bundlore loader is ARM-compatible and notarized by Apple. Given that MapperState has the ability to download and install other applications, its purpose is probably that of a loader. It also checks for installed anti-virus solutions. Searching for strings obtained from analyzing OSX/Tarmac, Confiant researchers located a flashcards app that had made public OSX/Tarmac Agent and C&C commands. Further searching of flashcards published using the same account led to flashcards containing Hydromac messages that were identical to those in MapperState. This led to the conclusion that MapperState is actually a Hydromac Root Agent. There are also a Hydromac Agent and a Hydromac Agent Plugin.

      "xfe_q": "Hydromac macOS Malware\nConfiant located new macOS malware that, due to the file and C&C server names, they dubbed MapperState. After investigation, it turns out that MapperState is actually a Hydromac Root Agent.",
      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nThe MapperState malware was found installed in a Confient honeypot. It had been installed by a combination of the OSX/Bundlore loader which installed OSX/Tarmac that in turn installed MapperState. Both MapperState and Tarmac use similar techniques to slow analysis. Of note is that the OSX/Bundlore loader is ARM-compatible and notarized by Apple. Given that MapperState has the ability to download and install other applications, its purpose is probably that of a loader. It also checks for installed anti-virus solutions. Searching for strings obtained from analyzing OSX/Tarmac, Confiant researchers located a flashcards app that had made public OSX/Tarmac Agent and C&C commands. Further searching of flashcards published using the same account led to flashcards containing Hydromac messages that were identical to those in MapperState. This led to the conclusion that MapperState is actually a Hydromac Root Agent. There are also a Hydromac Agent and a Hydromac Agent Plugin. It was also found that a C&C server used by older malware named Mughthesec was also used by the Hydromac Agent. Confiant concludes that the Hydromac Root Agent (MapperState), Hydromac Agent, and Mughthesec, have all been used in malware campaigns carried out through malvertising affiliates.

A posting to the Deutsche Telekom blog provides an analysis of a Flubot smishing campaign. Flubot is spread using SMS messages sent to contacts obtained from infected devices. A victim receives an SMS message from someone they know and provides a link. In the recent cases observed by Deutsche Telekom, the SMS messages claimed to be a missed call notification or a notification from DHL. In the past, Flubot campaigns are known to have used other brands such as FedEx and Correos in their SMS messages. Through compromised sites (frequently WordPress blogs) that host redirects, the link in the message leads to a site themed to the service or brand being used in the lure which tells the need victim they need to download and install an app to access the missed call or notification, etc. The theme and lure changed every month or so. The names of the APK files are also changed at certain intervals and hashes of the APK's change frequently. The links are generated per victim and a number of techniques are used to bypass a carrier's SMS content filters. One interesting technique used by Flubot to spread to other countries is having infected devices in one country and sending SMS messages to a neighboring country, in the neighboring countries language.

A number of countries have been affected by this malware. Once a system has been infected, URSA begins collecting passwords from browsers and a number of popular applications. It also creates banking browser overlays to capture the victim's financial credentials. The infection vector for URSA is through phishing or malspam campaigns. Legitimate organizations are spoofed to give the emails credence. The body of the email usually references overdue invoices, as a lure, and requests the victim download the malicious document, normally a zip file, from the Internet via a supplied URL. A MSI file inside the archive drops a VBS file that begins the infection. A second VBS file downloads and executes an AutoIt script that injects the malware into certain DLLs. The VBS files verify that the system is located in specific regions; if not, the infection halts. The article also noted that setting the computer's name to \"JOHN-PC\" also causes the infection to halt and thus might be a potential kill switch for URSA infections.

Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Malware, Ransomware\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nSophos researchers have been analyzing Conti ransomware over the past several months. Through that investigation, the team was able to put together a highly accurate accounting of the actual attack cycle day-by-day as well as some of the rapid growth and development of the ransomware. Conti ransomware has been around since 2020 and has wreaked havoc on systems worldwide. Now, with the help of the Rapid Response team from Sophos, a clearer picture of the TTPs for the group(s) behind the attacking software has been obtained. The authors of the malware have taken great steps toward making the malware difficult to analyze, such as programming reflective loaders that never write the ransomware binary to the file system. By doing so, no artifacts of the actual ransomware remain after infection. Initially, a Cobalt Strike DLL is loaded into system memory. The DLL then calls to the C2 server to retrieve the next stage. This connection allows the first stage to download a Cobalt Strike shellcode loader that contains the reflective instructions. If successful, the C2 server places the ransomware binary onto the server, implants it into the infected machine via the aforementioned reflective loader, and can be removed immediately upon completion of the attack. The attackers also use API-by-hash in order to use hash values to call specific API functions. This keeps analysts from reverse engineering simply. Upon the actual ransomware infection, files are immediately encrypted and connection attempts are made to other machines on the network using SMB. An RSA public key is used to perform the encryption using AES-256 algorithm. The ransomware seems to follow a pattern of daily activity which was analyzed and made into a flowchart as seen in the second of the three reports which can be found in the Reference section below. On Day 1, the ransomware conducts initial access and scans over the course of six hours. This sends a map of basic network topography. Day 2 brings no malicious activity observed. Day 3 is used for data exfiltration and credential gathering. Day 4 is the actual Conti attack using bash scripts to loop through lists of gathered devices in order to load the Cobalt Strike loader on any vulnerable machine. Day 5 had the researchers stop the attack and get the network back to \"normal\". Initial entry was made via public facing application and a domain admin account which had been compromised. Additionally, vulnerable firewalls were exploited. Batch scripts were employed for network scanning and system discovery.

An signed application masquerading as WeChat was installed on a machine, which triggered several behavioral processes, such as code injection, anti-virtualization, and penetration testing framework. This particular incident saw a process executed that, then, spawned another process. The process was identified as being part of the DealPly adware family. Upon execution, the application communicated with remote addresses that have been associated with malicious files. In addition, the process tried to add a root signing certificate as well as download files to the victim. The binary of its child process was placed on the desktop. API calls to VirtualAllocEX, WriteProcessMemory, and CreateRemoteThread were observed in the process of breaking down the code through disassembly. Decoding some of the code revealed XOR decoding and a subsequent injection and execution of a payload.

The majority of the victims in this campaign resided in the US and Europe, with government, military, and manufacturing industries being the most targeted.

They begin by creating a container on a remote host via exposed Docker REST APIs. This container is retrieved from Docker Hub, via accounts either compromised or owned by TeamTNT. Upon deployment these Docker images execute a malicious script that installs various tools to be used for post-compromise activities. These include tools for lateral movement, such as masscan and zmap. Ultimately, TeamTNT will carry out their goal of installing a cryptocurrency miner in order to turn a profit.

They begin by creating a container on a remote host via exposed Docker REST APIs. This container is retrieved from Docker Hub, via accounts either compromised or owned by TeamTNT. Upon deployment these Docker images execute a malicious script that installs various tools to be used for post-compromise activities. These include tools for lateral movement, such as masscan and zmap. Ultimately, TeamTNT will carry out their goal of installing a cryptocurrency miner in order to turn a profit. During these attacks, the threat actors carry out container escapes to gain access to the host system. Persistence is established by adding new SSH key pairs to the authorized_keys file.

At this time, Blackrota only works on Linux. Blackrota is compiled based on geacon. Geacon is a CobaltStrike Beacon written in Go. Using the CobalStrike Beacon, Blackrota can employ CobaltStrike to access and control infected hosts.

The payload is combined with Python and converted to a Windows PE file with PyInstaller. Due to some dependencies related to Python, in its current state the payload will crash when run on a victim system. For the purpose of analysis, the researcher installed the required dependencies. Upon doing so, it is revealed the ransomware masquerades as a tool to fix corrupted DLLs, displaying a window with fake messages related to the discovery and repair of broken DLLs. In the background it is using the Fernet encryption scheme to encrypt user files on the system. The use of Fernet in ransomware is unusual and could cause problems in some cases as it is designed to handle small files and, thus, may exhaust a system if large files are encountered. A public RSA key downloaded from Mediafire is used to encrypt the Fernet key. A ransom note requests the victim emails the operators to obtain a Bitcoin wallet address to be used for payment. During the infection process, the ransomware performs common functionality, such as deleting volume shadow copies, disabling admin tools, and disabling recovery capabilities. Furthermore, persistence is established via the autostart folder. The researchers note the presence of checks for Linux and Darwin environments, but no code that would function properly on such systems. Based on the fact it crashes upon execution, it appears the discovered sample is an early version of the ransomware.

Their report notes that Donot is known for attacking government and military organizations, and individuals, located in a small number of South Asian countries, primarily Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. However, Donot may also attack the embassies of the countries they target in any location. The group, also identified as APT-C-35 and SectorE02, has been active since 2016, and its objective is espionage. Donot typically use spearphishing as the infection vector with one of three functionally different documents attached to the emails. One variant is macros is Excel, PowerPoint, and Word files which use macros to deliver the payload. Another variant is RTF documents with a .doc extension that exploit the Equation Editor vulnerability, CVE\u20112017\u201111882.

Their report notes that Donot is known for attacking government and military organizations, and individuals, located in a small number of South Asian countries, primarily Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. However, Donot may also attack the embassies of the countries they target in any location. The group, also identified as APT-C-35 and SectorE02, has been active since 2016, and its objective is espionage. Donot typically use spearphishing as the infection vector with one of three functionally different documents attached to the emails. One variant is macros is Excel, PowerPoint, and Word files which use macros to deliver the payload. Another variant is RTF documents with a .doc extension that exploit the Equation Editor vulnerability, CVE\u20112017\u201111882. The last variant uses RTF template injection to download another document that exploits the Equation Editor vulnerability. Of the malware analyzed in the report, the malware used in the Gedit campaign was first observed used in attacks in September 2020 with DarkMusical malware being first used in June 2021.

IBM X-Force reported in October 2021 that the threat group ITG23, also known as the TrickBot Gang, had partnered with Shathak in July 2021 to distribute the TrickBot and the BazarLoader malware.

Gallium has historically targeted the telecommunications sector but has expanded its targeting to include the finance and government sectors. According to a report from Palo Alto's Unit42, Gallium is likely to be a Chinese state-sponsored group. The new PingPull RAT used by Gallium comes in three main variants, each of which uses one of three protocols, HTTP(S), ICMP, or raw TCP, for C&C communications. The use of ICMP helps PingPull helps hide its connections to C2 servers as few organizations monitor ICMP traffic. PingPull malware is coded in C++ and gives the threat actor the ability to execute commands and access a reverse shell on compromised hosts.

      "xfe_report": "Summary\n=======\n\n\n\nThreat Details\n==============\n\n* **Malware Type:** Malware, Espionage\n* **Associated Threat Actors:** Gallium, aka Softcell\n* **Associated Payloads:** PingPull RAT\n* **Targets:** Organizations in the government, finance, and telecommunications sectors located in Africa, Europe, and Southeast Asia.\n* **Initial Infection Vector:** Unspecified\n* **Post-Compromise Actions:** Collection and exfiltration of information\n* **Additional TTPs:**See the MITRE ATT&CK Framework below.\n\nOverview\n========\n\nGallium is a threat group that has been targeting organizations in Africa, Europe, and Southeast Asia. Gallium has historically targeted the telecommunications sector but has expanded its targeting to include the finance and government sectors. According to a report from Palo Alto's Unit42, Gallium is likely to be a Chinese state-sponsored group. The new PingPull RAT used by Gallium comes in three main variants, each of which uses one of three protocols, HTTP(S), ICMP, or raw TCP, for C&C communications. The use of ICMP helps PingPull helps hide its connections to C2 servers as few organizations monitor ICMP traffic. PingPull malware is coded in C++ and gives the threat actor the ability to execute commands and access a reverse shell on compromised hosts. Further information is available from the link in the References section below.\n\nIndicators of Compromise\n========================\n\nAssociated indicators of compromise are provided alongside this report.\n\nRecommendations\n===============\n\n* For a list of mitigative recommendations, please see the MITRE ATT&CK Framework matrix below.\n\nReferences\n==========\n\n* [https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/pingpull-gallium/](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/pingpull-gallium/ \"Follow link\")\n\nMITRE ATT&CK Framework\n======================\n\n**Tactics and Techniques:**\n\n**Resource Development - TA0042**  \n\u00a0T1583 - Acquire Infrastructure  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1583.004 - Server  \n\u00a0T1588 - Obtain Capabilities  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1588.002 - Tool  \n\n**Initial Access - TA0001**  \n\u00a0T1078 - Valid Accounts  \n\u00a0T1133 - External Remote Services  \n\u00a0T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application  \n\n**Execution - TA0002**  \n\u00a0T1047 - Windows Management Instrumentation  \n\u00a0T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1053.005 - Scheduled Task  \n\u00a0T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1059.001 - PowerShell  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1059.003 - Windows Command Shell  \n\n**Persistence - TA0003**  \n\u00a0T1078 - Valid Accounts  \n\u00a0T1136 - Create Account  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1136.002 - Domain Account  \n\u00a0T1505 - Server Software Component  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1505.003 - Web Shell  \n\u00a0T1574 - Hijack Execution Flow  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1574.002 - DLL Side-Loading  \n\n**Defense Evasion - TA0005**  \n\u00a0T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1027.002 - Software Packing  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1027.005 - Indicator Removal from Tools  \n\u00a0T1036 - Masquerading  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1036.003 - Rename System Utilities  \n\u00a0T1550 - Use Alternate Authentication Material  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1550.002 - Pass the Hash  \n\u00a0T1553 - Subvert Trust Controls  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1553.002 - Code Signing  \n\n**Credential Access - TA0006**  \n\u00a0T1003 - OS Credential Dumping  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1003.001 - LSASS Memory  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1003.002 - Security Account Manager  \n\n**Discovery - TA0007**  \n\u00a0T1016 - System Network Configuration Discovery  \n\u00a0T1018 - Remote System Discovery  \n\u00a0T1033 - System Owner/User Discovery  \n\u00a0T1049 - System Network Connections Discovery  \n\n**Lateral Movement - TA0008**  \n\u00a0T1570 - Lateral Tool Transfer  \n\n**Collection - TA0009**  \n\u00a0T1005 - Data from Local System  \n\u00a0T1074 - Data Staged  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1074.001 - Local Data Staging  \n\u00a0T1560 - Archive Collected Data  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1560.001 - Archive via Utility  \n\n**Exfiltration - TA0010**  \n\u00a0T1041 - Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  \n\n**Command and Control - TA0011**  \n\u00a0T1071 - Application Layer Protocol  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1071.001 - Web Protocols  \n\u00a0T1090 - Proxy  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1090.002 - External Proxy  \n\u00a0T1105 - Ingress Tool Transfer  \n\u00a0T1573 - Encrypted Channel  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0T1573.002 - Asymmetric Cryptography  \n\n**Mitigations:**\n\n**M1013:**\u00a0\u00a0Application Developer Guidance: This mitigation describes any guidance or training given to developers of applications to avoid introducing security weaknesses that an adversary may be able to take advantage of.  \n**M1015:**\u00a0\u00a0Active Directory Configuration - Configure Active Directory to prevent use of certain techniques;

Below is the information I have about the given report\n\n# Threat Type\n\n  * Ransomware Group\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nA mere 2 months after a self-imposed shutdown, REvil is back on the ransomware scene and already wreaking havoc. According to its Happy Blog, the group has resumed attacking organizations and leaking exfiltrated data on the Dark Web. The group has reactivated its Tor payment/negotiation and data leak sites. According to Bleeping Computer, all victims previously attacked had their payment timers reset in order to pay the ransom or risk the sensitive data being leaked. The group has published screenshots of new victim data on its data leak site. Over the past year, the group has attacked at least 360 US-based organizations according to Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow. The group claimed, in a chat between what is believed to be a security researcher and a representative of the group, they simply took a break.

      "xfe_report": "# Threat Type\n\n  * Ransomware Group\n\n\n\n\n# Overview\n\nA mere 2 months after a self-imposed shutdown, REvil is back on the ransomware scene and already wreaking havoc. According to its Happy Blog, the group has resumed attacking organizations and leaking exfiltrated data on the Dark Web. The group has reactivated its Tor payment/negotiation and data leak sites. According to Bleeping Computer, all victims previously attacked had their payment timers reset in order to pay the ransom or risk the sensitive data being leaked. The group has published screenshots of new victim data on its data leak site. Over the past year, the group has attacked at least 360 US-based organizations according to Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow. The group claimed, in a chat between what is believed to be a security researcher and a representative of the group, they simply took a break. The previous \"leader\" of REvil, \"UNKN\" or \"UNK\", has disappeared, according to the operator during the chat session. With the group being back in action, some of the victims previously attacked have a chance to get their data back after a leaked decryptor was found to be ineffective.
