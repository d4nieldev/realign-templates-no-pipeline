This behavior involved highly sophisticated methods and hitherto unseen malware, suggesting that this is a very capable threat group. The researchers have traced this activity back to July 2020. As this is a long-standing operation, with advanced capabilities and no known affinity to existing threat groups, the researchers have named this group GhostEmperor. This group has been observed using several initial infection vectors, but most commonly, they exploit public-facing servers to gain initial access. They have recently been observed exploiting the ProxyLogon vulnerability. Once initial access is gained, the group deploys a series of malware starting with a PowerShell dropper, which installs the second stage as a service and executes it. This second stage then initiates a third stage payload as an in-memory implant. The third stage is in charge of facilitating a communication channel with a C2 server, where traffic can be masqueraded under the guise of legitimate communications with a benign service. The final stage is injected into the winlogon.exe process by the previous stage, which provides the attacker remote control over the system. In addition to the final stage, the implant also deploys a Windows kernel-mode driver which serves as a rootkit with the sole purpose of concealing malware artifacts. Analysts have named this rootkit Demodex, as it has not been seen before.

Data exfiltration is done by archiving a folder of copied files using 7Zip and sending it back to the attackers using MEGASync. The threat actors will also move laterally across a network before carrying out their ransomware attack. They do this using legitimate tools, such as PsExec or WMI."

If the QR code fails, the victim is asked to provide their mobile number and they will receive an SMS message with the download link. The app contains the Cerberus Android malware. Cerberus is used by Ursnif\u2019s operators to receive two-factor authentication codes sent by banks. Ursnif allows the attacker to change the international bank account number (IBAN) and bank identifier code (BIC) numbers from legitimate transactions to an IBAN of an account under the attacker's control."

    "instruction": "Phishing, Sweepstakes, Delivery Scams for 2021\n\nFrom late-December 2020 to early-January 2021, threat actors have employed several campaigns meant to trick victims into providing sensitive information in exchange for several scam \"prizes\" being promised. One such scam is a sweepstakes scam that promises unlimited access to 100,000 e-books. Using a countdown clock to create urgency among victims, the campaign leads to a landing page promising no necessary purchase; however in order to obtain the promised books, the victim must enter personal information and credit card information. Once the victim enters their information, they are directed to a page which states the submission was unsuccessful. At this point, it appears the details provided have already been sent to the attacker. A second scam is a fake money transfer scam. In this attack, a phishing email is used to provide the victim with a specific amount of money in exchange for personal information requested on a linked page. The landing page contains a generic bank name and requests name and credit card details. Once the credentials are provided, the victim is redirected to a legitimate transaction verification services. Once this verification is complete, an error message is displayed stating the payment was declined. A third campaign involves the use of fake payment service sites. This campaign siphons credit card information. A phishing email is used as the delivery mechanism for the payment service website. The user agrees to pay a certain amount, and, again, a verification service is used to test the validity of the credit card. Once the information is entered, there is no indication on the success or failure of the payment. Finally, two scams involving Taiwanese targets have been observed. Using UPS Taiwan as the phishing service, the promise of a delivery in exchange for a held package is used. Upon payment, the victim is taken to a secondary page which contains a fake SMS verification page. If the victim enters any number in the SMS key field, an infinitely loading page is displayed. Finally, threat actors are using Taiwan and Singapore's postal service to request financial information before a package can be delivered.

The applications varied from messaging applications to document scanners to wallpapers. Once installed on the device, the application requests notification, contact, and phone access, then proceeds to operate as advertised. In the background, however, the app downloads two additional payloads. The first payload is hosted at a shortened URL and simply retrieves the second payload from a remote server. This second payload is the Joker malware in the form of an .mp3 file. It is capable of obtaining notification access and retrieving SMS data. If the device has a country code associated with Thailand, the user is also unknowingly subscribed to premium services. Quick Heal reported the eight identified malicious applications to Google who have since removed them from the official Play Store."

The research has shown that an unverified user can bypass paying for some premium features. The attacker could also have the ability to dump the entire user-base with pictures. Some of the techniques have been mitigated, while others remain. Part of a mitigated issue is the use of sequential user IDs by Bumble as well as updating its encryption scheme. Additionally, providing distance to other users is no longer possible, which eliminates the possibility of using triangulation to locate a specific user. One technique is using an endpoint to obtain Facebook likes, pictures, and other profile information. One limitation is the attack must have the encrypted user ID available to them or one which they own. It is suspected that Bumble will address this vulnerability in the coming days. Bypassing other premium features is still functional. The use of REST APIs for inter-application communication can allow client-side communication in a stateless form. Using the Burp Suite, the team was able to explore API calls and perform the necessary functions to trigger the unintentional data leak. \n\n## Unlimited Votes\n\nBumble's mobile app limits the number of \"swipes\" a non-premium user can use per day. The request is done through an action called SERVER_ENCOUNTERS_VOTE. If the options are manipulated, an attacker could receive unlimited votes during a 24-hour period. Since there is no check on the APIs, the web application user could achieve this rather easily. \n\n## Backtrack\n\nShould a user accidentally swipe left (deny) a prospective match, the backtrack function allows for removing the parameter for exclusion.

Weave Scope is a legitimate, open-source tool used to administer cloud environments, including Docker deployments. The infection chain of this attack involves first compromising an environment via an exposed Docker API port. A new privileged container is deployed with a vanilla Ubuntu image and mounted to the filesystem of the victim server. As is common with TeamTNT campaigns, several cryptominers are subsequently downloaded and executed on the container. Root access to the victim server is then obtained by creating a local privileged user and connecting back via SSH.

      "overview": "TeamTNT Abuses Weave Scope Tool\n\nIntezer has published a blog post analyzing recent TeamTNT activity that involves the use of Weave Scope. Weave Scope is a legitimate, open-source tool used to administer cloud environments, including Docker deployments. The infection chain of this attack involves first compromising an environment via an exposed Docker API port. A new privileged container is deployed with a vanilla Ubuntu image and mounted to the filesystem of the victim server. As is common with TeamTNT campaigns, several cryptominers are subsequently downloaded and executed on the container. Root access to the victim server is then obtained by creating a local privileged user and connecting back via SSH. With this access, Weave Scope is downloaded and installed, allowing the attackers to connect to a dashboard over HTTP. This dashboard provides visibility and control over the victim's entire cloud infrastructure, allowing them to issue shell commands without deploying malicious backdoor code to the server.

This RAT family was first seen in use by the SideCopy APT and has recently been used increasingly in targeting of Indian government agencies. The infection chain begins with a malicious ZIP archive attached to a spear phishing email. The ZIP file downloads a remotely-hosted HTA file that results in the creation and execution of either a JavaScript or Batch file. The JavaScript file was observed creating persistence via the Startup folder, while the Batch script established persistence via a Registry Run key.

The vulnerability was discovered by a researcher from Nao Sec who found a malicious Word document that had been uploaded to Virustotal and contained code to exploit the vulnerability. Further research by Kevin Beaumont notes that a \u00a0remote template feature in Word is used to retrieve an HTML file from a remote server. In turn, the HTML file calls MSDT using the URL protocol. Beaumont also notes that macros do not need to be enabled for the malicious code in the Word document to execute and if the document is changed to the RTF format, it can be executed by previewing the file. Microsoft has issued an advisory and a guide on mitigating the vulnerability."

Conti ransomware has been around since 2020 and has wreaked havoc on systems worldwide. Now, with the help of the Rapid Response team from Sophos, a clearer picture of the TTPs for the group(s) behind the attacking software has been obtained. The authors of the malware have taken great steps toward making the malware difficult to analyze, such as programming reflective loaders that never write the ransomware binary to the file system. By doing so, no artifacts of the actual ransomware remain after infection. Initially, a Cobalt Strike DLL is loaded into system memory. The DLL then calls to the C2 server to retrieve the next stage. This connection allows the first stage to download a Cobalt Strike shellcode loader that contains the reflective instructions. If successful, the C2 server places the ransomware binary onto the server, implants it into the infected machine via the aforementioned reflective loader, and can be removed immediately upon completion of the attack. The attackers also use API-by-hash in order to use hash values to call specific API functions. This keeps analysts from reverse engineering simply.

With backdoors installed on the system, the attacker injects additional malicious code into WordPress files. Possible final goals include cryptomining, SEO spam, or leasing access to a botnet. Both threat actors are adding password protection to the vulnerable file in order to prevent other attackers from infecting the server, allowing them to maintain control. Numerous additional threat actors have been observed, but these two actors are most prevalent and most successful."

      "overview": "TAG-22 Campaign Targets Multiple Geographies and Sectors\n\nIn June, Recorded Future's Insikt Group identified a suspected Chinese state-sponsored actor targeting organizations in Nepal, the Philippines, and Taiwan. In the past, the actor has also targeted Hong Kong. The targeted organizations are in the academic, government, research and development, and telecommunications sectors. Insikt refers to the actor as Threat Activity Group 22 (TAG-22). According to the Insikt report, initial access to the victims was from compromised GlassFish servers from which they ran the Acunetix web security scanner. The initial foothold in the victims was likely obtained using Cobalt Strike or a custom Cobalt Strike loader. They arrived at the victim in one of two forms, executable files disguised as Office and PDF files, or actual documents containing malicious macros. Once a foothold was obtained, malware including the ShadowPad, Spyder, and Winnti backdoors, were deployed. Data was exfiltrated from the victim systems. There are overlaps, including in infrastructure and malware, with other suspected Chinese state-sponsored actors in the TAG-22 activity."

The researchers have been able to locate and analyze the installer, loader, and main payload, a backdoor with a TorSocket DLL. Although the backdoor has been in use since late-2018, the initial compromise vector is still unknown. Among the capabilities of the backdoor are file exfiltration, timestomping, information gathering, and other backdoor functionality. ESET has surmised the most likely intent of the operation is espionage. The Vyveva backdoor share code similarities with older Lazarus samples. For example, the Vyveva backdoor uses fake TLS in communication, command line execution chains, and encryption and Tor services. ESET can, with high confidence, attribute this activity to Lazarus. The presence of Vyveva indicates an earlier dropper which has not yet been identified. The installer creates a service for persistence of the backdoor loader and the storage of embedded, default backdoor configuration within the registry. The backdoor itself is the main component of Vyveva. This backdoor connects to the C2 servers and executes commands as issued by the threat actors. In their analysis, the researchers were able to identify 23 commands, most being ordinary commands used for file and process operations or information gathering. It also has the ability to upload files and exfiltrate directories recursively. Additionally, the backdoor can also filter on specific file types, such as Office documents only. Configuration is set by the installer and is read from a registry value created by the installer. If the configuration is modified by a C2 server command, the registry is subsequently updated.

With the miner in place, the operators will begin to receive mined Monero currency to the configured wallets."

      "overview": "Chinese Threat Group Using Security Software To Load Malware\n\nSentinel Labs has observed a threat group known as 'Moshen Dragon' utilizing a trial-and-error process to sideload malicious DLLs. The group is operating in Central Asia and primarily operates as a cyberespionage group. The group attempted to use search-order hijacking to get security software to execute a malicious DLL rather than a legitimate one. This DLL would decrypt a malicious encrypted payload stored in the same folder. The researchers observed the actors attempting to exploit five different security products, showing that they were persistent when the technique did not work the first time, and were not put off by detections from security software. The payloads were variants of ShadowPad and PlugX malware. Once a foothold was established, the threat actors moved laterally using Impacket and installed a backdoor which was used to harvest credentials and exfiltrate data."

The targeted organizations are in specific verticals that include the healthcare, manufacturing, military, and software sectors. The objective of the campaign is to steal a victim's Office365 and Outlook credentials. The emails is crafted to appear to come from the victim's company and contains an attached HTML file. When the victim opens the HTML file it redirects them to a Captcha page that utilizes the Google reCAPTCHA technique. Once the Captcha has been passed the victim is presented with a fake Office365 login page. Credentials entered into the page are passed to the attacker."

This group is connected to Hamas and is using new malware and infrastructure to stage attacks against their targets. The attack starts with a fake profile on Facebook which is leveraged to trick individuals into downloading trojanized direct message applications. The accounts are months old and appear to be authentic. The victims are also tricked into downloading a .rar file that contains new malware, called Barbie Downloader. This will then download and install a new backdoor, called BarbWire. The file also contains a private video to distract the user from the malware installation. The attacker also attempts to infect the victim's phone with the malware VolatileVenom to ensure they can monitor all activity."

Bumblebee is typically distributed using spearphishing emails that contain a link to download an ISO file from OneDrive. The Cyble report provides examples of two ISO files, the first of which contains a .lnk and a .dat file. The .lnk file is used to execute rundll32.exe to load the content of the .dat file. The second example contains three files, a .lnk file, a password-protected 7zip archive, and a copy of 7z.exe. In this case, the .lnk file is used to execute PowerShell which in turn executes 7z.exe to extract a DLL from the archive and execute it using rundll32.exe. In both cases, the executed DLL is the Bumblebee payload. Bumblebee has a number of features to avoid detection including the use of various injection techniques and checks for debugging and virtual environments.

      "overview": "BLISTER Malware Campaign\n\nElastic published a blog post analyzing a new malware loader, BLISTER, that is leveraged by its operator(s) to execute secondary payloads in memory. The researchers uncovered a valid code signing certificate, the use of which reduces the chance of detection by security defenses. The BLISTER payload is highly obfuscated and has a low detection rate according to VirusTotal. The malicious code is embedded within legitimate DLLs for an additional layer of obfuscation. It is written to the victim host by a simple dropper and then executed using rundll32 for signed binary proxy execution. Upon execution, the malware sleeps for 10 minutes prior to running its malicious code, likely to evade sandbox analysis. Persistence is established by a LNK file ini the Startup folder. No information is provided regarding the initial infection vector or secondary payloads."

A number of actions are carried out including terminating processes that communicate with certain ports, the objective being to kill off processes that may be competing crypto-miners or bots. Persistence is achieved using cron entries. The presence of a Windows executables on an FTP server from which the malware's payloads are downloaded suggests that Windows systems are also being targeted."

This instance used the RIG exploit kit to disseminate Raccoon Stealer. A second malvertiser (malsmoke) has been tracked for months and uses Smoke Loader malware. The actor placed their malicious ad on the xhamster.com website. This campaign used a different and more sophisticated redirection technique with client-side fingerprinting and connectivity checks in an effort to target only legitimate IP addresses. For this attack, both Raccoon Stealer and ZLoader were downloaded and deployed. This group has a propensity to switch ad networks with rapid pace to continually perform its malvertising campaigns. Due to the continued use of Internet Explorer, it is suspected that these attacks and campaigns will continue using the aforementioned CVEs."

Spectre is a Linux exploit, although there is a Windows version available. The binary has stripped its -h option and leaves a #define in order to avoid detection; however, files to leak or the kernel base address are still present. The authors have not taken the logging function out completely, which leaves strings that help in the reversing process. The exploit is a four-stage process. The first step is to find the superblock. The second step is to find inode of the file to dump. Third is to find the corresponding page address. Finally, the exploit dumps the content of the file in question. The default option is the /etc/shadow file. The content of this file is dumped into memory which only takes a couple of minutes to perform. The exploit checks for SMAP, and, if found, the process is aborted. The exploit uses cpuid as a serializing instruction, rdtsc for timing, and mfence / lfence as barriers. KASLR is bypassed by looking at /proc/kallsyms if available to unprivileged users or by using a generic prefetch side-channel. This method still works in up-to-date Linux installations.

    "instruction": "A Fake Cryptocurrency Exchange and an Advance Fee Fraud\n\nAn advance-fee fraud, identified by researchers from Proofpoint, uses a fake cryptocurrency exchange to scam victims. Advance fee frauds, often referred to as 419 scams, operate by promising the victim, a large, often huge return, for a small up-front payment from the victim. The victim of course never receives anything. In the scams that Proofpoint identified, low-volume email campaigns are used to reach potential victims. In the sample email provided in the Proofpoint report, the email advises the victim that their Bitcoin wallet has been funded with 28.85 BTC, and provides the fake cryptocurrency exchange URL, and a username and password. If the victim logs in with the credentials, they are prompted to change their password and add a phone number for account recovery purposes. After completing these steps, the victim will then receive an automated call that provides them a one-time password used to enable the security feature. Proofpoint identified two numbers used to make these calls, one from the UK, and one from the US. When the victim enters the password they receive a confirmation message that the account has now been secured. From the victim's perspective, it appears they have just taken control of the account. The fake site even has some fake messages between the alleged original owner of the account and the exchange's customer support team. If the victim tries to transfer bitcoins, the exchange tells them that the first transfer from the account must be for the amount of 0.0001 BTC. This is claimed to be for testing purposes. If the victim lodges the transfer request, after a period of time, the request will appear to have concluded successfully. The trap is sprung when the victim attempts to make further transfers. If they attempt a transfer of any amount of bitcoins they will be advised that when the account was created, the minimum transfer amount was set to 29.029 BTC. So to the victim, it would appear that if they transfer an amount of bitcoin required to bring the account balance up to the required amount, they would then be able to transfer the full amount to their personal wallet. The amount required would be 0.0291 BTC or more, a little over $1,350 at today's exchange rate. Of course, if the victim does make the transfer, they will still not be able to transfer the bitcoin from the account.\nSummarize the aforementioned description in one paragraph.",

The forums and repos have gone so far as to ban any ransomware ads placed on the sites. Any type of ad touting ransomware is removed. Leading the way in this effort is the XSS Russian-speaking forum. RaaS gangs such as REvil, LockBit, DarkSide, Netwalker, Nefilim, Babuk, and others have been using these forums to recruit new members, partners, and affiliates. The owner of XSS feels that ransomware is bringing \"unwanted attention to the site and has become dangerous and toxic,\" according to a quote obtained by Bleeping Computer.

This occurs if WPAD services are enabled without a WPAD URL set up for the victim network, causing WPAD to iterate over the subdomains until it is able to resolve wpad.id. From that domain, a wpad.dat file is executed; in this case, it's a JavaScript exploit script. CVE-2019-1367 is exploited by this JavaScript file in order to execute shellcode. The shellcode then kicks off an attack chain with multiple stages involving PowerShell and MSI files hosted at remote URLs. Exploited vulnerabilities included CVE-2020-1054 and CVE-2018-8120, as well as an exploit for MS15-051. As with the previous campaign analyzed by Trend Micro, the threat actors once again leveraged Cloudflare proxies."

The vulnerabilities are due to a failure to properly validate user provided input, a missing token check, improper handling of usernames and blacklist configuration, a failure to remove sensitive data, and a failure to respect access levels. If successfully exploited, the vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to carry out CSRF and SQL injection attacks and obtain sensitive data. Updating to the new version, 3.9.23, addresses the vulnerabilities."

Researchers from Insikt Group at Recorded Future have analyzed the malware and published a comprehensive report on the malware's capabilities. The infostealer has been distributed since early 2020 by a group known as \"REDGlade\" or \"Glade\". According to these actors, there are two subscription licenses available - a lifetime license for 800 dollars, or monthly service for 150 dollars. This malware is normally distributed via phishing emails, as well as over social media. It has also been found masquerading as legitimate programs, including as an installer for Telegram. Once installed, the malware can perform a wide array of functions. At its core, it can steal usernames, passwords, cookies, saved credentials, and credit card information from browsers. It can also gather files from cryptocurrency cold wallets and other locations. Beyond that, RedLine Stealer is capable of performing basic download and execute functions, meaning it can be used as a loader in a multi-stage attack. RedLine is being continually developed by a competent C# developer, and so new versions of this malware are being released regularly.

The TFlower ransomware is deployed using the MATA backdoor, which is a well-known Lazarus commodity. The latest variant has not previously been seen in campaigns to this point. In addition to the MATA backdoor, the threat actors behind TFlower employ MATA in order to clear forensic evidence and evade detection through identifying and tampering with security products that may be installed on the target system. The MATA backdoor consists of a three-pronged approach - an initial loader (EXE), loader (DLL), and the payload (DAT).

The loader then decrypts the payload stored within the DAT file, which is loaded on startup or when the AddSecurityPackage Windows API function is called.

The malicious code was included due to APKPure's implementation of an SDK from an unverified source that turned out to be adware. The malicious code added by the SDK decrypts and launches a payload when the app store is opened. Device information is then collected and sent to a C2 server. In response, the C2 can issue commands to display ads on the device, intrusively open browser pages with ads, or download and execute additional modules. When executed by Kaspersky researchers, the Trojan attempted to sign the victim up for paid subscriptions and displayed highly intrusive ads. Combined with outdated OS versions, the malware is capable of installing additional payloads on the system partition, resulting in unremovable malware. APKPure has updated their app store to remove the malicious code, but this requires users to install the clean version of the app to rid the device of the malicious code."

The archive contains an executable file which is the Bandook payload. Proofpoint has located two variants of Bandook used in the campaigns. Bandook achieves persistence through a Registry run key. C&C communications are encrypted using AES in CFB mode, a hardcoded key, and an initialization vector that differs from the publicly available versions of Bandook."

      "overview": "The Warsaw Banking Trojan and Horus Eyes RAT\n\nAccording to a posting on the Seguranca-Inform\u00e1tica blog, Warsaw is a new .NET banking Trojan developed in and targeting Latin America. The infection chain begins with a victim downloading an executable file that contains the Warsaw Trojan. Additionally, it downloads and installs a second-stage payload, a customized variant Horus Eyes RAT (source-code available on Github) that provides typical RAT features including the ability to steal credentials. Once installed, Warsaw sends a basic profile of the system to a Telegram bot which notifies the malware's operators that a system has been infected. From that point, the operators can then take control of the system using the Horus Eyes RAT. Horus Eyes connects to the operator's AWS instance using a hard-coded ngrok TCP URL. Few details of the operation on the banking Trojan are provided, however, it is noted that foreground windows are captured by matching the substring \u201csantander\u201d."

Some of the IPs were targeted repeatedly with success in exploiting these IPs. Most of the activity covered in the report occurred between March and May 2021.

According to the report, nearly 50,000 IPs have been compromised as a result of this targeting and the subsequent attacks by TeamTNT. Some of the IPs were targeted repeatedly with success in exploiting these IPs. Most of the activity covered in the report occurred between March and May 2021. According to ISP lists, most of the targeted nodes/IPs were located in China and the US. Other countries were targeted but with 71% coming from China and the US, it can be assumed these countries were the main targets of the attacks. Initially, the bash history is disabled and environment variables are set for C2 server communication. The script used to disable bash history is also used to install two free, open-source tools - masscan and Zgrab. Also installed are a crypto miner and XMRig Monero miner. Additionally, an IRC bot is installed, similar to Kaiten. Using Masscan, the threat actor checks for any host with port 10250 open. This port is part of the Kubelet API and is open by default. The Kubelet server lists running pods, thus giving the attacker a target of opportunity. The API is then set to update the package index of the container, instal bash, wget, and curl, download a shell script, and begin the mining process for Monero cryptocurrency. The pwn function within the script subsequently attempts to find new targets in much the same way a worm would behave."

The HTML form element is the container for the payload. It is concealed using syntax that is strongly reminiscent of the correct usage of the <svg> element. The actors have implemented a seemingly benign social media company's images. Research has shown six separate companies being used in the campaign. Those are Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and Pinterest. The decoder interprets and executes the payload, which does not need to be injected in the same location as said payload.

The malware is delivered through paid malvertising using ads that offer cracked software which leads to archive files containing malicious binaries.

The dropper also uses PowerShell to add exclusions for the folder into which the files were copied, and specific file names, to Windows Defender. The second stage's task is to achieve persistence which it does by creating a Registry run key, and creating a service named pubgame-updater which runs periodically. The second stage concludes with the downloading of what Bitdefender describes as a malware sprayer.

It was first detected in November 2021 in Latin America and uses several evasion techniques to avoid detection. Symbiote does not run as an executable but instead is a shared object that is loaded into all running processes, which it uses to perform malicious activity. To avoid detection, the malware removes itself from any output commands that list port information, running processes, and files. The researchers assess that this malware, in addition to hiding malicious activity on the machine, is also intended to steal credentials and provide remote access to the attacker. Stolen credentials are encrypted and stored locally, as well as exfiltrated using DNS tunneling. Domain names used by the attackers are impersonations of some major Brazillian banks.
