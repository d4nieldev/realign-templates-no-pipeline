Single-Use Reply Blocks (SURBs) play a crucial role in allowing anonymous recipients to decode messages, as they encode a half-path to the recipient.

      "question": "How does Mixminion ensure anonymity for both senders and recipients when transmitting messages, and what is the role of Single-Use Reply Blocks (SURBs) in this process?",
      "answer": "Mixminion ensures anonymity for senders and recipients by using a mix network architecture, where messages are broken down into packets, padded to a uniform size, and sent through a series of servers (mixes) with encryption. Each packet is encrypted with the public keys of the servers in its path, but no single mix can see the entire path. Single-Use Reply Blocks (SURBs) play a crucial role in allowing anonymous recipients to decode messages, as they encode a half-path to the recipient. Each mix in the sequence can unwrap a single layer of the path and encrypt the message for the recipient, allowing the recipient to learn which SURB was used without the sender knowing which recipient has received the anonymous message."

      "answer": "Clef stores users' encrypted passwords in private accounts on its servers. This means that the passwords are not stored in plain text, which adds an extra layer of security and helps protect users' personal information. Additionally, because Clef requires a second form of verification (access to data on the user's mobile phone) to confirm their identity, even if an attacker were to gain access to a user's encrypted password, they would still need to bypass the mobile verification step in order to successfully log in to the user's account."
