    "instruction": "Operation Sundevil\n\n==Introduction==\nOperation Sundevil was a 1990 nationwide United States Secret Service crackdown on \"illegal computer hacking activities.\" It involved raids in approximately fifteen different cities and resulted in three arrests and the confiscation of computers, the contents of electronic bulletin board systems (BBSes), and floppy disks. It was revealed in a press release on May 9, 1990. The arrests and subsequent court cases resulted in the creation of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The operation is now seen as largely a public-relations stunt. Operation Sundevil has also been viewed as one of the preliminary attacks on the Legion of Doom and similar hacking groups. The raid on Steve Jackson Games, which led to the court case Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service, is often attributed to Operation Sundevil, but the Electronic Frontier Foundation states that it is unrelated and cites this attribution as a media error.The name comes from the Sun Devil Stadium of Arizona State University, near the local Secret Service headquarters from where the investigation and raids were coordinated.\n\n== Background ==\nPrior to 1990, people who manipulated telecommunication systems, known as phreakers, were generally not prosecuted within the United States. The majority of phreakers used software to obtain calling card numbers and built simple tone devices in order to make free telephone calls. A small elite, highly technical segment of phreakers were more interested in information about the inner workings of the telecommunication system than in making free phone calls. Phone companies complained of financial losses from phreaking activities. The switch from analog to digital equipment began to expose more of the inner workings of  telephone companies as hackers began to explore the switches and trunks. Due to a lack of laws and expertise on the part of American law enforcement, few cases against hackers were prosecuted until Operation Sundevil.However, starting in 1989, the US Secret Service (USSS), which had been given authority from Congress to deal with access device fraud as an extension of wire fraud investigations under Title 18 (\u00a7 1029), began to investigate. Over the course of the 18-month-long investigation, the USSS gathered alleged evidence of rampant credit card and calling card fraud over state lines.Operation Sundevil allowed multiple federal law enforcement agencies, particularly the Secret Service and the FBI, to gain valuable expertise on fighting this new form of criminal activity as well as expanding the agencies' budgets. New laws were created to allow federal prosecutors to charge individuals accused of phreaking, hacking, wire, and credit card fraud. Evidence gained from Operation Sundevil allowed law enforcement to convince the United States Congress of the need for additional funding, training, and overall expansion.\n\n== Action ==\nAlong with the Chicago Task Force and the Arizona Organized Crime and Racketeering Bureau, the operation involved raids in Austin, Plano, Cincinnati, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Newark, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Richmond, Tucson, San Diego, San Jose, San Francisco, and Seattle. The raids were centered in Arizona, where the press conference occurred.Raids generally took place in middle-class suburbs and targeted credit card thieves and telephone abusers. They were carried out by local police, with the aid of over 150 Secret Service agents, FBI and CIA. Twenty-seven search warrants, resulting in three arrests, were issued and executed on May 7 and 8, 1990. Police also took around 42 computers and approximately 25 BBSes, including some of the most infamous and elite hacking BBSs in the world at that time, such as Cloud Nine. This was the largest crackdown on electronic bulletin boards in world history. Finally, about 23,000 floppy disks were also seized. These held a variety of data, including software, phreaking and hacking tools, tens of thousands of credit card details, and a plethora of illegal copyrighted material. The three people arrested were \"Tony the Trashman,\" \"Dr. Ripco,\" and \"Electra.\"Other parts of the operation targeted the underground ezine Phrack, which had published the contents of a proprietary text file copied from BellSouth computers and containing information about the E911 emergency response system, although this was later made null in a court case in which it was proven that the same information about the E911 system was also provided to the public through a mail-order catalog.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn a press release on May 9, 1990, officials from the federal government and the Arizona state government revealed that the Secret Service was involved in the investigation. The Assistant Director of the US Secret Service, Garry M. Jenkins, commented in a press release that, \"the Secret Service is sending a clear message to those computer hackers who have decided to violate the laws of this nation in the mistaken belief that they can successfully avoid detection by hiding behind the relative anonymity of their computer terminals.\"Two public-access computer systems were shut down in the days following the operation: an AT&T Unix system in Dallas, Texassdf and a Jolnet system in Lockport, Illinois. Neither has been linked to the operation, however. An AT&T spokesman claimed the shutdown was a result of an internal investigation and was not related to the operation.In response to the arrests, the Electronic Frontier Foundation was founded by Mitchell Kapor, the founder of Lotus Development Corporation, and John Perry Barlow, an author. The foundation hired lawyers to represent the hackers in two of the cases arising from Operation Sundevil.Operation Sundevil was the most publicized action by the federal government against hackers. In part due to this, it has been seen as a public-relations stunt and a message to hackers. While it did little overall damage to the hacking community in the long run, it did stop the illicit hacking activities of many of the best hackers in the world for a short period of time, which is why it has been lauded as a tactical success due to the surprise and damage it caused to the communities in comparison to the long wars waged against the Legion of Doom. However, it has also been criticized as a failure due to several unsuccessful prosecutions, and a number of raids not even leading to arrest.\nWhat was the main reason for the lack of prosecution of phreakers prior to 1990 in the United States?Question: What was the role of the US Secret Service in Operation Sundevil and how did it help in fighting hacking and phreaking?Question: How did the switch from analog to digital equipment affect phreaking activities and what was the response from law enforcement?Question: What were the primary targets of the Operation Sundevil raids and where did they take place?Question: What was the significance of the arrests made during Operation Sundevil and who were the individuals arrested?Question: What was the impact of Operation Sundevil on the hacking community and how was it received by the public?Question: How did Operation Sundevil contribute to the creation of new laws related to hacking and phreaking?Question: What was the role of the Electronic Frontier Foundation in response to Operation Sundevil and how did it support the hacking community?Question: How did the press conference held during Operation Sundevil impact the public's perception of hacking and phreaking?Question: What was the significance of the seizure of computers, BBSes, and floppy disks during Operation Sundevil?Question: How did the switch from analog to digital equipment affect the way that phone companies responded to phreaking activities?Question: How did the creation of new laws related to hacking and phreaking impact the way that law enforcement was able to prosecute these activities?Question: What was the role of the FBI and CIA in Operation Sundevil and how did they assist in the raids?Question: How did the underground ezine Phrack play a role in Operation Sundevil and what was its impact on the hacking community?Question: How did the press release revealing Operation Sundevil impact the federal government's relationship with the hacking community?Question: How did the raid on Steve Jackson Games, Inc. relate to Operation Sundevil and what was the outcome of the subsequent court case?Question: How did the operation impact the budgets of federal law enforcement agencies and what was the overall impact on their expertise in fighting hacking and phreaking?Question: How did the shutdown of two public-access computer systems following Operation Sundevil impact the hacking community and what was the response from law enforcement?",

Evidence gained from Operation Sundevil allowed law enforcement to convince the United States Congress of the need for additional funding, training, and overall expansion.\n\n== Action ==\nAlong with the Chicago Task Force and the Arizona Organized Crime and Racketeering Bureau, the operation involved raids in Austin, Plano, Cincinnati, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Newark, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Richmond, Tucson, San Diego, San Jose, San Francisco, and Seattle. The raids were centered in Arizona, where the press conference occurred.Raids generally took place in middle-class suburbs and targeted credit card thieves and telephone abusers. They were carried out by local police, with the aid of over 150 Secret Service agents, FBI and CIA. Twenty-seven search warrants, resulting in three arrests, were issued and executed on May 7 and 8, 1990. Police also took around 42 computers and approximately 25 BBSes, including some of the most infamous and elite hacking BBSs in the world at that time, such as Cloud Nine. This was the largest crackdown on electronic bulletin boards in world history. Finally, about 23,000 floppy disks were also seized. These held a variety of data, including software, phreaking and hacking tools, tens of thousands of credit card details, and a plethora of illegal copyrighted material. The three people arrested were \"Tony the Trashman,\" \"Dr. Ripco,\" and \"Electra.\"Other parts of the operation targeted the underground ezine Phrack, which had published the contents of a proprietary text file copied from BellSouth computers and containing information about the E911 emergency response system, although this was later made null in a court case in which it was proven that the same information about the E911 system was also provided to the public through a mail-order catalog.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn a press release on May 9, 1990, officials from the federal government and the Arizona state government revealed that the Secret Service was involved in the investigation. The Assistant Director of the US Secret Service, Garry M. Jenkins, commented in a press release that, \"the Secret Service is sending a clear message to those computer hackers who have decided to violate the laws of this nation in the mistaken belief that they can successfully avoid detection by hiding behind the relative anonymity of their computer terminals.\"Two public-access computer systems were shut down in the days following the operation: an AT&T Unix system in Dallas, Texassdf and a Jolnet system in Lockport, Illinois. Neither has been linked to the operation, however. An AT&T spokesman claimed the shutdown was a result of an internal investigation and was not related to the operation.In response to the arrests, the Electronic Frontier Foundation was founded by Mitchell Kapor, the founder of Lotus Development Corporation, and John Perry Barlow, an author. The foundation hired lawyers to represent the hackers in two of the cases arising from Operation Sundevil.Operation Sundevil was the most publicized action by the federal government against hackers. In part due to this, it has been seen as a public-relations stunt and a message to hackers. While it did little overall damage to the hacking community in the long run, it did stop the illicit hacking activities of many of the best hackers in the world for a short period of time, which is why it has been lauded as a tactical success due to the surprise and damage it caused to the communities in comparison to the long wars waged against the Legion of Doom. However, it has also been criticized as a failure due to several unsuccessful prosecutions, and a number of raids not even leading to arrest.",

      "answers": "The main reason for the lack of prosecution of phreakers prior to 1990 in the United States was the absence of laws specifically targeting hacking and phreaking activities, as well as a lack of expertise on the part of law enforcement in dealing with these new forms of criminal activity.Answer: The US Secret Service played a major role in Operation Sundevil by investigating rampant credit card and calling card fraud over state lines. The operation allowed the USSS to gain valuable expertise on fighting this new form of criminal activity and expand its budget. Additionally, new laws were created to charge individuals accused of phreaking, hacking, wire, and credit card fraud, with evidence from Operation Sundevil helping to convince the US Congress of the need for additional funding, training, and overall expansion.Answer: The switch from analog to digital equipment exposed more of the inner workings of telephone companies, making it easier for hackers to explore switches and trunks. This led to financial losses for phone companies, prompting law enforcement to take action. However, due to a lack of laws and expertise, few cases were prosecuted until Operation Sundevil.Answer: The Operation Sundevil raids primarily targeted credit card thieves and telephone abusers and took place in Austin, Plano, Cincinnati, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Newark, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Richmond, Tucson, San Diego, San Jose, San Francisco, and Seattle. The raids were centered in Arizona, where the press conference occurred.Answer: The arrests made during Operation Sundevil were significant as they stopped the illicit hacking activities of many of the best hackers in the world for a short period of time. The three individuals arrested were \"Tony the Trashman,\" \"Dr. Ripco,\" and \"Electra.\"Answer: Operation Sundevil was seen as a public-relations stunt and a message to hackers, causing short-term damage to the hacking community. However, it did little overall damage in the long run and was criticized for several unsuccessful prosecutions and raids that did not lead to arrests.Answer: Evidence gained from Operation Sundevil allowed law enforcement to convince the US Congress of the need for additional funding, training, and overall expansion. New laws were created to allow federal prosecutors to charge individuals accused of phreaking, hacking, wire, and credit card fraud.Answer: In response to the arrests made during Operation Sundevil, the Electronic Frontier Foundation was founded by Mitchell Kapor and John Perry Barlow to represent the hackers in two of the cases arising from the operation. The foundation hired lawyers to defend the hackers and protect their rights.Answer: The press conference held during Operation Sundevil sent a clear message to hackers and phreakers that the federal government was taking a strong stance against these activities. This helped to shape public perception and increase awareness of the issue.Answer: The seizure of computers, BBSes, and floppy disks during Operation Sundevil was significant as it allowed law enforcement to gain access to valuable evidence related to hacking and phreaking activities. Additionally, it sent a message to the hacking community that these activities would not be tolerated.Answer: The switch from analog to digital equipment exposed more of the inner workings of telephone companies, making it easier for hackers to explore switches and trunks. This led to financial losses for phone companies, prompting them to take action and work with law enforcement to stop phreaking activities.Answer: The creation of new laws related to hacking and phreaking allowed federal prosecutors to charge individuals accused of these activities, making it easier for law enforcement to take action and prosecute those involved.Answer: The FBI and CIA assisted in the Operation Sundevil raids by providing aid to local police. They worked together with the US Secret Service and other federal law enforcement agencies to execute the raids and gather evidence related to hacking and phreaking activities.Answer: The underground ezine Phrack played a role in Operation Sundevil by publishing the contents of a proprietary text file copied from BellSouth computers, which contained information about the E911 emergency response system. This led to the targeting of the ezine during the operation and sparked controversy within the hacking community.Answer: The press release revealing Operation Sundevil sent a clear message to the hacking community that the federal government was taking a strong stance against hacking and phreaking activities. This strained the relationship between the two groups and led to increased scrutiny and legal action against hackers.Answer: The raid on Steve Jackson Games, Inc. was not related to Operation Sundevil, despite being often attributed to it. The Electronic Frontier Foundation states that it was a media error. The subsequent court case, Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service, was a landmark case in which it was proven that the same information about the E911 system was also provided to the public through a mail-order catalog.Answer: Operation Sundevil allowed multiple federal law enforcement agencies, particularly the Secret Service and the FBI, to gain valuable expertise on fighting this new form of criminal activity and expand their budgets. This helped them to better understand and combat hacking and phreaking activities in the future.Answer: The shutdown of two public-access computer systems following Operation Sundevil was not directly linked to the operation, but it did send a message to the hacking community that these activities would not be tolerated. Law enforcement used the opportunity to increase scrutiny and take action against hackers. However, the AT&T spokesman claimed the shutdown was a result of an internal investigation and not related to the operation."

    "instruction": "Zeroisation\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, zeroisation (also spelled zeroization) is the practice of erasing sensitive parameters (electronically stored data, cryptographic keys, and critical security parameters) from a cryptographic module to prevent their disclosure if the equipment is captured. This is generally accomplished by altering or deleting the contents to prevent recovery of the data.\n\n== Mechanical ==\nWhen encryption was performed by mechanical devices, this would often mean changing all the machine's settings to some fixed, meaningless value, such as zero.

    "instruction": "Microsoft Defender Antivirus\n\n==Introduction==\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus (formerly Windows Defender) is an antivirus software component of Microsoft Windows. It was first released as a downloadable free anti-spyware program for Windows XP and was shipped with Windows Vista and Windows 7. It has evolved into a full antivirus program, replacing Microsoft Security Essentials in Windows 8 or later versions.In March 2019, Microsoft announced Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac for business customers to protect their Mac devices from attacks on a corporate network, and a year later, to expand protection for mobile devices, it announced Microsoft Defender ATP for Android and iOS devices, which incorporates Microsoft SmartScreen, a firewall, and malware scanning. The mobile version of Microsoft Defender also includes a feature to block access to corporate data if it detects a malicious app is installed.\n\n\n\n== Microsoft Defender brand ==\nAs of 2021, Microsoft Defender Antivirus is part of the much larger Microsoft Defender brand, which includes several other software and service offerings, including:\n\nMicrosoft 365 Defender\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud\nMicrosoft Defender Endpoint\nMicrosoft Defender for Office 365\nMicrosoft Defender for Identity\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud Apps\nMicrosoft Defender Vulnerability Management\nMicrosoft Defender for Threat Intelligence\nMicrosoft Defender for Individuals\n\n== Features ==\nBefore Windows 8, Windows Defender only protected users against spyware. It includes a number of real-time security agents that monitor several common areas of Windows for changes which might have been caused by spyware. It also has the ability to remove installed ActiveX software. Windows Defender featured an integrated support for Microsoft SpyNet that allows users to report to Microsoft what they consider to be spyware, and what applications and device drivers they allow to be installed on their systems. Protection against viruses was subsequently added in Windows 8; which resembles Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE). It also uses the same anti-malware engine and virus definitions from MSE.\nIn Windows 10, Windows Defender settings are controlled in the Windows Defender Security Center. In the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, a new logo is introduced and a pop-up notification will appear to announce the results of a scan, even if no viruses are found.\n\n\n*** Real-time protection ***\n\nIn the Windows Defender options, the user can configure real-time protection options.

    "instruction": "Here are some questions about this text: Self-service password reset\n\n==Introduction==\nSelf-service password reset (SSPR) is defined as any process or technology that allows users who have either forgotten their password or triggered an intruder lockout to authenticate with an alternate factor, and repair their own problem, without calling the help desk. It is a common feature in identity management software and often bundled in the same software package as a password synchronization capability.\nTypically users who have forgotten their password launch a self-service application from an extension to their workstation login prompt, using their own or another user's web browser, or through a telephone call. Users establish their identity, without using their forgotten or disabled password, by answering a series of personal questions, using a hardware authentication token, responding to a notification e-mail or, less often, by providing a biometric sample such as voice recognition. Users can then either specify a new, unlocked password, or ask that a randomly generated one be provided.\nSelf-service password reset expedites problem resolution for users \"after the fact\", and thus reduces help desk call volume. It can also be used to ensure that password problems are only resolved after adequate user authentication, eliminating an important weakness of many help desks: social engineering attacks, where an intruder calls the help desk, pretends to be the intended victim user, claims to have forgotten the account password, and asks for a new password.\n\n== Multi-factor authentication ==\nRather than merely asking users to answer security questions, modern password reset systems may also leverage a sequence of authentication steps:\n\nAsk users to complete a CAPTCHA, to demonstrate that they are human.\nAsk users to enter a PIN which is sent to their personal e-mail address or mobile phone.\nRequire use of another technology, such as a one-time-password token.\nLeverage biometrics, such as a voice print.\nAn authenticator, such as Google Authenticator or an SMS code.\n\n== Security of authenticating users purely by asking security questions ==\nDespite the benefits, a self-service password reset that relies solely on answers to personal questions can introduce new\nvulnerabilities, since the answers to such questions can often be obtained by social engineering, phishing techniques or simple research. While users are frequently reminded never to reveal their password, they are less likely to treat as sensitive the answers to many commonly used security questions, such as pet names, place of birth or favorite movie. Much of this information may be publicly available on some users' personal home pages. Other answers can be elicited by someone pretending to conduct an opinion survey or offering a free dating service. Since many organizations have standard ways of determining login names from real names, an attacker who knows the names of several employees at such an organization can choose one whose security answers are most readily obtained.\nThis vulnerability is not strictly due to self-service password reset\u2014it often exists in the help desk prior to deployment of automation. Self-service password reset technology is often used to reduce this type of vulnerability, by introducing stronger caller authentication factors than the human-operated help desk had been using prior to deployment of automation.\nIn September 2008, the Yahoo e-mail account of Governor of Alaska and Vice President of the United States nominee Sarah Palin was accessed without authorization by someone who was able to research answers to two of her security questions, her zip code and date of birth and was able to guess the third, where she met her husband. This incident clearly highlighted that the choice of security questions is very important to prevent social engineering attacks on password systems.\n\n== Preference-based authentication ==\nJakobsson, Stolterman, Wetzel, and Yang proposed to use preferences to authenticate users for \npassword reset. The underlying insights are that preferences are stable over a long period of time, and are not publicly recorded. Their approach includes two phases---setup and authentication. During the setup, a user is asked to select items that they either like or dislike from several categories of items which are dynamically selected from a big candidate set and are presented to the user in a random order. During the authentication phase, users are asked to classify their preferences (like or dislike) for the selected items displayed to them in a random order. Jakobsson, Stolterman, Wetzel, and Yang evaluated the security of their approach by user experiments, user emulations, and attacker simulations.\n\n== Email or phone based resets ==\nMany web based systems not using single sign on allow users to send a password reset link to their registered email address or phone number. However, many large social media platforms reveal a part of a user's email address and some of the phone number digits when using the 'forgotten password' function. Often the whole email address can be derived from this hint.\n\n== Two-factor authentication ==\nTwo-factor authentication is a 'strong authentication' method, as it adds another layer of security to the password reset process. In most cases this consists of Preference Based Authentication plus a second form of physical authentication (using something the user possesses, i.e. Smartcards, USB tokens, etc.). One popular method is through SMS and email. Advanced SSPR software requires the user to provide a mobile phone number or personal e-mail address during setup. In the event of a password reset, a PIN code will be sent to the user's phone or email and they will need to enter this code during the password reset process. Modern technology also allows authentication via voice biometrics using voice recognition technology.\n\n== Access to platform for reset ==\nA major problem with self-service password reset inside corporations and similar organizations is enabling users to access the system if they forgot their primary password. Since SSPR systems are typically web-based, users need to launch a web browser to fix the problem, yet cannot log into the workstation until the problem is solved. There are various approaches to addressing this Catch-22, most of which are compromises (e.g., desktop software deployment, domain-wide password reset account, telephone access, visiting a neighbour, continuing to call the help desk, etc.).  Some companies have created software which presents a restricted web browser at the login screen with the sole ability to access the password reset page without logging into the system; an example of this is Novell's Client Login Extension technology.  Because these technologies effectively give the user access to computer resources, specifically a web browser, to reset passwords without authenticating to the computer, security is a high priority and capabilities are very limited so that the user cannot do more than is expected in this mode.\nThere are two additional problems related to the one of locked out users:\n\nMobile users, physically away from the corporate network, who forgot their PC's login password.\nPasswords cached by the operating system or browser, which might continue to be offered to servers after a password change that was initiated on another computer (help desk, password management web server, etc.) and therefore trigger an intruder lockout.\n\n== The vouching option ==\nIn conjunction with preference-based authentication, self-service password reset procedures could also rely on the network of existing human relations among users. In this scenario, the user who forgot the password asks a colleague for assistance. The \"helper\" colleague authenticates with the password reset application and vouches for user's identity.In this scenario, the problem changes from one of authenticating the user who forgot the password to one of understanding which users should have the ability to vouch for which other users.\n\n== RBAC Authorization ==\nThough it is important to provide multifactor authentication when SSPR software endpoint faces untrusted networks, there is another important aspect which modern SSPR needs to address. It is Role Base Access Control (RBAC) feature which is responsible for access level provisioning for the users.  When doing critical self-service password resets for privileged accounts you may want to allow account unlocks and to restrict password change functionality. The support teams have a responsibility of changing passwords of these accounts.

      "context": "Self-service password reset\n\n==Introduction==\nSelf-service password reset (SSPR) is defined as any process or technology that allows users who have either forgotten their password or triggered an intruder lockout to authenticate with an alternate factor, and repair their own problem, without calling the help desk. It is a common feature in identity management software and often bundled in the same software package as a password synchronization capability.\nTypically users who have forgotten their password launch a self-service application from an extension to their workstation login prompt, using their own or another user's web browser, or through a telephone call. Users establish their identity, without using their forgotten or disabled password, by answering a series of personal questions, using a hardware authentication token, responding to a notification e-mail or, less often, by providing a biometric sample such as voice recognition. Users can then either specify a new, unlocked password, or ask that a randomly generated one be provided.\nSelf-service password reset expedites problem resolution for users \"after the fact\", and thus reduces help desk call volume. It can also be used to ensure that password problems are only resolved after adequate user authentication, eliminating an important weakness of many help desks: social engineering attacks, where an intruder calls the help desk, pretends to be the intended victim user, claims to have forgotten the account password, and asks for a new password.\n\n== Multi-factor authentication ==\nRather than merely asking users to answer security questions, modern password reset systems may also leverage a sequence of authentication steps:\n\nAsk users to complete a CAPTCHA, to demonstrate that they are human.\nAsk users to enter a PIN which is sent to their personal e-mail address or mobile phone.\nRequire use of another technology, such as a one-time-password token.\nLeverage biometrics, such as a voice print.\nAn authenticator, such as Google Authenticator or an SMS code.\n\n== Security of authenticating users purely by asking security questions ==\nDespite the benefits, a self-service password reset that relies solely on answers to personal questions can introduce new\nvulnerabilities, since the answers to such questions can often be obtained by social engineering, phishing techniques or simple research. While users are frequently reminded never to reveal their password, they are less likely to treat as sensitive the answers to many commonly used security questions, such as pet names, place of birth or favorite movie. Much of this information may be publicly available on some users' personal home pages. Other answers can be elicited by someone pretending to conduct an opinion survey or offering a free dating service. Since many organizations have standard ways of determining login names from real names, an attacker who knows the names of several employees at such an organization can choose one whose security answers are most readily obtained.\nThis vulnerability is not strictly due to self-service password reset\u2014it often exists in the help desk prior to deployment of automation. Self-service password reset technology is often used to reduce this type of vulnerability, by introducing stronger caller authentication factors than the human-operated help desk had been using prior to deployment of automation.\nIn September 2008, the Yahoo e-mail account of Governor of Alaska and Vice President of the United States nominee Sarah Palin was accessed without authorization by someone who was able to research answers to two of her security questions, her zip code and date of birth and was able to guess the third, where she met her husband. This incident clearly highlighted that the choice of security questions is very important to prevent social engineering attacks on password systems.\n\n== Preference-based authentication ==\nJakobsson, Stolterman, Wetzel, and Yang proposed to use preferences to authenticate users for \npassword reset. The underlying insights are that preferences are stable over a long period of time, and are not publicly recorded. Their approach includes two phases---setup and authentication. During the setup, a user is asked to select items that they either like or dislike from several categories of items which are dynamically selected from a big candidate set and are presented to the user in a random order. During the authentication phase, users are asked to classify their preferences (like or dislike) for the selected items displayed to them in a random order. Jakobsson, Stolterman, Wetzel, and Yang evaluated the security of their approach by user experiments, user emulations, and attacker simulations.\n\n== Email or phone based resets ==\nMany web based systems not using single sign on allow users to send a password reset link to their registered email address or phone number. However, many large social media platforms reveal a part of a user's email address and some of the phone number digits when using the 'forgotten password' function. Often the whole email address can be derived from this hint.\n\n== Two-factor authentication ==\nTwo-factor authentication is a 'strong authentication' method, as it adds another layer of security to the password reset process.

    "instruction": "Transient-key cryptography\n\n==Introduction==\nTransient-key cryptography is a form of public-key cryptography wherein keypairs are generated and assigned to brief intervals of time instead of to individuals or organizations, and the blocks of cryptographic data are chained through time. In a transient-key system, private keys are used briefly and then destroyed, which is why it is sometimes nicknamed \u201cdisposable crypto.\u201d Data encrypted with a private key associated with a specific time interval can be irrefutably linked to that interval, making transient-key cryptography particularly useful for digital trusted timestamping. Transient-key cryptography was invented in 1997 by Dr. Michael Doyle of Eolas, and has been adopted in the ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard for trusted timestamps.\n\n== Public-key vs. transient-key ==\nBoth public-key and transient-key systems can be used to generate digital signatures that assert that a given piece of data has not changed since it was signed. But the similarities end there. In a traditional public key system, the public/private keypair is typically assigned to an individual, server, or organization. Data signed by a private key asserts that the signature came from the indicated source. Keypairs persist for years at a time, so the private component must be carefully guarded against disclosure; in a public-key system, anyone with access to a private key can counterfeit that person's digital signature.\nIn transient-key systems, however, the keypair is assigned to a brief interval of time, not to a particular person or entity. Data signed by a specific private key becomes associated with a specific time and date. A keypair is active only for a few minutes, after which the private key is permanently destroyed. Therefore, unlike public-key systems, transient-key systems do not depend upon the long-term security of the private keys.\n\n== Establishing data integrity ==\nIn a transient-key system, the source of time must be a consistent standard understood by all senders and receivers. Since a local system clock may be changed by a user, it is never used as a source of time. Instead, data is digitally signed with a time value derived from Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) accurate to within a millisecond, in accordance with the ANSI ASC X9.95 standard for Trusted Timestamping. Whenever a time interval in a transient-key system expires, a new public/private keypair is generated, and the private key from the previous interval is used to digitally certify the new public key. The old private key is then destroyed. This \"key-chaining\" system is the immediate ancestor of the Blockchain technology in vogue today.\nFor the new interval, time values are obtained from a trusted third-party source, and specific moments in time can be interpolated in between received times by using a time-biasing method based on the internal system timer. If a trusted time source cannot be obtained or is not running within specified tolerances, transient private keys are not issued. In that case, the time interval chain is terminated, and a fresh one is begun. The old and new chains are connected through network archives, which enable all servers to continue to verify the data integrity through time of protected data, regardless of how often the chain must be restarted.\nThe start times of the chain and of each interval can be coupled together to form an unbroken sequence of public keys, which can be used for the following:\n\nTo irrefutably identify the time at which a set of data was signed.\nTo identify the exact state of the data at the time it was signed.As an extra security measure, all requests for signatures made during an interval are stored in a log that is concatenated and is itself appended to the public key at the start of the next interval. This mechanism makes it impossible to insert new \u201csigned events\u201d into the interval chain after the fact.\n\n== Cross-verification ==\n\nThrough independently operating servers, cross-certification can provide third-party proof of the validity of a time interval chain and irrefutable evidence of consensus on the current time. Transient-key cryptographic systems display high Byzantine fault tolerance. A web of interconnected cross-certifying servers in a distributed environment creates a widely witnessed chain of trust that is as strong as its strongest link. By contrast, entire hierarchies of traditional public key systems can be compromised if a single private key is exposed.An individual transient key interval chain can be cross-certified with other transient key chains and server instances. Through cross-certification, Server A signs Server B's interval chain, the signed data of which is the interval definition. In effect, the private keys from Server B are used to sign the public keys of Server A. In the diagram, a server instance is cross-certified with two other server instances (blue and orange). Cross-certification requires that the timestamp for the interval agree with the timestamp of the cross-certifying server within acceptable tolerances, which are user-defined and typically a few hundred milliseconds in duration.\n\n== Network archives ==\nAlong with intervals, cross-certifications are stored in a network archive. Within a transient-key network, the archive is a logical database that can be stored and replicated on any system to enable verification of data that has been timestamped and signed by transient keys. A map of the set of accessible archives is stored within every digital signature created in the system. Whenever cross-certifications are completed at the beginning of an interval, the archive map is updated and published to all servers in the network.\n\n== Verification ==\nDuring an interval, the transient private key is used to sign data concatenated with trusted timestamps and authenticity certificates. To verify the data at a later time, a receiver accesses the persistent public key for the appropriate time interval. The public key applied to the digital signature can be passed through published cryptographic routines to unpack the hash of the original data, which is then compared against a fresh hash of the stored data to verify data integrity. If the signature successfully decrypts using a particular interval's published public key, the receiver can be assured that the signature originated during that time period. If the decrypted and fresh hashes match, the receiver can be assured that the data has not been tampered with since the transient private key created the timestamp and signed the data.\nTransient-key cryptography was invented in 1997 by Dr. Michael D. Doyle of Eolas Technologies Inc., while working on the Visible Embryo Project and later acquired by and productized by ProofSpace, Inc. It has been adopted as a national standard in the ANSI ASC X9.95 standard for Trusted Timestamping. Transient-key cryptography is the predecessor to Forward secrecy and formed the foundation of the forward-signature-chaining technology in the Bitcoin blockchain system.\n\nProofSpace, Inc has published a more detailed technical overview document of transient key cryptography.\n\nQ: How does transient-key cryptography differ from traditional public-key systems in terms of keypair assignment and private key security?q: How is data integrity established in transient-key cryptography?q: How does the \"key-chaining\" system in transient-key cryptography relate to the Blockchain technology?q: How are cross-verifications performed in transient-key cryptography?q: What is the role of network archives in transient-key cryptography?q: How is data integrity verified in transient-key cryptography?q: Who invented transient-key cryptography and when was it invented?q: How does transient-key cryptography differ from traditional public-key systems in terms of data signing and source of time?q: How does the \"key-chaining\" system work in transient-key cryptography?q: What happens if a trusted time source cannot be obtained in transient-key cryptography?q: How does cross-certification work in transient-key cryptography?q: How are network archives stored and replicated in transient-key cryptography?q: How is the private key used in transient-key cryptography to ensure data integrity?q: How does transient-key cryptography relate to the Bitcoin blockchain system?q: How is the source of time maintained in transient-key cryptography?",

      "context": "Transient-key cryptography\n\n==Introduction==\nTransient-key cryptography is a form of public-key cryptography wherein keypairs are generated and assigned to brief intervals of time instead of to individuals or organizations, and the blocks of cryptographic data are chained through time. In a transient-key system, private keys are used briefly and then destroyed, which is why it is sometimes nicknamed \u201cdisposable crypto.\u201d Data encrypted with a private key associated with a specific time interval can be irrefutably linked to that interval, making transient-key cryptography particularly useful for digital trusted timestamping. Transient-key cryptography was invented in 1997 by Dr. Michael Doyle of Eolas, and has been adopted in the ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard for trusted timestamps.\n\n== Public-key vs. transient-key ==\nBoth public-key and transient-key systems can be used to generate digital signatures that assert that a given piece of data has not changed since it was signed. But the similarities end there. In a traditional public key system, the public/private keypair is typically assigned to an individual, server, or organization. Data signed by a private key asserts that the signature came from the indicated source. Keypairs persist for years at a time, so the private component must be carefully guarded against disclosure; in a public-key system, anyone with access to a private key can counterfeit that person's digital signature.\nIn transient-key systems, however, the keypair is assigned to a brief interval of time, not to a particular person or entity. Data signed by a specific private key becomes associated with a specific time and date. A keypair is active only for a few minutes, after which the private key is permanently destroyed. Therefore, unlike public-key systems, transient-key systems do not depend upon the long-term security of the private keys.\n\n== Establishing data integrity ==\nIn a transient-key system, the source of time must be a consistent standard understood by all senders and receivers. Since a local system clock may be changed by a user, it is never used as a source of time. Instead, data is digitally signed with a time value derived from Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) accurate to within a millisecond, in accordance with the ANSI ASC X9.95 standard for Trusted Timestamping. Whenever a time interval in a transient-key system expires, a new public/private keypair is generated, and the private key from the previous interval is used to digitally certify the new public key. The old private key is then destroyed. This \"key-chaining\" system is the immediate ancestor of the Blockchain technology in vogue today.\nFor the new interval, time values are obtained from a trusted third-party source, and specific moments in time can be interpolated in between received times by using a time-biasing method based on the internal system timer. If a trusted time source cannot be obtained or is not running within specified tolerances, transient private keys are not issued. In that case, the time interval chain is terminated, and a fresh one is begun. The old and new chains are connected through network archives, which enable all servers to continue to verify the data integrity through time of protected data, regardless of how often the chain must be restarted.\nThe start times of the chain and of each interval can be coupled together to form an unbroken sequence of public keys, which can be used for the following:\n\nTo irrefutably identify the time at which a set of data was signed.\nTo identify the exact state of the data at the time it was signed.As an extra security measure, all requests for signatures made during an interval are stored in a log that is concatenated and is itself appended to the public key at the start of the next interval. This mechanism makes it impossible to insert new \u201csigned events\u201d into the interval chain after the fact.\n\n== Cross-verification ==\n\nThrough independently operating servers, cross-certification can provide third-party proof of the validity of a time interval chain and irrefutable evidence of consensus on the current time. Transient-key cryptographic systems display high Byzantine fault tolerance. A web of interconnected cross-certifying servers in a distributed environment creates a widely witnessed chain of trust that is as strong as its strongest link. By contrast, entire hierarchies of traditional public key systems can be compromised if a single private key is exposed.An individual transient key interval chain can be cross-certified with other transient key chains and server instances. Through cross-certification, Server A signs Server B's interval chain, the signed data of which is the interval definition. In effect, the private keys from Server B are used to sign the public keys of Server A. In the diagram, a server instance is cross-certified with two other server instances (blue and orange). Cross-certification requires that the timestamp for the interval agree with the timestamp of the cross-certifying server within acceptable tolerances, which are user-defined and typically a few hundred milliseconds in duration.\n\n== Network archives ==\nAlong with intervals, cross-certifications are stored in a network archive. Within a transient-key network, the archive is a logical database that can be stored and replicated on any system to enable verification of data that has been timestamped and signed by transient keys. A map of the set of accessible archives is stored within every digital signature created in the system. Whenever cross-certifications are completed at the beginning of an interval, the archive map is updated and published to all servers in the network.\n\n== Verification ==\nDuring an interval, the transient private key is used to sign data concatenated with trusted timestamps and authenticity certificates. To verify the data at a later time, a receiver accesses the persistent public key for the appropriate time interval. The public key applied to the digital signature can be passed through published cryptographic routines to unpack the hash of the original data, which is then compared against a fresh hash of the stored data to verify data integrity. If the signature successfully decrypts using a particular interval's published public key, the receiver can be assured that the signature originated during that time period. If the decrypted and fresh hashes match, the receiver can be assured that the data has not been tampered with since the transient private key created the timestamp and signed the data.\nTransient-key cryptography was invented in 1997 by Dr. Michael D. Doyle of Eolas Technologies Inc., while working on the Visible Embryo Project and later acquired by and productized by ProofSpace, Inc. It has been adopted as a national standard in the ANSI ASC X9.95 standard for Trusted Timestamping. Transient-key cryptography is the predecessor to Forward secrecy and formed the foundation of the forward-signature-chaining technology in the Bitcoin blockchain system.\n\nProofSpace, Inc has published a more detailed technical overview document of transient key cryptography.",

    "instruction": "Answer questions about:\nPassword notification email\n\n==Introduction==\nPassword notification email is a common password recovery technique used by websites.  If a user forgets their password then a password notification email is sent containing enough information for the user to access their account again. This method of password retrieval relies on the assumption that only the legitimate owner of the account has access to the inbox for that particular email address.\nThe process is often initiated by the user clicking on a forgotten password link on the website where, after entering their username or email address, the password notification email would be automatically sent to the inbox of the account holder. This email may contain a temporary password or a URL that can be followed to enter a new password for that account. The new password or the URL often contain a randomly generated string of text that can only be obtained by reading that particular email.Another method used is to send all or part of the original password in the email. Sending only a few characters of the password, can help the user to remember their original password, without having to reveal the whole password to them.\n\n== Security Concerns ==\nThe main issue is that the contents of the password notification email can be easily discovered by anyone with access to the inbox of the account owner. This could be as a result of shoulder surfing or if the inbox itself is not password protected. The contents could then be used to compromise the security of the account. The user would therefore have the responsibility of either securely deleting the email or ensuring that its contents are not revealed to anyone else. A partial solution to this problem, is to cause any links contained within the email to expire after a period of time, making the email useless if it is not used quickly after it is sent.\nAny method that sends part of the original password means that the password is stored in plain text and leaves the password open to an attack from hackers. This is why it is typical for newer sites to create a new password generate a token. If the site gets hacked the password contained within could be used to access other accounts used by the user, if that user had chosen to use the same password for two or more accounts.

    "instruction": "Here are some questions about this text: Key-agreement protocol\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, a key-agreement protocol is a protocol whereby two or more parties can agree on a cryptographic key in such a way that both influence the outcome. If properly done, this precludes undesired third parties from forcing a key choice on the agreeing parties. Protocols that are useful in practice also do not reveal to any eavesdropping party what key has been agreed upon.\nMany key exchange systems have one party generate the key, and simply send that key to the other party\u2014the other party has no influence on the key.\nUsing a key-agreement protocol avoids some of the key distribution problems associated with such systems.\nProtocols where both parties influence the final derived key are the only way to implement perfect forward secrecy.\n\n\n\n== Exponential key exchange ==\nThe first publicly known public-key agreement protocol that meets the above criteria was the Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange, in which two parties jointly exponentiate a generator with random numbers, in such a way that an eavesdropper cannot feasibly determine what the resultant value used to produce a shared key is.\nExponential key exchange in and of itself does not specify any prior agreement or subsequent authentication between the participants.  It has thus been described as an anonymous key agreement protocol.\n\n== Authentication ==\n\nAnonymous key exchange, like Diffie\u2013Hellman, does not provide authentication of the parties, and is thus vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.\nA wide variety of cryptographic authentication schemes and protocols have been developed to provide authenticated key agreement to prevent man-in-the-middle and related attacks. These methods generally mathematically bind the agreed key to other agreed-upon data, such as the following:\n\nPublic/private key pairs\nShared secret keys\nPasswords\n\n\n*** Public keys ***\nA widely used mechanism for defeating such attacks is the use of digitally signed keys that must be integrity-assured: if Bob's key is signed by a trusted third party vouching for his identity, Alice can have considerable confidence that a signed key she receives is not an attempt to intercept by Eve. When Alice and Bob have a public-key infrastructure, they may digitally sign an agreed Diffie\u2013Hellman key, or exchanged Diffie\u2013Hellman public keys. Such signed keys, sometimes signed by a certificate authority, are one of the primary mechanisms used for secure web traffic (including HTTPS, SSL or Transport Layer Security protocols). Other specific examples are MQV, YAK and the ISAKMP component of the IPsec protocol suite for securing Internet Protocol communications. However, these systems require care in endorsing the match between identity information and public keys by certificate authorities in order to work properly.\n\n\n*** Hybrid systems ***\nHybrid systems use public-key cryptography to exchange secret keys, which are then used in a symmetric-key cryptography systems. Most practical applications of cryptography use a combination of cryptographic functions to implement an overall system that provides all of the four desirable features of secure communications (confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation).\n\n\n*** Passwords ***\nPassword-authenticated key agreement protocols require the separate establishment of a password (which may be smaller than a key) in a manner that is both private and integrity-assured.

      "context": "Key-agreement protocol\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, a key-agreement protocol is a protocol whereby two or more parties can agree on a cryptographic key in such a way that both influence the outcome. If properly done, this precludes undesired third parties from forcing a key choice on the agreeing parties. Protocols that are useful in practice also do not reveal to any eavesdropping party what key has been agreed upon.\nMany key exchange systems have one party generate the key, and simply send that key to the other party\u2014the other party has no influence on the key.\nUsing a key-agreement protocol avoids some of the key distribution problems associated with such systems.\nProtocols where both parties influence the final derived key are the only way to implement perfect forward secrecy.\n\n\n\n== Exponential key exchange ==\nThe first publicly known public-key agreement protocol that meets the above criteria was the Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange, in which two parties jointly exponentiate a generator with random numbers, in such a way that an eavesdropper cannot feasibly determine what the resultant value used to produce a shared key is.\nExponential key exchange in and of itself does not specify any prior agreement or subsequent authentication between the participants.  It has thus been described as an anonymous key agreement protocol.\n\n== Authentication ==\n\nAnonymous key exchange, like Diffie\u2013Hellman, does not provide authentication of the parties, and is thus vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.\nA wide variety of cryptographic authentication schemes and protocols have been developed to provide authenticated key agreement to prevent man-in-the-middle and related attacks. These methods generally mathematically bind the agreed key to other agreed-upon data, such as the following:\n\nPublic/private key pairs\nShared secret keys\nPasswords\n\n\n*** Public keys ***\nA widely used mechanism for defeating such attacks is the use of digitally signed keys that must be integrity-assured: if Bob's key is signed by a trusted third party vouching for his identity, Alice can have considerable confidence that a signed key she receives is not an attempt to intercept by Eve. When Alice and Bob have a public-key infrastructure, they may digitally sign an agreed Diffie\u2013Hellman key, or exchanged Diffie\u2013Hellman public keys. Such signed keys, sometimes signed by a certificate authority, are one of the primary mechanisms used for secure web traffic (including HTTPS, SSL or Transport Layer Security protocols). Other specific examples are MQV, YAK and the ISAKMP component of the IPsec protocol suite for securing Internet Protocol communications. However, these systems require care in endorsing the match between identity information and public keys by certificate authorities in order to work properly.\n\n\n*** Hybrid systems ***\nHybrid systems use public-key cryptography to exchange secret keys, which are then used in a symmetric-key cryptography systems. Most practical applications of cryptography use a combination of cryptographic functions to implement an overall system that provides all of the four desirable features of secure communications (confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation).\n\n\n*** Passwords ***\nPassword-authenticated key agreement protocols require the separate establishment of a password (which may be smaller than a key) in a manner that is both private and integrity-assured. These are designed to resist man-in-the-middle and other active attacks on the password and the established keys. For example, DH-EKE, SPEKE, and SRP are password-authenticated variations of Diffie\u2013Hellman.\n\n\n*** Other tricks ***\nIf one has an integrity-assured way to verify a shared key over a public channel, one may engage in a Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange to derive a short-term shared key, and then subsequently authenticate that the keys match.

    "instruction": "Secure messaging\n\n==Introduction==\nSecure messaging is a server-based approach to protect sensitive data when sent beyond the corporate borders, and it provides compliance with industry regulations such as HIPAA, GLBA and SOX. Advantages over classical secure e-mail are that confidential and authenticated exchanges can be started immediately by any internet user worldwide since there is no requirement to install any software nor to obtain or to distribute cryptographic keys beforehand. Secure messages provide non-repudiation as the recipients (similar to online banking) are personally identified and transactions are logged by the secure email platform.\n\n== Functionality ==\nSecure messaging works as an online messaging service. Firstly, users enroll in a secure messaging platform. Then, the user logs into their account by typing in their username and password (or strong authentication) similar to a web-based email account. Out of a message center messages can be sent over a secure SSL-connection or via other equally protecting methods to any recipient. If the recipient is contacted for the first time a message unlock code (see below MUC) is needed to authenticate the recipient. Alternatively, secure messaging can be used out of any standard email program without installing software.\n\n== Secure delivery ==\nSecure messaging possesses different types of delivery: secured web interface, S/MIME or PGP encrypted communication or TLS secured connections to email domains, or individual email clients. One single secure message can be sent to different recipients with different types of secure delivery the sender does not have to worry about.\n\n== Trust management ==\nSecure messaging relies on a web of trust. This method synthesizes the authentication approach of web of trust, known from PGP, with the advantages of hierarchical structures, known from centralized PKI systems. Those combined with certificates provide a high quality of electronic identities. This approach focuses on the user and allows for immediate and personal bootstrapping of trust, respectively revocation.\n\n== Physical security ==\nIn a traditional client-server email, message data is downloaded to a local hard drive, and it is vulnerable if the computer is lost, stolen, or physically accessed by an unauthorized person. Secure messages are stored on a network or internet server which are typically more physically secure, and they are encrypted when data is inbound or outbound. However, an abundance of data still makes the server an attractive target for remote attacks. Methods that can be taken to protect physical security include ensuring environmental safety and hardware safety. Of course, the intentions of the server operator may also come into question.\n\n== Application ==\nSecure messaging is used in many business areas with company-wide and sensitive data exchanges. Financial institutions, insurance companies, public services, health organizations, and service providers rely on the protection from secure messaging.

      "context": "Secure messaging\n\n==Introduction==\nSecure messaging is a server-based approach to protect sensitive data when sent beyond the corporate borders, and it provides compliance with industry regulations such as HIPAA, GLBA and SOX. Advantages over classical secure e-mail are that confidential and authenticated exchanges can be started immediately by any internet user worldwide since there is no requirement to install any software nor to obtain or to distribute cryptographic keys beforehand. Secure messages provide non-repudiation as the recipients (similar to online banking) are personally identified and transactions are logged by the secure email platform.\n\n== Functionality ==\nSecure messaging works as an online messaging service. Firstly, users enroll in a secure messaging platform. Then, the user logs into their account by typing in their username and password (or strong authentication) similar to a web-based email account. Out of a message center messages can be sent over a secure SSL-connection or via other equally protecting methods to any recipient. If the recipient is contacted for the first time a message unlock code (see below MUC) is needed to authenticate the recipient. Alternatively, secure messaging can be used out of any standard email program without installing software.\n\n== Secure delivery ==\nSecure messaging possesses different types of delivery: secured web interface, S/MIME or PGP encrypted communication or TLS secured connections to email domains, or individual email clients. One single secure message can be sent to different recipients with different types of secure delivery the sender does not have to worry about.\n\n== Trust management ==\nSecure messaging relies on a web of trust. This method synthesizes the authentication approach of web of trust, known from PGP, with the advantages of hierarchical structures, known from centralized PKI systems. Those combined with certificates provide a high quality of electronic identities. This approach focuses on the user and allows for immediate and personal bootstrapping of trust, respectively revocation.\n\n== Physical security ==\nIn a traditional client-server email, message data is downloaded to a local hard drive, and it is vulnerable if the computer is lost, stolen, or physically accessed by an unauthorized person. Secure messages are stored on a network or internet server which are typically more physically secure, and they are encrypted when data is inbound or outbound. However, an abundance of data still makes the server an attractive target for remote attacks. Methods that can be taken to protect physical security include ensuring environmental safety and hardware safety. Of course, the intentions of the server operator may also come into question.\n\n== Application ==\nSecure messaging is used in many business areas with company-wide and sensitive data exchanges. Financial institutions, insurance companies, public services, health organizations, and service providers rely on the protection from secure messaging. Secure messaging can be easily integrated into corporate email infrastructures. According to Wolcott et al., secure messaging offers potential improvements in patient-provider relationships and outcomes.In the government context, secure messaging can offer electronic registered mail functions.

    "instruction": "Context: End node problem\n\n==Introduction==\nThe end node problem arises when individual computers are used for sensitive work and/or temporarily become part of a trusted, well-managed network/cloud and then are used for more risky activities and/or join untrusted networks. (Individual computers on the periphery of networks/clouds are called end nodes.) End nodes often are not managed to the trusted network\u2018s high computer security standards. End nodes often have weak/outdated software, weak security tools, excessive permissions, mis-configurations, questionable content and apps, and covert exploitations. Cross contamination and unauthorized release of data from within a computer system becomes the problem.\nWithin the vast cyber-ecosystem, these end nodes often attach transiently to one or more clouds/networks, some trustworthy and others not.  A few examples: a corporate desktop browsing the Internet, a corporate laptop checking company webmail via a coffee shop's open Wi-Fi access point, a personal computer used to telecommute during the day and gaming at night, or app within a smartphone/tablet (or any of the previous use/device combinations).  Even if fully updated and tightly locked down, these nodes may ferry malware from one network (e.g. a corrupted webpage or an infected email message) into another, sensitive network.  Likewise, the end nodes may exfiltrate sensitive data (e.g. log keystrokes or screen-capture).  Assuming the device is fully trustworthy, the end node must provide the means to properly authenticate the user.  Other nodes may impersonate trusted computers, thus requiring device authentication. The device and user may be trusted but within an untrustworthy environment (as determined by inboard sensors' feedback). Collectively, these risks are called the end node problem.  There are several remedies but all require instilling trust in the end node and conveying that trust to the network/cloud.\n\n== The cloud\u2019s weakest link ==\nCloud computing may be characterized as a vast, seemingly endless, array of processing and storage that one can rent from his or her computer.  Recent media attention has focused on the security within the cloud.  Many believe the real risk does not lie within a well monitored, 24-7-365 managed, full redundancy cloud host but in the many questionable computers that access the cloud.  Many such clouds are FISMA-certified whereas the end nodes connecting to them rarely are configured to any standard.\n\n== Ever growing risk ==\nFrom 2005 to 2009, the greatest and growing threats to personal and corporate data derived from exploits of users' personal computers. Organized cyber-criminals have found it more profitable to internally exploit the many weak personal and work computers than to attack through heavily fortified perimeters.  One common example is stealing small business's online banking account access.\n\n== Solutions ==\nTo eliminate the end node problem, only allow authenticated users on trusted remote computers in safe environments to connect to your network/cloud.  There are many ways to accomplish this with existing technology, each with different levels of trust.\nMany companies issue typical laptops and only allow those specific computers to remotely connect.  For example, the US Department of Defense only allows its remote computers to connect via VPN to its network (no direct Internet browsing) and uses two-factor authentication.  Some organizations use server-side tools to scan and/or validate the end node's computer, such as communicating with the node's Trusted Platform Module (TPM).\nA far higher level of trust can be obtained by issuing an immutable, tamper-resistant client with no local storage, allowing it to connect only after device and user authentication, remotely providing the OS and software (via PXE or Etherboot), and then only providing remote desktop or browser access to sensitive data.\nA less expensive approach is to trust any hardware (corporate, government, personal, or public) but provide a known kernel and software and require strong authentication of the user.  For example, the DoD\u2019s Software Protection Initiative offers Lightweight Portable Security, a LiveCD that boots only in RAM creating a pristine, non-persistent, end node while using Common Access Card software for authentication into DoD networks.\n\nNow answer the following questions: How does the end node problem arise in the context of individual computers used for sensitive work?Question: What risks do end nodes pose to networks and clouds they attach to?Question: Why is the cloud's weakest link believed to be the many questionable computers that access it?Question: What was the greatest and growing threat to personal and corporate data from 2005 to 2009?Question: How can the end node problem be eliminated?Question: What is one way companies can ensure trust in end nodes connecting to their network?Question: What is the role of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) in eliminating the end node problem?Question: What is an immutable, tamper-resistant client and how can it help eliminate the end node problem?Question: What is the role of Lightweight Portable Security in providing trust in end nodes?Question: What is the Software Protection Initiative and how does it offer trust in end nodes?Question: What is the difference between the trust levels provided by the different solutions to the end node problem?Question: How can inboard sensors help ensure trust in end nodes?Question: Why do cyber-criminals find it more profitable to internally exploit personal and work computers than to attack heavily fortified perimeters?Question: How can two-factor authentication help eliminate the end node problem?Question: How can remote desktop or browser access to sensitive data help eliminate the end node problem?",

The SSDT is then used to resolve the address of the corresponding function within ntoskrnl.exe.\nIn modern Windows kernels, two SSDTs are used: One for generic routines (KeServiceDescriptorTable) and a second (KeServiceDescriptorTableShadow) for graphical routines. A parameter passed by the calling userspace application determines which SSDT shall be used.\n\n== Hooking ==\nModification of the SSDT allows to redirect syscalls to routines outside the kernel.

    "instruction": "Read this and answer the below questions\n\nHigh Orbit Ion Cannon\n\n==Introduction==\nHigh Orbit Ion Cannon (HOIC) is an open-source network stress testing and denial-of-service attack application designed to attack as many as 256 URLs at the same time. It was designed to replace the Low Orbit Ion Cannon which was developed by Praetox Technologies and later released into the public domain. The security advisory for HOIC was released by Prolexic Technologies in February 2012.\n\n== Development ==\nHOIC was developed during the conclusion of Operation Payback by the hacktivist collective Anonymous. As Operation Payback concluded there was massive pressure on the group from law enforcement agencies, which captured and prosecuted more than 13 individuals connected with the group. This forced many members of the group to rethink their strategies and subsequently this part of the group launched Operation Leakspin. However a large part of Anonymous remained focused on launching opt-in DDoS attacks. However the Low Orbit Ion Cannon was not powerful enough to launch attacks with such a limited number of users. HOIC was designed to remedy this with the ability to cause an HTTP Flood with as few as 50 user agents being required to successfully launch an attack, and co-ordination between multiple users leading to an exponential increase in the damage. HOIC was the first tool of its kind to have support for the so-called \"booster files\", configurable VBscript modules that randomize the HTTP headers of attacking computers, allowing thousands upon thousands of highly randomized combinations for user agents. Apart from allowing user agents to implement some form of randomization countermeasures the booster files can and have been used to increase the magnitude of the attack.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nHOIC and its predecessor, the LOIC, are named after an ion cannon, a fictional directed-energy weapon described as firing beams of ions from a space-based platform onto Earth-based targets. Although ion cannons appear in many movies, television shows, and video games that have a science fiction-based setting, the ones depicted in the Command & Conquer series of video games are considered to be the inspiration for the graphics on the software's GUI and website.\n\n== Use ==\nSimply described, HOIC is a program for sending HTTP POST and GET requests at a computer under attack, that uses a lulz-inspired graphical interface. HOIC primarily performs a denial-of-service (DoS) attack and a DDoS attack when co-ordinated by multiple individuals. The denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the target URL is accomplished by sending excessive traffic in an attempt to overload the site and bring it down. This basic version of the attack can be customized by using the booster files which follow the VB 6 mixed with VB .NET syntax. In addition, HOIC can simultaneously attack up to 256 domains, making it one of the most versatile tools for hackers who are attempting to co-ordinate DDoS attacks as a group.The minimalist GUI of the tool makes it user friendly and easy to control. The basic routine of an attack is to input the URL of the website which is to be attacked, and set the power option on low, medium or high. The power option sets the request velocity with low at two requests per second, medium at four and high at eight requests per second. Then a booster file is added which uses .hoic extension to define dynamic request attributes, launch attacks on multiple pages within the same website and help evade some defense filters. The attack is then launched by pressing the red button in the GUI labelled as \"Fire Teh Lazer\".\n\n== Limitations ==\nThe basic limitation of HOIC is that it requires a coordinated group of users to ensure that the attacks are successful. Even though it has allowed attacks to be launched by far fewer users than the older Low Orbit Ion Cannon, HOIC still requires a minimum of 50 users to launch an effective attack and more are required to sustain it if the target website has protection. Another limiting factor is the lack of anonymizing and randomizing capability. Even though HOIC should, in theory, offer anonymizing through the use of booster files, the actual protection provided is not enough. Furthermore, anonymizing networks such as TOR are not capable of handling the bandwidth of attacks generated by HOIC. Any attempt to launch an attack using the TOR network will actually harm the network itself. However, Anonymous members routinely use proxy servers based in Sweden to launch their attacks. It has been speculated that this is due to the notion that Sweden may have stricter internet privacy laws than the rest of the world.\n\n== Legality ==\nPrimarily, HOIC has been designed as a stress testing tool and can be lawfully used as such to stress test local networks and servers provided the person initiating the test has authorization to test and as long as no other networks, servers, clients, networking equipment or URLs are disrupted.HOIC can also be used to perform distributed denial-of-service attacks, which are illegal under various statutes. The Police and Justice Act 2006 of the United Kingdom amended the Computer Misuse Act 1990, and specifically outlawed denial-of-service attacks and set a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. In the United States, denial-of-service attacks may be considered a federal crime under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act with penalties that include up to ten years of imprisonment. In 2013 criminal charges were brought against 13 members of Anonymous for participating in a DDoS attack against various websites of organizations including the Recording Industry Association of America, the Motion Picture Association of America, the United States Copyright Office of the Library of Congress, Visa, MasterCard, and Bank of America. They were charged with one count of \"conspiracy to intentionally cause damage to a protected computer\" for the events that occurred between  September 16, 2010 and January 2, 2011. DDoS attacks are federal offenses in the United States and are prosecuted by the Department of Justice under USC Title 18, Section 1030.In 2013, Anonymous petitioned the United States government via We the People, demanding that DDoS attacks be recognized as a form of virtual protest similar to Occupy protests.\n\n== Countermeasures ==\nDDoS mitigation usually works on the principle of distribution, which is basically intelligent routing of traffic to avoid congestion and prevent overload at a single URL. Other methods to counter DDoS include installation of intrusion prevention system (IPS) and intrusion detection system (IDS) devices and application software.\n\n== First use in attacks ==\nAnonymous were the first group to utilize High Orbit Ion Cannon publicly. After Megaupload, a file-sharing website, was shut down after federal agents raided their premises, Anonymous launched an attack against the website of the US Department of Justice. As the DOJ website went offline Anonymous claimed success via twitter, saying \"One thing is certain: EXPECT US! #Megaupload\". Over the course of the next few hours, several other websites were knocked offline and kept offline. These included websites belonging to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the BMI. Finally, as the day drew to a close, the website belonging to the FBI was hit repeatedly before it ultimately succumbed to attacks and acquired a \u201cTango Down\u201d status. Anonymous claimed that it was \"the single largest Internet attack in its history\", while it was reported that as many as 27,000 user agents were taking part in the attack.\n\nWhat is High Orbit Ion Cannon (HOIC) and what was its purpose in development?question: How does HOIC differ from its predecessor, the LOIC?question: What is the nomenclature behind the name High Orbit Ion Cannon?question: How does HOIC perform denial-of-service attacks?question: What are the basic limitations of HOIC?question: What is the legality of using HOIC?question: What were the consequences for members of Anonymous who used HOIC in DDoS attacks?question: How do intrusion prevention system (IPS) and intrusion detection system (IDS) devices and application software counter DDoS attacks?question: Who were the first group to utilize High Orbit Ion Cannon publicly and what were their targets?question: How many user agents were reported to be taking part in the attack launched by Anonymous against various websites?question: How does High Orbit Ion Cannon (HOIC) differ from other stress testing tools?question: What was the impact of the DDoS attack launched by Anonymous using HOIC?question: What is the maximum penalty for committing a denial-of-service attack in the United Kingdom?question: What is the role of booster files in High Orbit Ion Cannon (HOIC)?question: What is the purpose of the red button labeled \"Fire Teh Lazer\" in the HOIC GUI?",

    "instruction": "Context: Hole punching (networking)\n\n==Introduction==\nHole punching (or sometimes punch-through) is a technique in computer networking for establishing a direct connection between two parties in which one or both are behind firewalls or behind routers that use network address translation (NAT). To punch a hole, each client connects to an unrestricted third-party server that temporarily stores external and internal address and port information for each client. The server then relays each client's information to the other, and using that information each client tries to establish direct connection; as a result of the connections using valid port numbers, restrictive firewalls or routers accept and forward the incoming packets on each side.\nHole punching does not require any knowledge of the network topology to function. ICMP hole punching, UDP hole punching and TCP hole punching respectively use Internet Control Message, User Datagram and Transmission Control Protocols.\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\nNetworked devices with public or globally accessible IP addresses can create connections between one another easily. Clients with private addresses may also easily connect to public servers, as long as the client behind a router or firewall initiates the connection. However, hole punching (or some other form of NAT traversal) is required to establish a direct connection between two clients that both reside behind different firewalls or routers that use network address translation (NAT).\nBoth clients initiate a connection to an unrestricted server, which notes endpoint and session information including public IP and port along with private IP and port. The firewalls also note the endpoints in order to allow responses from the server to pass back through. The server then sends each client's endpoint and session information to the other client, or peer. Each client tries to connect to its peer through the specified IP address and port that the peer's firewall has opened for the server. The new connection attempt punches a hole in the client's firewall as the endpoint now becomes open to receive a response from its peer. Depending on network conditions, one or both clients might receive a connection request. Successful exchange of an authentication nonce between both clients indicates the completion of a hole punching procedure.\n\n== Examples ==\nVoIP products, online gaming applications, and P2P networking software all use hole punching.\n\nTelephony software Skype uses hole punching to allow users to communicate with one or more users audibly.\nFast-paced online multi-player games may use a hole punching technique or require users to create a permanent firewall pinhole in order to reduce network latency.\nVPN applications such as Hamachi, ZeroTier, and Tailscale utilize hole punching to allow users to connect directly to subscribed devices behind firewalls.\nDecentralized peer-to-peer file sharing software relies on hole punching for file distribution.\n\n== Requirements ==\nReliable hole punching requires consistent endpoint translation, and for multiple levels of NATs, hairpin translation.\nWhen an outbound connection from a private endpoint passes through a firewall, it receives a public endpoint (public IP address and port number), and the firewall translates traffic between them. Until the connection is closed, the client and server communicate through the public endpoint, and the firewall directs traffic appropriately. Consistent endpoint translation reuses the same public endpoint for a given private endpoint, instead of allocating a new public endpoint for every new connection.\nHairpin translation creates a loopback connection between two of its own private endpoints when it recognizes that the destination endpoint is itself. This functionality is necessary for hole punching only when used within a multiple-layered NAT.\n\nNow answer the following questions: What is hole punching in computer networking and how does it enable communication between two parties behind firewalls or NAT?Question: How do networked devices with public IP addresses and clients with private addresses establish connections between one another?Question: What is the role of an unrestricted server in the hole punching process and what information does it store?Question: How does the server send endpoint and session information to the clients in the hole punching process?Question: What happens when a client tries to connect to its peer's IP address and port in the hole punching process?Question: What is the significance of successful exchange of an authentication nonce between both clients in the hole punching procedure?Question: What types of applications use hole punching for communication between clients?Question: How does Skype use hole punching for communication between users?Question: How do fast-paced online multi-player games use hole punching to reduce network latency?Question: What type of network architecture requires hairpin translation for reliable hole punching?Question: What is consistent endpoint translation in the context of hole punching and how does it contribute to reliable hole punching?Question: What happens when a private endpoint passes through a firewall and receives a public endpoint in the context of hole punching?Question: How does the firewall direct traffic appropriately in the context of hole punching?Question: What is the role of a firewall in the hole punching process and why is it necessary?Question: What is the role of a router in the hole punching process and why is it necessary?",

The firewalls also note the endpoints in order to allow responses from the server to pass back through.Answer: The server sends each client's endpoint and session information to the other client, or peer, through their established connection.Answer: When a client tries to connect to its peer's IP address and port, it punches a hole in its firewall as the endpoint now becomes open to receive a response from its peer.Answer: Successful exchange of an authentication nonce between both clients indicates the completion of a hole punching procedure, meaning both clients have punched a hole in their firewalls and can now communicate directly.Answer: VoIP products, online gaming applications, and P2P networking software all use hole punching for communication between clients.Answer: Skype uses hole punching to allow users to communicate with one or more users audibly, enabling them to bypass firewalls and NAT for direct communication.Answer: Fast-paced online multi-player games may use a hole punching technique or require users to create a permanent firewall pinhole in order to reduce network latency, allowing for quicker and more efficient communication between clients.Answer: Hairpin translation is necessary for reliable hole punching only when used within a multiple-layered NAT, where two of its own private endpoints must establish a loopback connection when the destination endpoint is itself.Answer: Consistent endpoint translation is the process of reusing the same public endpoint for a given private endpoint, instead of allocating a new public endpoint for every new connection, contributing to reliable hole punching by ensuring that clients can communicate consistently through the same endpoint.Answer: When an outbound connection from a private endpoint passes through a firewall, it receives a public endpoint (public IP address and port number), and the firewall translates traffic between them, allowing for communication between the client and server.Answer: Until the connection is closed, the client and server communicate through the public endpoint, and the firewall directs traffic appropriately by translating traffic between the private and public endpoints.Answer: A firewall is a security system that controls inbound and outbound network traffic based on predetermined security rules. In the hole punching process, the firewall notes the endpoints and allows responses from the server to pass back through, allowing clients to punch holes in their firewalls and communicate directly with their peers.Answer: A router is a device that forwards data packets along networks. In the hole punching process, the router notes the endpoints and allows responses from the server to pass back through, allowing clients to punch holes in their firewalls and communicate directly with their peers.",

      "context": "Hole punching (networking)\n\n==Introduction==\nHole punching (or sometimes punch-through) is a technique in computer networking for establishing a direct connection between two parties in which one or both are behind firewalls or behind routers that use network address translation (NAT). To punch a hole, each client connects to an unrestricted third-party server that temporarily stores external and internal address and port information for each client. The server then relays each client's information to the other, and using that information each client tries to establish direct connection; as a result of the connections using valid port numbers, restrictive firewalls or routers accept and forward the incoming packets on each side.\nHole punching does not require any knowledge of the network topology to function. ICMP hole punching, UDP hole punching and TCP hole punching respectively use Internet Control Message, User Datagram and Transmission Control Protocols.\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\nNetworked devices with public or globally accessible IP addresses can create connections between one another easily. Clients with private addresses may also easily connect to public servers, as long as the client behind a router or firewall initiates the connection. However, hole punching (or some other form of NAT traversal) is required to establish a direct connection between two clients that both reside behind different firewalls or routers that use network address translation (NAT).\nBoth clients initiate a connection to an unrestricted server, which notes endpoint and session information including public IP and port along with private IP and port. The firewalls also note the endpoints in order to allow responses from the server to pass back through. The server then sends each client's endpoint and session information to the other client, or peer. Each client tries to connect to its peer through the specified IP address and port that the peer's firewall has opened for the server. The new connection attempt punches a hole in the client's firewall as the endpoint now becomes open to receive a response from its peer. Depending on network conditions, one or both clients might receive a connection request. Successful exchange of an authentication nonce between both clients indicates the completion of a hole punching procedure.\n\n== Examples ==\nVoIP products, online gaming applications, and P2P networking software all use hole punching.\n\nTelephony software Skype uses hole punching to allow users to communicate with one or more users audibly.\nFast-paced online multi-player games may use a hole punching technique or require users to create a permanent firewall pinhole in order to reduce network latency.\nVPN applications such as Hamachi, ZeroTier, and Tailscale utilize hole punching to allow users to connect directly to subscribed devices behind firewalls.\nDecentralized peer-to-peer file sharing software relies on hole punching for file distribution.\n\n== Requirements ==\nReliable hole punching requires consistent endpoint translation, and for multiple levels of NATs, hairpin translation.\nWhen an outbound connection from a private endpoint passes through a firewall, it receives a public endpoint (public IP address and port number), and the firewall translates traffic between them. Until the connection is closed, the client and server communicate through the public endpoint, and the firewall directs traffic appropriately. Consistent endpoint translation reuses the same public endpoint for a given private endpoint, instead of allocating a new public endpoint for every new connection.\nHairpin translation creates a loopback connection between two of its own private endpoints when it recognizes that the destination endpoint is itself. This functionality is necessary for hole punching only when used within a multiple-layered NAT.",

In 2008 it became the basis for their company AlienVault. Following the acquisition of the Eureka project label and completion of R&D, AlienVault began selling a commercial derivative of OSSIM ('AlienVault Unified Security Management'). AlienVault was acquired by AT&T Communications and renamed AT&T Cybersecurity in 2019.OSSIM has had four major-version releases since its creation and is on a 5.x.x version numbering. An information visualization of the contributions to the source code for OSSIM was published at 8 years of OSSIM. The project has approximately 7.4 million lines of code. The current version of OSSIM is 5.7.5 and was released on September 16, 2019. Information about this release and past versions can be found here\nAs a SIEM system, OSSIM is intended to give security analysts and administrators a more complete view of all the security-related aspects of their system, by combining log management which can be extended with plugins and asset management and discovery with information from dedicated information security controls and detection systems. This information is then correlated together to create contexts to the information not visible from one piece alone. Alarm and availability views along with reporting capabilities are provided to enhance the capabilities of the tool and its utility to the security and systems engineers.\nOSSIM performs these functions using other well-known open-source software security components, unifying them under a single browser-based user interface. The interface provides graphical analysis tools for information collected from the underlying open source software component (many of which are command line only tools that otherwise log only to a plain text file) and allows centralized management of configuration options.\nThe software is distributed freely under the GNU General Public License. Unlike the individual components which may be installed onto an existing system, OSSIM is distributed as an installable ISO image designed to be deployed to a physical or virtual host as the core operating system of the host.

    "instruction": "Slide attack\n\n==Introduction==\nThe slide attack is a form of cryptanalysis designed to deal with the prevailing idea that even weak ciphers can become very strong by increasing the number of rounds, which can ward off a differential attack. The slide attack works in such a way as to make the number of rounds in a cipher irrelevant. Rather than looking at the data-randomizing aspects of the block cipher, the slide attack works by analyzing the key schedule and exploiting weaknesses in it to break the cipher. The most common one is the keys repeating in a cyclic manner.\nThe attack was first described by David Wagner and Alex Biryukov. Bruce Schneier first suggested the term slide attack to them, and they used it in their 1999 paper describing the attack.\nThe only requirements for a slide attack to work on a cipher is that it can be broken down into multiple rounds of an identical F function. This probably means that it has a cyclic key schedule. The F function must be vulnerable to a known-plaintext attack. The slide attack is closely related to the related-key attack.\nThe idea of the slide attack has roots in a paper published by Edna Grossman and Bryant Tuckerman in an IBM Technical Report in 1977. Grossman and Tuckerman demonstrated the attack on a weak block cipher named New Data Seal (NDS). The attack relied on the fact that the cipher has identical subkeys in each round, so the cipher had a cyclic key schedule with a cycle of only one key, which makes it an early version of the slide attack. A summary of the report, including a description of the NDS block cipher and the attack, is given in Cipher Systems (Beker & Piper, 1982).\n\n\n\n== The actual attack ==\nFirst, to introduce some notation. In this section assume the cipher takes n bit blocks and has a key-schedule using \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        \u22ef\n        \n          K\n          \n            m\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{1}\\cdots K_{m}}\n   as keys of any length.\nThe slide attack works by breaking the cipher up into identical permutation\nfunctions, F. This F function may consist of more than one round\nof the cipher; it is defined by the key-schedule. For example, if a cipher uses an alternating key schedule where it switches between a \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{1}}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{2}}\n   for each round, the F function would consist of two rounds.

It is designed to protect users from malware and is primarily designed for computers running Microsoft Windows and macOS, although a version for Linux is available for business consumers.\n\n== Product ==\n\nKaspersky Anti-Virus features include real-time protection, detection and removal of viruses, trojans, worms, spyware, adware, keyloggers, malicious tools and auto-dialers, as well as detection and removal of rootkits.\nMicrosoft Windows users may download an antivirus rescue disk that scans the host computer during booting inside an isolated Linux environment. In addition, Kaspersky Anti-Virus prevents itself from being disabled by malware without user permission via password access prompts upon disabling protection elements and changing internal settings. It also scans incoming instant messenger traffic, email traffic, automatically disables links to known malware hosting sites while using Internet Explorer or Firefox, and includes free technical support and free product upgrades within paid-subscription periods.\n\n\n*** Limits ***\nKaspersky Anti-Virus lacks certain features found in Kaspersky Internet Security. These missing features include a personal firewall, HIPS, Secure Keyboard, AntiSpam, AntiBanner and parental control tools.Also, Kaspersky, like the majority of its competitors, is incompatible with many other anti-virus and anti-spyware software.\n\n== Security vulnerabilities ==\nIn 2005, two critical flaws were discovered in Kaspersky Anti-Virus. One could let attackers commandeer systems that use it, and one allowed CHM files to insert malicious code. Days later, the software maker had offered preliminary protection to customers, and a week later a permanent patch was made available.\n\n== Operating systems ==\n\n\n*** Microsoft Windows ***\nKaspersky has been initially developed for Windows, hence the system is supported with a client application since the very beginning.\n\n\n*** Linux ***\nAn edition of Kaspersky's anti-virus solution for Linux workstations is available to business consumers. It offers many of the features included in the mainstream version for Windows, including on-access and on-demand scanners.\nSpecialized editions of Kaspersky Anti-Virus are also available for a variety of Linux servers and offer protection from most forms of malware.\n\n\n*** Apple Mac OS X / macOS (since 2016) ***\nThe newly released Macintosh capable edition of Kaspersky Anti-Virus is compatible on (Intel Processor Based) Mac OS X Tiger and higher to include the brand new version Mac OS X Snow Leopard, released in August 2009. Kaspersky Lab internal testing concludes consuming only 2% CPU impact on performance and is designed to maintain a user friendly Mac-like interface with which Mac users are familiar. Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Mac contains definitions to detect and block malware affecting Windows, Linux and macOS alike. Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Mac also scans shared folders of users running Windows using Virtual PC on capable Apple Macintosh personal computers.\n\n== System requirements ==\nA DVD-ROM or CD-ROM drive, Internet Explorer 8 or above and Windows Installer 3.0 or above are also required for the installation of Kaspersky Anti-Virus in Windows. The latest version can either be downloaded from their official website or purchased through retail.\n\n== Criticisms and controversies ==\nIn March 2015, Bloomberg accused Kaspersky of having close ties to Russian military and intelligence officials. \nKaspersky criticized the article in his blog, calling the coverage \"sensationalist\" and guilty of \"exploiting paranoia\" to \"increase readership\".In June 2015, United States National Security Agency and United Kingdom Government Communications Headquarters agents broke Kaspersky antivirus software so that they could spy on people, leaks indicate.On 15 March 2022, the German Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) issued a warning against the usage of Kaspersky antivirus and cloud software. For antivirus software to work it requires deep access into the user's system and thus a particularly high level of trust in the software, the vendor and the encrypted update channel. Due to certain actions of Russian military and intelligence forces and the threats issued by Russia against the European Union, the NATO and the Federal Republic of Germany as part of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the usage of the software may not be considered trustworthy any longer and would impose a serious risk for a cyber-attack to be successful.

    "instruction": "Biometric device\n\n==Introduction==\nA biometric device is a security identification and authentication device.  Such devices use automated methods of verifying or recognising the identity of a living person based on a physiological  or behavioral characteristic. These characteristics include fingerprints, facial images, iris and voice recognition.\n\n== Types of biometric devices ==\nThere are two categories of biometric devices, \n\nContact Devices - These types of devices need contact of body part of live persons.  They are mainly fingerprint scanners, either single fingerprint, dual fingerprint or slap (4+4+2) fingerprint scanners, and hand geometry scanners.\nContactless Devices - These devices don't need any type of contact.  The main examples of these are face, iris, retina and palm vein scanners and voice identification devices.\n\n== Subgroups ==\nThe characteristic of the human body is used to access information by the users. According to these characteristics, the sub-divided groups are\n\nChemical biometric devices: Analyses the segments of the DNA to grant access to the users.\nVisual biometric devices: Analyses the visual features of the humans to grant access which includes iris recognition, face recognition, Finger recognition, and Retina Recognition.\nBehavioral biometric devices: Analyses the Walking Ability and Signatures (velocity of sign, width of sign, pressure of sign) distinct to every human.\nOlfactory biometric devices: Analyses the odor to distinguish between varied users.\nAuditory biometric devices: Analyses the voice to determine the identity of a speaker for accessing control.\n\n== Uses ==\n\n\n*** Workplace ***\n\nBiometrics are being used to establish better and accessible records of the hour's employee's work. With the increase in \"Buddy Punching\" (a case where employees clocked out coworkers and fraudulently inflated their work hours) employers have looked towards new technology like fingerprint recognition to reduce such fraud. Additionally, employers are also faced with the task of proper collection of data such as entry and exit times. Biometric devices make for largely fool proof  and reliable ways of enabling to collect data as employees have to be present to enter biometric details which are unique to them.\n\n\n*** Immigration ***\nAs the demand for air travel grows and more people travel, modern-day airports have to implement technology in such a way that there are no long queues. Biometrics are being implemented in more and more airports as they enable quick recognition of passengers and hence lead to lower volume of people standing in queues. One such example is of the Dubai International Airport which plans to make immigration counters a relic of the past as they implement IRIS on the move technology (IOM) which should help the seamless departures and arrivals of passengers at the airport.\n\n\n*** Handheld and personal devices ***\nFingerprint sensors can be found on mobile devices. The fingerprint sensor is used to unlock the device and authorize actions, like money and file transfers, for example. It can be used to prevent a device from being used by an unauthorized person.\n\n== Present day biometric devices ==\n\n\n*** Personal signature verification systems ***\nThis is one of the most highly recognised and acceptable biometrics in corporate surroundings. This verification has been taken one step further by capturing the signature while taking into account many parameters revolving around this like the pressure applied while signing, the speed of the hand movement and the angle made between the surface and the pen used to make the signature. This system also has the ability to learn from users as signature styles vary for the same user. Hence by taking a sample of data, this system is able to increase its own accuracy.\n\n\n*** Iris recognition system ***\nIris recognition involves the device scanning the pupil of the subject and then cross referencing that to data stored on the database. It is one of the most secure forms of authentication, as while fingerprints can be left behind on surfaces, iris prints are extremely hard to be stolen. Iris recognition is widely applied by organisations dealing with the masses, one being the Aadhaar identification carried out by the Government of India to keep records of its population. The reason for this is that iris recognition makes use of iris prints of humans, which hardly evolve during one's lifetime and are extremely stable.\n\n== Problems with present day biometric devices ==\n\n\n*** Biometric spoofing ***\n\nBiometric spoofing is a method of fooling a biometric identification management system, where a counterfeit mold is presented in front of the biometric scanner. This counterfeit mold emulates the unique biometric attributes of an individual so as to confuse the system between the artifact and the real biological target and gain access to sensitive data/materials.\nOne such high-profile case of Biometric spoofing came to the limelight when it was found that German Defence Minister, Ursula von der Leyen's fingerprint had been successfully replicated by Chaos Computer Club. The group used high quality camera lenses and shot images from 6 feet away. They used a professional finger software and mapped the contours of the Ministers thumbprint. Although progress has been made to stop spoofing. Using the principle of pulse oximetry- the liveliness of the test subject is taken into account by measure of blood oxygenation and the heart rate. This reduces attacks like the ones mentioned above, although these methods aren't commercially applicable as costs of implementation are high. This reduces their real world application and hence makes biometrics insecure until these methods are commercially viable.\n\n\n*** Accuracy ***\n\nAccuracy is a major issue with biometric recognition. Passwords are still extremely popular, because a password is static in nature, while biometric data can be subject to change (such as one's voice becoming heavier due to puberty, or an accident to the face, which could lead to improper reading of facial scan data). When testing voice recognition as a substitute to PIN-based systems, Barclays reported that their voice recognition system is 95 percent accurate. This statistic means that many of its customers' voices might still not be recognised even when correct. This uncertainty revolving around the system could lead to slower adoption of biometric devices, continuing the reliance of traditional password-based methods.\n\n== Benefits of biometric devices over traditional methods of authentication ==\nBiometric data cannot be lent and hacking of Biometric data is complicated hence it makes it safer to use than traditional methods of authentication like passwords which can be lent and shared. Passwords do not have the ability to judge the user but rely only on the data provided by the user, which can easily be stolen while Biometrics work on the uniqueness of each individual.\nPasswords can be forgotten and recovering them can take time, whereas Biometric devices rely on biometric data which tends to be unique to a person, hence there is no risk of forgetting the authentication data. A study conducted among Yahoo! users found that at least 1.5 percent of Yahoo users forgot their passwords every month, hence this makes accessing services more lengthy for consumers as the process of recovering passwords is lengthy. These shortcomings make Biometric devices more efficient and reduces effort for the end user.\n\n== Future ==\nResearchers are targeting the drawbacks of present-day biometric devices and developing to reduce problems like biometric spoofing and inaccurate intake of data. Technologies which are being developed are-\n\nThe United States Military Academy are developing an algorithm that allows identification through the ways each individual interacts with their own computers; this algorithm considers unique traits like typing speed, rhythm of writing and common spelling mistakes. This data allows the algorithm to create a unique profile for each user by combining their multiple behavioral and stylometric information. This can be very difficult to replicate collectively.\nA recent innovation by Kenneth Okereafor and, presented an optimized and secure design of applying biometric liveness detection technique using a trait randomization approach. This novel concept potentially opens up new ways of mitigating biometric spoofing more accurately, and making impostor predictions intractable or very difficult in future biometric devices. A simulation of Kenneth Okereafor's biometric liveness detection algorithm using a 3D multi-biometric framework consisting of 15 liveness parameters from facial print, finger print and iris pattern traits resulted in a system efficiency of the 99.2% over a cardinality of 125 distinct randomization combinations. The uniqueness of Okereafor's innovation lies in the application of uncorrelated biometric trait parameters including intrinsic and involuntary biomedical properties from eye blinking pattern, pulse oxymetry, finger spectroscopy, electrocardiogram, perspiration, etc.\nA group of Japanese Researchers have created a system which uses 400 sensors in a chair to identify the contours and unique pressure points of a person. This derri\u00e8re authenticator, still undergoing massive improvements and modifications, is claimed to be 98% accurate and is seen to have application in anti theft device mechanisms in cars.\nInventor Lawrence F. Glaser has developed and patented technology which appears at first to be a high definition display. However, unlike displays with 2 dimensional pixel arrays, this technology incorporates pixel stacks, accomplishing a series of goals leading to the capture of a multi-biometric. It is believed to be the first man-made device which can capture 2 or more distinct biometrics from the same region of pixel stacks (forming a surface) at the same instant, allowing for the data to form a third biometric, which is a more complex pattern inclusive as to how the data aligns. An example would be to capture the finger print and the capillary pattern at precisely the same moment.  Other opportunities exist with this technology, such as to capture kirlean data which assures the finger was alive during an event, or capture of bone details forming another biometric used with the others previously mentioned. The concept of stacking pixels to achieve increased functionality from less surface area is combined with the ability to emit any color from a single pixel, eliminating the need for RGB (RED GREEN BLUE) surface emissions.  Lastly, the technology was tested with high power cadmium magnetics to check for distortion or other anomalies, as the inventor wanted to also embed magnetic emission and magnetic collection with this same surface technology, but without exhibiting any magnetic stripes on the surface.  Devices, such as smart cards, can pass magnetic data from any orientation by automatically sensing what the user has done, and using data about where the card is when \"swiped\" or inserted into a reader. This technology can detect touch or read gestures at distance, without a user side camera and with no active electronics on its surface. The use of Multibiometrics hardens automated identity acquisition by a factor of 800,000,000 and will prove to be very difficult to hack or emulate.\n\nQ: How do biometric devices address the issue of \"Buddy Punching\" in workplaces?q: How do biometric devices improve data collection in workplaces?q: How are biometric devices implemented in modern-day airports?q: How are fingerprint sensors used in handheld and personal devices?q: How does personal signature verification work as a biometric device?q: How does iris recognition work as a biometric device?q: What is biometric spoofing, and how is it performed?q: What are the challenges associated with voice recognition as a biometric device?q: How do biometric devices offer an advantage over traditional password-based methods?q: How is the United States Military Academy addressing biometric spoofing?q: How does Kenneth Okereafor's biometric liveness detection algorithm work?q: How does the Japanese Researchers' derri\u00e8re authenticator work?q: How does Lawrence F.

      "context": "Biometric device\n\n==Introduction==\nA biometric device is a security identification and authentication device.  Such devices use automated methods of verifying or recognising the identity of a living person based on a physiological  or behavioral characteristic. These characteristics include fingerprints, facial images, iris and voice recognition.\n\n== Types of biometric devices ==\nThere are two categories of biometric devices, \n\nContact Devices - These types of devices need contact of body part of live persons.  They are mainly fingerprint scanners, either single fingerprint, dual fingerprint or slap (4+4+2) fingerprint scanners, and hand geometry scanners.\nContactless Devices - These devices don't need any type of contact.  The main examples of these are face, iris, retina and palm vein scanners and voice identification devices.\n\n== Subgroups ==\nThe characteristic of the human body is used to access information by the users. According to these characteristics, the sub-divided groups are\n\nChemical biometric devices: Analyses the segments of the DNA to grant access to the users.\nVisual biometric devices: Analyses the visual features of the humans to grant access which includes iris recognition, face recognition, Finger recognition, and Retina Recognition.\nBehavioral biometric devices: Analyses the Walking Ability and Signatures (velocity of sign, width of sign, pressure of sign) distinct to every human.\nOlfactory biometric devices: Analyses the odor to distinguish between varied users.\nAuditory biometric devices: Analyses the voice to determine the identity of a speaker for accessing control.\n\n== Uses ==\n\n\n*** Workplace ***\n\nBiometrics are being used to establish better and accessible records of the hour's employee's work. With the increase in \"Buddy Punching\" (a case where employees clocked out coworkers and fraudulently inflated their work hours) employers have looked towards new technology like fingerprint recognition to reduce such fraud. Additionally, employers are also faced with the task of proper collection of data such as entry and exit times. Biometric devices make for largely fool proof  and reliable ways of enabling to collect data as employees have to be present to enter biometric details which are unique to them.\n\n\n*** Immigration ***\nAs the demand for air travel grows and more people travel, modern-day airports have to implement technology in such a way that there are no long queues. Biometrics are being implemented in more and more airports as they enable quick recognition of passengers and hence lead to lower volume of people standing in queues. One such example is of the Dubai International Airport which plans to make immigration counters a relic of the past as they implement IRIS on the move technology (IOM) which should help the seamless departures and arrivals of passengers at the airport.\n\n\n*** Handheld and personal devices ***\nFingerprint sensors can be found on mobile devices. The fingerprint sensor is used to unlock the device and authorize actions, like money and file transfers, for example. It can be used to prevent a device from being used by an unauthorized person.\n\n== Present day biometric devices ==\n\n\n*** Personal signature verification systems ***\nThis is one of the most highly recognised and acceptable biometrics in corporate surroundings. This verification has been taken one step further by capturing the signature while taking into account many parameters revolving around this like the pressure applied while signing, the speed of the hand movement and the angle made between the surface and the pen used to make the signature. This system also has the ability to learn from users as signature styles vary for the same user. Hence by taking a sample of data, this system is able to increase its own accuracy.\n\n\n*** Iris recognition system ***\nIris recognition involves the device scanning the pupil of the subject and then cross referencing that to data stored on the database. It is one of the most secure forms of authentication, as while fingerprints can be left behind on surfaces, iris prints are extremely hard to be stolen. Iris recognition is widely applied by organisations dealing with the masses, one being the Aadhaar identification carried out by the Government of India to keep records of its population. The reason for this is that iris recognition makes use of iris prints of humans, which hardly evolve during one's lifetime and are extremely stable.\n\n== Problems with present day biometric devices ==\n\n\n*** Biometric spoofing ***\n\nBiometric spoofing is a method of fooling a biometric identification management system, where a counterfeit mold is presented in front of the biometric scanner. This counterfeit mold emulates the unique biometric attributes of an individual so as to confuse the system between the artifact and the real biological target and gain access to sensitive data/materials.\nOne such high-profile case of Biometric spoofing came to the limelight when it was found that German Defence Minister, Ursula von der Leyen's fingerprint had been successfully replicated by Chaos Computer Club. The group used high quality camera lenses and shot images from 6 feet away. They used a professional finger software and mapped the contours of the Ministers thumbprint. Although progress has been made to stop spoofing. Using the principle of pulse oximetry- the liveliness of the test subject is taken into account by measure of blood oxygenation and the heart rate. This reduces attacks like the ones mentioned above, although these methods aren't commercially applicable as costs of implementation are high. This reduces their real world application and hence makes biometrics insecure until these methods are commercially viable.\n\n\n*** Accuracy ***\n\nAccuracy is a major issue with biometric recognition. Passwords are still extremely popular, because a password is static in nature, while biometric data can be subject to change (such as one's voice becoming heavier due to puberty, or an accident to the face, which could lead to improper reading of facial scan data). When testing voice recognition as a substitute to PIN-based systems, Barclays reported that their voice recognition system is 95 percent accurate. This statistic means that many of its customers' voices might still not be recognised even when correct. This uncertainty revolving around the system could lead to slower adoption of biometric devices, continuing the reliance of traditional password-based methods.\n\n== Benefits of biometric devices over traditional methods of authentication ==\nBiometric data cannot be lent and hacking of Biometric data is complicated hence it makes it safer to use than traditional methods of authentication like passwords which can be lent and shared. Passwords do not have the ability to judge the user but rely only on the data provided by the user, which can easily be stolen while Biometrics work on the uniqueness of each individual.\nPasswords can be forgotten and recovering them can take time, whereas Biometric devices rely on biometric data which tends to be unique to a person, hence there is no risk of forgetting the authentication data. A study conducted among Yahoo! users found that at least 1.5 percent of Yahoo users forgot their passwords every month, hence this makes accessing services more lengthy for consumers as the process of recovering passwords is lengthy. These shortcomings make Biometric devices more efficient and reduces effort for the end user.\n\n== Future ==\nResearchers are targeting the drawbacks of present-day biometric devices and developing to reduce problems like biometric spoofing and inaccurate intake of data.

    "instruction": "Here are some questions about this text: Double Dragon (hacking group)\n\n==Introduction==\n\n\n== Origin ==\nDouble Dragon (also known as APT41, Barium, Winnti, Wicked Panda, Wicked Spider, TG-2633, Bronze Atlas, Red Kelpie, Blackfly) is a hacking organization with alleged ties to the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS). Classified as an advanced persistent threat, the organization was named by the United States Department of Justice in September 2020 in relation to charges brought against five Chinese and two Malaysian nationals for allegedly compromising more than 100 companies around the world.In 2019, the cybersecurity company FireEye stated with high confidence that the group was sponsored by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) while conducting operations for financial gain. The name \u201cDouble Dragon\u201d originates from the duality of their operation, as they engage in espionage and individual financial gain. The devices they use are usually used for state-sponsored intelligence.\nInvestigations conducted by FireEye have found APT 41 operations in multiple sectors, such as healthcare, telecommunications, and technology. The group conducts many of its financial activities in the video game industry, including development studios, distributors, and publishers.\n\n== Associated personnel ==\n\nIn their earlier activities, APT 41 has used domains registered to the monikers \u201cZhang Xuguang\u201d (simplified Chinese: \u5f20\u65ed\u5149) and \u201cWolfzhi\u201d. These online personas are associated with APT 41's operations and specific online Chinese language forums, although the number of other individuals working for the group is unknown. \u201cZhang Xuguang\u201d has activity on the online forum Chinese Hackers Alliance (simplified Chinese: \u534e\u590f\u9ed1 \u5ba2\u540c\u76df). Information related to this individual includes his year of birth, 1989, and his former living in Inner Mongolia of PRC. The persona has also posted on a forum regarding the Age of Wushu online game, using the moniker \u201cinjuriesa\u201d in 2011. Emails and online domains associated with \u201cWolfzhi\u201d also lead to a data science community profile. Forum posts also suggest that the individual is from Beijing or the nearby province, Hebei.The FBI has issued wanted posters for Haoran Zhang, Dailin Tan, Chuan Qian, Qiang Fu, and Lizhi Jiang, whom they have found to be linked with APT 41. Zhang and Tan were indicted on August 15, 2019, by the Grand Jury in the District of Columbia for charges associated with hacking offences, such as unauthorized access to protected computers, aggravated identity theft, money laundering and wire fraud. These actions were conducted on high-tech companies, video-game companies and six unnamed individuals from the United States and the United Kingdom while the two worked together. The FBI also charged Qian, Fu, and Jiang on August 11, 2020, for racketeering, money laundering, fraud, and identity theft. All three individuals were part of the management team of the Chengdu 404 Network Technology company, where the three and coworkers planned cyber attacks against companies and individuals in industries like communications, media, security, and government. Such operations were to occur in countries like the United States, Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, Sweden, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.In August 2020, Wong Ong Hua and Ling Yang Ching, were both charged with racketeering, conspiracy, identity theft, aggravated identity theft and fraud amongst others. The United States Department of Justice says that the two Malaysian businessmen were working with the Chinese hackers to target video game companies in the United States, France, South Korea, Japan and Singapore and profit from these operations. These schemes, particularly a series of computer intrusions involving gaming industries, were conducted under the Malaysian company Sea Gamer Mall, which was founded by Wong. On September 14, 2020, Malaysian authorities arrested both individuals in Sitawan.\n\n== Ties with Chinese government ==\nAPT 41's operations are described as \"moonlighting\" due to their balance of espionage supported by the Chinese state and financially motivated activities outside of state authorization in their downtime. As such, it is harder to ascertain whether particular incidents are state-directed or not. The organization has conducted multiple operations against 14 countries, most notably the United States. Such activities include incidents of tracking, the compromising of business supply chains, and collecting surveillance data. In 2022, APT 41 was linked to theft of at least $20 million in COVID-19 relief aid in the U.S.APT 41 uses cyber-espionage malware typically kept exclusive to the Chinese government. This characteristic is common for other advanced persistent threats, as this allows them to derive information to spy on high-profile targets or make contact with them to gain information that benefits national interest. APT 41 relation to the Chinese state can be evidenced by the fact that none of this information is on the dark web and may be obtained by the CCP.APT 41 targeting is consistent with the Chinese government's national plans to move into high research and development fields and increase production capabilities. Such initiatives coincide with the Chinese government's \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d plan, aiming to move Chinese production into high-value fields such as pharmacy, semi-conductors, and other high-tech sectors.FireEye has also evaluated with moderate confidence that APT 41 may engage in contract work associated with the Chinese government. Identified personas associated with the group have previously advertised their skills as hackers for hire. Their usage of HOMEUNIX and PHOTO in their personal and financially motivated operations, which are malware inaccessible to the public used by other state-sponsored espionage actors also evidences this stance. It is also recognized in China that more skilled hackers tend to work in the private sector under government contracts due to the higher pay. The FireEye report also noted that the Chinese state has depended on contractors to assist with other state operations focused on cyber-espionage, as demonstrated by prior Chinese advanced persistent threats like APT 10. APT 41 is viewed by some as potentially made up of skilled Chinese citizens, who are utilized and employed by the Chinese government, leading to the assumptions that members of the group often work two jobs, which is supported by their operating hours.\n\n== Techniques ==\nThe operating techniques of APT 41 are distinct, particularly in their usage of passive backdoors compared to traditional ones. While traditional backdoors utilized by other advanced persistent threats are easily detectable, this technique is often much harder to identify. Techniques applied in financially motivated APT 41 activity also include software supply-chain compromises. This has allowed them to implement injected codes into legitimate files to be distributed, which endanger other organizations by stealing data and altering systems.  Sophisticated malware is often deployed as well to remain undetected while extracting data. Bootkits are also a type of malware used by the group, which is both difficult to detect and harder to find amongst other cyber espionage and cybercrime groups, making it harder for security systems to detect malicious code.  They also used Deadeye launcher and Lowkey malware to perform instant reconnaissance while remaining undetected.Spear-phishing emails are regularly utilized by APT 41 across both cyber espionage and financial attacks. The group has sent many misleading emails which attempt to take information from high-level targets after gathering personal data to increase the likelihood of success. Targets have varied from media groups for espionage activities to bitcoin exchanges for financial gain.\n\n== Activities ==\nEspionage Activity\nAPT 41's targeting is deemed by FireEye to correlate with China's national strategies and goals, particularly those regarding technology. The targeting of tech firms align with Chinese interest in developing high-tech instruments domestically, as demonstrated by the 12th and 13th Five-Year Plans. The attack on organizations in various different sectors is believed by FireEye to be indicative of APT 41 fulfilling specifically assigned tasks. Campaigns attributed to APT 41 also demonstrates that the group is used to obtain information before major political and financial events. They have attacked companies in 14 different countries (and Hong Kong) including France, India, Italy, Japan, Myanmar, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They have also been discovered in several different industries, including healthcare, telecommunications, and technology.The German company TeamViewer AG, behind the popular software of the same name which allowed system control remotely, was hacked in June 2016 by APT 41 according to a FireEye security conference. The group was able to access the systems of TeamViewer users around the world and obtain management details and information regarding businesses. In 2021 APT 41 launched several phishing  scams in India that were found by the BlackBerry Research and Intelligence. They also stole data relating to new tax legislation and COVID-19 records and statistics. The group masked their identity to be the Indian government so that they would remain undetected.Financially Motivated Activities\nAPT 41 has targeted the video-game industry for the majority of its activity focused on financial gain. Chinese internet forums indicated that associated members linked to APT 41 have advertised their hacking skills outside of Chinese office hours for their own profits. In one FireEye reported case, the group was able to generate virtual game currency and sell it to buyers through underground markets and laundering schemes, which could have been sold for up to US$300,000. Although it is not a typical method used by the group for collecting money, APT 41  also attempted to deploy ransomware to profit from their operations.FireEye reports that because most of APT 41's financially motivated activity occurs later in the night or early in the morning, this could mean that these activities are completely unrelated to their espionage activities. FireEye reports that APT 41's activities are on average between 10:00 to 23:00 China Standard Time, which is typical for Chinese tech workers who follow a \u201c996\u201d work schedule.APT 41 uses digital certificates obtained from video game developers and producers to sign their malware. Through the application of over 19 different digital certificates, they target both gaming and non-gaming organizations to avoid detection and ensure compatibility with the systems of the target. In 2012, a certificate from a South Korean game publisher was leveraged by APT 41 to sign the malware they use against other members of the gaming industry. In 2021 APT 41 launched a series of attacks against the illegal gambling industry in China.\n\n== US Department of Justice ==\nOn the 16th of September 2020, The United States Department of Justice released previously sealed charges against 5 Chinese and 2 Malaysian citizens for hacking more than 100 companies across the world. These include firms involved in social-media, universities, telecommunications providers, software development, computer hardware, video-games, non-profit organizations, think tanks, foreign governments, and pro-democracy supporters in Hong Kong. The attacks were said to have involved the theft of code, code signing certificates, customer data and business information. Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen says that these actions involved having the hackers plant \u201cback-doors\u201d into software which allowed direct access to the systems of  the software provider's company. Two of the Chinese hackers also conducted attacks on the US gaming industry, which involved at least 6 companies in New York, Texas, Washington, Illinois, California, and the United Kingdom.The US District Court for the District of Columbia distributed warrants calling for the seizure of accounts, servers, domain names, and web pages used by the hackers to conduct their operations. The FBI had the responsibility of executing the warrants as well as other private sector companies. Microsoft also developed technical measures to prevent continued access to computer systems of victims. The Federal Bureau of Investigation released a report containing technical information that can be used by private sector groups.The Justice Department congratulated the Malaysian government, particularly the Attorney General's Chambers of Malaysia and the Royal Malaysia Police, in cooperating and aiding their arrest of the two Malay nationals, particularly since difficulties lie in arresting foreign hackers in general. The press release mentioned Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Verizon Media as groups which helped their investigation. The FBI also credited the Taiwanese Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau, which helped provide information to US authorities after discovering APT 41 servers set up in California.Contrastingly, Rosen criticizes the Chinese Communist Party in their inaction when it came to assisting the FBI for the arrest of the 5 Chinese hackers associated with APT 41. Rosen also claimed that the Chinese Communist Party was \u201cmaking China safe for their cyber criminals\u201d as they continue to assist them in espionage. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin says that the US uses its own cybersecurity issues to \u201cattack China\u201d through spreading false information, and political manipulation.This announcement was made during President Donald Trump's re-election campaign, associating the Chinese Communist Party with various cyber-espionage attacks. Alongside Russia and Iran, China was identified in a national threat assessment to the election.\n\n== Links with other groups ==\nAPT 41 has overlaps in activity with public reporting on other groups such as Barium and Winnti. In terms of technique, there are many overlaps in digital certificates and malware. According to FireEye, one of the most prominent similarities is the use of similar malware, particularly HIGHNOON, across various areas of activity. The use of the HIGHNOON malware was reported by FireEye and grouped under the APT 15 group (also known as Ke3chang, Vixen Panda, GREF, Playful Dragon). However, this was later found to be the work of multiple Chinese groups which share tools and strategies. A digital certificate distributed by video game company YNK Japan was used by APT 41, as well as other APT groups such as APT 17 and APT 20. A digital certificate allegedly from the Microsoft Certificate Authority was also used by APT 41 and APT 40. Non-public malware used by APT 41 is linked to other alleged Chinese state-sponsored groups, which may indicate that APT 41 has shared resources with other groups.\nWhat are the answers to these questions: Who is the hacking group known as Double Dragon and what are their origins?Q: What are the techniques used by Double Dragon in their financially motivated activities?Q: What is the connection between Double Dragon and the Chinese government?Q: What is the significance of Double Dragon's targeting of tech firms?Q: How does Double Dragon remain undetected while conducting their operations?Q: What industries does Double Dragon target in their financially motivated activities?Q: What countries does Double Dragon target in their operations?Q: What is the significance of Double Dragon's use of digital certificates obtained from video game developers and producers?Q: What are some of the espionage activities conducted by Double Dragon?Q: How does Double Dragon's targeting correlate with China's national strategies and goals?Q: What is the significance of Double Dragon's operating techniques being distinct?Q: How does Double Dragon perform reconnaissance while remaining undetected?Q: What is the connection between Double Dragon and other hacking groups such as Barium and Winnti?Q: What actions were taken by the US Department of Justice against Double Dragon?Q: What is the Chinese government's response to the allegations against Double Dragon?",

However, this was later found to be the work of multiple Chinese groups which share tools and strategies. A digital certificate distributed by video game company YNK Japan was used by APT 41, as well as other APT groups such as APT 17 and APT 20. A digital certificate allegedly from the Microsoft Certificate Authority was also used by APT 41 and APT 40. Non-public malware used by APT 41 is linked to other alleged Chinese state-sponsored groups, which may indicate that APT 41 has shared resources with other groups.",
      "questions": "Who is the hacking group known as Double Dragon and what are their origins?Q: What are the techniques used by Double Dragon in their financially motivated activities?Q: What is the connection between Double Dragon and the Chinese government?Q: What is the significance of Double Dragon's targeting of tech firms?Q: How does Double Dragon remain undetected while conducting their operations?Q: What industries does Double Dragon target in their financially motivated activities?Q: What countries does Double Dragon target in their operations?Q: What is the significance of Double Dragon's use of digital certificates obtained from video game developers and producers?Q: What are some of the espionage activities conducted by Double Dragon?Q: How does Double Dragon's targeting correlate with China's national strategies and goals?Q: What is the significance of Double Dragon's operating techniques being distinct?Q: How does Double Dragon perform reconnaissance while remaining undetected?Q: What is the connection between Double Dragon and other hacking groups such as Barium and Winnti?Q: What actions were taken by the US Department of Justice against Double Dragon?Q: What is the Chinese government's response to the allegations against Double Dragon?",
      "answers": "Double Dragon, also known as APT41, Barium, Winnti, Wicked Panda, Wicked Spider, TG-2633, Bronze Atlas, Red Kelpie, Blackfly, is a hacking organization with alleged ties to the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS). They were named by the United States Department of Justice in September 2020 in relation to charges brought against several Chinese and Malaysian nationals for allegedly compromising more than 100 companies around the world. The group was classified as an advanced persistent threat and has been active since at least 2012.A: Double Dragon uses various techniques in their financially motivated activities, including the use of passive backdoors, software supply-chain compromises, and sophisticated malware. Passive backdoors are used to gain access to a system without being easily detected, while software supply-chain compromises allow the group to inject malicious code into legitimate files for distribution. Sophisticated malware is used to remain undetected while extracting data. Bootkits, Deadeye launcher, and Lowkey malware are also used to perform reconnaissance and remain undetected.A: Double Dragon's operations are described as \"moonlighting\" due to their balance of espionage supported by the Chinese state and financially motivated activities outside of state authorization in their downtime. The organization has conducted multiple operations against 14 countries, most notably the United States, including incidents of tracking, compromising of business supply chains, and collecting surveillance data. APT 41 also uses cyber-espionage malware typically kept exclusive to the Chinese government, indicating a close relationship with the Chinese state.A: Double Dragon's targeting of tech firms aligns with Chinese interest in developing high-tech instruments domestically, as demonstrated by the 12th and 13th Five-Year Plans. The attack on organizations in various different sectors is believed by FireEye to be indicative of APT 41 fulfilling specifically assigned tasks, and campaigns attributed to APT 41 demonstrate that the group is used to obtain information before major political and financial events.A: Double Dragon uses various techniques to remain undetected while conducting their operations, including the use of passive backdoors, software supply-chain compromises, and sophisticated malware. The group also uses digital certificates obtained from video game developers and producers to sign their malware, allowing them to avoid detection and ensure compatibility with the systems of the target.A: Double Dragon has targeted the video-game industry for the majority of its activity focused on financial gain. Chinese internet forums indicate that associated members linked to APT 41 have advertised their hacking skills outside of Chinese office hours for their own profits. In 2021, APT 41 also launched a series of attacks against the illegal gambling industry in China.A: Double Dragon has attacked companies in 14 different countries (and Hong Kong) including France, India, Italy, Japan, Myanmar, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.A: Double Dragon's use of digital certificates obtained from video game developers and producers allows them to sign their malware and avoid detection. This technique also ensures compatibility with the systems of the target, making it harder for security systems to detect malicious code.A: Double Dragon's espionage activities include tracking, compromising of business supply chains, and collecting surveillance data. The group has also been linked to theft of at least $20 million in COVID-19 relief aid in the U.S.A: Double Dragon's targeting is deemed by FireEye to correlate with China's national strategies and goals, particularly those regarding technology. The targeting of tech firms aligns with Chinese interest in developing high-tech instruments domestically, as demonstrated by the 12th and 13th Five-Year Plans.A: Double Dragon's operating techniques are distinct, particularly in their usage of passive backdoors compared to traditional ones. While traditional backdoors utilized by other advanced persistent threats are easily detectable, this technique is often much harder to identify. This makes it harder for security systems to detect malicious code and for targets to protect themselves.A: Double Dragon uses Deadeye launcher and Lowkey malware to perform instant reconnaissance while remaining undetected.A: Double Dragon has overlaps in activity with public reporting on other groups such as Barium and Winnti. In terms of technique, there are many overlaps in digital certificates and malware. Non-public malware used by APT 41 is linked to other alleged Chinese state-sponsored groups, which may indicate that APT 41 has shared resources with other groups.A: The US Department of Justice released previously sealed charges against Double Dragon members in September 2020, including 5 Chinese and 2 Malaysian citizens. The attacks were said to have involved the theft of code, code signing certificates, customer data and business information. The FBI had the responsibility of executing warrants for the seizure of accounts, servers, domain names, and web pages used by the hackers to conduct their operations.A: The Chinese government has denied the allegations against Double Dragon and has criticized the US for spreading false information and engaging in political manipulation. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin says that the US uses its own cybersecurity issues to \"attack China\" through spreading false information, and political manipulation."

    "instruction": "Here are some questions about this text: NoScript\n\n==Introduction==\nNoScript (or NoScript Security Suite) is a free and open-source extension for  Firefox- and Chromium-based web browsers, written and maintained by Giorgio Maone, an Italian software developer and member of the Mozilla Security Group.\n\n\n\n== Features ==\n\n\n*** Active content blocking ***\nBy default, NoScript blocks active (executable) web content, which can be wholly or partially unblocked by allowlisting a site or domain from the extension's toolbar menu or by clicking a placeholder icon.\nIn the default configuration, active content is globally denied, although the user may turn this around and use NoScript to block specific unwanted content. The allowlist may be permanent or temporary (until the browser closes or the user revokes permissions). Active content may consist of JavaScript, web fonts, media codecs, WebGL, and Flash. The add-on also offers specific countermeasures against security exploits.Because many web browser attacks require active content that the browser normally runs without question, disabling such content by default and using it only to the degree that it is necessary reduces the chances of vulnerability exploitation. In addition, not loading this content saves significant bandwidth and defeats some forms of web tracking.\nNoScript is useful for developers to see how well their site works with JavaScript turned off. It also can remove many irritating web elements, such as in-page pop-up messages and certain paywalls, which require JavaScript in order to function.\nNoScript takes the form of a toolbar icon or status bar icon in Firefox. It displays on every website to denote whether NoScript has either blocked, allowed, or partially allowed scripts to run on the web page being viewed. Clicking or hovering (since version 2.0.3rc1) the mouse cursor on the NoScript icon gives the user the option to allow or forbid the script's processing.\nNoScript's interface, whether accessed by right-clicking on the web page or the distinctive NoScript box at the bottom of the page (by default), shows the URL of the script(s) that are blocked, but does not provide any sort of reference to look up whether or not a given script is safe to run. With complex webpages, users may be faced with well over a dozen different cryptic URLs and a non-functioning webpage, with only the choice to allow the script, block the script or to allow it temporarily.\nOn November 14, 2017, Giorgio Maone announced NoScript 10, which will be \"very different\" from 5.x versions, and will use WebExtension technology, making it compatible with Firefox Quantum. On November 20, 2017, Maone released version 10.1.1 for Firefox 57 and above. NoScript is available for Firefox for Android.\n\n\n*** Anti-XSS protection ***\nOn April 11, 2007, NoScript 1.1.4.7 was publicly released, introducing the first client-side protection against Type 0 and Type 1 cross-site scripting (XSS) ever delivered in a web browser.\nWhenever a website tries to inject HTML or JavaScript code inside a different site (a violation of the same-origin policy), NoScript filters the malicious request and neutralizes its dangerous payload.Similar features have been adopted years later by Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 and by Google Chrome.\n\n\n*** Application Boundaries Enforcer (ABE) ***\nThe Application Boundaries Enforcer (ABE) is a built-in NoScript module meant to harden the web application-oriented protections already provided by NoScript, by delivering a firewall-like component running inside the browser.\nThis \"firewall\" is specialized in defining and guarding the boundaries of each sensitive web application relevant to the user (e.g., plug-ins, webmail, online banking, and so on), according to policies defined directly by the user, the web developer/administrator, or a trusted third party. In its default configuration, NoScript's ABE provides protection against CSRF and DNS rebinding attacks aimed at intranet resources, such as routers and sensitive web applications.\n\n\n*** ClearClick (anti-clickjacking) ***\nNoScript's ClearClick feature, released on October 8, 2008, prevents users from clicking on invisible or \"redressed\" page elements of embedded documents or applets, defeating all types of clickjacking (i.e., from frames and plug-ins).This makes NoScript \"the only freely available product which offers a reasonable degree of protection against clickjacking attacks.\n\n\n*** HTTPS enhancements ***\nNoScript can force the browser to always use HTTPS when establishing connections to some sensitive sites, in order to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. This behavior can be triggered either by the websites themselves, by sending the Strict Transport Security header, or configured by users for those websites that don't support Strict Transport Security yet.NoScript's HTTPS enhancement features have been used by the Electronic Frontier Foundation as the basis of its HTTPS Everywhere add-on.\n\n== Conflicts ==\n\n\n*** Conflict with Adblock Plus ***\nIn May 2009, it was reported that an \"extension war\" had broken out between NoScript's developer, Giorgio Maone, and the developers of the Firefox ad-blocking extension Adblock Plus after Maone released a version of NoScript that circumvented a block enabled by an AdBlock Plus filter. The code implementing this workaround was \"camouflaged\" to avoid detection. Maone stated that he had implemented it in response to a filter that blocked his own website. After mounting criticism and a declaration by the administrators of the Mozilla Add-ons site that the site would change its guidelines regarding add-on modifications, Maone removed the code and issued a full apology.\n\n\n*** Conflict with Ghostery ***\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Adblock Plus incident, a spat arose between Maone and the developers of the Ghostery add-on after Maone implemented a change on his website that disabled the notification Ghostery used to report web tracking software. This was interpreted as an attempt to \"prevent Ghostery from reporting on trackers and ad networks on NoScript's websites\". In response, Maone stated that the change was made because Ghostery's notification obscured the donation button on the NoScript site. This conflict was resolved when Maone changed his site's CSS to move\u2014rather than disable\u2014the Ghostery notification.\nWhat are the answers to these questions: How does NoScript's active content blocking feature help users in terms of security?question: What is the role of the allowlist in NoScript's active content blocking feature?question: How does NoScript's active content blocking feature benefit web developers?question: What does NoScript's toolbar icon or status bar icon represent in Firefox?question: What is the purpose of NoScript's Anti-XSS protection feature?question: How does NoScript's Application Boundaries Enforcer (ABE) module enhance web application-oriented protections?question: What types of attacks does NoScript's ABE module protect against in its default configuration?question: What does NoScript's ClearClick feature prevent?question: How does NoScript's HTTPS enhancement feature help prevent man-in-the-middle attacks?question: What is the significance of NoScript's conflict with Adblock Plus in May 2009?question: What was the cause of the spat between NoScript and Ghostery after the Adblock Plus incident?question: How was the conflict between NoScript and Ghostery resolved?question: What is the role of the allowlist in NoScript's active content blocking feature in terms of user control?question: How does NoScript's ClearClick feature make it unique among freely available products?question: How do NoScript's HTTPS enhancement features benefit the Electronic Frontier Foundation?",

      "answers": "NoScript's active content blocking feature enhances security by defaulting to block executable web content, such as JavaScript, web fonts, media codecs, WebGL, and Flash. This reduces the likelihood of vulnerability exploitation as many web browser attacks require active content. Additionally, not loading this content saves bandwidth and defeats some forms of web tracking.answer: The allowlist in NoScript's active content blocking feature is used to wholly or partially unblock a site or domain from the extension's toolbar menu or by clicking a placeholder icon. This allows specific content to be enabled when necessary. The allowlist can be permanent or temporary, providing flexibility for the user.answer: NoScript's active content blocking feature helps developers see how well their site works with JavaScript turned off, allowing them to identify and fix any issues that may arise.answer: NoScript's toolbar icon or status bar icon in Firefox denotes whether NoScript has blocked, allowed, or partially allowed scripts to run on the web page being viewed.answer: NoScript's Anti-XSS protection feature is designed to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by filtering malicious requests and neutralizing dangerous payloads when a website tries to inject HTML or JavaScript code inside a different site.answer: NoScript's ABE module provides a firewall-like component running inside the browser that specializes in defining and guarding the boundaries of sensitive web applications according to policies defined directly by the user, web developer/administrator, or a trusted third party.answer: In its default configuration, NoScript's ABE module protects against CSRF and DNS rebinding attacks aimed at intranet resources, such as routers and sensitive web applications.answer: NoScript's ClearClick feature prevents users from clicking on invisible or \"redressed\" page elements of embedded documents or applets, defeating all types of clickjacking attacks.answer: NoScript's HTTPS enhancement feature forces the browser to always use HTTPS when establishing connections to some sensitive sites, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. This behavior can be triggered either by the websites themselves or configured by users for those websites that don't support Strict Transport Security yet.answer: The conflict between NoScript and Adblock Plus in May 2009 was significant because NoScript's developer, Giorgio Maone, released a version of NoScript that circumvented a block enabled by an AdBlock Plus filter. This led to criticism and an eventual apology from Maone, as well as a change in guidelines for the Mozilla Add-ons site.answer: The spat between NoScript and Ghostery arose after Maone implemented a change on his website that disabled the notification Ghostery used to report web tracking software. This was interpreted as an attempt to prevent Ghostery from reporting on trackers and ad networks on NoScript's websites.answer: The conflict was resolved when Maone changed his site's CSS to move\u2014rather than disable\u2014the Ghostery notification, addressing the issue and maintaining functionality for both parties.answer: The allowlist in NoScript's active content blocking feature provides users with control over which sites or domains have active content unblocked, allowing them to use NoScript as a tool for blocking specific unwanted content.answer: NoScript's ClearClick feature is unique among freely available products because it offers a reasonable degree of protection against clickjacking attacks, while other products may not provide this level of protection.answer: NoScript's HTTPS enhancement features have been used by the Electronic Frontier Foundation as the basis of its HTTPS Everywhere add-on, providing a more secure browsing experience for users."

    "instruction": "Punchscan\n\n==Introduction==\nPunchscan is an optical scan vote counting system invented by cryptographer David Chaum. Punchscan is designed to offer integrity, privacy, and transparency. The system is voter-verifiable, provides an end-to-end (E2E) audit mechanism, and issues a ballot receipt to each voter. The system won grand prize at the 2007 University Voting Systems Competition.\nThe computer software which Punchscan incorporates is open-source; the source code was released on 2 November 2006 under a revised BSD licence. However, Punchscan is software independent; it draws its security from cryptographic functions instead of relying on software security like DRE voting machines. For this reason, Punchscan can be run on closed source operating systems, like Microsoft Windows, and still maintain unconditional integrity.\nThe Punchscan team, with additional contributors, has since developed Scantegrity.\n\n== Voting procedure ==\n\nA Punchscan ballot has two layers of paper. On the top layer, the candidates are listed with a symbol or letter beside their name. Below the candidate list, there are a series of round holes in the top layer of the ballot. Inside the holes on the bottom layer, the corresponding symbols are printed.\nTo cast a vote for a candidate, the voter must locate the hole with the symbol corresponding to the symbol beside the candidate's name. This hole is marked with a Bingo-style ink dauber, which is purposely larger than the hole. The voter then separates the ballot, chooses either the top or the bottom layer to keep as a receipt, and shreds the other layer. The receipt is scanned at the polling station for tabulation.\nThe order of the symbols beside the candidate names is generated randomly for each ballot, and thus differs from ballot to ballot. Likewise for the order of the symbols in the holes. For this reason, the receipt does not contain enough information to determine which candidate the vote was cast for. If the top layer is kept, the order of the symbols through the holes is unknown. If the bottom layer is kept, the order of the symbols beside the candidates name is unknown. Therefore, the voter cannot prove to someone else how they voted, which prevents vote buying or voter intimidation.\n\n== Tabulation procedure ==\nAs an example, consider a two candidate election between Coke and Pepsi, as illustrated in the preceding diagram. The order of the letters beside the candidates' names could be A and then B, or B and then A. We will call this ordering \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          P\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P_{1}}\n  , and let \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          P\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P_{1}}\n\n== Basic auditing procedures ==\nThe voter's ballot receipt does not indicate which candidate the voter cast their ballot for, and therefore it is not secret information. After an election, the election authority will post an image of each receipt online. The voter can look up their ballot by typing in the serial number and they can check that information held by the election authority matches their ballot. This way, the voter can be confident that their ballot was cast as intended.\nAny voter or interested party can also inspect part of the database to ensure the results were calculated correctly. They cannot inspect the whole database, otherwise they could link votes to ballot serial numbers. However, half of the database can be safely inspected without breaking privacy. A random choice is made between opening \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        \n          D\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          D\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          D\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{D_{1},D_{2},D_{3}\\}}\n   or \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        \n          D\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          D\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          D\n          \n            5\n          \n        \n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{D_{3},D_{4},D_{5}\\}}\n   (this choice can be derived from the secret key or from a true random source, such as dice or the stock market). This procedure allows the voter to be confident that the set of all ballots were counted as cast.\nIf all ballots are counted as cast and cast as intended, then all ballots are counted as intended. Therefore, the integrity of the election can be proven to a very high probability.\n\n== Additional security ==\nTo further increase the integrity of a Punchscan election, several further steps can be taken to protect against a completely corrupt election authority.\n\n\n*** Multiple databases ***\nSince \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          D\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D_{1}}\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          D\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D_{2}}\n  , and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          D\n          \n            5\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D_{5}}\n   in the database are all generated pseudorandomly, multiple databases can be created with different random values for these columns. Each database is independent of the others, allowing the first half of some of the databases to be opened and inspected and the second half of others. Each database must produce the same final tally. Thus if an election authority were to tamper with the database to skew the final tally, they would have to tamper with each of the databases. The probability of the tampering being uncovered in the audit increases with the number of independent databases.\n\n\n*** Commitments ***\nPrior to an election, the election authority prints the ballots and creates the database(s). Part of this creation process involves committing to the unique information contained on each ballot and in the databases. This is accomplished by applying a cryptographic one-way function to the information. Though the result of this function, the commitment, is made public, the actual information being committed to remains sealed. Because the function is one-way, it is computationally infeasible to determine the information on the sealed ballot given only its publicly posted commitment.\n\n\n*** Ballot inspection ***\nPrior to an election, twice as many ballots are produced as the number intended to use in the election. Half of these ballots are selected randomly (or each candidate could choose a fraction of the ballots) and opened. The rows in the database corresponding to these selected ballots can be checked to ensure the calculations are correct and not tampered with. Since the election authority does not know a priori which ballots will be selected, passing this audit means the database is well formed with a very high probability. Furthermore, the ballots can be checked against their commitments to ensure with high probability that the ballot commitments are correct.\nHow is the Punchscan system designed to ensure voter privacy and transparency?q: How is the computer software in Punchscan designed to enhance its security?q: How is the voting procedure in Punchscan carried out?q: How does the tabulation procedure in Punchscan work?q: How are basic auditing procedures carried out in Punchscan?q: How does the use of multiple databases increase the integrity of a Punchscan election?q: How are commitments used in Punchscan to enhance security?q: How are ballots inspected in Punchscan before an election?q: How does the use of a cryptographic one-way function enhance the security of Punchscan?q: How does the Punchscan system ensure that all ballots are counted as cast and cast as intended?q: How is the voter's ballot receipt used in Punchscan to ensure the integrity of the election?q: How does the Punchscan system ensure the privacy of the voter?q: How does the use of Bingo-style ink dauber in Punchscan enhance the security of the system?q: How does the Punchscan system ensure the transparency of the election?q: How does the use of randomization in Punchscan enhance the security of the system?",

The result of this function, the commitment, is made public, but the actual information being committed to remains sealed.a: Prior to an election, twice as many ballots are produced as the number intended to use in the election. Half of these ballots are selected randomly and opened. The rows in the database corresponding to these selected ballots can be checked to ensure the calculations are correct and not tampered with.a: The use of a cryptographic one-way function in Punchscan ensures that it is computationally infeasible to determine the information on the sealed ballot given only its publicly posted commitment.a: The Punchscan system ensures that all ballots are counted as cast and cast as intended by allowing any voter or interested party to inspect part of the database to ensure the results were calculated correctly. Additionally, the voter can check that information held by the election authority matches their ballot by looking up their ballot online using the serial number.a: The voter's ballot receipt in Punchscan does not indicate which candidate the voter cast their ballot for, but it is used to ensure the integrity of the election by allowing the voter to check that their ballot was cast as intended. After an election, the election authority will post an image of each receipt online and the voter can look up their ballot by typing in the serial number.a: The Punchscan system ensures the privacy of the voter by generating the order of the symbols beside the candidate names and the order of the symbols in the holes randomly for each ballot. This means that the receipt does not contain enough information to determine which candidate the vote was cast for, and the voter cannot prove to someone else how they voted, which prevents vote buying or voter intimidation.a: The use of Bingo-style ink dauber in Punchscan enhances the security of the system by ensuring that the voter marks the hole corresponding to the symbol beside the candidate's name. The ink dauber is purposely larger than the hole, making it difficult for the voter to cheat.a: The Punchscan system ensures the transparency of the election by providing an end-to-end (E2E) audit mechanism and issuing a ballot receipt to each voter. Additionally, after an election, the election authority will post an image of each receipt online, allowing the voter to check that their ballot was cast as intended.a: The use of randomization in Punchscan enhances the security of the system by ensuring that the order of the symbols beside the candidate names and the order of the symbols in the holes are generated randomly for each ballot. This means that the receipt does not contain enough information to determine which candidate the vote was cast for, preventing vote buying or voter intimidation. Additionally, it also makes it impossible to link votes to ballot serial numbers, thus preserving the privacy of the voter."

    "instruction": "text: Traffic analysis\n\n==Introduction==\nTraffic analysis is the process of intercepting and examining messages in order to deduce information from patterns in communication. It can be performed even when the messages are encrypted. In general, the greater the number of messages observed, the greater information be inferred. Traffic analysis can be performed in the context of military intelligence, counter-intelligence, or pattern-of-life analysis, and is also a concern in computer security.\nTraffic analysis tasks may be supported by dedicated computer software programs. Advanced traffic analysis techniques which may include various forms of social network analysis.\nTraffic analysis has historically been a vital technique in cryptanalysis, especially when the attempted crack depends on successfully seeding a known-plaintext attack, which often requires an inspired guess based on how specific the operational context might likely influence what an adversary communicates, which may be sufficient to establish a short crib.\n\n== Breaking the anonymity of networks ==\nTraffic analysis method can be used to break the anonymity of anonymous networks, e.g., TORs. There are two methods of traffic-analysis attack, passive and active. \n\nIn passive traffic-analysis method, the attacker extracts features from the traffic of a specific flow on one side of the network and looks for those features on the other side of the network.\nIn active traffic-analysis method, the attacker alters the timings of the packets of a flow according to a specific pattern and looks for that pattern on the other side of the network; therefore, the attacker can link the flows in one side to the other side of the network and break the anonymity of it. It is shown, although timing noise is added to the packets, there are active traffic analysis methods robust against such a noise.\n\n== In military intelligence ==\nIn a military context, traffic analysis is a  basic part of signals intelligence, and can be a source of information about the intentions and actions of the target. Representative patterns include:\n\nFrequent communications \u2013 can denote planning\nRapid, short communications \u2013 can denote negotiations\nA lack of communication \u2013 can indicate a lack of activity, or completion of a finalized plan\nFrequent communication to specific stations from a central station \u2013 can highlight the chain of command\nWho talks to whom \u2013 can indicate which stations are 'in charge' or the 'control station' of a particular network. This further implies something about the personnel associated with each station\nWho talks when \u2013 can indicate which stations are active in connection with events, which implies something about the information being passed and perhaps something about the personnel/access of those associated with some stations\nWho changes from station to station, or medium to medium \u2013 can indicate movement, fear of interceptionThere is a close relationship between traffic analysis and cryptanalysis (commonly called codebreaking). Callsigns and addresses are frequently encrypted, requiring assistance in identifying them. Traffic volume can often be a sign of an addressee's importance, giving hints to pending objectives or movements to cryptanalysts.\n\n\n*** Traffic flow security ***\nTraffic-flow security is the use of measures that conceal the presence and properties of valid messages on a network to prevent traffic analysis. This can be done by operational procedures or by the protection resulting from features inherent in some cryptographic equipment. Techniques used include:\n\nchanging radio callsigns frequently\nencryption of a message's sending and receiving addresses (codress messages)\ncausing the circuit to appear busy at all times or much of the time by sending dummy traffic\nsending a continuous encrypted signal, whether or not traffic is being transmitted. This is also called masking or  link encryption.Traffic-flow security is one aspect of communications security.\n\n\n*** COMINT metadata analysis ***\nThe Communications' Metadata Intelligence, or COMINT metadata is a term in communications intelligence (COMINT) referring to the concept of producing intelligence by analyzing only the technical metadata, hence, is a great practical example for traffic analysis in intelligence.While traditionally information gathering in COMINT is derived from intercepting transmissions, tapping the target's communications and monitoring the content of conversations, the metadata intelligence is not based on content but on technical communicational data.\nNon-content COMINT is usually used to deduce information about the user of a certain transmitter, such as locations, contacts, activity volume, routine and its exceptions.\n\n== Examples ==\nFor example, if an emitter is known as the radio transmitter of a certain unit, and by using direction finding (DF) tools, the position of the emitter is locatable, the change of locations from one point to another can be deduced, without listening to any orders or reports. If one unit reports back to a command on a certain pattern, and another unit reports on the same pattern to the same command, then the two units are probably related, and that conclusion is based on the metadata of the two units' transmissions, not on the content of their transmissions.\nUsing all, or as much of the metadata available is commonly used to build up an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB) \u2013 mapping different entities in the battlefield and their connections. Of course the EOB could be built by tapping all the conversations and trying to understand which unit is where, but using the metadata with an automatic analysis tool enables a much faster and accurate EOB build-up that alongside tapping builds a much better and complete picture.\n\n\n*** World War I ***\nBritish analysts in World War I noticed that the call sign of German Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, commanding the hostile fleet, had been transferred to a land station. Admiral of the Fleet Beatty, ignorant of Scheer's practice of changing callsigns upon leaving harbor, dismissed its importance and disregarded Room 40 analysts' attempts to make the point. The German fleet sortied, and the British were late in meeting them at the Battle of Jutland. If traffic analysis had been taken more seriously, the British might have done better than a \"draw\".\nFrench military intelligence, shaped by Kerckhoffs's legacy, had erected a network of intercept stations at the Western front in pre-war times. When the Germans crossed the frontier, the French worked out crude means for direction-finding based on intercepted signal intensity. Recording of call-signs and volume of traffic further enabled them to identify German combat groups and to distinguish between fast-moving cavalry and slower infantry.\n\n\n*** World War II ***\nIn early World War II, the aircraft carrier HMS Glorious was evacuating pilots and planes from Norway. Traffic analysis produced indications Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were moving into the North Sea, but the Admiralty dismissed the report as unproven. The captain of Glorious did not keep sufficient lookout, and was subsequently surprised and sunk. Harry Hinsley, the young Bletchley Park liaison to the Admiralty, later said his reports from the traffic analysts were taken much more seriously thereafter.\nDuring the planning and rehearsal for the attack on Pearl Harbor, very little traffic was passed by radio, subject to interception. The ships, units, and commands involved were all in Japan and in touch by phone, courier, signal lamp, or even flag. None of that traffic was intercepted, and could not be analyzed.\nThe espionage effort against Pearl Harbor before December didn't send an unusual number of messages; Japanese vessels regularly called in Hawaii and messages were carried aboard by consular personnel. At least one such vessel carried some Japanese Navy Intelligence officers. Such messages cannot be analyzed. It has been suggested, however, the volume of diplomatic traffic to and from certain consular stations might have indicated places of interest to Japan, which might thus have suggested locations to concentrate traffic analysis and decryption efforts.\nAdmiral Nagumo's Pearl Harbor Attack Force sailed under radio silence, with its radios physically locked down. It is unclear if this deceived the U.S.; Pacific Fleet intelligence was unable to locate the Japanese carriers in the days immediately preceding the attack on Pearl Harbor.\nThe Japanese Navy played radio games to inhibit traffic analysis (see Examples, below) with the attack force after it sailed in late November.  Radio operators normally assigned to carriers, with a characteristic Morse Code \"fist\", transmitted from inland Japanese waters, suggesting the carriers were still near Japan.\nOperation Quicksilver, part of the British deception plan for the Invasion of Normandy in World War II, fed German intelligence a combination of true and  false information about troop deployments in Britain, causing the Germans to deduce an order of battle which suggested an invasion at the Pas-de-Calais instead of Normandy. The fictitious divisions created for this deception were supplied with real radio units, which maintained a flow of messages consistent with the deception.\n\n== In computer security ==\nTraffic analysis is also a concern in computer security. An attacker can gain important information by monitoring the frequency and timing of network packets. A timing attack on the SSH protocol can use timing information to deduce information about passwords since, during interactive session, SSH transmits each keystroke as a message. The time between keystroke messages can be studied using hidden Markov models. Song, et al. claim that it can recover the password fifty times faster than a brute force attack.\nOnion routing systems are used to gain anonymity.  Traffic analysis can be used to attack anonymous communication systems like the Tor anonymity network.  Adam Back, Ulf M\u00f6eller and Anton Stiglic present traffic analysis attacks against anonymity providing systems \n. Steven J. Murdoch and George Danezis from University of Cambridge presented  \n \nresearch showing that traffic-analysis allows adversaries to infer which nodes relay the anonymous streams.  This reduces the anonymity provided by Tor. They have shown that otherwise unrelated streams can be linked back to the same initiator.\nRemailer systems can also be attacked via traffic analysis. If a message is observed going to a remailing server, and an identical-length (if now anonymized) message is seen exiting the server soon after, a traffic analyst may be able to (automatically) connect the sender with the ultimate receiver. Variations of remailer operations exist that can make traffic analysis less effective.\n\n== Countermeasures ==\nIt is difficult to defeat traffic analysis without both encrypting messages and masking the channel.  When no actual messages are being sent, the channel can be masked\n by sending dummy traffic, similar to the encrypted traffic, thereby keeping bandwidth usage constant\n. \"It is very hard to hide information about the size or timing of messages. The known solutions require Alice to send a continuous stream of messages at the maximum bandwidth she will ever use...This might be acceptable for military applications, but it is not for most civilian applications.\" The military-versus-civilian problems applies in situations where the user is charged for the volume of information sent.\nEven for Internet access, where there is not a per-packet charge, ISPs make statistical assumption that connections from user sites will not be busy 100% of the time. The user cannot simply increase the bandwidth of the link, since masking would fill that as well. If masking, which often can be built into end-to-end encryptors, becomes common practice, ISPs will have to change their traffic assumptions.\n\nQuestions: How does traffic analysis deduce information from patterns in communication even when messages are encrypted?q: How does traffic analysis support cryptanalysis in military intelligence?q: What is traffic-flow security, and how does it prevent traffic analysis?q: How does COMINT metadata intelligence differ from traditional COMINT methods?q: Can changing call signs and maintaining radio silence deceive traffic analysis in military applications?q: How can traffic analysis be used to attack anonymous communication systems like the Tor anonymity network?q: How do remailer systems work, and how can they be attacked via traffic analysis?q: What are some countermeasures against traffic analysis in civilian applications?q: How can traffic analysis be used in pattern-of-life analysis in a military context?q: How can traffic analysis contribute to building an Electronic Order of Battle (EOB) in intelligence?q: How were British analysts in World War I affected by the dismissal of traffic analysis warnings?q: How did French military intelligence in World War I use traffic analysis to identify German combat groups and distinguish between cavalry and infantry?q: How was traffic analysis used in the planning and rehearsal for the attack on Pearl Harbor in World War II?q: How did the Japanese Navy play radio games to inhibit traffic analysis in World War II?q: How did Operation Quicksilver, part of the British deception plan for the Invasion of Normandy in World War II, use traffic analysis to deceive German intelligence?",

    "instruction": "text: Linux Unified Key Setup\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) is a disk encryption specification created by Clemens Fruhwirth in 2004 and originally intended for Linux.\nWhile most disk encryption software implements different, incompatible, and undocumented formats, LUKS implements a platform-independent standard on-disk format for use in various tools. This not only facilitates compatibility and interoperability among different programs, but also assures that they all implement password management in a secure and documented manner.\n\n\n\n== Description ==\nLUKS is used to encrypt a block device. The contents of the encrypted device are arbitrary, and therefore any filesystem can be encrypted, including swap partitions. There is an unencrypted header at the beginning of an encrypted volume, which allows up to 8 (LUKS1) or 32 (LUKS2) encryption keys to be stored along with encryption parameters such as cipher type and key size.The presence of this header is a major difference between LUKS and plain dm-crypt, since the header allows multiple different passphrases to be used, with the ability to change and remove them with ease. However, if the header is lost or corrupted, the device will no longer be decryptable.Encryption is done with a multi-layer approach. First, the block device is encrypted using multiple master keys, each of which is encrypted with an active user key in each keyslot. While keyslots often contain a passphrase, other kinds of keys include OpenPGP public keys or X.509 certificates. PGP public keys can be used in combination with an OpenPGP smart card which is inserted into the host. This layered scheme is known as TKS1.There are two versions of LUKS, with LUKS2 having features such as resilience to header corruption, and using the Argon2 key derivation function by default, whereas LUKS1 uses PBKDF2. Conversion between both versions of LUKS is possible in certain situations, but some features may not be available with LUKS1 such as Argon2. LUKS2 uses JSON as a metadata format.Available cryptographic algorithms depends on individual kernel support of the host. Libgcrypt can be used as a backend for hashing, which supports all of its algorithms. It is up to the operating system vendor to choose the default algorithm. LUKS1 makes use of an anti-forensics technique called AFsplitter, allowing for secure data erasure and protection.\n\n\n*** Using LUKS with LVM ***\nLogical Volume Management can be used alongside LUKS.\nLVM on LUKS\nWhen LVM is used on an unlocked LUKS container, all underlying partitions (which are LVM logical volumes) can be encrypted with a single key. This is akin to splitting a LUKS container into multiple partitions. The LVM structure is not visible until the disk is decrypted.\nLUKS on LVM\nWhen LUKS is used to encrypt LVM logical volumes, an encrypted volume can span multiple devices. The underlying LVM volume group is visible without decrypting the encrypted volumes.\n\n\n*** Full disk encryption ***\n\nA common usage of LUKS is to provide full disk encryption, which involves encrypting the root partition of an operating system installation, which protects the operating system files from being tampered with or read by unauthorized parties.On a Linux system, the boot partition (/boot) may be encrypted if the bootloader itself supports LUKS (e.g. GRUB). This is undertaken to prevent tampering of the Linux kernel. However, the first stage bootloader or an EFI system partition cannot be encrypted (see Full disk encryption#The boot key problem).On mobile Linux systems, postmarketOS has developed osk-sdl to allow a full disk encrypted system to be unlocked using a touch screen.\n\n\n*** Encrypted home directories ***\nOn systems running systemd, the systemd-homed component can be used to encrypt individual home directories.\n\n== Operating system support ==\nThe reference implementation for LUKS operates on Linux and is based on an enhanced version of cryptsetup, using dm-crypt as the disk encryption backend. Under Microsoft Windows, LUKS-encrypted disks can be used via the Windows Subsystem for Linux. (Formerly, this was possible with LibreCrypt, which currently has fundamental security holes, and which succeeded FreeOTFE, formerly DoxBox.)\nDragonFly BSD supports LUKS.\n\n\n*** Installer support ***\nSeveral Linux distributions allow the root device to be encrypted upon OS installation. These installers include Calamares, Ubiquity, Debian-Installer, and more.\n\n== On-disk format ==\nLUKS headers are backward compatible; newer versions of LUKS should be able to read headers of previous versions.\n\n\n*** LUKS1 ***\n\n\n*** LUKS2 ***\nLUKS2 devices begin with a binary header intended to allow recognition and fast detection by blkid, which also contains information such as checksums. All strings used in a LUKS2 header are null-terminated strings. Directly after the binary header comes the JSON area, containing the objects config (configuration), keyslots, digests, segments (describes encrypted areas on the disk), and tokens containing extra metadata.The binary format for regular luks2 keyslots are mostly similar to their predecessor, with the addition of different per-keyslot algorithms. Another type of key exists to allow redundancy in the case that a re-encryption process is interrupted.\n\n== Examples ==\nCryptsetup is the reference implementation of the LUKS frontend.\nTo encrypt a device with the path /dev/sda1:\n\nTo unlock an encrypted device, where name is the mapped device name:\n\n\n*** Re-encrypting ***\nRe-encrypting a LUKS container can be done either with the cryptsetup tool itself, or with a legacy tool called cryptsetup-reencrypt. These tools can also be used to add encryption to an existing unencrypted filesystem, or remove encryption from a block device.Both methods have similar syntax:\n\nQuestions: What is the purpose of the Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) and how does it differ from other disk encryption software?question: What is the significance of the header in LUKS encrypted device?question: How is encryption done in LUKS and what is TKS1?question: How does LUKS2 differ from LUKS1 and what are its features?question: What is the role of Logical Volume Management (LVM) in LUKS and how is it used alongside it?question: How is full disk encryption achieved using LUKS and what are its benefits?question: How are individual home directories encrypted using LUKS?question: What operating systems support LUKS and how can LUKS-encrypted disks be used on Microsoft Windows?question: Which Linux distributions allow the root device to be encrypted upon OS installation?question: How does LUKS ensure backward compatibility of its headers?question: What are the different parts of a LUKS2 device and how are they used?question: What is the role of the different per-keyslot algorithms in LUKS2 regular luks2 keyslots?question: What is the purpose of the anti-forensics technique called AFsplitter in LUKS1?question: How can a LUKS container be re-encrypted and what tools can be used for this purpose?question: What is the syntax for re-encrypting a LUKS container using the cryptsetup tool?",

    "instruction": "Application virtualization\n\n==Introduction==\nApplication virtualization is a software technology that encapsulates computer programs from the underlying operating system on which they are executed. A fully virtualized application is not installed in the traditional sense, although it is still executed as if it were. The application behaves at runtime like it is directly interfacing with the original operating system and all the resources managed by it, but can be isolated or sandboxed to varying degrees.\nIn this context, the term \"virtualization\" refers to the artifact being encapsulated (application), which is quite different from its meaning in hardware virtualization, where it refers to the artifact being abstracted (physical hardware).\n\n== Description ==\n\nFull application virtualization requires a virtualization layer. Application virtualization layers replace part of the runtime environment normally provided by the operating system.  The layer intercepts all disk operations of virtualized applications and transparently redirects them to a virtualized location, often a single file.  The application remains unaware that it accesses a virtual resource instead of a physical one.  Since the application is now working with one file instead of many files spread throughout the system, it becomes easy to run the application on a different computer and previously incompatible applications can be run side by side. Examples of this technology for the Windows platform include:\n\n== Benefits ==\nApplication virtualization allows applications to run in environments that do not suit the native application. For example, Wine allows some Microsoft Windows applications to run on Linux. \nApplication virtualization reduces system integration and administration costs by maintaining a common software baseline across multiple diverse computers in an organization. Lesser integration protects the operating system and other applications from poorly written or buggy code. In some cases, it provides memory protection, IDE-style debugging features and may even run applications that are not written correctly, for example applications that try to store user data in a read-only system-owned location. (This feature assists in the implementation of the principle of least privilege by removing the requirement for end-users to have administrative privileges in order to run poorly written applications.) It allows incompatible applications to run side by side, at the same time and with minimal regression testing against one another. Isolating applications from the operating system has security benefits as well, as the exposure of the virtualized application does not automatically entail the exposure of the entire OS.Application virtualization also enables simplified operating system migrations. Applications can be transferred to removable media or between computers without the need of installing them, becoming portable software.\nApplication virtualization uses fewer resources than a separate virtual machine.\n\n== Limitations ==\nNot all computer programs can be virtualized.  Some examples include applications that require a device driver (a form of integration with the OS) and 16-bit applications that need to run in shared memory space. Anti-virus programs and applications that require heavy OS integration, such as WindowBlinds or StyleXP are difficult to virtualize.\nMoreover, in software licensing, application virtualization bears great licensing pitfalls mainly because both the application virtualization software and the virtualized applications must be correctly licensed.While application virtualization can address file and Registry-level compatibility issues between legacy applications and newer operating systems, applications that don't manage the heap correctly will not execute on Windows Vista as they still allocate memory in the same way, regardless of whether they are virtualized. For this reason, specialist application compatibility fixes (shims) may still be needed, even if the application is virtualized.Functional discrepancies within the multicompatibility model are an additional limitation, where utility-driven access points are shared within a public network. These limitations are overcome by designating a system level share point driver.\n\n== Related technologies ==\nTechnology categories that fall under application virtualization include:\n\nApplication streaming.  Pieces of the application's code, data, and settings are delivered when they're first needed, instead of the entire application being delivered before startup.  Running the packaged application may require the installation of a lightweight client application.  Packages are usually delivered over a protocol such as HTTP, CIFS or RTSP.\nRemote Desktop Services (formerly called Terminal Services) is a server-based computing/presentation virtualization component of Microsoft Windows that allows a user to access applications and data hosted on a remote computer over a network. Remote Desktop Services sessions run in a single shared-server operating system (e.g. Windows Server 2008 R2 and later) and are accessed using the Remote Desktop Protocol.\nDesktop virtualization software technologies improve portability, manageability and compatibility of a personal computer's desktop environment by separating part or all of the desktop environment and associated applications from the physical client device that is used to access it.

Remote Desktop Services sessions run in a single shared-server operating system (e.g. Windows Server 2008 R2 and later) and are accessed using the Remote Desktop Protocol.\nDesktop virtualization software technologies improve portability, manageability and compatibility of a personal computer's desktop environment by separating part or all of the desktop environment and associated applications from the physical client device that is used to access it. A common implementation of this approach is to host multiple desktop operating system instances on a server hardware platform running a hypervisor. This is generally referred to as \"virtual desktop infrastructure\" (VDI).",

      "answers": "Application virtualization is a technology that encapsulates computer programs from the underlying operating system, while hardware virtualization abstracts physical hardware. In application virtualization, the application behaves as if it is directly interfacing with the original operating system, but can be isolated or sandboxed. In contrast, hardware virtualization creates a virtual machine that abstracts the hardware and runs an operating system on top of it.a: A virtualization layer is required for full application virtualization. This layer replaces part of the runtime environment normally provided by the operating system and intercepts all disk operations of virtualized applications, transparently redirecting them to a virtualized location, often a single file. The application remains unaware that it accesses a virtual resource instead of a physical one.a: Application virtualization allows applications to run in environments that do not suit the native application, reducing system integration and administration costs, and protecting the operating system and other applications from poorly written or buggy code. It also provides memory protection, IDE-style debugging features, and allows incompatible applications to run side by side. Isolating applications from the operating system has security benefits as well, as the exposure of the virtualized application does not automatically entail the exposure of the entire OS.a: Not all computer programs can be virtualized, and anti-virus programs and applications that require heavy OS integration are difficult to virtualize. Additionally, application virtualization bears great licensing pitfalls because both the application virtualization software and the virtualized applications must be correctly licensed.a: Application virtualization removes the requirement for end-users to have administrative privileges in order to run poorly written applications, which assists in the implementation of the principle of least privilege.a: Applications can be transferred to removable media or between computers without the need of installing them, becoming portable software. This makes it easier to perform operating system migrations.a: Application streaming is a technology that delivers pieces of an application's code, data, and settings when they're first needed, instead of delivering the entire application before startup. This is different from full application virtualization, where the entire application is delivered before startup.a: Remote Desktop Services is a server-based computing/presentation virtualization component of Microsoft Windows that allows a user to access applications and data hosted on a remote computer over a network. It differs from application virtualization in that sessions run in a single shared-server operating system and are accessed using the Remote Desktop Protocol.a: Desktop virtualization software technologies improve portability, manageability, and compatibility of a personal computer's desktop environment by separating part or all of the desktop environment and associated applications from the physical client device that is used to access it. A common implementation of this approach is to host multiple desktop operating system instances on a server hardware platform running a hypervisor.a: Application virtualization can address file and Registry-level compatibility issues between legacy applications and newer operating systems by delivering pieces of the application's code, data, and settings when they're first needed.a: Functional discrepancies within the multicompatibility model limit application virtualization by causing utility-driven access points to be shared within a public network. These limitations are overcome by designating a system level share point driver.a: Application virtualization uses fewer resources than a separate virtual machine because it does not require a separate operating system to be installed and run.a: Application virtualization enables applications to run in environments that do not suit the native application by encapsulating the application from the underlying operating system and intercepting all disk operations, transparently redirecting them to a virtualized location.a: Application virtualization reduces system integration and administration costs by maintaining a common software baseline across multiple diverse computers in an organization and protecting the operating system and other applications from poorly written or buggy code.a: Application virtualization provides memory protection by isolating or sandboxing the application, and IDE-style debugging features by allowing the application to be run as if it were directly interfacing with the original operating system.a: Application virtualization allows incompatible applications to run side by side by providing a virtualized location for the application to access, rather than a physical one. This makes it easy to run the application on a different computer and previously incompatible applications can be run side by side."

    "instruction": "text: Threema\n\n==Introduction==\nThreema is a paid cross-platform encrypted instant messaging app developed by Threema GmbH in Switzerland and launched in 2012. The service operates on a decentralized architecture and offers end-to-end encryption. Users can make voice and video calls, send photos, files, and voice notes, share locations, and make groups. Unlike many other popular secure messaging apps, Threema does not require phone numbers or email address for registration, only a one-time purchase. Threema is available on iOS and Android and has clients for Windows, macOS, Linux, and can be accessed via web browser but requires a mobile app to function.\n\n== Features ==\nThe service claims to be based on the privacy by design principles by not requiring a phone number or other personally identifiable information. This helps anonymize the users to a degree.Threema uses a user ID, created after the initial app launch by a random generator, instead of requiring a linked email address or phone number to send messages. It is possible to find other users by phone number or email address if the user allows the app to synchronize their address book. Linking a phone number or email address to a Threema ID is optional. Hence, the service can be used anonymously. Users can verify the identity of their Threema contacts by scanning their QR code when they meet physically. The QR code contains the public key of the user, which is cryptographically tied to the ID and will not change during the lifetime of the identity. Using this strong authentication feature, users can make sure they have the correct public key from their chat partners, which provides additional security against a Man-in-the-middle attack. Threema knows three levels of authentication (trust levels of the contact's identity). The verification level of each contact is displayed in the Threema application as dots next to the corresponding contact.\nIn addition to text messaging, users can make voice and video calls, send multimedia, locations, voice messages, and files. A web app version, Threema Web, can be used on desktop devices, but only as long as the phone with the Threema installation of the user is online.\nIn addition to one-on-one chats, Threema offers group chats up to 256 people. Users can make voice and video calls, send text and voice messages, multimedia, locations, and files of any type (up to 50 MB per file). It is also possible to create polls in personal or group chats.\n\n== Software ==\nThreema is developed by the Swiss company Threema GmbH. The servers are in Switzerland and the development is based in Pf\u00e4ffikon SZ. As of May 2021, Threema had 10 million users and the business version, Threema Work, was used by 2 million users across 5,000 companies and organizations.At the end of July, 2021 Threema introduced the ability for companies to host the messenger on their own server, primarily intended for companies with significantly high privacy concerns.\n\n\n*** Clients ***\nWith Threema Web, a client for web browsers, Threema can be used from other devices like desktop computers, though only as long as the original device is online.\nThreema optionally supports Android Wear smartwatch and Android Auto. Threema launched support for end-to-end encrypted video calls on August 10, 2020. The calls are person-to-person with group calls unavailable.The application does not allow the self-deletion of messages after a period defined by the interlocutors.\nThe application does prevent screenshots in conversations when configured to do so.\n\n\n*** Architecture ***\nThe entire communication via Threema is end-to-end encrypted. During the initial setup, the application generates a key pair and sends the public key to the server while keeping the private key on the user's device. The application then encrypts all messages and files that are sent to other Threema users with their respective public keys. Once a message is delivered successfully, it is immediately deleted from the servers.The encryption process used by Threema is based on the open-source library NaCl library. Threema uses asymmetric ECC-based encryption, with 256-bit strength. Threema offers a \"Validation Logging\" feature that makes it possible to confirm that messages are end-to-end encrypted using the NaCl Networking and Cryptography library. In August 2015, Threema was subjected to an external security audit. Researchers from cnlab confirmed that Threema allows secure end-to-end encryption, and claimed that they were unable to identify any weaknesses in the implementation. Cnlab researchers also confirmed that Threema provides anonymity to its users and handles contacts and other user data as advertised.\n\n== Related products ==\nThreema Work: On May 25, 2016, Threema Work, a corporate version of Threema, was released. Threema Work offers extended administration and deployment capabilities. Threema Work is based on a yearly subscription model.Threema Gateway: On March 20, 2015, Threema released a gateway for companies. Similar to an SMS gateway, businesses can use it to send messages to their users who have Threema installed. The code for the Threema Gateway SDK is open for developers and available on GitHub.Threema Broadcast: On August 9, 2018, Threema released Threema Broadcast, a tool for top-down communication. Similar to emails in electronic newsletters, Threema messages can be sent to any number of feed subscribers, and the Threema Broadcast allows to create chatbots.Threema Education: On September 10, 2020, Threema released Threema Education, a version of its messenger designed for education institutions. The app integrates Threema Broadcast and requires a one-time payment for each device used. It's intended for use by teachers, students, and parents.Threema OnPrem: On July 27, 2021, Threema released Threema OnPrem, a version of the messenger which could be hosted on a company's own servers for maximum security purposes.\n\n== Privacy ==\nSince Threema's servers are in Switzerland, they are subject to the Swiss federal law on data protection. The data center is ISO/IEC 27001-certified. Linking a phone number and/or email address to a Threema ID is optional; when doing so, only checksum values (SHA-256 HMAC with a static key) of the email address and/or phone number are sent to the server. Due to the small number of possible digit combinations of a telephone number, the phone number associated with a checksum could be determined by brute force. The transmitted data is TLS-secured. The address book data is kept only in the volatile memory of the server and is deleted immediately after synchronizing contacts. If a user chooses to link a phone number or email address with their Threema ID, they can remove the phone number or email address at any time. Should a user ever lose their device (and their private key), they can revoke their Threema ID if a revocation password for that ID has been set.Groups are solely managed on users\u2019 devices and group messages are sent to each recipient as an individual message, encrypted with the respective public key. Thus, group compositions are not directly exposed to the server.Data (including media files) stored on the users\u2019 devices is encrypted with AES 256. On Android, it can be additionally protected by a passphrase.Since 2016, Threema GmbH publishes a transparency report where public authority inquiries are disclosed.On March 9, 2017, Threema was listed in the \"Register of organizers of information dissemination in the Internet\" operated by the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media of the Russian Federation.In a response, a Threema spokesperson publicly stated: \"We operate under Swiss law and are neither allowed nor willing to provide any information about our users to foreign authorities.\"On April 29, 2021, Threema won a significant case at the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland against the Swiss Federal Department of Police and Justice, who wished to classify the company as a telecommunications provider. Had they lost the case, Threema would have had a legal requirement to identify users and send information about their users to law enforcement.Starting January 2022, Swiss Armed Forces suggested that the troops should use Threema instead of WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal, citing Threema being Swiss-based without servers in the United States and thus not subject to the CLOUD Act, also promising that soldiers would be reimbursed for the cost.\n\nQuestions: How does Threema ensure user anonymity in its messaging service?question: What is the role of QR codes in Threema's identity verification process?question: How does Threema protect the privacy of group chats?question: How does Threema ensure end-to-end encryption in its communication?question: What is the function of the NaCl library in Threema's encryption process?question: How does Threema handle the storage of user data on the server?question: What is Threema Work and how does it differ from the regular Threema service?question: How does Threema handle data protection and privacy for its users?question: How does Threema handle the self-deletion of messages after a period defined by the interlocutors?question: How does Threema prevent screenshots in conversations?question: How does Threema ensure that messages are end-to-end encrypted using the NaCl Networking and Cryptography library?question: How does Threema handle the case where a user loses their device and private key?question: How does Threema support Android Wear smartwatch and Android Auto?question: How does Threema ensure the security of voice and video calls?question: How does Threema handle the transmission of data associated with a phone number?",

    "instruction": "Read this and answer the below questions\n\nIdentity management theory\n\n==Introduction==\nIdentity management theory (also frequently referred to as IMT) is an intercultural communication theory from the 1990s. It was developed by William R. Cupach and Tadasu Todd Imahori on the basis of Erving Goffman's Interaction ritual: Essays on face-to-face behavior (1967). Cupach and Imahori distinguish between intercultural communication (speakers from different cultures) and intracultural communication (speakers sharing the same culture).\nTo understand IMT, it is important to be familiar with Cupach and Imahori's view of identities. Among the multiple identities which an individual possesses, cultural and relational identities are regarded as essential to IMT.\nThere are two ways of IMT. Cupach and Imahori claim that presenting one's face shows facets of an individual's identity. Whether an interlocuter is able to maintain face or not, reveals his or her interpersonal communication competence. The use of stereotypes in intercultural conversations often results from the ignorance of each other's culture; the application of stereotypes, however, is face threatening. Being able to manage the resulting tensions, is part of intercultural communication competence. For becoming competent in developing intercultural relationships, the following three phases have to be passed:\n\n\"trial and error\": act of looking for similar aspects in certain identities.\n\"mixing up\" the communicators' identities to achieve a relational identity acceptable for both participants\nrenegotiating the distinctive cultural identities with the help of the relational identity that was created in phase 2Cupach and Imahori call these phases \"cyclical\" as they are gone through by intercultural communicators for each aspect of their identities.\nErving Goffman is an author off of which the originators of IMT based their theory. Goffman was a well-known sociologist and writer and the most cited sociologist from his writings because of what he studied in communication. Among the six essays that make up Goffman's book, the first essay shows an individual's self-image while engaging in communicating with another individual. The author explained that the self-image that is obtained during interacting is not permanent and has a large social influence. The image someone gets in a social setting is than expected for the future. The risk of changing self-image in a social context will alter how the individual feels about oneself. The author was implying that oftentimes the defense mechanism is to retract from showing your self to much in a social setting so others do not see them in a displeasing way. The idea of the identity management theory uses the ideas of Goffman to help establish what the idea behind the theory is trying to get at.\nIntercultural verse intracultural communication varies significantly. Intercultural communication is based on a much greater scheme of things. This type of communication refers to a group of people that differ in backgrounds, whether that is religion, ethnic, education, or social backgrounds. Intercultural communication looks at how the world is viewed, how messages are interpreted, and how differing cultures react to situations [Communication ]. On the contrary, intracultural communication discusses how people of the same background interact with one another. I thought it was interesting that there was not a Wikipedia page discussing this concept. It is very important to compare and contrast intercultural communication to understand the similarities and differences. With little research conducted on intracultural communication, I am unable to correlate the two types of communication.\nThe last concept to expand on is identity. Identity is directly connected with the identity management theory since it helps define what this theory is trying to explain.  Even though identity is a very broad topic, I will discuss personal identity through the lens of the individual, which will than effect its social identity. Identity is said to be the \"distinct personality of an individual\" identity. Identity can be the view that people hold about themselves.

      "context": "Identity management theory\n\n==Introduction==\nIdentity management theory (also frequently referred to as IMT) is an intercultural communication theory from the 1990s. It was developed by William R. Cupach and Tadasu Todd Imahori on the basis of Erving Goffman's Interaction ritual: Essays on face-to-face behavior (1967). Cupach and Imahori distinguish between intercultural communication (speakers from different cultures) and intracultural communication (speakers sharing the same culture).\nTo understand IMT, it is important to be familiar with Cupach and Imahori's view of identities. Among the multiple identities which an individual possesses, cultural and relational identities are regarded as essential to IMT.\nThere are two ways of IMT. Cupach and Imahori claim that presenting one's face shows facets of an individual's identity. Whether an interlocuter is able to maintain face or not, reveals his or her interpersonal communication competence. The use of stereotypes in intercultural conversations often results from the ignorance of each other's culture; the application of stereotypes, however, is face threatening. Being able to manage the resulting tensions, is part of intercultural communication competence. For becoming competent in developing intercultural relationships, the following three phases have to be passed:\n\n\"trial and error\": act of looking for similar aspects in certain identities.\n\"mixing up\" the communicators' identities to achieve a relational identity acceptable for both participants\nrenegotiating the distinctive cultural identities with the help of the relational identity that was created in phase 2Cupach and Imahori call these phases \"cyclical\" as they are gone through by intercultural communicators for each aspect of their identities.\nErving Goffman is an author off of which the originators of IMT based their theory. Goffman was a well-known sociologist and writer and the most cited sociologist from his writings because of what he studied in communication. Among the six essays that make up Goffman's book, the first essay shows an individual's self-image while engaging in communicating with another individual. The author explained that the self-image that is obtained during interacting is not permanent and has a large social influence. The image someone gets in a social setting is than expected for the future. The risk of changing self-image in a social context will alter how the individual feels about oneself. The author was implying that oftentimes the defense mechanism is to retract from showing your self to much in a social setting so others do not see them in a displeasing way. The idea of the identity management theory uses the ideas of Goffman to help establish what the idea behind the theory is trying to get at.\nIntercultural verse intracultural communication varies significantly. Intercultural communication is based on a much greater scheme of things. This type of communication refers to a group of people that differ in backgrounds, whether that is religion, ethnic, education, or social backgrounds. Intercultural communication looks at how the world is viewed, how messages are interpreted, and how differing cultures react to situations [Communication ]. On the contrary, intracultural communication discusses how people of the same background interact with one another. I thought it was interesting that there was not a Wikipedia page discussing this concept. It is very important to compare and contrast intercultural communication to understand the similarities and differences. With little research conducted on intracultural communication, I am unable to correlate the two types of communication.\nThe last concept to expand on is identity. Identity is directly connected with the identity management theory since it helps define what this theory is trying to explain.  Even though identity is a very broad topic, I will discuss personal identity through the lens of the individual, which will than effect its social identity. Identity is said to be the \"distinct personality of an individual\" identity. Identity can be the view that people hold about themselves. Also, identity is the perception that people hold about themselves in a social setting. Identity has many subtopics that distinguish why this theory is specific and different from other identity theories. Specific characteristics explain how people feel about themselves as an individual and in a social setting.\n\n== Identity management strategies ==\nSocial identity theory suggests that individuals and groups use different identity management strategies to cope with threatened identities.\nIn a study conducted in Northern Ireland five identity management strategies were tested to see the effects of the person's identity in light of other people.\nThe five strategies included\n\nIndividualization\nSocial competition\nChange of comparison dimensions\nTemporal comparisons\nSubordinate re-categorizationThe five strategies previously listed can further be separated into two subgroups depending on the style of how they are manifested.

    "instruction": "Answer questions about:\nExec Shield\n\n==Introduction==\nExec Shield is a project started at Red Hat, Inc in late 2002 with the aim of reducing the risk of worm or other automated remote attacks on Linux systems. The first result of the project was a security patch for the Linux kernel that emulates an NX bit on x86 CPUs that lack a native NX implementation in hardware. While the Exec Shield project has had many other components, some people refer to this first patch as Exec Shield.\nThe first Exec Shield patch attempts to flag data memory as non-executable and program memory as non-writeable. This suppresses many security exploits, such as those stemming from buffer overflows and other techniques relying on overwriting data and inserting code into those structures.  Exec Shield also supplies some address space layout randomization for the mmap() and heap base.\nThe patch additionally increases the difficulty of inserting and executing shellcode, rendering most exploits ineffective. No application recompilation is necessary to fully utilize exec-shield, although some applications (Mono, Wine, XEmacs, Mplayer) are not fully compatible.\nOther features that came out of the Exec Shield project were the Position Independent Executables (PIE), the address space randomization patch for Linux kernels, a wide set of glibc internal security checks that make heap and format string exploits near impossible, the GCC Fortify Source feature, and the port and merge of the GCC stack-protector feature.\n\n\n\n== Implementation ==\nExec Shield works on all x86 CPUs utilizing the Code Segment limit.  Because of the way Exec Shield works, it is very lightweight; however, it won't fully protect arbitrary virtual memory layouts.  If the CS limit is raised, for example by calling mprotect() to make higher memory executable, then the protections are lost below that limit.  Ingo Molnar points this out in an e-mail conversation.  Most applications are fairly sane at this; the stack (the important part) at least winds up above any mapped libraries, so does not become executable except by explicit calls by the application.\nAs of August, 2004, nothing from the Exec Shield projects attempt to enforce memory protections by restricting mprotect() on any architecture; although memory may not initially be executable, it may become executable later, so the kernel will allow an application to mark memory pages as both writable and executable at the same time.

    "instruction": "Here are some questions about this text: ROCA vulnerability\n\n==Introduction==\nThe ROCA vulnerability is a cryptographic weakness that allows the \nprivate key of a key pair to be recovered from the public key in keys generated by devices with the vulnerability. \"ROCA\" is an acronym for \"Return of Coppersmith's attack\". The vulnerability has been given the identifier CVE-2017-15361.\nThe vulnerability arises from a problem with an approach to RSA key generation used in vulnerable versions of a software library, RSALib, provided by Infineon Technologies, and incorporated into many smart cards, Trusted Platform Module (TPM), and Hardware Security Modules (HSM) implementations, including YubiKey 4 tokens, often used to generate PGP keys. Keys of lengths 512, 1024, and 2048 bits generated using these versions of the Infineon library are vulnerable to a practical ROCA attack. The research team that discovered the attack (all with Masaryk University and led by Mat\u00fa\u0161 Nemec and Marek S\u00fds)  estimate that it affected around one-quarter of all current TPM devices globally. Millions of smart cards are believed to be affected.The team informed Infineon of the RSALib problem in February 2017, but withheld public notice until mid-October, citing responsible disclosure. At that time they announced the attack and provided a tool to test public keys for vulnerability. They published the details of the attack in November.\n\n== Technical details ==\nGenerating an RSA key involves selecting two large randomly-generated prime numbers, a process that can be time-consuming, particularly on small devices, such as smart cards. In addition to being primes, the numbers should have certain other properties for best security. The vulnerable RSALib selection process quickly creates primes of the desired type by only testing for primality numbers of the form:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        k\n        \u2217\n        M\n        +\n        (\n        \n          65537\n          \n            a\n          \n        \n        \n        mod\n        \n        \n        M\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k*M+(65537^{a}\\mod {M})}\n  where \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n   is the product of the first n successive primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13,...), and n is a constant that only depends on the desired key size. The security is based on the secret constants \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n  . The ROCA attack exploits this particular format for primes using a variation of the Coppersmith method. In addition, public keys generated this way have a distinctive fingerprint that can be quickly recognized by attempting to compute the discrete logarithm of the public key mod \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n   to base 65537. Computing discrete logarithms in a large group is usually extremely difficult, but in this case it can be done efficiently using the Pohlig\u2013Hellman algorithm because \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n   is a smooth number. A test site is available on the Internet.  In short, keys that fit this format have significantly low entropy and can be attacked relatively efficiently (weeks to months), and the format can be confirmed (\"fingerprinted\") by the attacker very quickly (microseconds). Multiple implementations of the attack are publicly available.\n\n== Mitigation ==\nThe ROCA authors consider public keys of length 512, 1024 and 2048-bits generated by RSALib  to be vulnerable. Because the details of key generation differ for different key lengths, shorter keys are not necessarily more vulnerable than longer keys. For example, a 1952-bit RSAlib key is stronger than a 2048-bit key and a 4096-bit key is weaker than a 3072-bit key.\nThe best mitigation, according to the authors, is to generate RSA keys using a stronger method, such as by OpenSSL. If that is not possible, the ROCA authors suggest using key lengths that are less susceptible to ROCA such as 3936-bit, 3072-bit or, if there is a 2048-bit key size maximum, 1952-bits.:\u200aSec 5.1\u200aInfineon has released firmware updates for its Trusted Platform Modules to manufacturers who have used its TPMs.\n\n== Implications ==\nThe vulnerability highlighted several shortcomings of the Common Criteria certification scheme as the vulnerability was present in a list of Common Criteria certified smart card products. Namely, the approval of homegrown cryptographic algorithms; the lack of transparency in certification reports, inability to revoke Common Criteria certificates for known vulnerable products and distribute this information to the users of the certified products.:\u200aSec 6.7.5\u200aIn Estonia, the discovery of the vulnerability resulted in a state-level cyber crisis as the vulnerable smart card chip was deployed on more than 750,000 Estonian identity cards that are used daily by Estonian residents and e-residents to securely authenticate online and create digital signatures.:\u200aSec 6.7\nWhat are the answers to these questions: How is the ROCA vulnerability related to RSA key generation?q: What is the approach to RSA key generation used in the vulnerable versions of RSALib?q: What is the security of the ROCA vulnerability based on?q: What is the ROCA attack and how does it exploit the prime number selection process?q: How can the distinctive fingerprint of public keys generated using the vulnerable RSALib selection process be confirmed?q: What is the best mitigation for the ROCA vulnerability, according to the authors?q: What firmware updates has Infineon released for its Trusted Platform Modules to mitigate the ROCA vulnerability?q: What are the shortcomings of the Common Criteria certification scheme highlighted by the ROCA vulnerability?q: What was the impact of the ROCA vulnerability in Estonia?q: How does the ROCA vulnerability allow the private key of a key pair to be recovered from the public key?q: What is the role of the Coppersmith method in the ROCA attack?q: How can public keys generated using the vulnerable RSALib selection process be tested for vulnerability?q: What is the impact of the ROCA vulnerability on the security of smart cards and Trusted Platform Module (TPM) implementations?q: What are the key sizes that are less susceptible to ROCA, according to the authors?q: How does the ROCA vulnerability impact the discrete logarithm computation?",

    "instruction": "Here are some questions about this text: Ciphertext\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, ciphertext or cyphertext is the result of encryption performed on plaintext using an algorithm, called a cipher. Ciphertext is also known as encrypted or encoded information because it contains a form of the original plaintext that is unreadable by a human or computer without the proper cipher to decrypt it. This process prevents the loss of sensitive information via hacking. Decryption, the inverse of encryption, is the process of turning ciphertext into readable plaintext. Ciphertext is not to be confused with codetext because the latter is a result of a code, not a cipher.\n\n== Conceptual underpinnings ==\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m\\!}\n    be the plaintext message that Alice wants to secretly transmit to Bob and let \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E_{k}\\!}\n   be the encryption cipher, where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle _{k}\\!}\n   is a cryptographic key. Alice must first transform the plaintext into ciphertext, \n  \n    \n      \n        c\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c\\!}\n  , in order to securely send the message to Bob, as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        c\n\n== Types of ciphers ==\n\nThe history of cryptography began thousands of years ago. Cryptography uses a variety of different types of encryption. Earlier algorithms were performed by hand and are substantially different from modern algorithms, which are generally executed by a machine.\n\n\n*** Historical ciphers ***\nHistorical pen and paper ciphers used in the past are sometimes known as classical ciphers. They include:\n\nSubstitution cipher: the units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext (e.g., Caesar cipher and one-time pad)\nPolyalphabetic substitution cipher: a substitution cipher using multiple substitution alphabets (e.g., Vigen\u00e8re cipher and Enigma machine)\nPolygraphic substitution cipher: the unit of substitution is a sequence of two or more letters rather than just one (e.g., Playfair cipher)\nTransposition cipher: the ciphertext is a permutation of the plaintext (e.g., rail fence cipher)Historical ciphers are not generally used as a standalone encryption technique because they are quite easy to crack. Many of the classical ciphers, with the exception of the one-time pad, can be cracked using brute force.\n\n\n*** Modern ciphers ***\nModern ciphers are more secure than classical ciphers and are designed  to withstand a wide range of attacks. An attacker should not be able to find the key used in a modern cipher, even if he knows any amount of plaintext and corresponding ciphertext. Modern encryption methods can be divided into the following categories:\n\nPrivate-key cryptography (symmetric key algorithm): the same key is used for encryption and decryption\nPublic-key cryptography (asymmetric key algorithm): two different keys are used for encryption and decryptionIn a symmetric key algorithm (e.g., DES and AES), the sender and receiver must have a shared key set up in advance and kept secret from all other parties; the sender uses this key for encryption, and the receiver uses the same key for decryption.

      "context": "Ciphertext\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, ciphertext or cyphertext is the result of encryption performed on plaintext using an algorithm, called a cipher. Ciphertext is also known as encrypted or encoded information because it contains a form of the original plaintext that is unreadable by a human or computer without the proper cipher to decrypt it. This process prevents the loss of sensitive information via hacking. Decryption, the inverse of encryption, is the process of turning ciphertext into readable plaintext. Ciphertext is not to be confused with codetext because the latter is a result of a code, not a cipher.\n\n== Conceptual underpinnings ==\nLet \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m\\!}\n    be the plaintext message that Alice wants to secretly transmit to Bob and let \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E_{k}\\!}\n   be the encryption cipher, where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle _{k}\\!}\n   is a cryptographic key.

Cryptography uses a variety of different types of encryption. Earlier algorithms were performed by hand and are substantially different from modern algorithms, which are generally executed by a machine.\n\n\n*** Historical ciphers ***\nHistorical pen and paper ciphers used in the past are sometimes known as classical ciphers. They include:\n\nSubstitution cipher: the units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext (e.g., Caesar cipher and one-time pad)\nPolyalphabetic substitution cipher: a substitution cipher using multiple substitution alphabets (e.g., Vigen\u00e8re cipher and Enigma machine)\nPolygraphic substitution cipher: the unit of substitution is a sequence of two or more letters rather than just one (e.g., Playfair cipher)\nTransposition cipher: the ciphertext is a permutation of the plaintext (e.g., rail fence cipher)Historical ciphers are not generally used as a standalone encryption technique because they are quite easy to crack. Many of the classical ciphers, with the exception of the one-time pad, can be cracked using brute force.\n\n\n*** Modern ciphers ***\nModern ciphers are more secure than classical ciphers and are designed  to withstand a wide range of attacks. An attacker should not be able to find the key used in a modern cipher, even if he knows any amount of plaintext and corresponding ciphertext. Modern encryption methods can be divided into the following categories:\n\nPrivate-key cryptography (symmetric key algorithm): the same key is used for encryption and decryption\nPublic-key cryptography (asymmetric key algorithm): two different keys are used for encryption and decryptionIn a symmetric key algorithm (e.g., DES and AES), the sender and receiver must have a shared key set up in advance and kept secret from all other parties; the sender uses this key for encryption, and the receiver uses the same key for decryption. In an asymmetric key algorithm (e.g., RSA), there are two separate keys: a public key is published and enables any sender to perform encryption, while a private key is kept secret by the receiver and enables only him to perform correct decryption.\nSymmetric key ciphers can be divided into block ciphers and stream ciphers.

    "instruction": "Answer questions about:\nIEEE P1619\n\n==Introduction==\nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standardization project for encryption of stored data, but more generically refers to the Security in Storage Working Group (SISWG), which includes a family of standards for protection of stored data and for the corresponding cryptographic key management.\n\n== Standards ==\nSISWG oversees work on the following standards:\nThe base IEEE 1619 Standard Architecture for Encrypted Shared Storage Media uses the XTS-Advanced Encryption Standard (XEX-based  Tweaked CodeBook mode (TCB) with ciphertext stealing (CTS); the proper name should be XTC (XEX TCB CTS), but that acronym is already used to denote the drug ecstasy.\nThe P1619.1  Authenticated Encryption with Length Expansion for Storage Devices uses the following algorithms:\n\nCounter mode with CBC-MAC (CCM)\nGalois/Counter Mode (GCM)\nCipher Block Chaining (CBC) with HMAC-Secure Hash Algorithm\nXTS-HMAC-Secure Hash AlgorithmThe P1619.2 Standard for Wide-Block Encryption for Shared Storage Media has proposed algorithms including:\n\nXCB [1]\nEME2The P1619.3 Standard for Key Management Infrastructure for Cryptographic Protection of Stored Data defines a system for managing encryption data at rest security objects which includes architecture, namespaces, operations, messaging and transport.\nP1619 also standardized the key backup in the XML format.\n\n\n*** Narrow-block vs. wide-block encryption ***\nAn encryption algorithm used for data storage has to support independent encryption and decryption of portions of data. So-called narrow-block algorithms operate on relatively small portions of data, while the wide-block algorithms encrypt or decrypt a whole sector. Narrow-block algorithms have the advantage of more efficient hardware implementation. On the other hand, smaller block size provides finer granularity for data modification attacks. There is no standardized \"acceptable granularity\"; however, for example, the possibility of data modification with the granularity of one bit (bit-flipping attack) is generally considered unacceptable.\nFor these reasons, the working group selected the narrow-block (128 bits) encryption with no authentication in the standard P1619, assuming that the added efficiency warrants the additional risk. But recognizing that wide-block encryption might be useful in some cases, another project P1619.2 has been started to study the usage of wide-block encryption.\nThe project is maintained by the IEEE Security in Storage Working Group (SISWG). Both the disk storage standard P1619 (sometimes called P1619.0) and the tape storage standard P1619.1 were standardized in December 2007.A discussion was ongoing on standardization of the wide-block encryption for disk drives, like CMC and EME as P1619.2, and on key management as P1619.3.\n\n\n*** LRW issue ***\nFrom  2004 to 2006, drafts of the P1619 standards used the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in LRW mode. In the 30 Aug 2006 meeting of the SISWG, a straw poll showed that most members would not approve P1619 as it was. Consequently, LRW-AES has been replaced by the XEX-AES tweakable block cipher in P1619.0 Draft 7 (and renamed to XTS-AES in Draft 11). Some members of the group found it non-trivial to abandon LRW, because it had been available for public peer-review for many years (unlike most of the newly suggested variants). The issues of LRW were:\n\nAn attacker can derive the LRW tweak key K2 from the ciphertext if the plaintext contains K2||0n or 0n||K2. Here || is the concatenation operator and 0n is a zero block. This may be an issue for software that encrypts the partition of an operating system under which this encryption software is running (at the same time). The operating system could write the LRW tweak key to an encrypted swap/hibernation file.\nIf the tweak key K2 is known, LRW does not offer indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA) anymore, and the same input block permutation attacks of ECB mode are possible. Leak of the tweak key does not affect the confidentiality of the plaintext.\nWhat organization is responsible for the IEEE P1619 standards and what is its purpose?q: What encryption algorithm and mode does the base IEEE 1619 Standard Architecture for Encrypted Shared Storage Media use and why was this selection made?q: What are the encryption algorithms considered for the P1619.2 Standard for Wide-Block Encryption for Shared Storage Media and why is this being studied?q: What is the purpose of the P1619.3 Standard for Key Management Infrastructure for Cryptographic Protection of Stored Data, and what does it define?q: What are the advantages and disadvantages of narrow-block and wide-block encryption algorithms for data storage?q: Why did the IEEE P1619 working group select narrow-block encryption over wide-block encryption for the standard, despite the added risk?q: What was the LRW mode used in early drafts of the P1619 standards, and what issues led to its replacement?q: How can the LRW tweak key K2 be derived from the ciphertext, and what are the implications of this vulnerability?q: What happens to the confidentiality of the plaintext if the tweak key K2 is known in LRW mode?q: Why did some members of the group find it non-trivial to abandon LRW in the P1619.0 Draft 7?q: What is the purpose of the SISWG, and what role do they play in the development and maintenance of the IEEE P1619 standards?q: What is the timeline for the standardization of the IEEE P1619 disk storage standard and tape storage standard?q: What encryption modes are used in the P1619.1 Authenticated Encryption with Length Expansion for Storage Devices?q: What is the main difference between narrow-block and wide-block encryption algorithms for data storage?q: How can smaller block sizes in narrow-block encryption algorithms lead to increased risk for data storage?",

Bitdefender develops and delivers cybersecurity products and services, including endpoint protection, cloud and managed security, antivirus software and IoT security. Bitdefender products are distributed through partners in over 150 countries and the US market is estimated to generate more than 40% of its revenues.  As of 2020, the company employed more than 1,600 people worldwide.As of August 2021, Bitdefender was ranked 5th globally among Microsoft Windows anti-malware application vendors by market scores.\n\n== Bitdefender products ==\nBitdefender develops cybersecurity solutions for businesses and consumers. It offers a range of products and services including endpoint protection, cloud security, and managed detection & response. Its flagship product is Bitdefender Antivirus which protects against viruses, spyware, malware, phishing attacks, ransomware, and other threats.\n\n== Fighting cyber-crime ==\nBitdefender advises Europol's European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) in supporting investigations into criminal activity in cyberspace, sharing relevant data and knowledge about disruption, prevention, investigation and prosecution. The company is involved in ongoing cooperation with international law enforcement actors such as local, regional and international police offices to support the fight against crime.Bitdefender is also part of the Cybersecurity Tech Accord for a safer online world, a collaboration among global technology companies committed to protecting their customers and users and helping them defend against malicious threats.\n\n== Independent tests ==\nBitdefender has won a number of awards from AV-Comparatives, an anti-virus assessment firm.\n\n== Controversies and incidents ==\n\n\n*** Trojan.FakeAlert.5 ***\nOn March 20, 2010, computers running Bitdefender under 64-bit versions of Windows were affected by a malfunctioning update that classified every executable program as well as dll files as infected. These files were all marked as 'Trojan.FakeAlert.5' and were moved into quarantine. This action led to software and systems malfunctions that affected users around the world.  Bitdefender representatives announced the removal of the faulty update and a workaround for the users affected, except for those using the 2008 version.\n\n\n*** DarkSide ransomware ***\nIn 2021, Bitdefender was accused of self-promotion when releasing and publicly announcing a decryptor to the detriment of actual victims with regards to DarkSide, a hacking group.  In 2020, DarkSide switched their main encryption ransomware product over to an \"affiliate\" model wherein other attackers could download and use their software in exchange for a portion of the profits.  However, they introduced a bug in the process where affiliate hackers would all use the same private RSA key - meaning that a decryption package for a single target who paid the ransom would work on any target that had the ransomware installed.  Security researchers noticed and were quietly already helping victims of the software, but with no public notice, making it so that the attackers would only see an inexplicable decrease in ransom payments that could be written off as chance. At about the same time, Bitdefender researchers developed a decryptor and issued a blog post in January 2021 describing the flaw and offering the decryptor as a free download, in order to make as many organizations as possible aware of its existence to reduce the impact of Darkside ransomware attacks. This was criticized in an article in the MIT Technology Review: claiming, first, Bitdefender's program wasn't even safe - it was flawed and would \"damage\" files decrypted with it due to bugs within it. Second, the blog post tipped off DarkSide as to the nature of the flaw; DarkSide promptly patched the bug and sarcastically thanked Bitdefender for pointing it out, then went on with their campaign of extortion.  A notable incident that took place after Bitdefender's public disclosure was the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack in May 2021.  While the security researchers who had been using the flaw before acknowledge that it's probable DarkSide would eventually have noticed and fixed the issue, they still criticized Bitdefender for using the bug merely for a brief burst of publicity, rather than in the way that would most help victims of the scheme.  Bitdefender has defended their actions on their blog. The article and blog post triggered a discussion among cybersecurity professionals about the pros and cons of publicly disclosing decryptors.\n\n\n*** REvil Ransomware ***\nIn September 2021, Bitdefender published a universal decryptor utility that will help past victims of the REvil ransomware  recover their encrypted files.\n\nQuestions: How does Bitdefender's flagship product protect against various cyber threats?Q: In which year was Bitdefender founded and by whom?Q: Which market generates the majority of Bitdefender's revenues?Q: How many employees does Bitdefender have worldwide as of 2020?Q: What is Bitdefender's position in the global Microsoft Windows anti-malware application vendors ranking as of August 2021?Q: Which organization does Bitdefender advise in supporting investigations into criminal activity in cyberspace?Q: What is the name of the anti-virus assessment firm that has awarded Bitdefender multiple times?Q: What was the name of the faulty update that affected computers running Bitdefender under 64-bit versions of Windows in 2010?Q: What action did Bitdefender take after releasing a decryptor for DarkSide ransomware in 2021?Q: What was the reaction of DarkSide to Bitdefender's blog post about the decryptor?Q: What was the main reason for the controversy surrounding Bitdefender's release of the DarkSide decryptor?Q: Which ransomware did Bitdefender publish a universal decryptor utility for in September 2021?Q: How did Bitdefender's release of the DarkSide decryptor affect the cybersecurity community's response to ransomware attacks?Q: What is the Cybersecurity Tech Accord and who is a part of it?Q: What is the main focus of Bitdefender's products and services?",

Bitdefender representatives announced the removal of the faulty update and a workaround for the users affected, except for those using the 2008 version.\n\n\n*** DarkSide ransomware ***\nIn 2021, Bitdefender was accused of self-promotion when releasing and publicly announcing a decryptor to the detriment of actual victims with regards to DarkSide, a hacking group.  In 2020, DarkSide switched their main encryption ransomware product over to an \"affiliate\" model wherein other attackers could download and use their software in exchange for a portion of the profits.  However, they introduced a bug in the process where affiliate hackers would all use the same private RSA key - meaning that a decryption package for a single target who paid the ransom would work on any target that had the ransomware installed.  Security researchers noticed and were quietly already helping victims of the software, but with no public notice, making it so that the attackers would only see an inexplicable decrease in ransom payments that could be written off as chance. At about the same time, Bitdefender researchers developed a decryptor and issued a blog post in January 2021 describing the flaw and offering the decryptor as a free download, in order to make as many organizations as possible aware of its existence to reduce the impact of Darkside ransomware attacks. This was criticized in an article in the MIT Technology Review: claiming, first, Bitdefender's program wasn't even safe - it was flawed and would \"damage\" files decrypted with it due to bugs within it. Second, the blog post tipped off DarkSide as to the nature of the flaw; DarkSide promptly patched the bug and sarcastically thanked Bitdefender for pointing it out, then went on with their campaign of extortion.  A notable incident that took place after Bitdefender's public disclosure was the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack in May 2021.  While the security researchers who had been using the flaw before acknowledge that it's probable DarkSide would eventually have noticed and fixed the issue, they still criticized Bitdefender for using the bug merely for a brief burst of publicity, rather than in the way that would most help victims of the scheme.  Bitdefender has defended their actions on their blog. The article and blog post triggered a discussion among cybersecurity professionals about the pros and cons of publicly disclosing decryptors.\n\n\n*** REvil Ransomware ***\nIn September 2021, Bitdefender published a universal decryptor utility that will help past victims of the REvil ransomware  recover their encrypted files.",

    "instruction": "Answer questions about:\nNSA product types\n\n==Introduction==\nThe U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) used to rank cryptographic products or algorithms by a certification called product types. Product types were defined in the National Information Assurance Glossary (CNSSI No. 4009, 2010) which used to define Type 1, 2, 3, and 4 products.   The definitions of numeric type products have been removed from the government lexicon  and are no longer used in government procurement efforts.\n\n== Type 1 product ==\nA Type 1 product was a device or system certified by NSA for use in cryptographically securing classified U.S. Government information. A Type 1 product was defined as:\n\nCryptographic equipment, assembly or component classified or certified by NSA for encrypting and decrypting classified and sensitive national security information when appropriately keyed. Developed using established NSA business processes and containing NSA approved algorithms. Used to protect systems requiring the most stringent protection mechanisms.\nThey were available to U.S. Government users, their contractors, and federally sponsored non-U.S. Government activities subject to export restrictions in accordance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations.\nType 1 certification was a rigorous process that included testing and formal analysis of (among other things) cryptographic security, functional security, tamper resistance, emissions security (EMSEC/TEMPEST), and security of the product manufacturing and distribution process.\n\n== Type 2 product ==\nA Type 2 product was unclassified cryptographic equipment, assemblies, or components, endorsed by the NSA, for use in telecommunications and automated information systems for the protection of national security information, as defined as:\n\nCryptographic equipment, assembly, or component certified by NSA for encrypting or decrypting sensitive national security information when appropriately keyed.

    "instruction": "Read this and answer the below questions\n\nCrypTool\n\n==Introduction==\nCrypTool is an open-source project\nthat is a free e-learning software for illustrating cryptographic and cryptanalytic concepts.\nAccording to \"Hakin9\", CrypTool is worldwide the most widespread e-learning software in the field of cryptology.CrypTool implements more than 400 algorithms. Users can adjust these with own parameters. To introduce users to the field of cryptography, the organization created multiple graphical interface software containing an online documentation, analytic tools and algorithms. They contain most classical ciphers, as well as modern symmetric and asymmetric cryptography including RSA, ECC, digital signatures, hybrid encryption, homomorphic encryption, and Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange. Methods from the area of quantum cryptography (like BB84 key exchange protocol) and the area of post-quantum cryptography (like McEliece, WOTS, Merkle-Signature-Scheme, XMSS, XMSS_MT, and SPHINCS) are implemented. In addition to the algorithms, solvers (analyzers) are included, especially for classical ciphers. Other methods (for instance Huffman code, AES, Keccak, MSS) are visualized.\nIn addition it contains: didactical games (like Number Shark, Divider Game, or Zudo-Ku) and interactive tutorials about primes, elementary number theory, and lattice-based cryptography.\n\n\n\n== Development, history and roadmap ==\nThe development of CrypTool started in 1998. Originally developed by German companies and universities, it is an open-source project since 2001. More than sixty people worldwide contribute regularly to the project. Contributions as software plugins came from universities or schools in the following towns: Belgrad, Berlin, Bochum, Brisbane, Darmstadt, Dubai, Duisburg-Essen, Eindhoven, Hagenberg, Jena, Kassel, Klagenfurt, Koblenz, London, Madrid, Mannheim, San Jose, Siegen, Utrecht, Warsaw.Currently 4 versions of CrypTool are maintained and developed: The CrypTool 1 (CT1) software is available in 6 languages (English, German, Polish, Spanish, Serbian, and French). CrypTool 2 (CT2) is available in 3 languages (English, German, Russian). All others, JCrypTool (JCT) and CrypTool-Online (CTO), are available only in English and German.The goal of the CrypTool project is to make users aware of how cryptography can help against network security threats and to explain the underlying concepts of cryptology.CrypTool 1 (CT1) is written in C++ and designed for the Microsoft Windows operating system. A port of CT1 to Linux with Qt4 was started, but there is no progress anymore.In 2007, development began on two additional projects, both based on a pure-plugin architecture, to serve as successors to the original CrypTool program. Both successors regularly publish new stable versions:\n\nCrypTool 2 (built with C#/.NET/WPF) (abbreviated CT2)uses the concept of visual programming to clarify cryptographic processes. Currently, CT2 contains more than 150 crypto functions.\n\nJCrypTool 1.0 (built with Java/Eclipse/RCP/SWT) (abbreviated JCT)runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and offers both a document-centric and a function-centric perspective. Currently, JCT contains more than 100 crypto functions. One of its focal points are modern digital signatures (like Merkle trees and SPHINCS).\n\n== Use ==\nCrypTool is used in schools, universities, companies and agencies for education and awareness training.Worldwide, the CrypTool packages are downloaded more than 10,000 times per month from the CrypTool website. Just over 50% of the downloads are for the English version.\n\n== CrypTool-Online (abbreviated CTO) ==\nThe CrypTool project also includes the website CrypTool-Online, launched in 2009. This website allows users to try cryptographic methods directly within a browser on a PC or on a smartphone (using JavaScript), without the need to download and install software. \nThis site aims to present the topic in an easy and attractive way for new users and young people.  Advanced tasks still require the offline versions of CrypTool.\n\n== MysteryTwister (MTC3) ==\nIn 2010, the international cipher contest MTC3 started as part of the CrypTool project.\nThe contest currently offers more than 200 challenges derived from old and modern ciphers and designed by more than 30 different authors from different countries.  All challenges are presented in PDF templates in English and German. The challenges are clustered in four levels of difficulty, which range from simple riddles solvable with paper-and-pencil to mathematical challenges from modern cryptanalysis for researchers and experts. Additionally, a moderated forum, user statistics, and a hall-of-fame are available.  Currently, more than 10,000 registered users are engaged in solving these challenges.\n\n== Merger with CrypTools ==\nIn early 2020, the CrypTool project decided to merge with a similar project of the same name, CrypTools, founded in 2017 in Australia by Luka Lafaye de Micheaux, Arthur Guiot, and Lucas Gruwez. CrypTool, much older and known, thus completely \"absorbs\" the project under its name.\n\nThe first impact of this merger is the rebranding of the project. A new logo, a new website, and the new CTO version are announced. Currently, it's still in development. Another change was the targeted audience. Previously, CrypTool focused on (university) students, and CrypTools on developers and young people. It was therefore necessary to broaden the audience.\nOn May 15, 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, CrypTool announces the creation of tools to test Decentralized contact tracing protocols. A new page is added to CTO with technical description of the algorithms involved in DP-3T and Exposure Notification. In addition to this, CrypTool also announced the implementation of a page dedicated to raising awareness of the cryptographic means related to privacy in these protocols, called the Corona Tracing Animation. The newer page stands out for its new design and its accessibility to ordinary users.\n\nWhat is CrypTool and what is its purpose?question: How many algorithms does CrypTool implement?question: What programming languages were used to develop the different versions of CrypTool?question: How many crypto functions does CT2 and JCT contain?question: In which operating systems can the different versions of CrypTool run?question: What is CrypTool-Online and what are its features?question: What is the MTC3 and what does it offer?question: How many registered users are engaged in solving the MTC3 challenges?question: What is the merger between CrypTool and CrypTools and what was the first impact of this merger?question: What is the new page added to CTO in May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic?question: What are the two decentralized contact tracing protocols that CrypTool announced the creation of tools to test in May 2020?question: What is the goal of the new page added to CTO in May 2020?question: What are the features of the new page added to CTO in May 2020?question: Who founded CrypTools in 2017 in Australia?question: When was the development of CrypTool started?",

    "instruction": "Here are some questions about this text: Proof of identity (blockchain consensus)\n\n==Introduction==\nProof of identity (PoID) is a consensus protocol for permission-less blockchains, in which each uniquely identified individual receives one equal unit of voting power and associated rewards (minting token). The protocol is based on biometric identification, humanity identification parties and additional verification parties.\nThe proof of identity supersedes the approach of proof of work and proof of stake which distribute voting power and rewards to participants according to their investment in some activity or resource and introduces the opportunity to create a universal basic income (UBI) for individuals.\nThe proof of identity solves the problem with the proof of personhood in which individuals are requested to attend recurrent pseudonymous parties and creates a network that is permanently secured and censorship resilient.\n\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n*** Currently used proofs of investment ***\nIn a permission-less network, some kind of proof is required to prevent Sybil attacks, i.e., the event in which an attacker gains control over the transactions of the network by creating multiple users generated with a malicious script.The most common methods to prevent Sybil attacks are proofs of investment (proof of work, proof of stake) that require participants of the network to invest in some activity or resource as evidence of genuine involvement in the chain.\nThe growing criticism over this approach is that voting power and rewards are not distributed equally among individuals but instead, big holders/corporations benefit the most from the network. \nProof of investment blockchains are thus prone to the formation of oligarchies and marginally appeal to small investors/holders who receive minimal rewards. In the case of proof of work, there are additional sustainability concerns over the amount of electrical energy wasted as proof.The idea of having a \"unique identity system\" as a consensus protocol for cryptocurrencies, which would give each human user one and only one anti-Sybil participation token, was initially proposed in 2014 by Vitalik Buterin.\n\n\n*** The proof of personhood ***\nIn contrast with proofs of investment, proof of personhood aims to allocate to each individual one equal unit of voting power and its associated reward.\nIn the PoP protocol, each individual is required to demonstrate his humanity and uniqueness regardless of his identity by attending a pseudonymous party. To preserve privacy, attendances to parties are anonymous and individuals can wear masks or hide their appearance.Whilst the PoP protocol achieves the goal of democratizing blockchain networks, some criticisms have been raised over the recurrent nature of PoP parties and more specifically:\n\nTo avoid multiple attendances to pseudonymous parties, each individual has to attend a new party every time the network expands; this suggests the process will be endless or will leave out those individuals unable to attend the last round of parties.\nBecause there is no control over the creation of PoP parties and anyone can organize them, more study should be conducted to rule out the possibility for an attacker to create a high number of parties with the intent of populating one or more parties entirely with forgeries and hence gaining a considerable number of minting tokens.\nBecause of the recurrent nature of pseudonymous parties, the PoP network does not guarantee the creation of a value stable in time. Any epoch can be better or worse than the previous one, so the network is possibly exposed to censorship and instability.\n\n\n*** Other protocols ***\nSome other protocols based on the use of national IDs, online face recognition CAPTCHA solving, and social network identification, have been also proposed; however, in general, they are deemed not secure enough against the threats posed by AI engines\u2019 capacity to create spoofed identities when a banking security level is to be attained.\n\n== Biometric data-based proofs ==\n\n\n*** The proof of UniqueID ***\nTo avoid the problems associated with the recurrent nature of PoP parties and strengthen identification methods against spoofed identities, the use of biometric identification and data storage of individuals/minters were introduced. The first comprehensive study was proposed in June 2018.According to the white paper, individuals are biometrically identified in person by local verifiers. Then their data are encrypted using a trusted setup and recorded in the blockchain.The system relies on the Ethereum blockchain for the execution of a set of smart contracts.The protocol also proposes the use of CAPTCHA parties and the involvement of trusted, famous people to strengthen the system against Sybil attacks.The proof of UniqueID achieves the goal of assigning one minting token to each identified individual while not requiring attendance to multiple recurrent PoP parties; however, there are some challenges and possible criticisms to consider under this proposal:\n\nThe reliance on the Ethereum blockchain ultimately ties down the security of the system to the security of the Ethereum blockchain and may present serious technical challenges.\nA trusted setup for biometric data encryption may not guarantee the privacy of users against a governmental request of data disclosure. This seems to significantly penalize the censorship resistance of the system.\nThere is no certainty against the future possibility that AI engines will be able to solve CAPTCHAs.\nAdditional investigation and study may be required to rule out the possibility of carrying out a Sybil attack under this protocol. In fact, it is possible to figure out a scenario in which initial parties are kicked off by a colluding group, or a group of legit verifiers collude with each other and start to generate identity forgeries, particularly in remote locations (e.g., Papua New Guinea). Once spoofed identities successfully infiltrate the system there are no procedures in place to detect them.\n\n\n*** The proof of identity ***\nThe proof of identity protocol proposes to overcome the possibility of biometric spoofed identities and collusions between participants using an AI engine stored in the blockchain which randomly organizes humanity identification parties and constantly computes the possibility of cheats for each individual/area/country which triggers additional verification parties either in a pyramid scheme or in a random way.The identification procedure requires each party attendee to perform a face recognition of all others to establish the principle \u201ceveryone or no one is cheating,\u201d which ultimately requires attackers to collude globally to avoid being discovered.\nThe protocol also introduces a new proposal to preserve the privacy of individuals: biometric data are stored partially encrypted.

      "context": "Proof of identity (blockchain consensus)\n\n==Introduction==\nProof of identity (PoID) is a consensus protocol for permission-less blockchains, in which each uniquely identified individual receives one equal unit of voting power and associated rewards (minting token). The protocol is based on biometric identification, humanity identification parties and additional verification parties.\nThe proof of identity supersedes the approach of proof of work and proof of stake which distribute voting power and rewards to participants according to their investment in some activity or resource and introduces the opportunity to create a universal basic income (UBI) for individuals.\nThe proof of identity solves the problem with the proof of personhood in which individuals are requested to attend recurrent pseudonymous parties and creates a network that is permanently secured and censorship resilient.\n\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n*** Currently used proofs of investment ***\nIn a permission-less network, some kind of proof is required to prevent Sybil attacks, i.e., the event in which an attacker gains control over the transactions of the network by creating multiple users generated with a malicious script.The most common methods to prevent Sybil attacks are proofs of investment (proof of work, proof of stake) that require participants of the network to invest in some activity or resource as evidence of genuine involvement in the chain.\nThe growing criticism over this approach is that voting power and rewards are not distributed equally among individuals but instead, big holders/corporations benefit the most from the network. \nProof of investment blockchains are thus prone to the formation of oligarchies and marginally appeal to small investors/holders who receive minimal rewards. In the case of proof of work, there are additional sustainability concerns over the amount of electrical energy wasted as proof.The idea of having a \"unique identity system\" as a consensus protocol for cryptocurrencies, which would give each human user one and only one anti-Sybil participation token, was initially proposed in 2014 by Vitalik Buterin.\n\n\n*** The proof of personhood ***\nIn contrast with proofs of investment, proof of personhood aims to allocate to each individual one equal unit of voting power and its associated reward.\nIn the PoP protocol, each individual is required to demonstrate his humanity and uniqueness regardless of his identity by attending a pseudonymous party. To preserve privacy, attendances to parties are anonymous and individuals can wear masks or hide their appearance.Whilst the PoP protocol achieves the goal of democratizing blockchain networks, some criticisms have been raised over the recurrent nature of PoP parties and more specifically:\n\nTo avoid multiple attendances to pseudonymous parties, each individual has to attend a new party every time the network expands; this suggests the process will be endless or will leave out those individuals unable to attend the last round of parties.\nBecause there is no control over the creation of PoP parties and anyone can organize them, more study should be conducted to rule out the possibility for an attacker to create a high number of parties with the intent of populating one or more parties entirely with forgeries and hence gaining a considerable number of minting tokens.\nBecause of the recurrent nature of pseudonymous parties, the PoP network does not guarantee the creation of a value stable in time. Any epoch can be better or worse than the previous one, so the network is possibly exposed to censorship and instability.\n\n\n*** Other protocols ***\nSome other protocols based on the use of national IDs, online face recognition CAPTCHA solving, and social network identification, have been also proposed; however, in general, they are deemed not secure enough against the threats posed by AI engines\u2019 capacity to create spoofed identities when a banking security level is to be attained.\n\n== Biometric data-based proofs ==\n\n\n*** The proof of UniqueID ***\nTo avoid the problems associated with the recurrent nature of PoP parties and strengthen identification methods against spoofed identities, the use of biometric identification and data storage of individuals/minters were introduced. The first comprehensive study was proposed in June 2018.According to the white paper, individuals are biometrically identified in person by local verifiers. Then their data are encrypted using a trusted setup and recorded in the blockchain.The system relies on the Ethereum blockchain for the execution of a set of smart contracts.The protocol also proposes the use of CAPTCHA parties and the involvement of trusted, famous people to strengthen the system against Sybil attacks.The proof of UniqueID achieves the goal of assigning one minting token to each identified individual while not requiring attendance to multiple recurrent PoP parties; however, there are some challenges and possible criticisms to consider under this proposal:\n\nThe reliance on the Ethereum blockchain ultimately ties down the security of the system to the security of the Ethereum blockchain and may present serious technical challenges.\nA trusted setup for biometric data encryption may not guarantee the privacy of users against a governmental request of data disclosure. This seems to significantly penalize the censorship resistance of the system.\nThere is no certainty against the future possibility that AI engines will be able to solve CAPTCHAs.\nAdditional investigation and study may be required to rule out the possibility of carrying out a Sybil attack under this protocol. In fact, it is possible to figure out a scenario in which initial parties are kicked off by a colluding group, or a group of legit verifiers collude with each other and start to generate identity forgeries, particularly in remote locations (e.g., Papua New Guinea). Once spoofed identities successfully infiltrate the system there are no procedures in place to detect them.\n\n\n*** The proof of identity ***\nThe proof of identity protocol proposes to overcome the possibility of biometric spoofed identities and collusions between participants using an AI engine stored in the blockchain which randomly organizes humanity identification parties and constantly computes the possibility of cheats for each individual/area/country which triggers additional verification parties either in a pyramid scheme or in a random way.The identification procedure requires each party attendee to perform a face recognition of all others to establish the principle \u201ceveryone or no one is cheating,\u201d which ultimately requires attackers to collude globally to avoid being discovered.\nThe protocol also introduces a new proposal to preserve the privacy of individuals: biometric data are stored partially encrypted. The amount of public data stored in the blockchain is enough to avoid a good number of biometric collisions, but it is not enough to securely identify a person. \nOnce biometric collisions occur, minters are requested by the system to temporarily disclose their encryption key. The system can be implemented according to CanDID methodology.The proof of identity addresses the problems with the proof of personhood and UniqueID, however, there are some challenges and possible criticisms to consider:\n\nThe amount of data to store in the blockchain is considerable and may require some daily downtime for cohort leader servers to reboot.\nThe system includes the creation of a PoID global organization that facilitates the kick-off of identification venues and rules out rare biometric disputes. This may be seen as a center of authority.\n\n\n*** Summary of the main protocols based on individuals ***\nThe following table summarizes the characteristics of the three main individuals-based protocols:\n\n== The proof of identity protocol ==\n \nThe proof of identity protocol combines state of the art of 3D mapping face recognition technologies, the attendance to humanity identification parties, and the decentralized (stored in the blockchain) supervision of an AI engine that randomly forms parties and carries on organizing additional verification parties to rule out any possible cheating.The protocol is summarized in the following scheme:\nHumanity identification/verification parties are designed in a way to enforce the principle: \u201ceveryone or no one is cheating,\u201d ruling out the possibility of having a party formed by honest individuals and spoofed identities at the same time: \n\nIndividuals gather in the identification venue (fig. 1) randomly assigned by the AI engine.\nIndividuals are requested to firstly confirm the number of attendees and then to perform the face recognition of all others using their minting app.\nOne or more verifiers coming from remote locations attend the party in incognitoParties kick off in a region once there are enough online data submissions and sufficient interoperability of verifiers.

    "instruction": "Ciphertext indistinguishability\n\n==Introduction==\nCiphertext indistinguishability is a property of many encryption schemes. Intuitively, if a cryptosystem possesses the property of indistinguishability, then an adversary will be unable to distinguish pairs of ciphertexts based on the message they encrypt. The property of indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack is considered a basic requirement for most provably secure public key cryptosystems, though some schemes also provide indistinguishability under chosen ciphertext attack and adaptive chosen ciphertext attack. Indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack is equivalent to the property of semantic security, and many cryptographic proofs use these definitions interchangeably.\nA cryptosystem is considered secure in terms of indistinguishability if no adversary, given an encryption of a message randomly chosen from a two-element message space determined by the adversary, can identify the message choice with probability significantly better than that of random guessing (1\u20442). If any adversary can succeed in distinguishing the chosen ciphertext with a probability significantly greater than 1\u20442, then this adversary is considered to have an \"advantage\" in distinguishing the ciphertext, and the scheme is not considered secure in terms of indistinguishability. This definition encompasses the notion that in a secure scheme, the adversary should learn no information from seeing a ciphertext. Therefore, the adversary should be able to do no better than if it guessed randomly.\n\n\n\n== Formal definitions ==\nSecurity in terms of indistinguishability has many definitions, depending on assumptions made about the capabilities of the attacker. It is normally presented as a game, where the cryptosystem is considered secure if no adversary can win the game with significantly greater probability than an adversary who must guess randomly. The most common definitions used in cryptography are indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack (abbreviated IND-CPA), indistinguishability under (non-adaptive) chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA1), and indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2). Security under either of the latter definition implies security under the previous ones: a scheme which is IND-CCA1 secure is also IND-CPA secure, and a scheme which is IND-CCA2 secure is both IND-CCA1 and IND-CPA secure. Thus, IND-CCA2 is the strongest of the three definitions of security.\n\n\n*** Indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CPA) ***\nFor a probabilistic asymmetric key encryption algorithm, indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA) is defined by the following game between an adversary and a challenger. For schemes based on computational security, the adversary is modeled by a probabilistic polynomial time Turing machine, meaning that it must complete the game and output a guess within a polynomial number of time steps. In this definition E(PK, M) represents the encryption of a message M under the key PK:\n\nThe challenger generates a key pair PK, SK based on some security parameter k (e.g., a key size in bits), and publishes PK to the adversary. The challenger retains SK.\nThe adversary may perform a polynomially bounded number of encryptions or other operations.\nEventually, the adversary submits two distinct chosen plaintexts \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            M\n            \n              0\n            \n          \n          ,\n          \n            M\n            \n              1\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle M_{0},M_{1}}\n   to the challenger.\nThe challenger selects a bit b \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u2208\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle \\in }\n   {0, 1} uniformly at random, and sends the challenge ciphertext C\n\n== Equivalences and implications ==\nIndistinguishability is an important property for maintaining the confidentiality of encrypted communications. However, the property of indistinguishability has in some cases been found to imply other, apparently unrelated security properties. Sometimes these implications go in both directions, making two definitions equivalent; for example, it is known that the property of indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2) is equivalent to the property of non-malleability under the same attack scenario (NM-CCA2). This equivalence is not immediately obvious, as non-malleability is a property dealing with message integrity, rather than confidentiality. In other cases, it has been demonstrated that indistinguishability can be combined with certain other definitions, in order to imply still other useful definitions, and vice versa. The following list summarizes a few known implications, though it is by no means complete.\nThe notation \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n          \u21d2\n          \n

It is defined as a game between an adversary and a challenger, where the adversary can submit chosen plaintexts for encryption, and the challenger responds with the corresponding ciphertexts. The adversary's goal is to determine if two challenge ciphertexts correspond to the plaintexts of their choice. The encryption scheme is considered IND-CPA secure if no adversary can distinguish the challenge ciphertexts with a probability significantly greater than random guessing.A: IND-CPA is equivalent to semantic security under chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA).

      "context": "Ciphertext indistinguishability\n\n==Introduction==\nCiphertext indistinguishability is a property of many encryption schemes. Intuitively, if a cryptosystem possesses the property of indistinguishability, then an adversary will be unable to distinguish pairs of ciphertexts based on the message they encrypt. The property of indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack is considered a basic requirement for most provably secure public key cryptosystems, though some schemes also provide indistinguishability under chosen ciphertext attack and adaptive chosen ciphertext attack. Indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack is equivalent to the property of semantic security, and many cryptographic proofs use these definitions interchangeably.\nA cryptosystem is considered secure in terms of indistinguishability if no adversary, given an encryption of a message randomly chosen from a two-element message space determined by the adversary, can identify the message choice with probability significantly better than that of random guessing (1\u20442). If any adversary can succeed in distinguishing the chosen ciphertext with a probability significantly greater than 1\u20442, then this adversary is considered to have an \"advantage\" in distinguishing the ciphertext, and the scheme is not considered secure in terms of indistinguishability. This definition encompasses the notion that in a secure scheme, the adversary should learn no information from seeing a ciphertext. Therefore, the adversary should be able to do no better than if it guessed randomly.\n\n\n\n== Formal definitions ==\nSecurity in terms of indistinguishability has many definitions, depending on assumptions made about the capabilities of the attacker. It is normally presented as a game, where the cryptosystem is considered secure if no adversary can win the game with significantly greater probability than an adversary who must guess randomly. The most common definitions used in cryptography are indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack (abbreviated IND-CPA), indistinguishability under (non-adaptive) chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA1), and indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2). Security under either of the latter definition implies security under the previous ones: a scheme which is IND-CCA1 secure is also IND-CPA secure, and a scheme which is IND-CCA2 secure is both IND-CCA1 and IND-CPA secure. Thus, IND-CCA2 is the strongest of the three definitions of security.\n\n\n*** Indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CPA) ***\nFor a probabilistic asymmetric key encryption algorithm, indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA) is defined by the following game between an adversary and a challenger. For schemes based on computational security, the adversary is modeled by a probabilistic polynomial time Turing machine, meaning that it must complete the game and output a guess within a polynomial number of time steps. In this definition E(PK, M) represents the encryption of a message M under the key PK:\n\nThe challenger generates a key pair PK, SK based on some security parameter k (e.g., a key size in bits), and publishes PK to the adversary. The challenger retains SK.\nThe adversary may perform a polynomially bounded number of encryptions or other operations.\nEventually, the adversary submits two distinct chosen plaintexts \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            M\n            \n              0\n            \n          \n          ,\n          \n            M\n            \n              1\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle M_{0},M_{1}}\n   to the challenger.\nThe challenger selects a bit b \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u2208\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle \\in }\n   {0, 1} uniformly at random, and sends the challenge ciphertext C\n\n== Equivalences and implications ==\nIndistinguishability is an important property for maintaining the confidentiality of encrypted communications. However, the property of indistinguishability has in some cases been found to imply other, apparently unrelated security properties. Sometimes these implications go in both directions, making two definitions equivalent; for example, it is known that the property of indistinguishability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (IND-CCA2) is equivalent to the property of non-malleability under the same attack scenario (NM-CCA2). This equivalence is not immediately obvious, as non-malleability is a property dealing with message integrity, rather than confidentiality. In other cases, it has been demonstrated that indistinguishability can be combined with certain other definitions, in order to imply still other useful definitions, and vice versa. The following list summarizes a few known implications, though it is by no means complete.\nThe notation \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n          \u21d2\n          \n          B\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle A\\;\\Rightarrow \\;B}\n   means that property A implies property B. \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n          \u21d4\n          \n          B\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle A\\;\\Leftrightarrow \\;B}\n   means that properties A and B are equivalent. \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n          \u21cf\n          \n          B\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle A\\;\\not \\Rightarrow \\;B}\n   means that property A does not necessarily imply property B.\n\nIND-CPA \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u21d4\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle \\Leftrightarrow }\n   semantic security under CPA.\nNM-CPA (non-malleability under chosen plaintext attack) \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u21d2\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle \\Rightarrow }\n   IND-CPA.\nNM-CPA (non-malleability under chosen plaintext attack) \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u21cf\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle \\not \\Rightarrow }\n   IND-CCA2.\nNM-CCA2 (non-malleability under adaptive chosen ciphertext attack) \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u21d4\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\scriptstyle \\Leftrightarrow }\n   IND-CCA2.",

Specifically, BAN logic helps its users determine whether exchanged information is trustworthy, secured against eavesdropping, or both. BAN logic starts with the assumption that all information exchanges happen on media vulnerable to tampering and public monitoring. This has evolved into the popular security mantra, \"Don't trust the network.\"\nA typical BAN logic sequence includes three steps:\nVerification of message origin\nVerification of message freshness\nVerification of the origin's trustworthiness.BAN logic uses postulates and definitions \u2013 like all axiomatic systems \u2013 to analyze authentication protocols. Use of the BAN logic often accompanies a security protocol notation formulation of a protocol and is sometimes given in papers.\n\n\n\n== Language type ==\nBAN logic, and logics in the same family, are decidable: there exists an algorithm taking BAN hypotheses and a purported conclusion, and that answers whether or not the conclusion is derivable from the hypotheses.

Some of these try to repair one weakness of BAN logic: the lack of a good semantics with a clear meaning in terms of knowledge and possible universes.

In some cases a protocol was reasoned as secure by the BAN analysis but were in fact insecure. This has led to the abandonment of BAN-family logics in favor of proof methods based on standard invariance reasoning.\n\n== Basic rules ==\nThe definitions and their implications are below (P and Q are network agents, X is a message,\nand K is an encryption key):\n\nP believes X: P acts as if X is true, and may assert X in other messages.\nP has jurisdiction over X: P's beliefs about X should be trusted.\nP said X: At one time, P transmitted (and believed) message X, although P might no longer believe X.\nP sees X: P receives message X, and can read and repeat X.\n{X}K: X is encrypted with key K.\nfresh(X): X has not previously been sent in any message.\nkey(K, P\u2194Q): P and Q may communicate with shared key KThe meaning of these definitions is captured in a series of postulates:\n\nIf P believes key(K, P\u2194Q), and P sees {X}K, then P believes (Q said X)\nIf P believes (Q said X) and P believes fresh(X), then P believes (Q believes X).P must believe that X is fresh here.

For example, if P believes that Q said <X, Y>, the concatenation of X and Y, then P also believes that Q said X, and P also believes that Q said Y.Using this notation, the assumptions behind an authentication protocol\ncan be formalized.

B can now contact A\ndirectly, using Kab as a secret session key.\nNow let's suppose that we abandon the assumption that the clocks are\nsynchronized.  In that case, S gets message 1 from A with {t,\nkey(Kab, A\u2194B)}, but it can no longer conclude\nthat t is fresh.  It knows that A sent this message at some time\nin the past (because it is encrypted with Kas)\nbut not that this is a recent message, so S doesn't believe that A\nnecessarily wants to continue to use the key\nKab.

Devices in the family can use either the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or SCIP to provide Type-1 encryption, with communication levels classified up to Top Secret. The devices are activated with a Personal Identification Number (PIN).\n\n\n\n== Sect\u00e9ra Secure Module ==\nThe Sect\u00e9ra Secure Module is a device that can provide encryption of both voice and data. It is used in the Sect\u00e9ra Wireline Terminal for use with standard PSTN devices and has been incorporated into a slim module to use with a Motorola GSM cell phone.  The module is placed between the battery and the body of the phone.

    "instruction": "Forward-confirmed reverse DNS\n\n==Introduction==\nForward-confirmed reverse DNS (FCrDNS), also known as full-circle reverse DNS, double-reverse DNS, or iprev, is a networking parameter configuration in which a given IP address has both forward (name-to-address) and reverse (address-to-name) Domain Name System (DNS) entries that match each other. This is the standard configuration expected by the Internet standards supporting many DNS-reliant protocols. David Barr published an opinion in RFC 1912 (Informational) recommending it as best practice for DNS administrators, but there are no formal requirements for it codified within the DNS standard itself.A FCrDNS verification can create a weak form of authentication that there is a valid relationship between the owner of a domain name and the owner of the network that has been given an IP address. While weak, this authentication is strong enough that it can be used for whitelisting purposes because spammers and phishers cannot usually by-pass this verification when they use zombie computers for email spoofing. That is, the reverse DNS might verify, but it will usually be part of another domain than the claimed domain name.\nUsing an ISP's mail server as a relay may solve the reverse DNS problem, because the requirement is the forward and reverse lookup for the sending relay have to match, it does not have to be related to the from-field or sending domain of messages it relays.\nOther methods for establishing a relation between an IP address and a domain in email are the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and the MX record.\nISPs that will not or cannot configure reverse DNS will generate problems for hosts on their networks, by virtue of being unable to support applications or protocols that require reverse DNS agree with the corresponding A (or AAAA) record.  ISPs that cannot or will not provide reverse DNS ultimately will be limiting the ability of their client base to use Internet services they provide effectively and securely.\n\n== Applications ==\nMost e-mail mail transfer agents (server software) use a FCrDNS verification and if there is a valid domain name, put it into the \"Received:\" trace header field.\nSome e-mail mail transfer agents will perform FCrDNS verification on the domain name given on the SMTP HELO and EHLO commands. This can violate RFC 2821 and so e-mail is usually not rejected by default.\nThe Sender Policy Framework email anti-forgery system uses a FCrDNS check in its \"ptr:\" mechanism. However, the use of this \"ptr:\" mechanism is discouraged since the first standardization of SPF in 2006 (in RFC 4408).\nSome e-mail spam filters use FCrDNS checks as an authentication method for domain names or for whitelisting purposes, according to RFC 8601, for example.\nSpamCop uses the FCrDNS check, which sometimes causes problems for SpamCop users who are also customers of Internet service providers who do not provide properly matching DNS and rDNS records for mail servers. [1] [2]\nSome FTP, Telnet and TCP Wrapper servers perform FCrDNS checks.[3]\nSome IRC Servers perform FCrDNS checks to prevent abuse.\n\nQ: What is Forward-confirmed reverse DNS (FCrDNS) and how does it relate to the Domain Name System (DNS)?question: What is the purpose of FCrDNS verification in email?question: Can an ISP's mail server solve the reverse DNS problem?question: What are other methods for establishing a relation between an IP address and a domain in email?question: What are the consequences for hosts on a network if the ISP cannot or will not provide reverse DNS?question: Which e-mail mail transfer agents use FCrDNS verification and put it into the \"Received:\" trace header field?question: Is it a violation of RFC 2821 for e-mail mail transfer agents to perform FCrDNS verification on the domain name given on the SMTP HELO and EHLO commands?question: Is the use of the \"ptr:\" mechanism in SPF encouraged?question: How do some e-mail spam filters use FCrDNS checks?question: What can be a problem for SpamCop users who are also customers of Internet service providers who do not provide properly matching DNS and rDNS records for mail servers?question: Which servers perform FCrDNS checks other than email servers?question: Why do some IRC Servers perform FCrDNS checks?question: Is FCrDNS verification a formal requirement within the DNS standard?question: How can FCrDNS verification help prevent spamming and phishing?question: What are the potential consequences for ISPs that cannot or will not provide reverse DNS?",

      "context": "Forward-confirmed reverse DNS\n\n==Introduction==\nForward-confirmed reverse DNS (FCrDNS), also known as full-circle reverse DNS, double-reverse DNS, or iprev, is a networking parameter configuration in which a given IP address has both forward (name-to-address) and reverse (address-to-name) Domain Name System (DNS) entries that match each other. This is the standard configuration expected by the Internet standards supporting many DNS-reliant protocols. David Barr published an opinion in RFC 1912 (Informational) recommending it as best practice for DNS administrators, but there are no formal requirements for it codified within the DNS standard itself.A FCrDNS verification can create a weak form of authentication that there is a valid relationship between the owner of a domain name and the owner of the network that has been given an IP address. While weak, this authentication is strong enough that it can be used for whitelisting purposes because spammers and phishers cannot usually by-pass this verification when they use zombie computers for email spoofing. That is, the reverse DNS might verify, but it will usually be part of another domain than the claimed domain name.\nUsing an ISP's mail server as a relay may solve the reverse DNS problem, because the requirement is the forward and reverse lookup for the sending relay have to match, it does not have to be related to the from-field or sending domain of messages it relays.\nOther methods for establishing a relation between an IP address and a domain in email are the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and the MX record.\nISPs that will not or cannot configure reverse DNS will generate problems for hosts on their networks, by virtue of being unable to support applications or protocols that require reverse DNS agree with the corresponding A (or AAAA) record.  ISPs that cannot or will not provide reverse DNS ultimately will be limiting the ability of their client base to use Internet services they provide effectively and securely.\n\n== Applications ==\nMost e-mail mail transfer agents (server software) use a FCrDNS verification and if there is a valid domain name, put it into the \"Received:\" trace header field.\nSome e-mail mail transfer agents will perform FCrDNS verification on the domain name given on the SMTP HELO and EHLO commands. This can violate RFC 2821 and so e-mail is usually not rejected by default.\nThe Sender Policy Framework email anti-forgery system uses a FCrDNS check in its \"ptr:\" mechanism. However, the use of this \"ptr:\" mechanism is discouraged since the first standardization of SPF in 2006 (in RFC 4408).\nSome e-mail spam filters use FCrDNS checks as an authentication method for domain names or for whitelisting purposes, according to RFC 8601, for example.\nSpamCop uses the FCrDNS check, which sometimes causes problems for SpamCop users who are also customers of Internet service providers who do not provide properly matching DNS and rDNS records for mail servers. [1] [2]\nSome FTP, Telnet and TCP Wrapper servers perform FCrDNS checks.[3]\nSome IRC Servers perform FCrDNS checks to prevent abuse.",

    "instruction": "In re Boucher\n\n==Introduction==\nIn re Boucher (case citation: No. 2:06-mJ-91, 2009 WL 424718), is a federal criminal case in Vermont, which was the first to directly address the question of whether investigators can compel a suspect to reveal their encryption passphrase or password, despite the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination. A magistrate judge held that producing the passphrase would constitute self-incrimination. In its submission on appeal to the District Court, the Government stated that it does not seek the password for the encrypted hard drive, but only sought to force Boucher to produce the contents of his encrypted hard drive in an unencrypted format by opening the drive before the grand jury. A District Court judge agreed with the government, holding that, given Boucher's initial cooperation in showing some of the content of his computer to border agents, producing the complete contents would not constitute self-incrimination.\nIn late 2009, Boucher finally gave up his password and investigators found numerous images and videos depicting sexual abuse of children. In January 2010, Boucher was sentenced to 3 years in prison and deported.\n\n== Facts ==\nOn 17 December 2006, the laptop computer of defendant Sebastien D. Boucher (born in 1977) was inspected when he crossed the border from Canada into the United States at Derby Line, Vermont. The laptop  was powered-up when the border was crossed, which allowed its contents to be browsed. Images containing child pornography were allegedly seen by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) border agents who seized the laptop, questioned Boucher and then arrested him on a complaint\ncharging him with transportation of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2252A(a)(1). The laptop was subsequently powered-down. When the laptop was switched on and booted on 29 December 2006, it was not possible to access its entire storage capability. This was because the laptop had been protected by PGP Disk encryption. As a result, investigators working for the US government were unable to view the contents of drive \"Z:\", which allegedly contained the illegal content. A grand jury then subpoenaed the defendant to provide the password to the encryption key protecting the data.\n\n== Decision of the United States District Court ==\nOn November 29, 2007, U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerome Niedermeier of the United States District Court for the District of Vermont stated \"Compelling Boucher to enter the password forces him to produce evidence that could be used to incriminate him.\" Accordingly, Niedermeier quashed the subpoena.\nOn January 2, 2008, the United States appealed the magistrate's opinion to the District Court in a sealed motion (court docket, case #: 2:06-mJ-00091-wks-jjn-1). The appeal was heard by U.S. District Judge William K. Sessions. Oral arguments were scheduled for April 30, 2008.On February 19, 2009, Judge Sessions reversed the magistrate's ruling and directed  Boucher \"to provide an unencrypted version of the Z drive viewed by the ICE agent.\"\n\nBoucher accessed the Z drive of his laptop at the ICE agent's request. The ICE agent viewed the contents of some of the Z drive's files, and ascertained that they may consist of images or videos of child pornography. The Government thus knows of the existence and location of the Z drive and its files. Again providing access to the unencrypted Z drive 'adds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government's information about the existence and location of files that may contain incriminating information. Fisher, 425 U.S. at 411.\nBoucher's act of producing an unencrypted version of the Z drive likewise is not necessary to authenticate it. He has already admitted to possession of the computer, and provided the Government with access to the Z drive. The Government has submitted that it can link Boucher with the files on his computer without making use of his production of an unencrypted version of the Z drive, and that it will not use his act of production as evidence of authentication.\n\nQ: Can suspects be compelled to reveal their encryption passphrase or password under the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination?question: What was the initial charge against Sebastien D. Boucher?question: Why were investigators unable to view the contents of drive \"Z:\" on Boucher's laptop?question: Who stated that they do not seek the password for the encrypted hard drive, but only sought to force Boucher to produce the contents of his encrypted hard drive in an unencrypted format?question: What did U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerome Niedermeier of the United States District Court for the District of Vermont state regarding compelling Boucher to enter the password?question: Who reversed the magistrate's ruling in the United States District Court for the District of Vermont?question: Why does providing access to the unencrypted Z drive add little or nothing to the sum total of the Government's information about the existence and location of files that may contain incriminating information?question: What did Boucher admit to in relation to the possession of the computer?question: What did the Government submit regarding linking Boucher with the files on his computer?question: What was the final sentence for Boucher?question: What was the initial reaction of the border agents when they inspected Boucher's laptop?question: Why was the laptop powered-up when Boucher crossed the border?question: What was the role of the grand jury in this case?question: What was the decision of U.S. District Judge William K. Sessions?question: Why did Boucher finally give up his password?",

      "context": "In re Boucher\n\n==Introduction==\nIn re Boucher (case citation: No. 2:06-mJ-91, 2009 WL 424718), is a federal criminal case in Vermont, which was the first to directly address the question of whether investigators can compel a suspect to reveal their encryption passphrase or password, despite the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination. A magistrate judge held that producing the passphrase would constitute self-incrimination. In its submission on appeal to the District Court, the Government stated that it does not seek the password for the encrypted hard drive, but only sought to force Boucher to produce the contents of his encrypted hard drive in an unencrypted format by opening the drive before the grand jury. A District Court judge agreed with the government, holding that, given Boucher's initial cooperation in showing some of the content of his computer to border agents, producing the complete contents would not constitute self-incrimination.\nIn late 2009, Boucher finally gave up his password and investigators found numerous images and videos depicting sexual abuse of children. In January 2010, Boucher was sentenced to 3 years in prison and deported.\n\n== Facts ==\nOn 17 December 2006, the laptop computer of defendant Sebastien D. Boucher (born in 1977) was inspected when he crossed the border from Canada into the United States at Derby Line, Vermont. The laptop  was powered-up when the border was crossed, which allowed its contents to be browsed. Images containing child pornography were allegedly seen by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) border agents who seized the laptop, questioned Boucher and then arrested him on a complaint\ncharging him with transportation of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2252A(a)(1). The laptop was subsequently powered-down. When the laptop was switched on and booted on 29 December 2006, it was not possible to access its entire storage capability. This was because the laptop had been protected by PGP Disk encryption. As a result, investigators working for the US government were unable to view the contents of drive \"Z:\", which allegedly contained the illegal content. A grand jury then subpoenaed the defendant to provide the password to the encryption key protecting the data.\n\n== Decision of the United States District Court ==\nOn November 29, 2007, U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerome Niedermeier of the United States District Court for the District of Vermont stated \"Compelling Boucher to enter the password forces him to produce evidence that could be used to incriminate him.\" Accordingly, Niedermeier quashed the subpoena.\nOn January 2, 2008, the United States appealed the magistrate's opinion to the District Court in a sealed motion (court docket, case #: 2:06-mJ-00091-wks-jjn-1). The appeal was heard by U.S. District Judge William K. Sessions. Oral arguments were scheduled for April 30, 2008.On February 19, 2009, Judge Sessions reversed the magistrate's ruling and directed  Boucher \"to provide an unencrypted version of the Z drive viewed by the ICE agent.\"\n\nBoucher accessed the Z drive of his laptop at the ICE agent's request. The ICE agent viewed the contents of some of the Z drive's files, and ascertained that they may consist of images or videos of child pornography. The Government thus knows of the existence and location of the Z drive and its files. Again providing access to the unencrypted Z drive 'adds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government's information about the existence and location of files that may contain incriminating information. Fisher, 425 U.S. at 411.\nBoucher's act of producing an unencrypted version of the Z drive likewise is not necessary to authenticate it. He has already admitted to possession of the computer, and provided the Government with access to the Z drive. The Government has submitted that it can link Boucher with the files on his computer without making use of his production of an unencrypted version of the Z drive, and that it will not use his act of production as evidence of authentication.",

    "instruction": "text: Stream cipher\n\n==Introduction==\nA stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext digits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher digit stream (keystream). In a stream cipher, each plaintext digit is encrypted one at a time with the corresponding digit of the keystream, to give a digit of the ciphertext stream. Since encryption of each digit is dependent on the current state of the cipher, it is also known as state cipher. In practice, a digit is typically a bit and the combining operation is an exclusive-or (XOR).\nThe pseudorandom keystream is typically generated serially from a random seed value using digital shift registers. The seed value serves as the cryptographic key for decrypting the ciphertext stream. Stream ciphers represent a different approach to symmetric encryption from block ciphers. Block ciphers operate on large blocks of digits with a fixed, unvarying transformation. This distinction is not always clear-cut: in some modes of operation, a block cipher primitive is used in such a way that it acts effectively as a stream cipher. Stream ciphers typically execute at a higher speed than block ciphers and have lower hardware complexity. However, stream ciphers can be susceptible to security breaches (see stream cipher attacks); for example, when the same starting state (seed) is used twice.\n\n== Loose inspiration from the one-time pad ==\nStream ciphers can be viewed as approximating the action of a proven unbreakable cipher, the one-time pad (OTP). A one-time pad uses a keystream of completely random digits. The keystream is combined with the plaintext digits one at a time to form the ciphertext. This system was proved to be secure by Claude E. Shannon in 1949. However, the keystream must be generated completely at random with at least the same length as the plaintext and cannot be used more than once. This makes the system cumbersome to implement in many practical applications, and as a result the one-time pad has not been widely used, except for the most critical applications. Key generation, distribution and management are critical for those applications.\nA stream cipher makes use of a much smaller and more convenient key such as 128 bits. Based on this key, it generates a pseudorandom keystream which can be combined with the plaintext digits in a similar fashion to the one-time pad. However, this comes at a cost. The keystream is now pseudorandom and so is not truly random. The proof of security associated with the one-time pad no longer holds. It is quite possible for a stream cipher to be completely insecure.\n\n== Types ==\nA stream cipher generates successive elements of the keystream based on an internal state. This state is updated in essentially two ways: if the state changes independently of the plaintext or ciphertext messages, the cipher is classified as a synchronous stream cipher. By contrast, self-synchronising stream ciphers update their state based on previous ciphertext digits.\n\n\n*** Synchronous stream ciphers ***\n\nIn a synchronous stream cipher a stream of pseudorandom digits is generated independently of the plaintext and ciphertext messages, and then combined with the plaintext (to encrypt) or the ciphertext (to decrypt). In the most common form, binary digits are used (bits), and the keystream is combined with the plaintext using the exclusive or operation (XOR). This is termed a binary additive stream cipher.\nIn a synchronous stream cipher, the sender and receiver must be exactly in step for decryption to be successful. If digits are added or removed from the message during transmission, synchronisation is lost. To restore synchronisation, various offsets can be tried systematically to obtain the correct decryption. Another approach is to tag the ciphertext with markers at regular points in the output.\nIf, however, a digit is corrupted in transmission, rather than added or lost, only a single digit in the plaintext is affected and the error does not propagate to other parts of the message. This property is useful when the transmission error rate is high; however, it makes it less likely the error would be detected without further mechanisms. Moreover, because of this property, synchronous stream ciphers are very susceptible to active attacks: if an attacker can change a digit in the ciphertext, they might be able to make predictable changes to the corresponding plaintext bit; for example, flipping a bit in the ciphertext causes the same bit to be flipped in the plaintext.\n\n\n*** Self-synchronizing stream ciphers ***\nAnother approach uses several of the previous N ciphertext digits to compute the keystream. Such schemes are known as self-synchronizing stream ciphers, asynchronous stream ciphers or ciphertext autokey (CTAK). The idea of self-synchronization was patented in 1946 and has the advantage that the receiver will automatically synchronise with the keystream generator after receiving N ciphertext digits, making it easier to recover if digits are dropped or added to the message stream. Single-digit errors are limited in their effect, affecting only up to N plaintext digits.\nAn example of a self-synchronising stream cipher is a block cipher in cipher feedback (CFB) mode.\n\n== Based on linear-feedback shift registers ==\nBinary stream ciphers are often constructed using linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs) because they can be easily implemented in hardware and can be readily analysed mathematically. The use of LFSRs on their own, however, is insufficient to provide good security. Various schemes have been proposed to increase the security of LFSRs.\n\n\n*** Non-linear combining functions ***\n\nBecause LFSRs are inherently linear, one technique for removing the linearity is to feed the outputs of several parallel LFSRs into a non-linear Boolean function to form a combination generator. Various properties of such a combining function are critical for ensuring the security of the resultant scheme, for example, in order to avoid correlation attacks. \n\n\n*** Clock-controlled generators ***\nNormally LFSRs are stepped regularly. One approach to introducing non-linearity is to have the LFSR clocked irregularly, controlled by the output of a second LFSR. Such generators include the stop-and-go generator, the alternating step generator and the shrinking generator.\nAn alternating step generator comprises three LFSRs, which we will call LFSR0, LFSR1 and LFSR2 for convenience. The output of one of the registers decides which of the other two is to be used; for instance, if LFSR2 outputs a 0, LFSR0 is clocked, and if it outputs a 1, LFSR1 is clocked instead. The output is the exclusive OR of the last bit produced by LFSR0 and LFSR1. The initial state of the three LFSRs is the key.\nThe stop-and-go generator (Beth and Piper, 1984) consists of two LFSRs. One LFSR is clocked if the output of a second is a 1, otherwise it repeats its previous output. This output is then (in some versions) combined with the output of a third LFSR clocked at a regular rate.\nThe shrinking generator takes a different approach. Two LFSRs are used, both clocked regularly. If the output of the first LFSR is 1, the output of the second LFSR becomes the output of the generator. If the first LFSR outputs 0, however, the output of the second is discarded, and no bit is output by the generator. This mechanism suffers from timing attacks on the second generator, since the speed of the output is variable in a manner that depends on the second generator's state. This can be alleviated by buffering the output.\n\n\n*** Filter generator ***\nAnother approach to improving the security of an LFSR is to pass the entire state of a single LFSR into a non-linear filtering function.\n\n== Other designs ==\n\nInstead of a linear driving device, one may use a nonlinear update function. For example, Klimov and Shamir proposed triangular functions (T-functions) with a single cycle on n-bit words.\n\n== Security ==\n\nFor a stream cipher to be secure, its keystream must have a large period, and it must be impossible to recover the cipher's key or internal state from the keystream. Cryptographers also demand that the keystream be free of even subtle biases that would let attackers distinguish a stream from random noise, and free of detectable relationships between keystreams that correspond to related keys or related cryptographic nonces. That should be true for all keys (there should be no weak keys), even if the attacker can know or choose some plaintext or ciphertext.\nAs with other attacks in cryptography, stream cipher attacks can be certificational so they are not necessarily practical ways to break the cipher but indicate that the cipher might have other weaknesses.\nSecurely using a secure synchronous stream cipher requires that one never reuse the same keystream twice. That generally means a different nonce or key must be supplied to each invocation of the cipher. Application designers must also recognize that most stream ciphers provide not authenticity but privacy: encrypted messages may still have been modified in transit.\nShort periods for stream ciphers have been a practical concern. For example, 64-bit block ciphers like DES can be used to generate a keystream in output feedback (OFB) mode. However, when not using full feedback, the resulting stream has a period of around 232 blocks on average; for many applications, the period is far too low. For example, if encryption is being performed at a rate of 8 megabytes per second, a stream of period 232 blocks will repeat after about a half an hour.Some applications using the stream cipher RC4 are attackable because of weaknesses in RC4's key setup routine; new applications should either avoid RC4 or make sure all keys are unique and ideally unrelated (such as generated by a well-seeded CSPRNG or a cryptographic hash function) and that the first bytes of the keystream are discarded.\nThe elements of stream ciphers are often much simpler to understand than block ciphers and are thus less likely to hide any accidental or malicious weaknesses.\n\n== Usage ==\nStream ciphers are often used for their speed and simplicity of implementation in hardware, and in applications where plaintext comes in quantities of unknowable length like a secure wireless connection. If a block cipher (not operating in a stream cipher mode) were to be used in this type of application, the designer would need to choose either transmission efficiency or implementation complexity, since block ciphers cannot directly work on blocks shorter than their block size. For example, if a 128-bit block cipher received separate 32-bit bursts of plaintext, three quarters of the data transmitted would be padding. Block ciphers must be used in ciphertext stealing or residual block termination mode to avoid padding, while stream ciphers eliminate this issue by naturally operating on the smallest unit that can be transmitted (usually bytes).\nAnother advantage of stream ciphers in military cryptography is that the cipher stream can be generated in a separate box that is subject to strict security measures and fed to other devices such as a radio set, which will perform the XOR operation as part of their function. The latter device can then be designed and used in less stringent environments.\nChaCha is becoming the most widely used stream cipher in software; others include: \nRC4,\nA5/1,\nA5/2,\nChameleon, \nFISH, \nHelix,\nISAAC, \nMUGI,\nPanama,\nPhelix, \nPike,\nSalsa20,\nSEAL, \nSOBER,\nSOBER-128,\nand\nWAKE.\n\n== Comparison ==\n\n== Trivia ==\nUnited States National Security Agency documents sometimes use the term combiner-type algorithms, referring to algorithms that use some function to combine a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) with a plaintext stream.\n\nQuestions: How does a stream cipher differ from a block cipher in terms of encryption?q: What is the role of the seed value in a stream cipher?q: How does the keystream in a stream cipher differ from that in a one-time pad?q: What are the two ways in which a stream cipher's state can be updated?q: How does a synchronous stream cipher maintain synchronisation between the sender and receiver?q: What is the advantage of using a self-synchronising stream cipher over a synchronous stream cipher?q: How are binary stream ciphers often constructed?q: What is a non-linear combining function in the context of stream ciphers?q: How does the shrinking generator introduce non-linearity in stream ciphers?q: What is a filter generator in the context of stream ciphers?q: What is the significance of the period of a stream cipher's keystream?q: What is the requirement for the keystream in a secure synchronous stream cipher?q: Why should a different nonce or key be supplied to each invocation of a secure synchronous stream cipher?q: What is the practical concern with short periods in stream ciphers?q: Why are stream ciphers often used in military cryptography?",

If a block cipher (not operating in a stream cipher mode) were to be used in this type of application, the designer would need to choose either transmission efficiency or implementation complexity, since block ciphers cannot directly work on blocks shorter than their block size. For example, if a 128-bit block cipher received separate 32-bit bursts of plaintext, three quarters of the data transmitted would be padding. Block ciphers must be used in ciphertext stealing or residual block termination mode to avoid padding, while stream ciphers eliminate this issue by naturally operating on the smallest unit that can be transmitted (usually bytes).\nAnother advantage of stream ciphers in military cryptography is that the cipher stream can be generated in a separate box that is subject to strict security measures and fed to other devices such as a radio set, which will perform the XOR operation as part of their function. The latter device can then be designed and used in less stringent environments.\nChaCha is becoming the most widely used stream cipher in software; others include: \nRC4,\nA5/1,\nA5/2,\nChameleon, \nFISH, \nHelix,\nISAAC, \nMUGI,\nPanama,\nPhelix, \nPike,\nSalsa20,\nSEAL, \nSOBER,\nSOBER-128,\nand\nWAKE.\n\n== Comparison ==\n\n== Trivia ==\nUnited States National Security Agency documents sometimes use the term combiner-type algorithms, referring to algorithms that use some function to combine a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) with a plaintext stream.",
      "questions": "How does a stream cipher differ from a block cipher in terms of encryption?q: What is the role of the seed value in a stream cipher?q: How does the keystream in a stream cipher differ from that in a one-time pad?q: What are the two ways in which a stream cipher's state can be updated?q: How does a synchronous stream cipher maintain synchronisation between the sender and receiver?q: What is the advantage of using a self-synchronising stream cipher over a synchronous stream cipher?q: How are binary stream ciphers often constructed?q: What is a non-linear combining function in the context of stream ciphers?q: How does the shrinking generator introduce non-linearity in stream ciphers?q: What is a filter generator in the context of stream ciphers?q: What is the significance of the period of a stream cipher's keystream?q: What is the requirement for the keystream in a secure synchronous stream cipher?q: Why should a different nonce or key be supplied to each invocation of a secure synchronous stream cipher?q: What is the practical concern with short periods in stream ciphers?q: Why are stream ciphers often used in military cryptography?",
      "answers": "A stream cipher encrypts plaintext digits one at a time with the corresponding digit of the pseudorandom keystream, while a block cipher operates on large blocks of digits with a fixed, unvarying transformation.a: The seed value serves as the cryptographic key for decrypting the ciphertext stream in a stream cipher.a: The keystream in a stream cipher is pseudorandom, while in a one-time pad it is truly random.a: A stream cipher's state can be updated independently of the plaintext or ciphertext messages (synchronous stream cipher), or based on previous ciphertext digits (self-synchronising stream cipher).a: In a synchronous stream cipher, the sender and receiver must be exactly in step for decryption to be successful. If digits are added or removed from the message during transmission, synchronisation is lost and various offsets can be tried systematically to obtain the correct decryption.a: The advantage of using a self-synchronising stream cipher over a synchronous stream cipher is that the receiver will automatically synchronise with the keystream generator after receiving N ciphertext digits, making it easier to recover if digits are dropped or added to the message stream.a: Binary stream ciphers are often constructed using linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs) because they can be easily implemented in hardware and can be readily analysed mathematically.a: A non-linear combining function is a technique used to remove the linearity of LFSRs in stream ciphers by feeding the outputs of several parallel LFSRs into a non-linear Boolean function.a: The shrinking generator introduces non-linearity in stream ciphers by having the LFSR clocked irregularly, controlled by the output of a second LFSR.a: A filter generator is an approach to improving the security of an LFSR by passing the entire state of a single LFSR into a non-linear filtering function.a: The period of a stream cipher's keystream must be large for the stream cipher to be secure.a: The keystream in a secure synchronous stream cipher must be impossible to recover the cipher's key or internal state from the keystream.a: To be secure, a different nonce or key must be supplied to each invocation of a secure synchronous stream cipher to prevent reuse of the same keystream.a: Short periods in stream ciphers can be a practical concern as they may cause the keystream to repeat too frequently, making the cipher insecure.a: Stream ciphers are often used in military cryptography for their speed and simplicity of implementation in hardware, and in applications where plaintext comes in quantities of unknowable length. They also allow for the cipher stream to be generated in a separate box subject to strict security measures and fed to other devices which perform the XOR operation."

    "instruction": "Anomaly-based intrusion detection system\n\n==Introduction==\nAn anomaly-based intrusion detection system, is an intrusion detection system for detecting both network and computer intrusions and misuse by monitoring system activity and classifying it as either normal or anomalous. The classification is based on heuristics or rules, rather than patterns or signatures, and attempts to detect any type of misuse that falls out of normal system operation. This is as opposed to signature-based systems, which can only detect attacks for which a signature has previously been created.In order to positively identify attack traffic, the system must be taught to recognize normal system activity. The two phases of a majority of anomaly detection systems consist of the training phase (where a profile of normal behaviors is built) and testing phase (where current traffic is compared with the profile created in the training phase). Anomalies are detected in several ways, most often with artificial intelligence type techniques. Systems using artificial neural networks have been used to great effect. Another method is to define what normal usage of the system comprises using a strict mathematical model, and flag any deviation from this as an attack. This is known as strict anomaly detection. Other techniques used to detect anomalies include data mining methods, grammar based methods, and Artificial Immune System.Network-based anomalous intrusion detection systems often provide a second line of defense to detect anomalous traffic at the physical and network layers after it has passed through a firewall or other security appliance on the border of a network. Host-based anomalous intrusion detection systems are one of the last layers of defense and reside on computer end points. They allow for fine-tuned, granular protection of end points at the application level.Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection at both the network and host levels have a few shortcomings; namely a high false-positive rate and the ability to be fooled by a correctly delivered attack.

VeraCrypt includes optimizations to the original cryptographic hash functions and ciphers, which boost performance on modern CPUs.\n\n== Encryption scheme ==\nVeraCrypt employs AES, Serpent, Twofish, Camellia, and Kuznyechik as ciphers. Version 1.19 stopped using the Magma cipher in response to a security audit. For additional security, ten different combinations of cascaded algorithms are available:\nAES\u2013Twofish\nAES\u2013Twofish\u2013Serpent\nCamellia\u2013Kuznyechik\nCamellia\u2013Serpent\nKuznyechik\u2013AES\nKuznyechik\u2013Serpent\u2013Camellia\nKuznyechik\u2013Twofish\nSerpent\u2013AES\nSerpent\u2013Twofish\u2013AES\nTwofish\u2013SerpentThe cryptographic hash functions available for use in VeraCrypt are RIPEMD-160, SHA-256, SHA-512, Streebog and Whirlpool.VeraCrypt's block cipher mode of operation is XTS. It generates the header key and the secondary header key (XTS mode) using PBKDF2 with a 512-bit salt. By default they go through 200,000 to 655,331 iterations, depending on the underlying hash function used. The user can customize it to start as low as 2,048.\n\n== Security improvements ==\n\nThe VeraCrypt development team considered the TrueCrypt storage format too vulnerable to a National Security Agency (NSA) attack, so it created a new format incompatible with that of TrueCrypt. VeraCrypt is still capable of opening and converting volumes in the TrueCrypt format.\nAn independent security audit of TrueCrypt released 29 September 2015 found TrueCrypt includes two vulnerabilities in the Windows installation driver allowing an attacker arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation via DLL hijacking. This was fixed in VeraCrypt in January 2016.\nWhile TrueCrypt uses 1,000 iterations of the PBKDF2-RIPEMD160 algorithm for system partitions, VeraCrypt uses either 200,000 or 327,661 iterations by default (which is customizable by user to be as low as 2,048), depending on the algorithm used. For standard containers and other partitions, VeraCrypt uses 655,331 iterations of RIPEMD160 and 500,000 iterations of SHA-2 and Whirlpool by default (which is customizable by user to be as low as 16,000). While these default settings make VeraCrypt slower at opening encrypted partitions, it also makes password-guessing attacks slower.\nAdditionally, since version 1.12, a new feature called \"Personal Iterations Multiplier\" (PIM) provides a parameter whose value is used to control the number of iterations used by the header key derivation function, thereby making brute-force attacks potentially even more difficult. Veracrypt out of the box uses a reasonable PIM value to improve security, but users can provide a higher value to enhance security. The primary downside of this feature is that it makes the process of opening encrypted archives even slower.\nA vulnerability in the bootloader was fixed on Windows and various optimizations were made as well. The developers added support for SHA-256 to the system boot encryption option and also fixed a ShellExecute security issue. Linux and macOS users benefit from support for hard drives with sector sizes larger than 512. Linux also received support for the NTFS formatting of volumes.\nUnicode passwords are supported on all operating systems since version 1.17 (except for system encryption on Windows).\nVeraCrypt added the capability to boot system partitions using UEFI in version 1.18a.\nOption to enable/disable support for the TRIM command for both system and non-system drives was added in version 1.22.\nErasing the system encryption keys from RAM during shutdown/reboot helps mitigate some cold boot attacks, added in version 1.24.\nRAM encryption for keys and passwords on 64-bit systems was added in version 1.24.\n\n\n*** VeraCrypt audit ***\nQuarksLab  conducted an audit of version 1.18 on behalf of the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF), which took 32 man-days. The auditor published the results on 17 October 2016. On the same day, IDRIX released version 1.19, which resolved major vulnerabilities identified in the audit.Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (SIT) conducted another audit in 2020, following a request by Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), and published the results in October 2020.\n\n== Security precautions ==\nThere are several kinds of attacks to which all software-based disk encryption is vulnerable. As with TrueCrypt, the VeraCrypt documentation instructs users to follow various security precautions to mitigate these attacks, several of which are detailed below.\n\n\n*** Encryption keys stored in memory ***\n\nVeraCrypt stores its keys in RAM; on some personal computers DRAM will maintain its contents for several seconds after power is cut (or longer if the temperature is lowered). Even if there is some degradation in the memory contents, various algorithms may be able to recover the keys. This method, known as a cold boot attack (which would apply in particular to a notebook computer obtained while in power-on, suspended, or screen-locked mode), was successfully used to attack a file system protected by TrueCrypt versions 4.3a and 5.0a in 2008. With version 1.24, VeraCrypt added the option of encrypting the in-RAM keys and passwords on x64 editions of Windows, with a CPU overhead of less than 10%, and the option of erasing all encryption keys from memory when a new device is connected.\n\n\n*** Tampered hardware ***\n\nVeraCrypt documentation states that VeraCrypt is unable to secure data on a computer if an attacker physically accessed it and VeraCrypt is then used on the compromised computer by the user again. This does not affect the common case of a stolen, lost, or confiscated computer. The attacker having physical access to a computer can, for example, install a hardware or a software keylogger, a bus-mastering device capturing memory or install any other malicious hardware or software, allowing the attacker to capture unencrypted data (including encryption keys and passwords) or to decrypt encrypted data using captured passwords or encryption keys. Therefore, physical security is a basic premise of a secure system.Some kinds of malware are designed to log keystrokes, including typed passwords, that may then be sent to the attacker over the Internet or saved to an unencrypted local drive from which the attacker might be able to read it later, when they gain physical access to the computer.\n\n\n*** Trusted Platform Module ***\nVeraCrypt does not take advantage of Trusted Platform Module (TPM). VeraCrypt FAQ repeats the negative opinion of the original TrueCrypt developers verbatim. The TrueCrypt developers were of the opinion that the exclusive purpose of the TPM is \"to protect against attacks that require the attacker to have administrator privileges, or physical access to the computer\". The attacker who has physical or administrative access to a computer can circumvent TPM, e.g., by installing a hardware keystroke logger, by resetting TPM, or by capturing memory contents and retrieving TPM-issued keys. The condemning text goes so far as to claim that TPM is entirely redundant.It is true that after achieving either unrestricted physical access or administrative privileges, it is only a matter of time before other security measures in place are bypassed. However, stopping an attacker in possession of administrative privileges has never been one of the goals of TPM. (See Trusted Platform Module \u00a7 Uses for details.) TPM might, however, reduce the success rate of the cold boot attack described above. TPM is also known to be susceptible to SPI attacks.\n\n== Plausible deniability ==\nAs with its predecessor TrueCrypt, VeraCrypt supports plausible deniability by allowing a single \"hidden volume\" to be created within another volume. The Windows versions of VeraCrypt can create and run a hidden encrypted operating system whose existence may be denied. The VeraCrypt documentation lists ways in which the hidden volume deniability features may be compromised (e.g., by third-party software which may leak information through temporary files or via thumbnails) and possible ways to avoid this.\n\n== Performance ==\nVeraCrypt supports parallelized:\u200a63\u200a encryption for multi-core systems. On Microsoft Windows, pipelined read and write operations (a form of asynchronous processing):\u200a63\u200a to reduce the performance hit of encryption and decryption. On processors supporting the AES-NI instruction set, VeraCrypt supports hardware-accelerated AES to further improve performance.:\u200a64\u200a On 64-bit CPUs VeraCrypt uses optimized assembly implementation of Twofish, Serpent, and Camellia.\n\n== License and source model ==\nVeraCrypt was forked from the since-discontinued TrueCrypt project in 2013. and originally contained mostly TrueCrypt code released under the TrueCrypt License 3.0. In the years since, more and more of Veracrypt's code has been rewritten and released under the permissive Apache License 2.0.\nThe TrueCrypt license is generally considered to be source-available but not free and open source. The Apache license is universally considered to be free and open source. The mixed VeraCrypt license is widely but not universally considered to be free and open source.\nOn 28 May 2014 TrueCrypt was abandoned under unusual circumstances, and there exists no way to contact the former developers.\nVeraCrypt is considered to be free and open source by:\n\nPC World\nTechspot\nDuckDuckGo's Open Source Technology Improvement Fund\nSourceforge\nOpen Tech Fund\nFosshub\nopensource.com\nfossmintVeraCrypt is considered to not be free and open source by:\n\nDebianSome members of the Open Source Initiative, including the director, expressed concern about an older version of the TrueCrypt license, but the OSI itself has not published a determination regarding either TrueCrypt or VeraCrypt.The Free Software Foundation has determined the TrueCrypt license to be non-free. The FSF has not published a determination regarding the VeraCrypt license.Most of these are due to Veracrypt and Truecrypt not having supported or endorsed licenses. For example, the FSF considers all licenses not under the GNU license series that interfere with the GNU license to be non-free.

    "instruction": "Here are some questions about this text: Scam baiting\n\n==Introduction==\nScam baiting (or scambaiting) is a form of internet vigilantism primarily used towards advance-fee fraud, IRS impersonation scams, technical support scams, pension scams, and consumer financial fraud.Scambaiters pose as potential victims to waste the time and resources of scammers, gather information useful to authorities, and publicly expose scammers. They may document scammers' tools and methods, warn potential victims, provide discussion forums, disrupt scammers' devices and systems using remote access trojans and computer viruses, or take down fraudulent webpages. Some scambaiters are motivated by a sense of civic duty, some simply engage for their own amusement, or a combination of both.\n\n== Methodology ==\nFor scams conducted via written communication, baiters may answer scam emails using throwaway email accounts, pretending to be receptive to scammers' offers.Popular methods of accomplishing the first objective are to ask scammers to fill out lengthy questionnaires; to bait scammers into taking long trips; to encourage the use of poorly made props or inappropriate English-language idioms that surreptitiously cast doubt upon their scams.Baiters may deceive scammers with claims as ludicrous as the ones they have used to defraud their victims; or they may entrap them with Trojan horses, such as remote administration tools, that enable baiters to gain sensitive information from or damage scammers' computers. Baiters may publicly humiliate scammers by live streaming their sessions or persuading them to produce humiliating images colloquially known as \"trophies\". Some of the images that were uploaded to early scam baiting websites have been described as a form of schadenfreude or reinforcing racist stereotypes. However, modern day scam baiting content is primarily centred around education on how the scams work and how to prevent falling victim to scams.\n\n== Examples ==\nIn May 2004, a Something Awful forum poster asked for advice on how to deal with a bogus escrow scam from a buyer on eBay. Since the eBay auction was for an Apple PowerBook G4, the poster sent a three-ring binder crudely dressed as a PowerBook and declared it to customs at the value of a real product. The buyer, who lived overseas, paid several hundred dollars in import duties to claim the fake laptop. A member of the scambaiting website 419eater.com was able to convince a scammer to send him a wooden replica of a Commodore 64.In February 2011, the Belgian television show Basta portrayed, with hidden cameras, how a scammer was fooled during a meeting with baiters, raising the stakes by involving a one-armed man, two dwarves and a pony. Eventually, a police raid was faked, during which the baiters were arrested and the scammer went free, abandoning the money, and without any suspicion.In January 2014, members of 419eater.com appeared in two segments of the Channel 4 show Secrets of the Scammers. In the first segment scambaiters persuaded a scammer to travel from London to a remote location in Cornwall by train and taxi to meet a victim (played by a baiter) and collect payment for a gold deal. In the second segment a female scammer met with two scambaiters posing as victims in Trafalgar Square to pass them a fake check. This scammer was subsequently questioned by the police.\nIn 2015 and 2016, James Veitch hosted three TED talks about scambaiting. Veitch also presented the Mashable video series \"Scamalot\" on YouTube.In March 2020, an anonymous YouTuber and grey hat hacker under the alias \"Jim Browning\" infiltrated and gathered drone and CCTV footage of a fraudulent call centre scam operation in India with the help of fellow YouTube personality Karl Rock. Through the aid of the British documentary programme Panorama, a police raid was carried out when the documentary was brought to the attention of assistant police commissioner Karan Goel, leading to the arrest of call centre operator Amit Chauhan, who also operated a fraudulent travel agency under the name \"Faremart Travels\".YouTube and Twitch are popular sources scambaiters use to educate and/or entertain their audience about various types of scams.\nWhat are the answers to these questions: How does scam baiting help in gathering information useful to authorities about advance-fee fraud and other types of scams?Question: What motivates individuals to engage in scam baiting?Question: How do scam baiters waste the time and resources of scammers?Question: How can scambaiting lead to the disruption of scammers' devices and systems?Question: How do scam baiters gather sensitive information from scammers' computers?Question: How do scam baiters publicly humiliate scammers?Question: What are some of the potential negative consequences of scam baiting?Question: How do scam baiters use humor to expose scammers?Question: How have scam baiters used fake products to expose scammers?Question: How have scam baiters used hidden cameras to expose scammers?Question: How have scam baiters used fake identities to expose scammers?Question: How have scam baiters used humor to educate the public about scams?Question: How have scam baiters used online platforms to educate the public about scams?Question: How have scam baiters collaborated with authorities to take down fraudulent websites?Question: How have scam baiters used in-person meetings to expose scammers?",

      "context": "Scam baiting\n\n==Introduction==\nScam baiting (or scambaiting) is a form of internet vigilantism primarily used towards advance-fee fraud, IRS impersonation scams, technical support scams, pension scams, and consumer financial fraud.Scambaiters pose as potential victims to waste the time and resources of scammers, gather information useful to authorities, and publicly expose scammers. They may document scammers' tools and methods, warn potential victims, provide discussion forums, disrupt scammers' devices and systems using remote access trojans and computer viruses, or take down fraudulent webpages. Some scambaiters are motivated by a sense of civic duty, some simply engage for their own amusement, or a combination of both.\n\n== Methodology ==\nFor scams conducted via written communication, baiters may answer scam emails using throwaway email accounts, pretending to be receptive to scammers' offers.Popular methods of accomplishing the first objective are to ask scammers to fill out lengthy questionnaires; to bait scammers into taking long trips; to encourage the use of poorly made props or inappropriate English-language idioms that surreptitiously cast doubt upon their scams.Baiters may deceive scammers with claims as ludicrous as the ones they have used to defraud their victims; or they may entrap them with Trojan horses, such as remote administration tools, that enable baiters to gain sensitive information from or damage scammers' computers. Baiters may publicly humiliate scammers by live streaming their sessions or persuading them to produce humiliating images colloquially known as \"trophies\". Some of the images that were uploaded to early scam baiting websites have been described as a form of schadenfreude or reinforcing racist stereotypes. However, modern day scam baiting content is primarily centred around education on how the scams work and how to prevent falling victim to scams.\n\n== Examples ==\nIn May 2004, a Something Awful forum poster asked for advice on how to deal with a bogus escrow scam from a buyer on eBay. Since the eBay auction was for an Apple PowerBook G4, the poster sent a three-ring binder crudely dressed as a PowerBook and declared it to customs at the value of a real product. The buyer, who lived overseas, paid several hundred dollars in import duties to claim the fake laptop. A member of the scambaiting website 419eater.com was able to convince a scammer to send him a wooden replica of a Commodore 64.In February 2011, the Belgian television show Basta portrayed, with hidden cameras, how a scammer was fooled during a meeting with baiters, raising the stakes by involving a one-armed man, two dwarves and a pony. Eventually, a police raid was faked, during which the baiters were arrested and the scammer went free, abandoning the money, and without any suspicion.In January 2014, members of 419eater.com appeared in two segments of the Channel 4 show Secrets of the Scammers. In the first segment scambaiters persuaded a scammer to travel from London to a remote location in Cornwall by train and taxi to meet a victim (played by a baiter) and collect payment for a gold deal. In the second segment a female scammer met with two scambaiters posing as victims in Trafalgar Square to pass them a fake check. This scammer was subsequently questioned by the police.\nIn 2015 and 2016, James Veitch hosted three TED talks about scambaiting. Veitch also presented the Mashable video series \"Scamalot\" on YouTube.In March 2020, an anonymous YouTuber and grey hat hacker under the alias \"Jim Browning\" infiltrated and gathered drone and CCTV footage of a fraudulent call centre scam operation in India with the help of fellow YouTube personality Karl Rock. Through the aid of the British documentary programme Panorama, a police raid was carried out when the documentary was brought to the attention of assistant police commissioner Karan Goel, leading to the arrest of call centre operator Amit Chauhan, who also operated a fraudulent travel agency under the name \"Faremart Travels\".YouTube and Twitch are popular sources scambaiters use to educate and/or entertain their audience about various types of scams.",

Al-Bassam co-founded the hacker group LulzSec in 2011, which was responsible for several high profile breaches. He later went on to co-found Chainspace, a company implementing a smart contract platform, which was acquired by Facebook in 2019. In 2021, Al-Bassam graduated from University College London, completing a PhD in computer science with a thesis on Securely Scaling Blockchain Base Layers. In 2016, Forbes listed Al-Bassam as one of the 30 Under 30 entrepreneurs in technology.\n\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nAl-Bassam was born in Baghdad, Iraq in January 1995, and migrated to London, United Kingdom when he was five years old. He received a BSc in Computer Science from King's College London, and is currently a PhD student at University College London.\n\n== Hacktivism ==\n\nIn 2011 as a 16 year old teenager, Al-Bassam was one of the six core members of LulzSec during its 50-day hacking spree, going by the alias \"tflow\". The group used denial-of-service attacks and compromised a number of high profile organizations and corporations, including Sony, Fox, News International, Nintendo and the CIA.He was also affiliated with the online association of hacktivists known as Anonymous, where he was involved with the hacking of emails from HBGary Federal, an intelligence contractor for the U.S. government. The emails revealed that HBGary Federal was working to develop astroturfing software to create an \"army\" of fake social media profiles, and was hired by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to spy on and smear political opponents with fake documents and communications. As a result, members of the U.S. Congress called for an investigation into HBGary Federal.\n\n\n*** Arrest and legal proceedings ***\nOn 20 July 2011, it was announced on Fox News and other press outlets that London's Metropolitan Police had arrested a 16-year-old student in London who was alleged to have used the nickname \"Tflow\" in a series of high-profile attacks on fox.com, the FBI affiliate \"Infragard\", PBS and Sony. For legal reasons, his name could not be disclosed for nearly two more years. On 9 April 2013, Tflow's full name was revealed along with his picture on multiple news outlets throughout the Internet. He pleaded guilty to computer misuse and received a 20-month suspended sentence with 320 hours of unpaid community service work. A nearly two-year internet ban imposed by police has since expired.\n\n== Career and research ==\n\n\n*** Distributed ledgers ***\nAl-Bassam has published research on scaling blockchains and cryptocurrencies. He contributed to the design and implementation of Chainspace, a blockchain protocol that makes use of sharding to increase transaction throughput. Chainspace was later spun-out into a commercial company he co-founded, and was then acquired by Facebook in 2019 to become a part of the Libra project. Al-Bassam has since been critical of Libra, stating that \"the road to dystopia is paved with good intentions, and I'm concerned about Libra's model for decentralization\".\n\n\n*** Privacy and surveillance ***\nIn 2014 Al-Bassam volunteered for Privacy International, where he released research on the computer destruction techniques that GCHQ used when forcing journalists at The Guardian's London headquarters to destroy the computers on which they stored copies of classified documents provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.In an article for Motherboard, he revealed that GCHQ's Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG), had been involved with online sockpuppetry by creating a series of fake Twitter accounts and an URL shortener which was used as a honeypot for dissidents during the Arab spring, having been targeted by JTRIG himself.\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nIn 2016, Al-Bassam was listed in the Forbes 30 Under 30 in the technology section for his work on uncovering government surveillance.\nWhat are the answers to these questions: What is Mustafa Al-Bassam's background in computer security research and hacking?question: What is LulzSec and what were their activities during their 50-day hacking spree in 2011?question: What was HBGary Federal and what was their role in the U.S. government?question: What was the outcome of HBGary Federal's actions and why did members of the U.S. Congress call for an investigation?question: How was Mustafa Al-Bassam involved in the Anonymous hack of HBGary Federal?question: What was the outcome of Mustafa Al-Bassam's legal proceedings related to his involvement in LulzSec?question: What is Chainspace and how does it use sharding to increase transaction throughput in blockchain protocols?question: How was Chainspace acquired by Facebook and how is it being used in the Libra project?question: What is Mustafa Al-Bassam's stance on the Libra project and its model for decentralization?question: What is Privacy International and what role did Mustafa Al-Bassam play in the organization?question: What is GCHQ and what were their actions related to the destruction of classified documents provided by Edward Snowden?question: What is JTRIG and what was their role in online sockpuppetry during the Arab spring?question: In what way was Mustafa Al-Bassam recognized by Forbes in 2016?question: What is the significance of Mustafa Al-Bassam being listed in the Forbes 30 Under 30 in the technology section in 2016?question: How did Mustafa Al-Bassam's early life and education influence his career in computer security?",

    "instruction": "Please answer questions about the following article about: Microsoft CryptoAPI\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Microsoft Windows platform specific Cryptographic Application Programming Interface (also known variously as CryptoAPI, Microsoft Cryptography API, MS-CAPI or simply CAPI) is an application programming interface included with Microsoft Windows operating systems that provides services to enable developers to secure Windows-based applications using cryptography. It is a set of dynamically linked libraries that provides an abstraction layer which isolates programmers from the code used to encrypt the data. The Crypto API was first introduced in Windows NT 4.0 and enhanced in subsequent versions.\nCryptoAPI supports both public-key and symmetric key cryptography, though persistent symmetric keys are not supported. It includes functionality for encrypting and decrypting data and for authentication using digital certificates. It also includes a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator function CryptGenRandom.\nCryptoAPI works with a number of CSPs (Cryptographic Service Providers) installed on the machine. CSPs are the modules that do the actual work of encoding and decoding data by performing the cryptographic functions. Vendors of HSMs may supply a CSP which works with their hardware.\n\n\n\n== Cryptography API: Next Generation ==\nWindows Vista features an update to the Crypto API known as Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG). It has better API factoring to allow the same functions to work using a wide range of cryptographic algorithms, and includes a number of newer algorithms that are part of the National Security Agency (NSA) Suite B. It is also flexible, featuring support for plugging custom cryptographic APIs into the CNG runtime. However, CNG Key Storage Providers still do not support symmetric keys. CNG works in both user and kernel mode, and also supports all of the algorithms from the CryptoAPI. The Microsoft provider that implements CNG is housed in Bcrypt.dll.\nCNG also supports elliptic curve cryptography which, because it uses shorter keys for the same expected level of security, is more efficient than RSA. The CNG API integrates with the smart card subsystem by including a Base Smart Card Cryptographic Service Provider (Base CSP) module which encapsulates the smart card API. Smart card manufacturers just have to make their devices compatible with this, rather than provide a from-scratch solution.\nCNG also adds support for Dual_EC_DRBG, a pseudorandom number generator defined in NIST SP 800-90A that could expose the user to eavesdropping by the National Security Agency since it contains a kleptographic backdoor, unless the developer remembers to generate new base points with a different cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator or a true random number generator and then publish the generated seed in order to remove the NSA backdoor. It is also very slow. It is only used when called for explicitly.\nCNG also replaces the default PRNG with CTR_DRBG using AES as the block cipher, because the earlier RNG which is defined in the now superseded FIPS 186-2 is based on either DES or SHA-1, both which have been broken. CTR_DRBG is one of the two algorithms in NIST SP 800-90 endorsed by Schneier, the other being Hash_DRBG.\n\nWhat is the Microsoft Cryptographic Application Programming Interface (CryptoAPI) and what is its purpose?Q: What are Cryptographic Service Providers (CSPs) in the context of CryptoAPI?Q: What is Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG) and what are its advantages over the traditional CryptoAPI?Q: What is the role of Bcrypt.dll in CNG?Q: What is the Base Smart Card Cryptographic Service Provider (Base CSP) in CNG and what is its purpose?Q: What is Dual_EC_DRBG and what are its potential issues?Q: What is the default Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG) in CNG and what was it replaced with?Q: What is CTR_DRBG and why was it chosen as the default PRNG in CNG?Q: Does CNG support symmetric keys?Q: What is the purpose of the introduction of CNG in Windows Vista?Q: How does CNG support plugging custom cryptographic APIs into the CNG runtime?Q: What is the role of the CNG API in the smart card subsystem?Q: What is the difference between CNG and the traditional CryptoAPI in terms of the algorithms they support?Q: How does CNG handle the storage of symmetric keys?Q: How does CNG address the security concerns associated with Dual\\_EC\\_DRBG?",

      "context": "Microsoft CryptoAPI\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Microsoft Windows platform specific Cryptographic Application Programming Interface (also known variously as CryptoAPI, Microsoft Cryptography API, MS-CAPI or simply CAPI) is an application programming interface included with Microsoft Windows operating systems that provides services to enable developers to secure Windows-based applications using cryptography. It is a set of dynamically linked libraries that provides an abstraction layer which isolates programmers from the code used to encrypt the data. The Crypto API was first introduced in Windows NT 4.0 and enhanced in subsequent versions.\nCryptoAPI supports both public-key and symmetric key cryptography, though persistent symmetric keys are not supported. It includes functionality for encrypting and decrypting data and for authentication using digital certificates. It also includes a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator function CryptGenRandom.\nCryptoAPI works with a number of CSPs (Cryptographic Service Providers) installed on the machine. CSPs are the modules that do the actual work of encoding and decoding data by performing the cryptographic functions. Vendors of HSMs may supply a CSP which works with their hardware.\n\n\n\n== Cryptography API: Next Generation ==\nWindows Vista features an update to the Crypto API known as Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG). It has better API factoring to allow the same functions to work using a wide range of cryptographic algorithms, and includes a number of newer algorithms that are part of the National Security Agency (NSA) Suite B. It is also flexible, featuring support for plugging custom cryptographic APIs into the CNG runtime. However, CNG Key Storage Providers still do not support symmetric keys. CNG works in both user and kernel mode, and also supports all of the algorithms from the CryptoAPI. The Microsoft provider that implements CNG is housed in Bcrypt.dll.\nCNG also supports elliptic curve cryptography which, because it uses shorter keys for the same expected level of security, is more efficient than RSA. The CNG API integrates with the smart card subsystem by including a Base Smart Card Cryptographic Service Provider (Base CSP) module which encapsulates the smart card API. Smart card manufacturers just have to make their devices compatible with this, rather than provide a from-scratch solution.\nCNG also adds support for Dual_EC_DRBG, a pseudorandom number generator defined in NIST SP 800-90A that could expose the user to eavesdropping by the National Security Agency since it contains a kleptographic backdoor, unless the developer remembers to generate new base points with a different cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator or a true random number generator and then publish the generated seed in order to remove the NSA backdoor. It is also very slow. It is only used when called for explicitly.\nCNG also replaces the default PRNG with CTR_DRBG using AES as the block cipher, because the earlier RNG which is defined in the now superseded FIPS 186-2 is based on either DES or SHA-1, both which have been broken.

    "instruction": "PERMIS\n\n==Introduction==\nPERMIS (PrivilEge and Role Management Infrastructure Standards) is a sophisticated policy-based authorization system that implements an enhanced version of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model. PERMIS supports the distributed assignment of both roles and attributes to users by multiple distributed attribute authorities, unlike the NIST model which assumes the centralised assignment of roles to users. PERMIS provides a cryptographically secure privilege management infrastructure (PMI) using public key encryption technologies and X.509 Attribute certificates to maintain users' attributes. PERMIS does not provide any authentication mechanism, but leaves it up to the application to determine what to use. PERMIS's strength comes from its ability to be integrated into virtually any application and any authentication scheme like Shibboleth (Internet2), Kerberos, username/passwords, Grid proxy certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).\nAs a standard RBAC system, PERMIS's main entities are \n\nan authorisation policy,\na set of users,\na set of administrators (attribute authorities) who assign roles/attributes to users,\na set of resources that are to be protected,\na set of actions on resources,\na set of access control rules,\nand optional obligations and constraints.The PERMIS policy is eXtensible Markup Language (XML)-based and has rules for user-role assignments and role-privilege assignments, the latter containing optional obligations that are returned to the application when a user is granted access to a resource. A PERMIS policy can be stored as either a simple text XML file, or as an attribute within a signed X.509 attribute certificate to provide integrity protection and tampering detection. User roles and attributes may be held in secure signed X.509 attributes certificates, and stored in Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directories or Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) repositories, or they may be created on demand as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) attribute assertions.\nThe PERMIS authorisation engine comprises two components: a Credential Validation Service that validates users' roles according to the user-role assignment rules, and the Policy Decision Point (PDP) that evaluates users' access requests according to the role-permission assignment rules (or access control rules). Access to a resource depends upon the roles/attributes assigned to the user, and the role-permission assignments, which can contain constraints based on the user's access request (e.g. \"print less than 10 pages\") and the environment (e.g. time of day). PERMIS can work in either push mode (the user attribute assignments are sent to PERMIS by the application) or in pull mode (PERMIS fetches the attribute assignments itself from LDAP/WebDAV repositories or SAML attribute authorities).\nPERMIS is unique with its support for cryptographically protecting the user attributes/roles and the policy, which guarantees their integrity and protects them from being tampered with. New features are continually being added to it, like a standard eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) interface which allows PERMIS and XACML PDPs to be seamlessly interchanged, the ability to accept SAML attribute assertions, support for dynamic delegation of authority and separation of duty policies, and the recent addition of a controlled natural language interface (in English) for writing simple PERMIS policies.\n\n\n\nQ: How does PERMIS handle the assignment of roles and attributes to users, and what is the difference with the NIST model?Question: What technologies does PERMIS use to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of users' attributes?Question: How does PERMIS enforce access control, and what are the main entities involved in this process?Question: How does PERMIS handle the integration with different authentication schemes and applications?",

PERMIS's strength comes from its ability to be integrated into virtually any application and any authentication scheme like Shibboleth (Internet2), Kerberos, username/passwords, Grid proxy certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).\nAs a standard RBAC system, PERMIS's main entities are \n\nan authorisation policy,\na set of users,\na set of administrators (attribute authorities) who assign roles/attributes to users,\na set of resources that are to be protected,\na set of actions on resources,\na set of access control rules,\nand optional obligations and constraints.The PERMIS policy is eXtensible Markup Language (XML)-based and has rules for user-role assignments and role-privilege assignments, the latter containing optional obligations that are returned to the application when a user is granted access to a resource. A PERMIS policy can be stored as either a simple text XML file, or as an attribute within a signed X.509 attribute certificate to provide integrity protection and tampering detection. User roles and attributes may be held in secure signed X.509 attributes certificates, and stored in Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directories or Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) repositories, or they may be created on demand as Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) attribute assertions.\nThe PERMIS authorisation engine comprises two components: a Credential Validation Service that validates users' roles according to the user-role assignment rules, and the Policy Decision Point (PDP) that evaluates users' access requests according to the role-permission assignment rules (or access control rules). Access to a resource depends upon the roles/attributes assigned to the user, and the role-permission assignments, which can contain constraints based on the user's access request (e.g. \"print less than 10 pages\") and the environment (e.g. time of day). PERMIS can work in either push mode (the user attribute assignments are sent to PERMIS by the application) or in pull mode (PERMIS fetches the attribute assignments itself from LDAP/WebDAV repositories or SAML attribute authorities).\nPERMIS is unique with its support for cryptographically protecting the user attributes/roles and the policy, which guarantees their integrity and protects them from being tampered with. New features are continually being added to it, like a standard eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) interface which allows PERMIS and XACML PDPs to be seamlessly interchanged, the ability to accept SAML attribute assertions, support for dynamic delegation of authority and separation of duty policies, and the recent addition of a controlled natural language interface (in English) for writing simple PERMIS policies.\n\n",
      "questions": "How does PERMIS handle the assignment of roles and attributes to users, and what is the difference with the NIST model?Question: What technologies does PERMIS use to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of users' attributes?Question: How does PERMIS enforce access control, and what are the main entities involved in this process?Question: How does PERMIS handle the integration with different authentication schemes and applications?",
      "answers": "PERMIS supports the distributed assignment of both roles and attributes to users by multiple distributed attribute authorities, unlike the NIST model which assumes the centralized assignment of roles to users. This allows for greater flexibility and scalability in large distributed systems.Answer: PERMIS uses a cryptographically secure privilege management infrastructure (PMI) that is based on public key encryption technologies and X.509 Attribute certificates. This ensures that users' attributes are protected from tampering and unauthorized access.Answer: PERMIS enforces access control using a set of access control rules that are based on the roles and attributes assigned to users, the resources that are to be protected, and the actions that can be performed on those resources. The main entities involved in this process are the authorization policy, the set of users, the set of administrators (attribute authorities), the set of resources, the set of actions, and the set of access control rules.Answer: PERMIS is designed to be highly flexible and can be integrated into virtually any application and any authentication scheme, such as Shibboleth, Kerberos, username/passwords, Grid proxy certificates, and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This allows PERMIS to be used in a wide variety of systems and environments."

    "instruction": "Here are some questions about this text: Active defense\n\n==Introduction==\nActive defense can refer to a defensive strategy in the military or cybersecurity arena.\nIn the cybersecurity arena, active defense may mean \"asymmetric defenses,\" namely defenses that increase costs to cyber-adversaries by reducing costs to cyber-defenders. For example, an active defense data protection strategy leverages dynamic data movement, distribution, and re-encryption to make data harder to attack, steal, or destroy. Prior data protection approaches relied on encryption of data at rest, which leaves data vulnerable to attacks including stealing of ciphertext, cryptographic attack, attacks on encryption keys, destruction of encrypted data, ransomware attacks, insider attacks, and others. Three ACM computing conferences have explored Moving Target Defense as a strategy for network and application-level security as well, for instance by rotating IP addresses or dynamically changing network topologies. Production implementations of MTD are provided by companies for applications including legacy systems, communications, and election security. Additionally, \"active defense measures\" are often another term used to define and refer to offensive cyber operations (OCOs) or computer network attacks (CNAs).\nSome have defined active defenses as including of deception or honeypots, which seek to confuse attackers with traps and advanced forensics. Examples of such honeypot technologies include Illusive Networks, TrapX, Cymmetria, Attivo, and others.

      "context": "Active defense\n\n==Introduction==\nActive defense can refer to a defensive strategy in the military or cybersecurity arena.\nIn the cybersecurity arena, active defense may mean \"asymmetric defenses,\" namely defenses that increase costs to cyber-adversaries by reducing costs to cyber-defenders. For example, an active defense data protection strategy leverages dynamic data movement, distribution, and re-encryption to make data harder to attack, steal, or destroy. Prior data protection approaches relied on encryption of data at rest, which leaves data vulnerable to attacks including stealing of ciphertext, cryptographic attack, attacks on encryption keys, destruction of encrypted data, ransomware attacks, insider attacks, and others. Three ACM computing conferences have explored Moving Target Defense as a strategy for network and application-level security as well, for instance by rotating IP addresses or dynamically changing network topologies. Production implementations of MTD are provided by companies for applications including legacy systems, communications, and election security. Additionally, \"active defense measures\" are often another term used to define and refer to offensive cyber operations (OCOs) or computer network attacks (CNAs).\nSome have defined active defenses as including of deception or honeypots, which seek to confuse attackers with traps and advanced forensics. Examples of such honeypot technologies include Illusive Networks, TrapX, Cymmetria, Attivo, and others.

    "instruction": "Defense strategy (computing)\n\n==Introduction==\nIn computing, defense strategy is a concept and practice used by computer designers, users, and IT personnel to reduce computer security risks.\n\n\n\n== Common strategies ==\n\n\n*** Boundary protection ***\nBoundary protection employs security measures and devices to prevent unauthorized access to computer systems (referred to as controlling the system border). The approach is based on the assumption that the attacker did not penetrate the system. Examples of this strategy include using gateways, routers, firewalls, and password checks, deleting suspicious emails/messages, and limiting physical access.\nBoundary protection is typically the main strategy for computing systems; if this type of defense is successful, no other strategies are required. This is a resource-consuming strategy with a known scope. External information system monitoring is part of boundary protection.\n\n\n*** Information System Monitoring ***\nInformation System Monitoring employs security measures to find intruders or the damage done by them. This strategy is used when the system has been penetrated, but the intruder did not gain full control. Examples of this strategy include antivirus software, applying a patch, and network behavior anomaly detection.\nThis strategy's success is based on competition of offence and defence. This is a time and resource-consuming strategy, affecting performance. The scope is variable in time. It cannot be fully successful if not supported by other strategies.\n\n\n*** Unavoidable actions ***\nUnavoidable actions employ security measures that cannot be prevented or neutralized. This strategy is based on the assumption that the system has been penetrated, but an intruder cannot prevent the defensive mechanism from being employed. Examples of this strategy include rebooting, using physical unclonable functions, and using a security switch.\n\n\n*** Secure enclave ***\nSecure enclave is a strategy that employs security measures that prevent access to some parts of the system. This strategy is used when the system has been penetrated, but an intruder cannot access its special parts. Examples of this strategy include using the Access level, using a Trusted Platform Module, using a microkernel, using Diode (unidirectional network device), and using air gaps.\nThis is a supporting strategy for boundary protection, information system monitoring and unavoidable action strategies. This is a time and resource-consuming strategy with a known scope. Even if this strategy is fully successful, it does not guarantee the overall success of the larger defense strategy.\n\n\n*** False target ***\nFalse target is a strategy that deploys non-real targets for an intruder. It is used when the system has been penetrated, but the intruder does not know the system architecture. Examples of this strategy include honeypots, virtual computers, virtual security switches, fake files, and address/password copies.\nThis is a supporting strategy for information system monitoring. It is a time-consuming strategy, and the scope is determined by the designer. It cannot be fully successful if not supported by other strategies.\n\n\n*** Moving target ***\nMoving target is a security strategy based on frequent changes of data and processes. This strategy is based on the assumption that the system has been penetrated, but the intruder does not know the architecture of the system and its processes. Examples of this strategy are regular changes of passwords or keys (cryptography), using a dynamic platform, etc.\nThis is a supporting strategy for information system monitoring. It is a time-consuming strategy, and the scope is determined by the designer. It cannot be fully successful if not supported by other strategies. Actions are activated on a scheduled basis or as a response to a detected threat.\n\n\n*** Useless information ***\nUseless information comprises  security measures to turn important information into useless data for an intruder. The strategy is based on the assumption that the system has been penetrated, but the intruder is not able to decrypt information, or does not have enough time to decrypt it. For example, encrypting the file system or using encryption software can render the data useless even if an attacker gets access to the file system, or using data masking, where sensitive data is hidden in non-sensitive data with modified content.\nThis is a supporting strategy for information system monitoring. It is a time and resource-consuming strategy, affecting performance. The scope is known. It cannot be successful if not supported by other strategies. Claude Shannon's theorems show that if the encryption key is smaller than the secured information, the information-theoretic security can not be achieved. There is only one known unbreakable cryptographic system: the one-time pad. This strategy is not generally possible to use because of the difficulties involved in exchanging one-time pads without the risk of being compromised. Other cryptographic systems are only buying time or can be broken (see Cryptographic hash function#Degree_of_difficulty). This strategy needs to be supported by the moving target or deletes strategies.\n\n\n*** Deletion ***\nDeletion is a strategy using  security measures to prevent an intruder from gaining sensitive information at all costs. The strategy is based on the assumption that the damage from information disclosure would be greater than the damage caused by deleting the information or disabling the system required to gain access to the information. The strategy is part of the data-centric security approach. Examples of this strategy include information deletion as a response to a security violation (such as unauthorized access attempts) and password resets.\nThis is a supporting strategy for information system monitoring. It is a resource-consuming strategy, and the scope is determined by the designer. It cannot be fully successful on its own since the detected intrusion is not quarantined.\n\n\n*** Information redundancy ***\nInformation redundancy is a strategy performing security measures to keep redundancy for information and using it in case of damage. The strategy is based on the assumption that finding and repairing the damage is more complicated than the restoration of the system. Examples of this strategy include using system restoration, keeping backup files,  and using a backup computer.\nThis is a supporting strategy for information system monitoring. This strategy consumes considerable resources, and the scope is known. It can be fully successful in its part.\n\n\n*** Limiting of actions made by a robot ***\nLimiting of actions made by a robot is a strategy performing security measures to limit a robot's (software bot) actions. The strategy is based on the assumption that a robot can take more actions, or create damage that a human cannot create. Examples of this strategy include using anti-spam techniques, using CAPTCHA and other human presence detection techniques, and using DOS-based defense (protection from Denial-of-service attack).\nThis is a supporting strategy for boundary protection and information system monitoring. It is a time and resource-consuming strategy, and the scope is determined by the designer. This strategy cannot be fully successful on its own.\n\n\n*** Active defense ***\nActive defense is a strategy performing security measures attacking the potential intruders. The strategy is based on the assumption that a potential intruder under attack has fewer abilities. Examples of this strategy include creating and using lists of trusted networks, devices, and applications, blocking untrusted addresses, and vendor management.\nThis is a supporting strategy for boundary protection and information system monitoring. It is a time and resource-consuming strategy, and the scope is determined by the designer. This strategy cannot be fully successful on its own.\n\n\n*** Unavoidable actions ***\nThis strategy can support any other strategy. This is a resource-consuming strategy, and the scope is determined by the designer. An implementation may have a wide impact on devices. This strategy can be fully successful, but in most cases, there is a trade-off of full system functionality for security. This strategy can be used proactively or reactively. Actions done in response to an already detected problem may be too late. Any implementation needs to be supported by the secure enclave strategy in order to prevent neutralizing action by unauthorized access to the protection mechanism.\nActions can be of the following types: \n\nPreventive actions - blocking certain functions, signals, peripheral devices, memory parts, and/or data transfers. For example: blocking audio/video recording, the sending of long messages, or secret memory access.\nCreative actions - activating certain functions, sending signals, messages, and/or data. For example: sending an alarm signal or message, or activating data copying or transfer.\nModification actions - modifying a peripheral device's functioning, or modifying the data, signals or processes of the defended system. For example, independent hardware encryption/decryption, changing accelerometer accuracy, filtering messages or words, or changing state diagram or algorithm by independent hardware.\n\nQ: How does boundary protection differ from other defense strategies in computing?q: What is the main assumption behind the information system monitoring strategy?q: How does the secure enclave strategy support other defense strategies?q: What is the goal of the moving target strategy?q: How does the deletion strategy protect sensitive information?q: What is the assumption behind the useless information strategy?q: How does the information system monitoring strategy compete with offence?q: How does the secure enclave strategy affect the overall success of the larger defense strategy?q: What is the goal of the false target strategy?q: How does the limiting of actions made by a robot strategy protect against potential threats?q: How does the active defense strategy protect against potential intruders?q: How does the unavoidable actions strategy support other defense strategies?q: What are the three types of actions that can be taken in the unavoidable actions strategy?q: How does the information redundancy strategy protect against damage?q: How does the useless information strategy affect performance?",

It involves employing security measures and devices to prevent unauthorized access to computer systems, and is based on the assumption that the attacker has not yet penetrated the system.a: The main assumption behind the information system monitoring strategy is that the system has been penetrated, but the intruder has not gained full control.a: The secure enclave strategy supports other defense strategies by employing security measures that prevent access to certain parts of the system, making it difficult for an intruder to access special parts of the system even if it has been penetrated.a: The goal of the moving target strategy is to make it difficult for an intruder to understand the architecture of the system and its processes by frequently changing data and processes.a: The deletion strategy protects sensitive information by using security measures to prevent an intruder from gaining access to it at all costs, even if it means disabling the system required to gain access.a: The useless information strategy is based on the assumption that the system has been penetrated, but the intruder is not able to decrypt information or does not have enough time to do so.a: The success of the information system monitoring strategy is based on competition of offence and defense, and it can be time and resource-consuming, affecting performance.a: Even if the secure enclave strategy is fully successful, it does not guarantee the overall success of the larger defense strategy, as it is only a supporting strategy for boundary protection, information system monitoring, and unavoidable action strategies.a: The false target strategy deploys non-real targets for an intruder in order to confuse it and make it difficult to understand the system architecture.a: The limiting of actions made by a robot strategy protects against potential threats by using security measures to limit a robot's actions and prevent it from taking more actions or creating damage that a human cannot create.a: The active defense strategy protects against potential intruders by using security measures to attack them, assuming that a potential intruder under attack has fewer abilities.a: The unavoidable actions strategy can support any other defense strategy by employing security measures that cannot be prevented or neutralized, assuming that the system has been penetrated but an intruder cannot prevent the defensive mechanism from being employed.a: The three types of actions that can be taken in the unavoidable actions strategy are preventive actions, creative actions, and modification actions.a: The information redundancy strategy protects against damage by performing security measures to keep redundancy for information and using it in case of damage, assuming that finding and repairing the damage is more complicated than the restoration of the system.a: The useless information strategy is a time and resource-consuming strategy, affecting performance, and it cannot be fully successful if not supported by other strategies."

    "instruction": "Answer questions about:\nSocial hacking\n\n==Introduction==\nSocial hacking describes the act of attempting to manipulate outcomes of social behaviour through orchestrated actions. The general function of social hacking is to gain access to restricted information or to a physical space without proper permission. Most often, social hacking attacks are achieved by impersonating an individual or group who is directly or indirectly known to the victims or by representing an individual or group in a position of authority. This is done through pre-meditated research and planning to gain victims\u2019 confidence. Social hackers take great measures to present overtones of familiarity and trustworthiness to elicit confidential or  personal information.\nSocial hacking is most commonly associated as a component of \u201csocial engineering\u201d.\nAlthough the practice involves exercising control over human behaviour rather than computers, the term \"social hacking\" is also used in reference to online behaviour and increasingly, social media activity. The technique can be used in multiple ways that affect public perception and conversely, increase public awareness of social hacking activity. However, while awareness helps reduce the volume of hacks being carried out, technology has allowed for attack tools to become more sophisticated.\n\n== Social Hacking Techniques ==\nCarrying out a social hacking attack involves looking for weaknesses in user behaviour that can be exploited through seemingly legitimate means. Three popular methods of attack include dumpster diving, role playing, and spear-phishing.\n\n\n*** Dumpster Diving ***\nSifting through garbage is a popular tactic for social hackers to recover information about the habits, activities, and interactions of organizations and individuals. Information retrieved from discarded property allows social hackers to create effective profiles of their targets. Personal contact information such as employee titles and phone numbers can be appropriated from discarded phone books or directories and used to gain further technical information such as login data and security passwords. Another advantageous find for social hackers is discarded hardware, especially hard drives that have not properly been scrubbed clean and still contain private and accurate information about corporations or individuals. Since surfing through people's curbside garbage is not a criminal offence and does not require a warrant, it is a rich resource for social hackers, as well as a legally accessible one. Dumpster diving can yield fruitful, albeit smelly, results for information seekers such as private investigators, stalkers, nosy neighbours, and the police.\n\n\n*** Roleplaying ***\nEstablishing trust by fooling people into believing in the legitimacy of a false character is one of the main tenets of social hacking. Adopting a false personality or impersonating a known figure to trick victims into sharing personal details can be done in person or via phone conversation.\n\n\n*** In person ***\nBy posing as third party maintenance workers in an office building, medical practitioners in a hospital, or one of many other forms, social hackers can get past security personnel and other employees undetected. In both examples, uniform apparel is associated with specific job functions, giving people reason to trust impersonators. A more complicated manoeuver would involve a longer planning cycle, such as taking up employment inside an organization that is being targeted for an attack.\nIn the movie Ocean's Eleven, a sophisticated crew of con artists plot an elaborate heist to rob three popular Las Vegas casinos by assimilating themselves in the everyday activities of the casinos' operations. Although the heist is executed in less than a day, the planning cycle is long and notably fastidious. An imperative function of the attack is to present credibility in the roles being impersonated, to which attention to detail is inevitably required.\n\n\n**** Tailgating ****\nTailgating is the act of following someone into a restricted space, such as an office building or an academic institution. Third party maintenance workers, or medical personnel, as mentioned above, often have limited cause to justify their credibility because of their appearances. Similar to role playing, tailgating functions around the assumption of familiarity and trust. People are less likely to react suspiciously to anyone who appears to fit into the surrounding environment, and will be even less liable to question individuals who don't call attention to themselves. Following behind someone in an unassuming fashion may even eliminate the need to establish a rapport with authorized personnel.\n\n\n*** Spear Phishing ***\nOnline social hacks include \u201cspear phishing\u201d in which hackers scam their victims into releasing sensitive information about themselves or their organization. Hackers will target individuals within specific organizations by sending emails that appear to come from trusted sources including senior officials within the organization who hold positions of authority. To appear convincing, a social hacker's email message has to establish a tone of familiarity that forestalls any suspicion on the part of its recipient. The email is designed to put forth a request for information that ties logically to the person sending it. Often, company employees will fall prey to these emails and share personal information such as phone numbers or passwords, thinking that the information transfer is taking place in a secure environment. In more sinister scenarios, the emails from hackers may be embedded with malware that infects victims\u2019 computers without their knowledge and secretly transfers private data directly to hackers. From October 2013 to December 2016, the FBI investigated just over 22,000 of these incidents involving American businesses. In total, they saw losses approaching $1.6 billion.A successful example of spear phishing was highly publicized in the news media in January 2014, when Target, a U.S.-based retailer, experienced a security breach that allowed hackers to steal customers\u2019 credit card and personal data information. Later, it was revealed that the cyber criminals were able to access Target's financial and personal data files by targeting a third party mechanical company that had access to Target's network credentials. The social implications of such a high-profile social hack affect Target's popularity as a retailer, but also consumers\u2019 trust and loyalty towards the brand.\nAnother example of Spear Phishing happened in June 2015 to Ubiquiti Networks Inc, a network technology company based in the United States. During this act of Spear Phishing Ubiquiti Networks reportedly lost over 46.7 million dollars. The hacking group sent Spear Phishing emails to employees in the finance department. These hackers sent spear phishing emails directly to the finance department's employees posing as company executives. The hackers managed to trick the employees into transferring funds to third party groups overseas. Fortunately for Ubiquiti Networks, 8.1 million dollars were recovered from the hackers.\n\n== Security ==\nAlthough Target may not have been slacking in its security, the hackers were able to infiltrate Target's network indirectly, by identifying a third party company with by access to Target's credentials. The social hack was in defrauding employees of the third party to divulge sensitive information, while the cybercrime was conducted by means of a malware infected email phishing attack. The need for vigilant online security is highlighted by cyber-attacks against corporations like Target as well as other global businesses and high-traffic websites. Even small websites are vulnerable to attacks, specifically because their security protection is presumed to be low. In Target's case, the third party mechanical company had inadequate security software which left them open to a malware attack.In a similar incident, Yahoo Mail also announced in January 2014 that their system had been hacked and a number of user email accounts had been accessed. While the origin of the cause was unclear, poor security was again at the centre of the trouble. In both cases, large corporations with assumed understanding of security policies were compromised. Also in both cases, consumer data was stolen.In a study by Orgill et al., an observation is made that \u201cit is important that each person responsible for computer security ask if their system is vulnerable to attacks by social engineers, and if so, how can the effect of a social engineering attack be mitigated.\u201d   Using strong passwords is one simple and easy method that assists in such mitigation, as is using reliable and effective anti-virus software. Other preventative measures include using different logins for services used, frequently monitoring accounts and personal data, as well as being alert to the difference between a request for help and a phishing attempt from strangers.\n\n== Ethical Hacking ==\nTo counter security breaches at the hands of social hackers as well as technical hackers, companies employ security professionals, known as ethical hackers, or more popularly, white hat hackers, to attempt to break into their systems in the same manner that social hackers would employ. Ethical hackers will leverage the same tools methods as hackers with criminal intent but with legitimate objectives. Ethical hackers evaluate security strengths and weaknesses and provide corrective options. Ethical hacking is also known as penetration testing, intrusion testing and red teaming.\n\n== Impacting Social Media ==\nThe internet affords social hackers the ability to populate content spaces without detection of suspicious behaviour.  Social hacking can also occur in environments where user-generated content is prevalent. This includes the opportunity to influence opinion polls and even to skew data beyond a point of validity. Social hacking can also be used to provide favourable reviews e.g. on product websites. It can also be used to counter negative feedback with an influx of positive responses (\"like button\") e.g. on blog or news article comment sections. Social hacking can cause damage to the online profile of a person or a brand by the simple act of accessing information that is openly available through social media channels.\n\n== Technology Appropriation ==\nTechnology appropriation can be perceived as a type of social hacking in that it involves social manipulation of a technology. It describes the effort of users to make sense of a technology within their own contexts beyond adopting its intended use. When this happens, the use of the technology can change. Adaptation of a technology can incorporate reinterpretation of its function and meaning, to the effect that the technology itself can take on a new role. Appropriation accentuates that the user adjusts the technology for his own best practice, while adaptation advises that the use sometimes changes in general. For example, advances in today's technology make it easier than ever to portray another person. This method is known as creating a \"deepfake\". A deep fake is where someone can recreate somebody else's face and voice with a computer program. It is used to fake people saying and doing things they have never done or said before. \"Public figures may be more \u201cfakeable\u201d through this method than private ones. Visually routine situations, like a press conference, are more likely to be faked than entirely novel ones.\" Deepfakes can be very dangerous in the sense that they can be used to fake what people with high authority have said such as, the president and politicians. There have been many articles and discussions over the new discovery of deepfakes such as Youtuber Shane Dawson's video, \"Conspiracy Theories with Shane Dawson\" where he talks about the conspiracy of deepfakes and what they could mean for the world today.Social hacking is also affiliated with social enterprise. Social enterprise can be represented in the form of for-profit or non-profit organizations that encourage socially responsible business strategies for long-term environmental and human well-being. The concept of socially hacking new enterprises within the existing capitalist structure is a human endeavour that encourages people to re-evaluate the social systems that we are accustomed to, in order to identify the problems that are not being addressed. New enterprises can then be created to replace the old with systems that reinforce sustainability and regenerative growth.\nHow does social hacking involve manipulation of human behavior for malicious purposes?Question: What is the relationship between social hacking and social engineering?Question: How can dumpster diving be used as a social hacking technique?Question: How can role playing be used as a social hacking technique?Question: What is tailgating and how can it be used as a social hacking technique?Question: What is spear phishing and how can it be used as a social hacking technique?Question: What was the impact of the spear phishing attack on Target in 2014?Question: How can ethical hacking be used to counter security breaches?Question: How can social hacking impact social media?Question: What is technology appropriation and how can it be related to social hacking?Question: How can advances in technology be used for social hacking?Question: How can social enterprise be related to social hacking?Question: How can spear phishing be used to defraud employees of a third party company to gain access to a targeted organization's network?Question: How can poor security contribute to social hacks against corporations?Question: How can the use of strong passwords and reliable anti-virus software assist in mitigating the effects of social engineering attacks?",

      "context": "Social hacking\n\n==Introduction==\nSocial hacking describes the act of attempting to manipulate outcomes of social behaviour through orchestrated actions. The general function of social hacking is to gain access to restricted information or to a physical space without proper permission. Most often, social hacking attacks are achieved by impersonating an individual or group who is directly or indirectly known to the victims or by representing an individual or group in a position of authority. This is done through pre-meditated research and planning to gain victims\u2019 confidence. Social hackers take great measures to present overtones of familiarity and trustworthiness to elicit confidential or  personal information.\nSocial hacking is most commonly associated as a component of \u201csocial engineering\u201d.\nAlthough the practice involves exercising control over human behaviour rather than computers, the term \"social hacking\" is also used in reference to online behaviour and increasingly, social media activity. The technique can be used in multiple ways that affect public perception and conversely, increase public awareness of social hacking activity. However, while awareness helps reduce the volume of hacks being carried out, technology has allowed for attack tools to become more sophisticated.\n\n== Social Hacking Techniques ==\nCarrying out a social hacking attack involves looking for weaknesses in user behaviour that can be exploited through seemingly legitimate means. Three popular methods of attack include dumpster diving, role playing, and spear-phishing.\n\n\n*** Dumpster Diving ***\nSifting through garbage is a popular tactic for social hackers to recover information about the habits, activities, and interactions of organizations and individuals. Information retrieved from discarded property allows social hackers to create effective profiles of their targets. Personal contact information such as employee titles and phone numbers can be appropriated from discarded phone books or directories and used to gain further technical information such as login data and security passwords. Another advantageous find for social hackers is discarded hardware, especially hard drives that have not properly been scrubbed clean and still contain private and accurate information about corporations or individuals. Since surfing through people's curbside garbage is not a criminal offence and does not require a warrant, it is a rich resource for social hackers, as well as a legally accessible one. Dumpster diving can yield fruitful, albeit smelly, results for information seekers such as private investigators, stalkers, nosy neighbours, and the police.\n\n\n*** Roleplaying ***\nEstablishing trust by fooling people into believing in the legitimacy of a false character is one of the main tenets of social hacking. Adopting a false personality or impersonating a known figure to trick victims into sharing personal details can be done in person or via phone conversation.\n\n\n*** In person ***\nBy posing as third party maintenance workers in an office building, medical practitioners in a hospital, or one of many other forms, social hackers can get past security personnel and other employees undetected. In both examples, uniform apparel is associated with specific job functions, giving people reason to trust impersonators. A more complicated manoeuver would involve a longer planning cycle, such as taking up employment inside an organization that is being targeted for an attack.\nIn the movie Ocean's Eleven, a sophisticated crew of con artists plot an elaborate heist to rob three popular Las Vegas casinos by assimilating themselves in the everyday activities of the casinos' operations. Although the heist is executed in less than a day, the planning cycle is long and notably fastidious. An imperative function of the attack is to present credibility in the roles being impersonated, to which attention to detail is inevitably required.\n\n\n**** Tailgating ****\nTailgating is the act of following someone into a restricted space, such as an office building or an academic institution. Third party maintenance workers, or medical personnel, as mentioned above, often have limited cause to justify their credibility because of their appearances. Similar to role playing, tailgating functions around the assumption of familiarity and trust. People are less likely to react suspiciously to anyone who appears to fit into the surrounding environment, and will be even less liable to question individuals who don't call attention to themselves. Following behind someone in an unassuming fashion may even eliminate the need to establish a rapport with authorized personnel.\n\n\n*** Spear Phishing ***\nOnline social hacks include \u201cspear phishing\u201d in which hackers scam their victims into releasing sensitive information about themselves or their organization. Hackers will target individuals within specific organizations by sending emails that appear to come from trusted sources including senior officials within the organization who hold positions of authority. To appear convincing, a social hacker's email message has to establish a tone of familiarity that forestalls any suspicion on the part of its recipient. The email is designed to put forth a request for information that ties logically to the person sending it. Often, company employees will fall prey to these emails and share personal information such as phone numbers or passwords, thinking that the information transfer is taking place in a secure environment. In more sinister scenarios, the emails from hackers may be embedded with malware that infects victims\u2019 computers without their knowledge and secretly transfers private data directly to hackers. From October 2013 to December 2016, the FBI investigated just over 22,000 of these incidents involving American businesses. In total, they saw losses approaching $1.6 billion.A successful example of spear phishing was highly publicized in the news media in January 2014, when Target, a U.S.-based retailer, experienced a security breach that allowed hackers to steal customers\u2019 credit card and personal data information. Later, it was revealed that the cyber criminals were able to access Target's financial and personal data files by targeting a third party mechanical company that had access to Target's network credentials. The social implications of such a high-profile social hack affect Target's popularity as a retailer, but also consumers\u2019 trust and loyalty towards the brand.\nAnother example of Spear Phishing happened in June 2015 to Ubiquiti Networks Inc, a network technology company based in the United States. During this act of Spear Phishing Ubiquiti Networks reportedly lost over 46.7 million dollars. The hacking group sent Spear Phishing emails to employees in the finance department. These hackers sent spear phishing emails directly to the finance department's employees posing as company executives. The hackers managed to trick the employees into transferring funds to third party groups overseas. Fortunately for Ubiquiti Networks, 8.1 million dollars were recovered from the hackers.\n\n== Security ==\nAlthough Target may not have been slacking in its security, the hackers were able to infiltrate Target's network indirectly, by identifying a third party company with by access to Target's credentials. The social hack was in defrauding employees of the third party to divulge sensitive information, while the cybercrime was conducted by means of a malware infected email phishing attack. The need for vigilant online security is highlighted by cyber-attacks against corporations like Target as well as other global businesses and high-traffic websites. Even small websites are vulnerable to attacks, specifically because their security protection is presumed to be low. In Target's case, the third party mechanical company had inadequate security software which left them open to a malware attack.In a similar incident, Yahoo Mail also announced in January 2014 that their system had been hacked and a number of user email accounts had been accessed. While the origin of the cause was unclear, poor security was again at the centre of the trouble. In both cases, large corporations with assumed understanding of security policies were compromised. Also in both cases, consumer data was stolen.In a study by Orgill et al., an observation is made that \u201cit is important that each person responsible for computer security ask if their system is vulnerable to attacks by social engineers, and if so, how can the effect of a social engineering attack be mitigated.\u201d   Using strong passwords is one simple and easy method that assists in such mitigation, as is using reliable and effective anti-virus software. Other preventative measures include using different logins for services used, frequently monitoring accounts and personal data, as well as being alert to the difference between a request for help and a phishing attempt from strangers.\n\n== Ethical Hacking ==\nTo counter security breaches at the hands of social hackers as well as technical hackers, companies employ security professionals, known as ethical hackers, or more popularly, white hat hackers, to attempt to break into their systems in the same manner that social hackers would employ. Ethical hackers will leverage the same tools methods as hackers with criminal intent but with legitimate objectives. Ethical hackers evaluate security strengths and weaknesses and provide corrective options. Ethical hacking is also known as penetration testing, intrusion testing and red teaming.\n\n== Impacting Social Media ==\nThe internet affords social hackers the ability to populate content spaces without detection of suspicious behaviour.  Social hacking can also occur in environments where user-generated content is prevalent. This includes the opportunity to influence opinion polls and even to skew data beyond a point of validity. Social hacking can also be used to provide favourable reviews e.g. on product websites. It can also be used to counter negative feedback with an influx of positive responses (\"like button\") e.g. on blog or news article comment sections. Social hacking can cause damage to the online profile of a person or a brand by the simple act of accessing information that is openly available through social media channels.\n\n== Technology Appropriation ==\nTechnology appropriation can be perceived as a type of social hacking in that it involves social manipulation of a technology. It describes the effort of users to make sense of a technology within their own contexts beyond adopting its intended use. When this happens, the use of the technology can change. Adaptation of a technology can incorporate reinterpretation of its function and meaning, to the effect that the technology itself can take on a new role. Appropriation accentuates that the user adjusts the technology for his own best practice, while adaptation advises that the use sometimes changes in general. For example, advances in today's technology make it easier than ever to portray another person. This method is known as creating a \"deepfake\". A deep fake is where someone can recreate somebody else's face and voice with a computer program. It is used to fake people saying and doing things they have never done or said before. \"Public figures may be more \u201cfakeable\u201d through this method than private ones. Visually routine situations, like a press conference, are more likely to be faked than entirely novel ones.\" Deepfakes can be very dangerous in the sense that they can be used to fake what people with high authority have said such as, the president and politicians. There have been many articles and discussions over the new discovery of deepfakes such as Youtuber Shane Dawson's video, \"Conspiracy Theories with Shane Dawson\" where he talks about the conspiracy of deepfakes and what they could mean for the world today.Social hacking is also affiliated with social enterprise. Social enterprise can be represented in the form of for-profit or non-profit organizations that encourage socially responsible business strategies for long-term environmental and human well-being. The concept of socially hacking new enterprises within the existing capitalist structure is a human endeavour that encourages people to re-evaluate the social systems that we are accustomed to, in order to identify the problems that are not being addressed. New enterprises can then be created to replace the old with systems that reinforce sustainability and regenerative growth.",

    "instruction": "Context: Zhenhua Data leak\n\n==Introduction==\nShenzhen Zhenhua Data Information Technology Co is a big data scraping company that provides open-source intelligence profiling and threat intelligence services. The company is reported to be owned by China Zhenhua Electronics Group, which is owned by China Electronics Corporation  (CEC), a state-owned military research enterprise. While the data Zhenhua uses is publicly available data, Zhenhua's usage of that data is a security concern to western countries. The company claims to work with the Chinese government, including Chinese intelligence agencies and the military. Zhenhua Data's CEO has publicly supported \"hybrid warfare\" and \"psychological warfare\". Winston Peters, the Foreign Affairs Minister of New Zealand, stated that it would be 'naive' to think there was no connection to the Chinese state.In September 2020, a data leak revealed that Zhenhua was globally monitoring over 2.4 million people. The databases, collectively called the Overseas Key Information Database (OKIDB), was leaked to an American academic who shared the data with Internet 2.0, an Australian-based cybersecurity consultancy. On 14 September 2020, a consortium of media outlets published the findings. Researchers found out that about 20% of the data was not from open source locations. Investigation by journalists in New Zealand found that some people with no online presence were profiled in the database.There have been \"conflicting assessments\" of the value of the data, from it being an entirely \"aspirational\" venture, to it being a small peek into the world of hybrid warfare and psychological warfare being waged by the Chinese.Internet 2.0 recovered a quarter of a million people from OKIDB, including about 52,000 Americans, 35,000 Australians and 10,000 Britons. Prominent people in the database include prime ministers Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison, the President of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen and their families. One of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n's children appears on the list as well. Australians in the database include Natalie Imbruglia, Larry Anthony, Emma Husar, Ellen Whinnett  and Junaid Thorne. Around 10,000 people and organisations from India were also on the list, including senior India diplomats such as Harsh Vardhan Shringla and Sanjeev Singla, policymakers such as Amitabh Kant, academics such as Romila Thapar, and sportspeople  such as Sachin Tendulkar. Numerous Indian think-tanks were also being monitored.A threat intelligence organisation published a report on Zhenhua Data's operation and found a number of monitoring systems that were publicly accessible.  The report found real-time monitoring of social media such as LinkedIn, TikTok, Facebook, Twitter and online forums, and discovered an \"Internet Big Data Military Intelligence System\". This system tracks US warships in real-time and profiles the personnel on board, weapons being carried, LinkedIn profiles etc. This may be related to a previous story published by the NYT titled \"How China Uses LinkedIn to Recruit Spies Abroad\". The firm also found keywords that were being used to target US Embassy-supported activists in Hong Kong, which included political organisations, famous events and protestors.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow answer the following questions: How is Zhenhua Data's open-source intelligence profiling and threat intelligence services linked to the Chinese government, including Chinese intelligence agencies and the military?question: What is the significance of the data leak of Zhenhua Data's Overseas Key Information Database (OKIDB) and its potential impact on individuals and organizations being monitored?question: How does Zhenhua Data's data collection methods and usage of data differ from traditional data scraping companies?",

      "context": "Zhenhua Data leak\n\n==Introduction==\nShenzhen Zhenhua Data Information Technology Co is a big data scraping company that provides open-source intelligence profiling and threat intelligence services. The company is reported to be owned by China Zhenhua Electronics Group, which is owned by China Electronics Corporation  (CEC), a state-owned military research enterprise. While the data Zhenhua uses is publicly available data, Zhenhua's usage of that data is a security concern to western countries. The company claims to work with the Chinese government, including Chinese intelligence agencies and the military. Zhenhua Data's CEO has publicly supported \"hybrid warfare\" and \"psychological warfare\". Winston Peters, the Foreign Affairs Minister of New Zealand, stated that it would be 'naive' to think there was no connection to the Chinese state.In September 2020, a data leak revealed that Zhenhua was globally monitoring over 2.4 million people. The databases, collectively called the Overseas Key Information Database (OKIDB), was leaked to an American academic who shared the data with Internet 2.0, an Australian-based cybersecurity consultancy. On 14 September 2020, a consortium of media outlets published the findings. Researchers found out that about 20% of the data was not from open source locations. Investigation by journalists in New Zealand found that some people with no online presence were profiled in the database.There have been \"conflicting assessments\" of the value of the data, from it being an entirely \"aspirational\" venture, to it being a small peek into the world of hybrid warfare and psychological warfare being waged by the Chinese.Internet 2.0 recovered a quarter of a million people from OKIDB, including about 52,000 Americans, 35,000 Australians and 10,000 Britons. Prominent people in the database include prime ministers Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison, the President of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen and their families. One of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n's children appears on the list as well. Australians in the database include Natalie Imbruglia, Larry Anthony, Emma Husar, Ellen Whinnett  and Junaid Thorne. Around 10,000 people and organisations from India were also on the list, including senior India diplomats such as Harsh Vardhan Shringla and Sanjeev Singla, policymakers such as Amitabh Kant, academics such as Romila Thapar, and sportspeople  such as Sachin Tendulkar. Numerous Indian think-tanks were also being monitored.A threat intelligence organisation published a report on Zhenhua Data's operation and found a number of monitoring systems that were publicly accessible.  The report found real-time monitoring of social media such as LinkedIn, TikTok, Facebook, Twitter and online forums, and discovered an \"Internet Big Data Military Intelligence System\". This system tracks US warships in real-time and profiles the personnel on board, weapons being carried, LinkedIn profiles etc. This may be related to a previous story published by the NYT titled \"How China Uses LinkedIn to Recruit Spies Abroad\". The firm also found keywords that were being used to target US Embassy-supported activists in Hong Kong, which included political organisations, famous events and protestors.\n\n\n\n",

The leak of this information poses a significant security concern, as it reveals the extent to which Zhenhua Data was collecting and potentially using this information for malicious purposes. The company's real-time monitoring of social media and discovery of an \"Internet Big Data Military Intelligence System\" also raises concerns about the potential for espionage and targeted attacks against individuals and organizations.answer: Zhenhua Data differs from traditional data scraping companies in several ways. While Zhenhua Data collects publicly available data, their usage of that data raises security concerns for western countries, as the company is reported to be owned by China Zhenhua Electronics Group, which is owned by China Electronics Corporation (CEC), a state-owned military research enterprise. This means that the data collected by Zhenhua Data may be used for purposes beyond what is traditionally associated with data scraping, such as hybrid warfare and psychological warfare. Additionally, Zhenhua Data's CEO has publicly supported these tactics and the company claims to work with the Chinese government, including Chinese intelligence agencies and the military. The company's Overseas Key Information Database (OKIDB) was found to contain information on over 2.4 million people, including prominent political figures and senior diplomats, which raises concerns about the potential for espionage and targeted attacks. Zhenhua Data's real-time monitoring of social media and discovery of an \"Internet Big Data Military Intelligence System\" also sets them apart from traditional data scraping companies."

    "instruction": "SHA-2\n\n==Introduction==\nSHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and first published in 2001. They are built using the Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction, from a one-way compression function itself built using the Davies\u2013Meyer structure from a specialized block cipher.\nSHA-2 includes significant changes from its predecessor, SHA-1. The SHA-2 family consists of six hash functions with digests (hash values) that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256. SHA-256 and SHA-512 are novel hash functions computed with eight 32-bit and 64-bit words, respectively. They use different shift amounts and additive constants, but their structures are otherwise virtually identical, differing only in the number of rounds. SHA-224 and SHA-384 are truncated versions of SHA-256 and SHA-512 respectively, computed with different initial values. SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 are also truncated versions of SHA-512, but the initial values are generated using the method described in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) PUB 180-4.\nSHA-2 was first published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a U.S. federal standard. The SHA-2 family of algorithms are patented in the U.S.. The United States has released the patent under a royalty-free license.As of 2011, the best public attacks break preimage resistance for 52 out of 64 rounds of SHA-256 or 57 out of 80 rounds of SHA-512, and collision resistance for 46 out of 64 rounds of SHA-256.\n\n== Hash standard ==\n\nWith the publication of FIPS PUB 180-2, NIST added three additional hash functions in the SHA family. The algorithms are collectively known as SHA-2, named after their digest lengths (in bits): SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.\nThe algorithms were first published in 2001 in the draft FIPS PUB 180-2, at which time public review and comments were accepted. In August 2002, FIPS PUB 180-2 became the new Secure Hash Standard, replacing FIPS PUB 180-1, which was released in April 1995. The updated standard included the original SHA-1 algorithm, with updated technical notation consistent with that describing the inner workings of the SHA-2 family.In February 2004, a change notice was published for FIPS PUB 180-2, specifying an additional variant, SHA-224, defined to match the key length of two-key Triple DES. In October 2008, the standard was updated in FIPS PUB 180-3, including SHA-224 from the change notice, but otherwise making no fundamental changes to the standard. The primary motivation for updating the standard was relocating security information about the hash algorithms and recommendations for their use to Special Publications 800-107 and 800-57. Detailed test data and example message digests were also removed from the standard, and provided as separate documents.In January 2011, NIST published SP800-131A, which specified a move from the then-current minimum of 80-bit security (provided by SHA-1) allowable for federal government use until the end of 2013, to 112-bit security (provided by SHA-2) being both the minimum requirement (starting in 2014) and the recommended security level (starting from the publication date in 2011).In March 2012, the standard was updated in FIPS PUB 180-4, adding the hash functions SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256, and describing a method for generating initial values for truncated versions of SHA-512. Additionally, a restriction on padding the input data prior to hash calculation was removed, allowing hash data to be calculated simultaneously with content generation, such as a real-time video or audio feed. Padding the final data block must still occur prior to hash output.In July 2012, NIST revised SP800-57, which provides guidance for cryptographic key management. The publication disallowed creation of digital signatures with a hash security lower than 112 bits after 2013. The previous revision from 2007 specified the cutoff to be the end of 2010. In August 2012, NIST revised SP800-107 in the same manner.The NIST hash function competition selected a new hash function, SHA-3, in 2012. The SHA-3 algorithm is not derived from SHA-2.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nThe SHA-2 hash function is implemented in some widely used security applications and protocols, including TLS and SSL, PGP, SSH, S/MIME, and IPsec.\nSHA-256 is used for authenticating Debian software packages and in the DKIM message signing standard; SHA-512 is part of a system to authenticate archival video from the International Criminal Tribunal of the Rwandan genocide. SHA-256 and SHA-512 are proposed for use in DNSSEC. Unix and Linux vendors are moving to using 256- and 512-bit SHA-2 for secure password hashing.Several cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, use SHA-256 for verifying transactions and calculating proof of work or proof of stake. The rise of ASIC SHA-2 accelerator chips has led to the use of scrypt-based proof-of-work schemes.\nSHA-1 and SHA-2 are the Secure Hash Algorithms required by law for use in certain U.S. Government applications, including use within other cryptographic algorithms and protocols, for the protection of sensitive unclassified information. FIPS PUB 180-1 also encouraged adoption and use of SHA-1 by private and commercial organizations. SHA-1 is being retired for most government uses; the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology says, \"Federal agencies should stop using SHA-1 for...applications that require collision resistance as soon as practical, and must use the SHA-2 family of hash functions for these applications after 2010\" (emphasis in original). NIST's directive that U.S. government agencies ought to, but not explicitly must, stop uses of SHA-1 after 2010 was hoped to accelerate migration away from SHA-1.\nThe SHA-2 functions were not quickly adopted initially, despite better security than SHA-1. Reasons might include lack of support for SHA-2 on systems running Windows XP SP2 or older and a lack of perceived urgency since SHA-1 collisions had not yet been found. The Google Chrome team announced a plan to make their web browser gradually stop honoring SHA-1-dependent TLS certificates over a period from late 2014 and early 2015. Similarly, Microsoft announced that Internet Explorer and Edge would stop honoring public SHA-1-signed TLS certificates from February 2017. Mozilla disabled SHA-1 in early January 2016, but had to re-enable it temporarily via a Firefox update, after problems with web-based user interfaces of some router models and security appliances.\n\n== Cryptanalysis and validation ==\nFor a hash function for which L is the number of bits in the message digest, finding a message that corresponds to a given message digest can always be done using a brute force search in 2L evaluations. This is called a preimage attack and may or may not be practical depending on L and the particular computing environment. The second criterion, finding two different messages that produce the same message digest, known as a collision, requires on average only 2L/2 evaluations using a birthday attack.\nSome of the applications that use cryptographic hashes, such as password storage, are only minimally affected by a collision attack. Constructing a password that works for a given account requires a preimage attack, as well as access to the hash of the original password (typically in the shadow file) which may or may not be trivial. Reversing password encryption (e.g., to obtain a password to try against a user's account elsewhere) is not made possible by the attacks. (However, even a secure password hash cannot prevent brute-force attacks on weak passwords.)\nIn the case of document signing, an attacker could not simply fake a signature from an existing document\u2014the attacker would have to produce a pair of documents, one innocuous and one damaging, and get the private key holder to sign the innocuous document. There are practical circumstances in which this is possible; until the end of 2008, it was possible to create forged SSL certificates using an MD5 collision which would be accepted by widely used web browsers.Increased interest in cryptographic hash analysis during the SHA-3 competition produced several new attacks on the SHA-2 family, the best of which are given in the table below. Only the collision attacks are of practical complexity; none of the attacks extend to the full round hash function.\nAt FSE 2012, researchers at Sony gave a presentation suggesting pseudo-collision attacks could be extended to 52 rounds on SHA-256 and 57 rounds on SHA-512 by building upon the biclique pseudo-preimage attack.\n\n\n*** Official validation ***\n\nImplementations of all FIPS-approved security functions can be officially validated through the CMVP program, jointly run by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Communications Security Establishment (CSE). For informal verification, a package to generate a high number of test vectors is made available for download on the NIST site; the resulting verification, however, does not replace the formal CMVP validation, which is required by law for certain applications.\nAs of December 2013, there are over 1300 validated implementations of SHA-256 and over 900 of SHA-512, with only 5 of them being capable of handling messages with a length in bits not a multiple of eight while supporting both variants.\n\n== Test vectors ==\nHash values of an empty string (i.e., a zero-length input text).\n\nSHA224(\"\")\n0x d14a028c2a3a2bc9476102bb288234c415a2b01f828ea62ac5b3e42f\nSHA256(\"\")\n0x e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855\nSHA384(\"\")\n0x 38b060a751ac96384cd9327eb1b1e36a21fdb71114be07434c0cc7bf63f6e1da274edebfe76f65fbd51ad2f14898b95b\nSHA512(\"\")\n0x cf83e1357eefb8bdf1542850d66d8007d620e4050b5715dc83f4a921d36ce9ce47d0d13c5d85f2b0ff8318d2877eec2f63b931bd47417a81a538327af927da3e\nSHA512/224(\"\")\n0x 6ed0dd02806fa89e25de060c19d3ac86cabb87d6a0ddd05c333b84f4\nSHA512/256(\"\")\n0x c672b8d1ef56ed28ab87c3622c5114069bdd3ad7b8f9737498d0c01ecef0967a\n\nEven a small change in the message will (with overwhelming probability) result in a different hash, due to the avalanche effect. For example, adding a period to the end of the following sentence changes almost half (111 out of 224) of the bits in the hash, equivalent to picking a new hash at random:\n\nSHA224(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\")\n0x 730e109bd7a8a32b1cb9d9a09aa2325d2430587ddbc0c38bad911525\nSHA224(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\")\n0x 619cba8e8e05826e9b8c519c0a5c68f4fb653e8a3d8aa04bb2c8cd4c\n\n== Pseudocode ==\nPseudocode for the SHA-256 algorithm follows. Note the great increase in mixing between bits of the w[16..63] words compared to SHA-1.\n\nNote 1: All variables are 32 bit unsigned integers and addition is calculated modulo 232\nNote 2: For each round, there is one round constant k[i] and one entry in the message schedule array w[i], 0 \u2264 i \u2264 63\nNote 3: The compression function uses 8 working variables, a through h\nNote 4: Big-endian convention is used when expressing the constants in this pseudocode,\n    and when parsing message block data from bytes to words, for example,\n    the first word of the input message \"abc\" after padding is 0x61626380\n\nInitialize hash values:\n(first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the square roots of the first 8 primes 2..19):\nh0 :\n\n== Comparison of SHA functions ==\nIn the table below, internal state means the \"internal hash sum\" after each compression of a data block.\n\nIn the bitwise operations column, \"Rot\" stands for rotate no carry, and \"Shr\" stands for right logical shift. All of these algorithms employ modular addition in some fashion except for SHA-3.\nMore detailed performance measurements on modern processor architectures are given in the table below.\n\nThe performance numbers labeled 'x86' were running using 32-bit code on 64-bit processors, whereas the 'x86-64' numbers are native 64-bit code. While SHA-256 is designed for 32-bit calculations, it does benefit from code optimized for 64-bit processors on the x86 architecture. 32-bit implementations of SHA-512 are significantly slower than their 64-bit counterparts. Variants of both algorithms with different output sizes will perform similarly, since the message expansion and compression functions are identical, and only the initial hash values and output sizes are different. The best implementations of MD5 and SHA-1 perform between 4.5 and 6 cycles per byte on modern processors.\nTesting was performed by the University of Illinois at Chicago on their hydra8 system running an Intel Xeon E3-1275 V2 at a clock speed of 3.5 GHz, and on their hydra9 system running an AMD A10-5800K APU at a clock speed of 3.8 GHz. The referenced cycles per byte speeds above are the median performance of an algorithm digesting a 4,096 byte message using the SUPERCOP cryptographic benchmarking software. The MiB/s performance is extrapolated from the CPU clockspeed on a single core; real-world performance will vary due to a variety of factors.\n\n== Implementations ==\nBelow is a list of cryptography libraries that support SHA-2:\n\nBotan\nBouncy Castle\nCryptlib\nCrypto++\nLibgcrypt\nMbed TLS\nlibsodium\nNettle\nLibreSSL\nOpenSSL\nGnuTLS\nwolfSSLHardware acceleration is provided by the following processor extensions:\n\nIntel SHA extensions: Available on some Intel and AMD x86 processors.\nVIA PadLock\nARMv8 Cryptography Extensions \nIBM z/Architecture:  Available since 2005 as part of the Message-Security-Assist Extensions 1 (SHA-256) and 2 (SHA-512)\nIBM Power ISA since v.2.07\nWhat is the significance of the number of bits in the message digest for a hash function?question: How does the birthday attack impact the security of cryptographic hash functions?question: What are the implications of a collision attack on password storage?question: How does the SHA-2 family of hash functions compare to SHA-1 in terms of security?question: What are some factors that might have contributed to the slow adoption of the SHA-2 functions initially?question: What is the significance of the restriction on padding the input data prior to hash calculation in the SHA-2 family of hash functions?question: How does the avalanche effect impact the security of hash functions?question: What are some examples of applications that use the SHA-2 hash function?question: How does the CMVP program provide official validation for implementations of FIPS-approved security functions?question: What is the significance of the number of validated implementations of SHA-256 and SHA-512?question: How does the performance of SHA-256 and SHA-512 compare to other hash functions on different processor architectures?question: What are some cryptography libraries that support SHA-2?question: How do hardware acceleration extensions provide performance benefits for SHA-2?question: What are some factors that can affect real-world performance of hash functions?question: How does the SHA-2 family of hash functions compare to SHA-3 in terms of design and security?",

      "context": "SHA-2\n\n==Introduction==\nSHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) and first published in 2001. They are built using the Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction, from a one-way compression function itself built using the Davies\u2013Meyer structure from a specialized block cipher.\nSHA-2 includes significant changes from its predecessor, SHA-1. The SHA-2 family consists of six hash functions with digests (hash values) that are 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, SHA-512/256. SHA-256 and SHA-512 are novel hash functions computed with eight 32-bit and 64-bit words, respectively. They use different shift amounts and additive constants, but their structures are otherwise virtually identical, differing only in the number of rounds. SHA-224 and SHA-384 are truncated versions of SHA-256 and SHA-512 respectively, computed with different initial values. SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 are also truncated versions of SHA-512, but the initial values are generated using the method described in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) PUB 180-4.\nSHA-2 was first published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a U.S. federal standard. The SHA-2 family of algorithms are patented in the U.S.. The United States has released the patent under a royalty-free license.As of 2011, the best public attacks break preimage resistance for 52 out of 64 rounds of SHA-256 or 57 out of 80 rounds of SHA-512, and collision resistance for 46 out of 64 rounds of SHA-256.\n\n== Hash standard ==\n\nWith the publication of FIPS PUB 180-2, NIST added three additional hash functions in the SHA family. The algorithms are collectively known as SHA-2, named after their digest lengths (in bits): SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.\nThe algorithms were first published in 2001 in the draft FIPS PUB 180-2, at which time public review and comments were accepted. In August 2002, FIPS PUB 180-2 became the new Secure Hash Standard, replacing FIPS PUB 180-1, which was released in April 1995. The updated standard included the original SHA-1 algorithm, with updated technical notation consistent with that describing the inner workings of the SHA-2 family.In February 2004, a change notice was published for FIPS PUB 180-2, specifying an additional variant, SHA-224, defined to match the key length of two-key Triple DES. In October 2008, the standard was updated in FIPS PUB 180-3, including SHA-224 from the change notice, but otherwise making no fundamental changes to the standard. The primary motivation for updating the standard was relocating security information about the hash algorithms and recommendations for their use to Special Publications 800-107 and 800-57. Detailed test data and example message digests were also removed from the standard, and provided as separate documents.In January 2011, NIST published SP800-131A, which specified a move from the then-current minimum of 80-bit security (provided by SHA-1) allowable for federal government use until the end of 2013, to 112-bit security (provided by SHA-2) being both the minimum requirement (starting in 2014) and the recommended security level (starting from the publication date in 2011).In March 2012, the standard was updated in FIPS PUB 180-4, adding the hash functions SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256, and describing a method for generating initial values for truncated versions of SHA-512. Additionally, a restriction on padding the input data prior to hash calculation was removed, allowing hash data to be calculated simultaneously with content generation, such as a real-time video or audio feed. Padding the final data block must still occur prior to hash output.In July 2012, NIST revised SP800-57, which provides guidance for cryptographic key management. The publication disallowed creation of digital signatures with a hash security lower than 112 bits after 2013. The previous revision from 2007 specified the cutoff to be the end of 2010. In August 2012, NIST revised SP800-107 in the same manner.The NIST hash function competition selected a new hash function, SHA-3, in 2012. The SHA-3 algorithm is not derived from SHA-2.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nThe SHA-2 hash function is implemented in some widely used security applications and protocols, including TLS and SSL, PGP, SSH, S/MIME, and IPsec.\nSHA-256 is used for authenticating Debian software packages and in the DKIM message signing standard; SHA-512 is part of a system to authenticate archival video from the International Criminal Tribunal of the Rwandan genocide. SHA-256 and SHA-512 are proposed for use in DNSSEC. Unix and Linux vendors are moving to using 256- and 512-bit SHA-2 for secure password hashing.Several cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, use SHA-256 for verifying transactions and calculating proof of work or proof of stake. The rise of ASIC SHA-2 accelerator chips has led to the use of scrypt-based proof-of-work schemes.\nSHA-1 and SHA-2 are the Secure Hash Algorithms required by law for use in certain U.S. Government applications, including use within other cryptographic algorithms and protocols, for the protection of sensitive unclassified information. FIPS PUB 180-1 also encouraged adoption and use of SHA-1 by private and commercial organizations. SHA-1 is being retired for most government uses; the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology says, \"Federal agencies should stop using SHA-1 for...applications that require collision resistance as soon as practical, and must use the SHA-2 family of hash functions for these applications after 2010\" (emphasis in original). NIST's directive that U.S. government agencies ought to, but not explicitly must, stop uses of SHA-1 after 2010 was hoped to accelerate migration away from SHA-1.\nThe SHA-2 functions were not quickly adopted initially, despite better security than SHA-1. Reasons might include lack of support for SHA-2 on systems running Windows XP SP2 or older and a lack of perceived urgency since SHA-1 collisions had not yet been found. The Google Chrome team announced a plan to make their web browser gradually stop honoring SHA-1-dependent TLS certificates over a period from late 2014 and early 2015. Similarly, Microsoft announced that Internet Explorer and Edge would stop honoring public SHA-1-signed TLS certificates from February 2017. Mozilla disabled SHA-1 in early January 2016, but had to re-enable it temporarily via a Firefox update, after problems with web-based user interfaces of some router models and security appliances.\n\n== Cryptanalysis and validation ==\nFor a hash function for which L is the number of bits in the message digest, finding a message that corresponds to a given message digest can always be done using a brute force search in 2L evaluations. This is called a preimage attack and may or may not be practical depending on L and the particular computing environment. The second criterion, finding two different messages that produce the same message digest, known as a collision, requires on average only 2L/2 evaluations using a birthday attack.\nSome of the applications that use cryptographic hashes, such as password storage, are only minimally affected by a collision attack. Constructing a password that works for a given account requires a preimage attack, as well as access to the hash of the original password (typically in the shadow file) which may or may not be trivial. Reversing password encryption (e.g., to obtain a password to try against a user's account elsewhere) is not made possible by the attacks. (However, even a secure password hash cannot prevent brute-force attacks on weak passwords.)\nIn the case of document signing, an attacker could not simply fake a signature from an existing document\u2014the attacker would have to produce a pair of documents, one innocuous and one damaging, and get the private key holder to sign the innocuous document. There are practical circumstances in which this is possible; until the end of 2008, it was possible to create forged SSL certificates using an MD5 collision which would be accepted by widely used web browsers.Increased interest in cryptographic hash analysis during the SHA-3 competition produced several new attacks on the SHA-2 family, the best of which are given in the table below. Only the collision attacks are of practical complexity; none of the attacks extend to the full round hash function.\nAt FSE 2012, researchers at Sony gave a presentation suggesting pseudo-collision attacks could be extended to 52 rounds on SHA-256 and 57 rounds on SHA-512 by building upon the biclique pseudo-preimage attack.\n\n\n*** Official validation ***\n\nImplementations of all FIPS-approved security functions can be officially validated through the CMVP program, jointly run by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Communications Security Establishment (CSE). For informal verification, a package to generate a high number of test vectors is made available for download on the NIST site; the resulting verification, however, does not replace the formal CMVP validation, which is required by law for certain applications.\nAs of December 2013, there are over 1300 validated implementations of SHA-256 and over 900 of SHA-512, with only 5 of them being capable of handling messages with a length in bits not a multiple of eight while supporting both variants.\n\n== Test vectors ==\nHash values of an empty string (i.e., a zero-length input text).\n\nSHA224(\"\")\n0x d14a028c2a3a2bc9476102bb288234c415a2b01f828ea62ac5b3e42f\nSHA256(\"\")\n0x e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855\nSHA384(\"\")\n0x 38b060a751ac96384cd9327eb1b1e36a21fdb71114be07434c0cc7bf63f6e1da274edebfe76f65fbd51ad2f14898b95b\nSHA512(\"\")\n0x cf83e1357eefb8bdf1542850d66d8007d620e4050b5715dc83f4a921d36ce9ce47d0d13c5d85f2b0ff8318d2877eec2f63b931bd47417a81a538327af927da3e\nSHA512/224(\"\")\n0x 6ed0dd02806fa89e25de060c19d3ac86cabb87d6a0ddd05c333b84f4\nSHA512/256(\"\")\n0x c672b8d1ef56ed28ab87c3622c5114069bdd3ad7b8f9737498d0c01ecef0967a\n\nEven a small change in the message will (with overwhelming probability) result in a different hash, due to the avalanche effect. For example, adding a period to the end of the following sentence changes almost half (111 out of 224) of the bits in the hash, equivalent to picking a new hash at random:\n\nSHA224(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\")\n0x 730e109bd7a8a32b1cb9d9a09aa2325d2430587ddbc0c38bad911525\nSHA224(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\")\n0x 619cba8e8e05826e9b8c519c0a5c68f4fb653e8a3d8aa04bb2c8cd4c\n\n== Pseudocode ==\nPseudocode for the SHA-256 algorithm follows. Note the great increase in mixing between bits of the w[16..63] words compared to SHA-1.\n\nNote 1: All variables are 32 bit unsigned integers and addition is calculated modulo 232\nNote 2: For each round, there is one round constant k[i] and one entry in the message schedule array w[i], 0 \u2264 i \u2264 63\nNote 3: The compression function uses 8 working variables, a through h\nNote 4: Big-endian convention is used when expressing the constants in this pseudocode,\n    and when parsing message block data from bytes to words, for example,\n    the first word of the input message \"abc\" after padding is 0x61626380\n\nInitialize hash values:\n(first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the square roots of the first 8 primes 2..19):\nh0 :\n\n== Comparison of SHA functions ==\nIn the table below, internal state means the \"internal hash sum\" after each compression of a data block.\n\nIn the bitwise operations column, \"Rot\" stands for rotate no carry, and \"Shr\" stands for right logical shift. All of these algorithms employ modular addition in some fashion except for SHA-3.\nMore detailed performance measurements on modern processor architectures are given in the table below.\n\nThe performance numbers labeled 'x86' were running using 32-bit code on 64-bit processors, whereas the 'x86-64' numbers are native 64-bit code. While SHA-256 is designed for 32-bit calculations, it does benefit from code optimized for 64-bit processors on the x86 architecture. 32-bit implementations of SHA-512 are significantly slower than their 64-bit counterparts. Variants of both algorithms with different output sizes will perform similarly, since the message expansion and compression functions are identical, and only the initial hash values and output sizes are different. The best implementations of MD5 and SHA-1 perform between 4.5 and 6 cycles per byte on modern processors.\nTesting was performed by the University of Illinois at Chicago on their hydra8 system running an Intel Xeon E3-1275 V2 at a clock speed of 3.5 GHz, and on their hydra9 system running an AMD A10-5800K APU at a clock speed of 3.8 GHz. The referenced cycles per byte speeds above are the median performance of an algorithm digesting a 4,096 byte message using the SUPERCOP cryptographic benchmarking software. The MiB/s performance is extrapolated from the CPU clockspeed on a single core; real-world performance will vary due to a variety of factors.\n\n== Implementations ==\nBelow is a list of cryptography libraries that support SHA-2:\n\nBotan\nBouncy Castle\nCryptlib\nCrypto++\nLibgcrypt\nMbed TLS\nlibsodium\nNettle\nLibreSSL\nOpenSSL\nGnuTLS\nwolfSSLHardware acceleration is provided by the following processor extensions:\n\nIntel SHA extensions: Available on some Intel and AMD x86 processors.\nVIA PadLock\nARMv8 Cryptography Extensions \nIBM z/Architecture:  Available since 2005 as part of the Message-Security-Assist Extensions 1 (SHA-256) and 2 (SHA-512)\nIBM Power ISA since v.2.07",

    "instruction": "Crypto++\n\n==Introduction==\nCrypto++ (also known as CryptoPP, libcrypto++, and libcryptopp) is a free and open-source C++ class library of cryptographic algorithms and schemes written by Wei Dai. Crypto++ has been widely used in academia, student projects, open-source, and non-commercial projects, as well as businesses. Released in 1995, the library fully supports 32-bit and 64-bit architectures for many major operating systems and platforms, including Android (using STLport), Apple (macOS and iOS), BSD, Cygwin, IBM AIX, Linux, MinGW, Solaris, Windows, Windows Phone and Windows RT. The project also supports compilation using C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 runtime libraries; and a variety of compilers and IDEs, including Borland Turbo C++, Borland C++ Builder, Clang, CodeWarrior Pro, GCC (including Apple's GCC), Intel C++ Compiler (ICC), Microsoft Visual C/C++, and Sun Studio.\nCrypto++ 1.0 was released in June 1995, but the download is no longer available. The Crypto++ 1.0 release was withdrawn due to RSA Data Security, Inc asserting its patent over the RSA algorithm. All other versions of the library are available for download.\n\n\n\n== Algorithms ==\nCrypto++ ordinarily provides complete cryptographic implementations and often includes less popular, less frequently-used schemes. For example, Camellia is an ISO/NESSIE/IETF-approved block cipher roughly equivalent to AES, and Whirlpool is an ISO/NESSIE/IETF-approved hash function roughly equivalent to SHA; both are included in the library.Additionally, the Crypto++ library sometimes makes proposed and bleeding-edge algorithms and implementations available for study by the cryptographic community. For example, VMAC, a universal hash-based message authentication code, was added to the library during its submission to the Internet Engineering Task Force (CFRG Working Group); and Brainpool curves, proposed in March 2009 as an Internet Draft in RFC 5639, were added to Crypto++ 5.6.0 in the same month.\nThe library also makes available primitives for number-theoretic operations such as fast multi-precision integers; prime number generation and verification; finite field arithmetic, including GF(p) and GF(2n); elliptical curves; and polynomial operations.\nFurthermore, the library retains a collection of insecure or obsolescent algorithms for backward compatibility and historical value: MD2, MD4, MD5, Panama Hash, DES, ARC4, SEAL 3.0, WAKE, WAKE-OFB, DESX (DES-XEX3), RC2, SAFER, 3-WAY, GOST, SHARK, CAST-128, and Square.\n\n== Performance ==\nIn a 2007 ECRYPT workshop paper focusing on public key implementations of eight libraries, Ashraf Abusharekh and Kris Kaj found that \"Crypto++ 5.1 [sic] leads in terms of support for cryptographic primitives and schemes, but is the slowest of all investigated libraries.\"In 2008, speed tests carried out by Timo Bingmann using seven open-source security libraries with 15 block ciphers, Crypto++ 5.5.2 was the top-performing library under two block ciphers and did not rank below the average library performance under the remaining block ciphers.Crypto++ also includes an auto-benchmarking feature, available from the command line (cryptest.exe b), the results of which are available at Crypto++ 5.6.0 Benchmarks.As with many other cryptographic libraries available for 32-bit and 64-bit x86 architectures, Crypto++ includes assembly routines for AES using AES-NI. With AES-NI, AES performance improves dramatically: 128-bit AES/GCM throughput increases from approximately 28.0 cycles per byte to 3.5 cycles per byte.\n\n== Version releases ==\nCrypto++ 1.0 was released in June 1995. Since its initial release, the library has seen nearly two dozen revisions, including an architectural change in version 5.0. There have been ten releases using the version 5.0 architecture since March 2009.\nLawrence Teo's compilation of previous Crypto++ releases dating back to 1995 can be found in the users group archives.\n\n== FIPS validations ==\nCrypto++ has received three Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 Level 1 module validations with no post-validation issues.\nCrypto++ was moved to the CMVP's Historical Validation List in 2016. The move effectively means the library is no longer validated.\n\n== Licensing ==\nAs of version 5.6.1, Crypto++ consists of only public domain files, with a compilation copyright and a single open source license for the compilation copyright:\nThe License of Crypto++ is somewhat unusual amongst open source projects. A distinction is made between the library as a compilation (i.e., collection), which is copyrighted by Wei Dai, and the individual files in it, which are public domain.\nThe library is copyrighted as a compilation in order to place certain disclaimers (regarding warranty, export, and patents) in the license and to keep the attributions and public domain declarations intact when Crypto++ is distributed in source code form. The fact that individual files are public domain means that legally you can place code segments, entire files, or small sets of files (up to the limit set by fair use) into your own project and do anything you want with them without worrying about the copyright.\nWhat is Crypto++ and what kind of projects is it commonly used in?Question: On which operating systems and platforms does Crypto++ fully support 32-bit and 64-bit architectures?Question: Which versions of C++ runtime libraries does Crypto++ support for compilation?Question: What was the reason for the withdrawal of Crypto++ 1.0 release?Question: Which block cipher is roughly equivalent to AES and is included in the Crypto++ library?Question: Which hash function is roughly equivalent to SHA and is included in the Crypto++ library?Question: What primitives for number-theoretic operations are available in the Crypto++ library?Question: What insecure or obsolescent algorithms are available in the Crypto++ library for backward compatibility and historical value?Question: How was the performance of Crypto++ 5.1 in a 2007 ECRYPT workshop paper focusing on public key implementations of eight libraries?Question: How was Crypto++ 5.5.2's performance compared to other open-source security libraries in 2008?Question: What is the auto-benchmarking feature of Crypto++ and how to use it?Question: How does the AES performance improve when using AES-NI in Crypto++?Question: How many revisions has Crypto++ seen since its initial release?Question: What is the status of Crypto++ validations under FIPS 140-2 Level 1?Question: What is the licensing of Crypto++ version 5.6.1?",

      "context": "Crypto++\n\n==Introduction==\nCrypto++ (also known as CryptoPP, libcrypto++, and libcryptopp) is a free and open-source C++ class library of cryptographic algorithms and schemes written by Wei Dai. Crypto++ has been widely used in academia, student projects, open-source, and non-commercial projects, as well as businesses. Released in 1995, the library fully supports 32-bit and 64-bit architectures for many major operating systems and platforms, including Android (using STLport), Apple (macOS and iOS), BSD, Cygwin, IBM AIX, Linux, MinGW, Solaris, Windows, Windows Phone and Windows RT. The project also supports compilation using C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 runtime libraries; and a variety of compilers and IDEs, including Borland Turbo C++, Borland C++ Builder, Clang, CodeWarrior Pro, GCC (including Apple's GCC), Intel C++ Compiler (ICC), Microsoft Visual C/C++, and Sun Studio.\nCrypto++ 1.0 was released in June 1995, but the download is no longer available. The Crypto++ 1.0 release was withdrawn due to RSA Data Security, Inc asserting its patent over the RSA algorithm. All other versions of the library are available for download.\n\n\n\n== Algorithms ==\nCrypto++ ordinarily provides complete cryptographic implementations and often includes less popular, less frequently-used schemes. For example, Camellia is an ISO/NESSIE/IETF-approved block cipher roughly equivalent to AES, and Whirlpool is an ISO/NESSIE/IETF-approved hash function roughly equivalent to SHA; both are included in the library.Additionally, the Crypto++ library sometimes makes proposed and bleeding-edge algorithms and implementations available for study by the cryptographic community. For example, VMAC, a universal hash-based message authentication code, was added to the library during its submission to the Internet Engineering Task Force (CFRG Working Group); and Brainpool curves, proposed in March 2009 as an Internet Draft in RFC 5639, were added to Crypto++ 5.6.0 in the same month.\nThe library also makes available primitives for number-theoretic operations such as fast multi-precision integers; prime number generation and verification; finite field arithmetic, including GF(p) and GF(2n); elliptical curves; and polynomial operations.\nFurthermore, the library retains a collection of insecure or obsolescent algorithms for backward compatibility and historical value: MD2, MD4, MD5, Panama Hash, DES, ARC4, SEAL 3.0, WAKE, WAKE-OFB, DESX (DES-XEX3), RC2, SAFER, 3-WAY, GOST, SHARK, CAST-128, and Square.\n\n== Performance ==\nIn a 2007 ECRYPT workshop paper focusing on public key implementations of eight libraries, Ashraf Abusharekh and Kris Kaj found that \"Crypto++ 5.1 [sic] leads in terms of support for cryptographic primitives and schemes, but is the slowest of all investigated libraries.\"In 2008, speed tests carried out by Timo Bingmann using seven open-source security libraries with 15 block ciphers, Crypto++ 5.5.2 was the top-performing library under two block ciphers and did not rank below the average library performance under the remaining block ciphers.Crypto++ also includes an auto-benchmarking feature, available from the command line (cryptest.exe b), the results of which are available at Crypto++ 5.6.0 Benchmarks.As with many other cryptographic libraries available for 32-bit and 64-bit x86 architectures, Crypto++ includes assembly routines for AES using AES-NI. With AES-NI, AES performance improves dramatically: 128-bit AES/GCM throughput increases from approximately 28.0 cycles per byte to 3.5 cycles per byte.\n\n== Version releases ==\nCrypto++ 1.0 was released in June 1995. Since its initial release, the library has seen nearly two dozen revisions, including an architectural change in version 5.0. There have been ten releases using the version 5.0 architecture since March 2009.\nLawrence Teo's compilation of previous Crypto++ releases dating back to 1995 can be found in the users group archives.\n\n== FIPS validations ==\nCrypto++ has received three Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 Level 1 module validations with no post-validation issues.\nCrypto++ was moved to the CMVP's Historical Validation List in 2016. The move effectively means the library is no longer validated.\n\n== Licensing ==\nAs of version 5.6.1, Crypto++ consists of only public domain files, with a compilation copyright and a single open source license for the compilation copyright:\nThe License of Crypto++ is somewhat unusual amongst open source projects. A distinction is made between the library as a compilation (i.e., collection), which is copyrighted by Wei Dai, and the individual files in it, which are public domain.\nThe library is copyrighted as a compilation in order to place certain disclaimers (regarding warranty, export, and patents) in the license and to keep the attributions and public domain declarations intact when Crypto++ is distributed in source code form. The fact that individual files are public domain means that legally you can place code segments, entire files, or small sets of files (up to the limit set by fair use) into your own project and do anything you want with them without worrying about the copyright.",

    "instruction": "Here are some questions about this text: Group Domain of Interpretation\n\n==Introduction==\nGroup Domain of Interpretation or GDOI is a cryptographic protocol for group key management.  The GDOI protocol is specified in an IETF Standard, RFC 6407, and is based on Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP), RFC 2408, and Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKE).  Whereas IKE is run between two peers to establish a \"pair-wise security association\", GDOI protocol is run between a group member and a \"group controller/key server\" (controller) and establishes a security association among two or more group members.\n\n== Functional Overview ==\nGDOI \"interprets\" IKE or ISAKMP for the group security domain in addition to pair-wise security associations.  GDOI uses an IKE v1 Phase 1 security association for authenticating a GDOI member to a GDOI controller.  The IKE/GDOI Phase 1 cryptographic protocol exchange protects a new type of Phase 2 exchange in which the member requests (\"pulls\") group state from the controller.  The \"group key\" is the most important state in a GDOI member.   The group key encrypts keys that decrypt application data.  Thus, the group key is also called a \"key encrypting key\" in GDOI.  A group's key-encrypting key is used for the \"Rekey Security Association\".  Once the \"Rekey-SA\" is established, the GDOI controller can send (\"push\") unsolicited updates to the group security association to members over multicast, broadcast or unicast channels.  This is why GDOI is called a \"multicast key management system\" as it uses and supports multicast messaging for very large groups.  These multicast messages are unsolicited messages and are therefore called \"push\" messages, which are unsolicited messages sent from the controller to the members; explicit requests from a member to a controller are called \"pull\" messages in GDOI.  Thus GDOI group key updates are pushed and can reach any number of group members with a single efficient transmission from the controller.\nGDOI group key updates also serve to remove members from groups.  RFC 2627 describes one Group Membership Management protocol that allows selective key updates to members to efficiently remove a member from the group.  \"Efficiency\" is evaluated in terms of space, time and message complexity.  RFC 2627 and other algorithms such as \"subset-difference\" are logarithmic in space, time and message complexity.  Thus, RFC 2627 supports efficient group \"membership management\" for GDOI.  In a practical implementation, GDOI group membership management is a separate function that the controller or a AAA function invokes to remove a de-authorized group member.  \"AAA\" is authorization, authentication and accounting, which might run some kind of AAA protocol.  But the AAA function could also be a \"customer care\" function for a service provider or a \"subscriber management system\" for a media services provider.  The provider or AAA function must have a credential infrastructure such as a Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 digital certificates, SPKI or some other credential.  In an X.509 environment, the provider or AAA function will install a certificate to allow a member to join a group when the Group Controller queries the PKI during a GDOI Registration exchange when a member attempts to join a group and \"pull down\" the group state.\n\n\n*** Key Ladder ***\nThe group state that is stored in the group member are keys and key metadata.  Conceptually, the group member's keys are structured in a set of 1:N relationships and often called a \"key ladder\".  The member has a credential such as an X.509 certificate that proves it is authorized to join one or more groups.  The default group policy for the \"Private Authentication Key\" is a 2048-bit RSA key, but other policies are possible.  Similarly, the default \"group key\" or \"Key Encrypting Key\" is a 128-bit AES key, but other policies are possible.  Finally, the data encryption key is application-dependent but is commonly a 128-bit AES key.  In some groups, a member can be a sender that generates a data encryption key and encrypts it with the key encrypting key.     So long as the two share the group key for the same group, the sender can use that \"key encrypting key\" to encrypt the key(s) for the media files or streams that it serves.\nNot all GDOI groups make a distinction between sender and receiver, however, and whether or not group members may send to each other is a matter of group policy.  The type of keys in the key ladder are also determined by group policy.  Each group can have its own policy for cryptography, key lifetime, and member behavior.\n\n\n*** Group Policy ***\n[1]\n\n== Implementations and Products ==\nIn Cisco\nIn Juniper\nWhat are the answers to these questions: How does GDOI differ from IKE in terms of security associations?Q: What is the role of the IKE v1 Phase 1 security association in GDOI?Q: What is a group key encrypting key in GDOI, and what is its purpose?Q: How does GDOI support multicast messaging for large groups?Q: What is the role of Group Membership Management protocol in GDOI?Q: How is GDOI group membership management implemented in a practical scenario?Q: What is the purpose of the Key Ladder in GDOI?Q: What is the default group policy for the Private Authentication Key in GDOI?Q: What is the default group key or Key Encrypting Key in GDOI?Q: How does the sender use the Key Encrypting Key in GDOI?Q: What is the role of group policy in GDOI?Q: How does GDOI ensure secure communication in a group?Q: What is the purpose of the IKE v1 Phase 2 exchange in GDOI?Q: How does GDOI use and support multicast messaging for very large groups?Q: How does GDOI ensure secure group membership management?",

The WYSIWYS property of digital signature systems aims to tackle this problem by defining a desirable property that the visual representation of a digital document should be consistent across computing systems, particularly at the points of digital signature and digital signature verification.It is relatively easy to change the interpretation of a digital document by implementing changes on the computer system where the document is being processed, and the greater the semantic distance, the easier it gets. From a semantic perspective this creates uncertainty about what exactly has been signed. WYSIWYS  is a property of a digital signature system that ensures that the semantic interpretation of a digitally signed message cannot be changed, either by accident or by intent. This property also ensures that a digital document to be signed can not contain hidden semantic content that can be revealed after the signature has been applied. Though a WYSIWYS implementation is only as secure as the computing platform it is running on, various methods have been proposed to make WYSIWYS more robust.The term WYSIWYS was coined by Peter Landrock and Torben Pedersen to describe some of the principles in delivering secure and legally binding digital signatures for Pan-European projects.\n\nWhat is WYSIWYS in the context of cryptography?Question: What is the significance of the visual representation of a digital document in WYSIWYS?Question: How can the semantic interpretation of a digital document be altered?Question: What does a WYSIWYS implementation aim to prevent?Question: What is the role of digital signature algorithms in WYSIWYS?Question: What is the purpose of hiding semantic content in a digital document before signing?Question: In what scenarios is it easy to change the semantics of a digital document?Question: How can WYSIWYS be made more robust?Question: What are the origins of the term WYSIWYS in cryptography?Question: What is the primary goal of WYSIWYS in digital signature systems?Question: Is the security of a WYSIWYS implementation solely dependent on the computing platform it runs on?Question: What challenges does WYSIWYS address in digital signature systems?Question: How does WYSIWYS contribute to the integrity of digital signatures?Question: What is the significance of consistency in the visual representation of digital documents in WYSIWYS?Question: Can WYSIWYS prevent malicious attempts to alter the semantics of a signed document?",

    "output": "WYSIWYS in cryptography stands for \"What You See Is What You Sign,\" which is a property of digital signature systems. It ensures that the semantic content of signed messages cannot be altered, either accidentally or intentionally.Answer: The visual representation of a digital document is significant in WYSIWYS because it should be consistent across computing systems, especially during digital signature and verification. This consistency ensures that the semantic interpretation of the signed message remains unchanged.Answer: The semantic interpretation of a digital document can be altered by implementing changes in the computer system where the document is being processed. This creates uncertainty about the exact content that has been signed.Answer: A WYSIWYS implementation aims to prevent changes to the semantic interpretation of a digitally signed message, regardless of whether they are intentional or accidental.Answer: The soundness of digital signature algorithms is crucial to the integrity of a digital signature in WYSIWYS. However, the security of the computing platform used for signing and verification is equally important.Answer: The purpose of hiding semantic content in a digital document before signing is to reveal it after the signature has been applied.

    "instruction": "Read this and answer the below questions\n\nTwister (software)\n\n==Introduction==\nTwister is a decentralised, experimental peer-to-peer microblogging program. The system uses end-to-end encryption to safeguard communications. It is based on both BitTorrent- and Bitcoin-like protocols and has been likened to a distributed version of Twitter.In 2020 the original author Miguel Freitas announced that he would no longer be leading Twister development for the \"foreseeable future\", however the Twister network has continued functioning, and suggested that others might wish to fork the project. It was also announced that the website might go offline as hosting was due to expire. The Twister core had been at version 0.9.40 since 2018. The source code remains available on GitHub.\n\n== Overview ==\nTwister is a Twitter-like microblogging platform that utilizes the same blockchain technology as Bitcoin, and the file exchange method from BitTorrent, both based on P2P technologies.\nThe website seobloggingpro.com ranked Twister as the number 13 microblogging site, while seosandwitch.com ranked Twister as the number 4 microblogging site. (In the case of Twister, the ranking is not of the website itself, which exists primarily to facilitate downloads of the Twister platform.)\nAs of 2014 Twister was experimental software in alpha phase, implemented as a distributed file sharing system. User registration and authentication is provided by a Bitcoin-like network, so it is completely distributed and does not depend on any central authority. Distribution of posts uses a Kademlia distributed hash table (DHT) network and BitTorrent-like swarms, both provided by libtorrent. Included versions of both Bitcoin and libtorrent are highly patched, and are intentionally not interoperable with the already existing networks.\nMiguel Freitas, aiming to build a censor-resistant public posting platform, began development on Twister in July 2013 to address the concerns of free speech and privacy. Building on the work of Bitcoin and Bittorrent, he built the core structure in October 2013. Lucas Leal was hired to create HTML and CSS for the user interface, with Miguel writing the required JavaScript code. 2,500 user accounts were registered in the first six days of operation.As a completely decentralised network, Twister cannot be incapacitated since there is no central point to attack. Twister uses end-to-end encryption to protect communications and is also designed to prevent other users from knowing a user's IP address and which messages the user has read. As a consequence of the decentralisation, a user will be unable to regain access to their \"account\" if they lose access to their secret key.\n\n== Technology ==\n\n\n*** Protocols ***\nTwister is a distributed system, that works using a peer-to-peer architecture. Unlike other decentralised networks (like pump.io/Identi.ca, StatusNet/GNU social, Mastodon or Diaspora), it does not require the user to use their own server and does not require a user to trust a third-party server in order to use it.\n\n\n**** Bitcoin ****\nThe distribution is achieved through the Bitcoin protocol, though not through the same network used by the cryptocurrency. The protocol handles the registration of users. In the same way that miners verify transactions on the network used by the Bitcoin cryptocurrency to combat double spending, the Twister network verifies the users' names and that the message posted by a specific user originated from that user.\n\n\n**** BitTorrent ****\nThe messages are transmitted through the BitTorrent protocol. This allows for distribution of a great number of messages along the network in a fast and efficient way.\nBecause it is a peer-to-peer system, there is no central server from which information may be collected (see PRISM). \n\n\n*** Platforms ***\nTwister was developed under Linux and ported successfully to Android and OS X.\nOne of the long-term objectives of the program is to move the whole cryptographic code of the implementation to the user's browsers. This way users would be capable of accessing Twister through any client platform they wish and still maintain the security of their secret keys at all times.\n\n== Functionality ==\nThe first Twister prototype intended to reproduce the basic characteristics of microblogging platforms, including:\n\nSearching users\nFollowing and unfollowing users\nLimiting the length of text based messages to 140 characters\nBroadcasting and answering messages\nBrowsing through mentions, hashtags and private messagesPrivate messages require the addressee to follow the speaker, which is a common requirement in many of the existing platforms.\n\n== Security ==\nTwister is a peer-to-peer microblogging platform without a central node mediating messages.\nTwister uses 256-bit ECC encryption with the same secp256k1 parameters as Bitcoin, supposedly providing similar security to a 3072-bit RSA key.A significant bug bounty was offered, payable in bitcoin, for identifying design flaws.The direct message application is based on example code published by Ladar Levison of Lavabit.\n\n\n*** Censorship ***\nPeople who run a node can delete a user's posts in the DHT, but not block the user's account.\n\n\n*** Privacy ***\nMessages are sent encrypted directly between users.\n\n\n*** Anonymity ***\nPeers' IP addresses are not recorded within the application, which avoids tracking of peers if the device is later compromised, but network interception can still identify data flows between devices.In order to be 100% anonymous, the user would have to use a browser that masks the IP address, such as Tor or similar.\n\nHow does Twister ensure the authenticity of user identities and messages?Q: How does Twister protect user communications from being monitored or intercepted?Q: What technology does Twister use to prevent a central point of attack and ensure network resilience?Q: How does Twister's peer-to-peer architecture differ from other decentralized networks like pump.io, StatusNet, Mastodon, or Diaspora?Q: How does Twister distribute messages across the network, and what benefits does this approach offer?Q: What are the long-term objectives of Twister's platform development, and how do they benefit users?Q: How is user registration and authentication handled in Twister, and what advantages does this approach provide?Q: How does Twister's use of end-to-end encryption protect user communications?Q: What measures does Twister take to protect user anonymity, and what additional steps can users take to achieve complete anonymity?Q: How does Twister's decentralized architecture impact a user's ability to regain access to their account if they lose their secret key?Q: What challenges might users face when following or interacting with other users on Twister, and how does the platform address these issues?Q: How does Twister's use of the Kademlia distributed hash table (DHT) network and BitTorrent-like swarms contribute to the platform's overall functionality and performance?Q: How does Twister's integration of Bitcoin and BitTorrent protocols impact the platform's overall security and privacy?Q: How does Twister's censorship policy impact user interactions and content moderation on the platform?Q: What security challenges might arise from using Twister on different platforms, and how can users mitigate these risks?",

    "instruction": "Please answer questions about the following article about: Presidential Policy Directive 20\n\n==Introduction==\nPresidential Policy Directive 20 (PPD-20), provides a framework for U.S. cybersecurity by establishing principles and processes. Signed by President Barack Obama in October 2012, this directive supersedes National Security Presidential Directive NSPD-38. Integrating cyber tools with those of national security, the directive complements NSPD-54/Homeland Security Presidential Directive HSPD-23.\nClassified and unreleased by the National Security Agency (NSA), NSPD-54 was authorized by George W. Bush. It gives the U.S. government power to conduct surveillance through monitoring.Its existence was made public in June 2013 by former intelligence NSA infrastructure analyst Edward Snowden.\n\n== Background ==\nBecause of private industry, and issues surrounding international and domestic law, public-private-partnership became the, \"cornerstone of America's cybersecurity strategy\". Suggestions for the private sector were detailed in the declassified 2003, National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. Its companion document, National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD-38), was signed in secret by George W. Bush the following year.Although the contents of NSPD 38 are still undisclosed, the U.S. military did not recognize cyberspace as a \"theater of operations\" until the U.S. National Defense Strategy of 2005. The report declared that the, \"ability to operate in and from the global commons-space, international waters and airspace, and cyberspace is important ... to project power anywhere in the world from secure bases of operation.\" Three years later, George W. Bush formed the classified Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI).\nCiting economic and national security, the Obama administration prioritized cybersecurity upon taking office. After an in-depth review of the, \"communications and information infrastructure,\" the CNCI was partially declassified and expanded under President Obama. It outlines \"key elements of a broader, updated national U.S. cybersecurity strategy.\" By 2011, the Pentagon announced its capability to run cyber attacks.\n\n== General ==\nAfter the U.S. Senate failed to pass the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 that August, Presidential Policy Directive 20 (PPD-20) was signed in secret. The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) filed a Freedom of Information Request to see it, but the NSA would not comply. Some details were reported in November 2012. The Washington Post wrote that PPD-20, \"is the most extensive White House effort to date to wrestle with what constitutes an 'offensive' and a 'defensive' action in the rapidly evolving world of cyberwar and cyberterrorism.\" The following January, the Obama administration released a ten-point factsheet.\n\n== Controversy ==\nOn June 7, 2013, PPD-20 became public. Released by Edward Snowden and posted by The Guardian, it is part of the 2013 Mass Surveillance Disclosures. While the U.S. factsheet claims PPD-20 acts within the law and is, \"consistent with the values that we promote domestically and internationally as we have previously articulated in the International Strategy for Cyberspace\", it doesn't reveal cyber operations in the directive.Snowden's disclosure called attention to passages noting cyberwarfare policy and its possible consequences. The directive calls both defensive and offensive measures as Defensive Cyber Effects Operations (DCEO) and Offensive Cyber Effects Operations (OCEO), respectively.\n\n== Notable points ==\n\"Loss of life, significant responsive actions against the United States, significant damage to property, serious adverse US foreign policy consequences, or serious economic impact on the United States.\"\n\"OCEO can offer unique and unconventional capabilities to advance U.S. national objectives around the world with little or no warning to the adversary or target and with potential effects ranging from subtle to severely damaging. The development and sustainment of OCEO capabilities, however, may require considerable time and effort if access and tools for a specific target do not already exist.\"\n\"The United States Government shall identify potential targets of national importance where OCEO can offer a favorable balance of effectiveness and risk as compared with other instruments of national power, establish and maintain OCEO capabilities integrated as appropriate with other U.S. offensive capabilities, and execute those capabilities in a manner consistent with the provisions of this directive.\"\n\nWhat is the role of Presidential Policy Directive 20 (PPD-20) in U.S. cybersecurity?q: What was the situation that prompted the formation of the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) under George W. Bush?q: What is the relationship between NSPD-38 and the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace?q: What was the significance of the Pentagon's announcement of its cyber attack capabilities in 2011?q: What is the role of private industry in America's cybersecurity strategy?q: What was the outcome of the U.S. Senate's failure to pass the Cybersecurity Act of 2012?q: Why did the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) file a Freedom of Information Request to see PPD-20?q: What are the implications of the U.S. government's recognition of cyberspace as a \"theater of operations\"?q: What is the difference between Defensive Cyber Effects Operations (DCEO) and Offensive Cyber Effects Operations (OCEO)?q: How does PPD-20 define the role of cyber operations in advancing U.S. national objectives?q: What is the significance of the fact that PPD-20 was initially classified and unreleased?q: How does PPD-20 relate to international law and norms in cyberspace?q: What are the potential consequences of cyberwarfare operations as outlined in PPD-20?q: How does PPD-20 address the issue of identifying potential targets of national importance for cyber operations?q: What is the significance of the fact that PPD-20 does not reveal specific cyber operations?",

      "context": "Presidential Policy Directive 20\n\n==Introduction==\nPresidential Policy Directive 20 (PPD-20), provides a framework for U.S. cybersecurity by establishing principles and processes. Signed by President Barack Obama in October 2012, this directive supersedes National Security Presidential Directive NSPD-38. Integrating cyber tools with those of national security, the directive complements NSPD-54/Homeland Security Presidential Directive HSPD-23.\nClassified and unreleased by the National Security Agency (NSA), NSPD-54 was authorized by George W. Bush. It gives the U.S. government power to conduct surveillance through monitoring.Its existence was made public in June 2013 by former intelligence NSA infrastructure analyst Edward Snowden.\n\n== Background ==\nBecause of private industry, and issues surrounding international and domestic law, public-private-partnership became the, \"cornerstone of America's cybersecurity strategy\". Suggestions for the private sector were detailed in the declassified 2003, National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. Its companion document, National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD-38), was signed in secret by George W. Bush the following year.Although the contents of NSPD 38 are still undisclosed, the U.S. military did not recognize cyberspace as a \"theater of operations\" until the U.S. National Defense Strategy of 2005. The report declared that the, \"ability to operate in and from the global commons-space, international waters and airspace, and cyberspace is important ... to project power anywhere in the world from secure bases of operation.\" Three years later, George W. Bush formed the classified Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI).\nCiting economic and national security, the Obama administration prioritized cybersecurity upon taking office. After an in-depth review of the, \"communications and information infrastructure,\" the CNCI was partially declassified and expanded under President Obama. It outlines \"key elements of a broader, updated national U.S. cybersecurity strategy.\" By 2011, the Pentagon announced its capability to run cyber attacks.\n\n== General ==\nAfter the U.S. Senate failed to pass the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 that August, Presidential Policy Directive 20 (PPD-20) was signed in secret. The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) filed a Freedom of Information Request to see it, but the NSA would not comply. Some details were reported in November 2012. The Washington Post wrote that PPD-20, \"is the most extensive White House effort to date to wrestle with what constitutes an 'offensive' and a 'defensive' action in the rapidly evolving world of cyberwar and cyberterrorism.\" The following January, the Obama administration released a ten-point factsheet.\n\n== Controversy ==\nOn June 7, 2013, PPD-20 became public. Released by Edward Snowden and posted by The Guardian, it is part of the 2013 Mass Surveillance Disclosures. While the U.S. factsheet claims PPD-20 acts within the law and is, \"consistent with the values that we promote domestically and internationally as we have previously articulated in the International Strategy for Cyberspace\", it doesn't reveal cyber operations in the directive.Snowden's disclosure called attention to passages noting cyberwarfare policy and its possible consequences. The directive calls both defensive and offensive measures as Defensive Cyber Effects Operations (DCEO) and Offensive Cyber Effects Operations (OCEO), respectively.\n\n== Notable points ==\n\"Loss of life, significant responsive actions against the United States, significant damage to property, serious adverse US foreign policy consequences, or serious economic impact on the United States.\"\n\"OCEO can offer unique and unconventional capabilities to advance U.S. national objectives around the world with little or no warning to the adversary or target and with potential effects ranging from subtle to severely damaging. The development and sustainment of OCEO capabilities, however, may require considerable time and effort if access and tools for a specific target do not already exist.\"\n\"The United States Government shall identify potential targets of national importance where OCEO can offer a favorable balance of effectiveness and risk as compared with other instruments of national power, establish and maintain OCEO capabilities integrated as appropriate with other U.S. offensive capabilities, and execute those capabilities in a manner consistent with the provisions of this directive.\"",

    "instruction": "Context: Self-sovereign identity\n\n==Introduction==\nSelf-sovereign identity (SSI) is an approach to digital identity that gives individuals control over the information they use to prove who they are to websites, services, and applications across the web. Without SSI, individuals with persistent accounts (identities) across the internet must rely on a number of large identity providers, such as Facebook (Facebook Connect) and Google (Google Sign-In), that have control of the information associated with their identity. If a user chooses not to use a large identity provider, then they have to create new accounts with each service provider, which fragments their web experiences. Self-sovereign identity offers a way to avoid these two undesirable alternatives. In a self-sovereign identity system, the user accesses services in a streamlined and secure manner, while maintaining control over the information associated with their identity.\n\n== Background ==\nThe TCP/IP protocol provides identifiers for machines, but not for the people and organisations operating the machines.

      "context": "Self-sovereign identity\n\n==Introduction==\nSelf-sovereign identity (SSI) is an approach to digital identity that gives individuals control over the information they use to prove who they are to websites, services, and applications across the web. Without SSI, individuals with persistent accounts (identities) across the internet must rely on a number of large identity providers, such as Facebook (Facebook Connect) and Google (Google Sign-In), that have control of the information associated with their identity. If a user chooses not to use a large identity provider, then they have to create new accounts with each service provider, which fragments their web experiences. Self-sovereign identity offers a way to avoid these two undesirable alternatives. In a self-sovereign identity system, the user accesses services in a streamlined and secure manner, while maintaining control over the information associated with their identity.\n\n== Background ==\nThe TCP/IP protocol provides identifiers for machines, but not for the people and organisations operating the machines.

    "instruction": "Answer questions about:\nBlueKeep\n\n==Introduction==\nBlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708) is a security vulnerability that was discovered in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) implementation, which allows for the possibility of remote code execution.\nFirst reported in May 2019, it is present in all unpatched Windows NT-based versions of Microsoft Windows from Windows 2000 through Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7. Microsoft issued a security patch (including an out-of-band update for several versions of Windows that have reached their end-of-life, such as Windows XP) on 14 May 2019. On 13 August 2019, related BlueKeep security vulnerabilities, collectively named DejaBlue, were reported to affect newer Windows versions, including Windows 7 and all recent versions up to Windows 10 of the operating system, as well as the older Windows versions. On 6 September 2019, a Metasploit exploit of the wormable BlueKeep security vulnerability was announced to have been released into the public realm.\n\n\n\n== Mechanism ==\nThe RDP protocol uses \"virtual channels\", configured before authentication, as a data path between the client and server for providing extensions. RDP 5.1 defines 32 \"static\" virtual channels, and \"dynamic\" virtual channels are contained within one of these static channels. If a server binds the virtual channel \"MS_T120\" (a channel for which there is no legitimate reason for a client to connect to) with a static channel other than 31, heap corruption occurs that allows for arbitrary code execution at the system level.Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 were named by Microsoft as being vulnerable to this attack. Versions newer than 7, such as Windows 8 and Windows 10, were not affected. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency stated that it had also successfully achieved code execution via the vulnerability on Windows 2000.\n\n== Mitigation ==\nMicrosoft released patches for the vulnerability on 14 May 2019, for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2. This included versions of Windows that have reached their end-of-life (such as Vista, XP, and Server 2003) and thus are no longer eligible for security updates. The patch forces the aforementioned \"MS_T120\" channel to always be bound to 31 even if requested otherwise by an RDP server.The NSA recommended additional measures, such as disabling Remote Desktop Services and its associated port (TCP 3389) if it is not being used, and requiring Network Level Authentication (NLA) for RDP. According to computer security company Sophos, two-factor authentication may make the RDP issue less of a vulnerability. However, the best protection is to take RDP off the Internet: switch RDP off if not needed and, if needed, make RDP accessible only via a VPN.\nWhat is the BlueKeep vulnerability and what kind of security breach does it allow?q: Which versions of Microsoft Windows are affected by the BlueKeep vulnerability?q: What is the mechanism behind the BlueKeep vulnerability and how does it allow for arbitrary code execution?q: Which specific versions of Windows were named by Microsoft as being vulnerable to the BlueKeep attack?q: What measures did Microsoft take to mitigate the BlueKeep vulnerability?q: What additional measures did the NSA recommend to mitigate the BlueKeep vulnerability?q: How can the best protection be achieved against the BlueKeep vulnerability?q: When was the BlueKeep vulnerability first reported?q: When were related BlueKeep security vulnerabilities, named DejaBlue, first reported?q: What does the Metasploit exploit of the wormable BlueKeep security vulnerability allow for?q: What is the significance of the \"MS_T120\" virtual channel in the context of the BlueKeep vulnerability?q: Why were versions of Windows newer than Windows 7 not affected by the BlueKeep vulnerability?q: How can two-factor authentication make the RDP issue less of a vulnerability in the context of the BlueKeep vulnerability?q: Why did the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency successfully achieve code execution via the BlueKeep vulnerability on Windows 2000?q: What is the significance of the fact that the BlueKeep vulnerability allows for remote code execution without user interaction or authentication?",

It featured a web interface, complete with forms to enter targets, tables to display results, and context-sensitive tutorials that appeared when a vulnerability had been found.\n\n\n\n== Naming ==\nFor those offended by the name SATAN, the software contained a special command called repent, which rearranged the letters in the program's acronym from \"SATAN\" to \"SANTA\".\n\n== Description ==\nThe tool was developed by Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema. Neil Gaiman drew the artwork for the SATAN documentation.\nSATAN was designed to help systems administrators automate the process of testing their systems for known vulnerabilities that can be exploited via the network. This was particularly useful for networked systems with multiple hosts. Like most security tools, it was useful for good or malicious purposes \u2013 it was also useful to would-be intruders looking for systems with security holes.\nSATAN was written mostly in Perl and utilized a web browser such as Netscape, Mosaic or Lynx to provide the user interface. This easy to use interface drove the scanning process and presents the results in summary format. As well as reporting the presence of vulnerabilities, SATAN also gathered large amounts of general network information, such as which hosts are connected to subnets, what types of machines they are and which services they offered.\n\n== Status ==\nSATAN has fallen from popularity after the height of its popularity in the 1990s. SATAN was released in 1995 and development has ceased. In 2006, SecTools.Org conducted a security popularity poll and developed a list of 100 network security analysis tools in order of popularity based on the responses of 3,243 people.

    "instruction": "Answer questions about:\nIntranet\n\n==Introduction==\nAn intranet is a computer network for sharing information, easier communication, collaboration tools, operational systems, and other computing services within an organization, usually to the exclusion of access by outsiders. The term is used in contrast to public networks, such as the Internet, but uses the same technology based on the Internet protocol suite.An organization-wide intranet can constitute an important focal point of internal communication and collaboration, and provide a single starting point to access internal and external resources. In its simplest form, an intranet is established with the technologies for local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs). Many modern intranets have search engines, user profiles, blogs, mobile apps with notifications, and events planning within their infrastructure.\nAn intranet is sometimes contrasted to an extranet. While an intranet is generally restricted to employees of the organization, extranets may also be accessed by customers, suppliers, or other approved parties. Extranets extend a private network onto the Internet with special provisions for authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA protocol).\n\n== Uses ==\nIncreasingly, intranets are being used to deliver tools, e.g. collaboration (to facilitate working in groups and teleconferencing) or sophisticated corporate directories, sales and customer relationship management tools, project management etc.,\nIntranets are also being used as corporate culture-change platforms. For example, large numbers of employees discussing key issues in an intranet forum application could lead to new ideas in management, productivity, quality, and other corporate issues.\nIn large intranets, website traffic is often similar to public website traffic and can be better understood by using web metrics software to track overall activity. User surveys also improve intranet website effectiveness.\nLarger businesses allow users within their intranet to access public internet through firewall servers. They have the ability to screen messages coming and going, keeping security intact. When part of an intranet is made accessible to customers and others outside the business, it becomes part of an extranet. Businesses can send private messages through the public network, using special encryption/decryption and other security safeguards to connect one part of their intranet to another.\nIntranet user-experience, editorial, and technology teams work together to produce in-house sites. Most commonly, intranets are managed by the communications, HR or CIO departments of large organizations, or some combination of these.\nBecause of the scope and variety of content and the number of system interfaces, intranets of many organizations are much more complex than their respective public websites. Intranets and their use are growing rapidly. According to the Intranet Design Annual 2007 from Nielsen Norman Group, the number of pages on participants' intranets averaged 200,000 over the years 2001 to 2003 and has grown to an average of 6 million pages over 2005\u20132007.\n\n== Benefits ==\nWorkforce productivity: Intranets can help users to locate and view information faster and use applications relevant to their roles and responsibilities. With the help of a web browser interface, users can access data held in any database the organization wants to make available, anytime and \u2014 subject to security provisions \u2014 from anywhere within the company workstations, increasing the employees ability to perform their jobs faster, more accurately, and with confidence that they have the right information. It also helps to improve the services provided to the users.\nTime: Intranets allow organizations to distribute information to employees on an as-needed basis; Employees may link to relevant information at their convenience, rather than being distracted indiscriminately by email.\nCommunication: Intranets can serve as powerful tools for communication within an organization, vertically strategic initiatives that have a global reach throughout the organization. The type of information that can easily be conveyed is the purpose of the initiative and what the initiative is aiming to achieve, who is driving the initiative, results achieved to date, and whom to speak to for more information. By providing this information on the intranet, staff have the opportunity to keep up-to-date with the strategic focus of the organization. Some examples of communication would be chat, email, and/or blogs. A great real-world example of where an intranet helped a company communicate is when Nestle had a number of food processing plants in Scandinavia. Their central support system had to deal with a number of queries every day.\tWhen Nestle decided to invest in an intranet, they quickly realized the savings.\tMcGovern says the savings from the reduction in query calls was substantially greater than the investment in the intranet.\nWeb publishing allows cumbersome corporate knowledge to be maintained and easily accessed throughout the company using hypermedia and Web technologies.Examples include employee manuals, benefits documents, company policies, business standards, news feeds, and even training, can be accessed using common Internet standards (Acrobat files, Flash files, CGI applications). Because each business unit can update the online copy of a document, the most recent version is usually available to employees using the intranet.\nBusiness operations and management: Intranets are also being used as a platform for developing and deploying applications to support business operations and decisions across the internetworked enterprise.\nWorkflow: a collective term that reduces delay, such as automating meeting scheduling and vacation planning\nCost-effectiveness: Users can view information and data via web-browser rather than maintaining physical documents such as procedure manuals, internal phone list and requisition forms. This can potentially save the business money on printing, duplicating documents, and the environment as well as document maintenance overhead. For example, the HRM company PeopleSoft \"derived significant cost savings by shifting HR processes to the intranet\". McGovern goes on to say the manual cost of enrolling in benefits was found to be US$109.48 per enrollment. \"Shifting this process to the intranet reduced the cost per enrollment to $21.79; a saving of 80 percent\". Another company that saved money on expense reports was Cisco. \"In 1996, Cisco processed 54,000 reports and the amount of dollars processed was USD19 million\".Enhance collaboration: Information is easily accessible by all authorised users, which enables teamwork.

Being able to specifically address one's \"viewer\" is a great advantage. Since intranets are user-specific (requiring database/network authentication prior to access), users know exactly who they are interfacing with and can personalize their intranet based on role (job title, department) or individual (\"Congratulations Jane, on your 3rd year with our company!\").\nPromote common corporate culture: Every user has the ability to view the same information within the intranet.\nSupports a distributed computing architecture': The intranet can also be linked to a company's management information system, for example a time keeping system.\nEmployee Engagement: Since \"involvement in decision making\" is one of the main drivers of employee engagement, offering tools (like forums or surveys) that foster peer-to-peer collaboration and employee participation can make employees feel more valued and involved.\n\n== Planning and creation ==\nMost organizations devote considerable resources into the planning and implementation of their intranet as it is of strategic importance to the organization's success. Some of the planning would include topics such as determining the purpose and goals of the intranet, identifying persons or departments responsible for implementation and management and devising functional plans, page layouts and designs.\nThe appropriate staff would also ensure that implementation schedules and phase-out of existing systems were organized, while defining and implementing security of the intranet and ensuring it lies within legal boundaries and other constraints. In order to produce a high-value end product, systems planners should determine the level of interactivity (e.g. wikis, on-line forms) desired.\nPlanners may also consider whether the input of new data and updating of existing data is to be centrally controlled or devolve. These decisions sit alongside to the hardware and software considerations (like content management systems), participation issues (like good taste, harassment, confidentiality), and features to be supported.Intranets are often static sites; they are a shared drive, serving up centrally stored documents alongside internal articles or communications (often one-way communication). By leveraging firms which specialise in 'social' intranets, organisations are beginning to think of how their intranets can become a 'communication hub' for their entire team. The actual implementation would include steps such as securing senior management support and funding, conducting a business requirement analysis and identifying users' information needs.\nFrom the technical perspective, there would need to be a co-ordinated installation of the web server and user access network, the required user/client applications and the creation of document framework (or template) for the content to be hosted.The end-user should be involved in testing and promoting use of the company intranet, possibly through a parallel adoption methodology or pilot programme. In the long term, the company should carry out ongoing measurement and evaluation, including through benchmarking against other company services.\n\n== Maintenance ==\nSome aspects are non-static.\n\n\n*** Staying current ***\nAn intranet structure needs key personnel committed to maintaining the intranet and keeping content current. For feedback on the intranet, social networking can be done through a forum for users to indicate what they want and what they do not like.\n\n\n*** Privacy protection ***\nThe European Union's General Data Protection Regulation went into effect May 2018. Since then, the protection of the privacy of employees, customers and other stakeholders (e.g. consultants) has become more and more a significant concern for most companies (at least, all those having an interest in markets and countries where regulations are in place to protect the privacy).\n\n== Enterprise private network ==\nAn enterprise private network is a computer network built by a business to interconnect its various company sites (such as production sites, offices and shops) in order to share computer resources.\nBeginning with the digitalisation of telecommunication networks, started in the 1970s in the US by AT&T, and propelled by the growth in computer systems availability and demands, enterprise networks have been built for decades without the need to append the term private to them. The networks were operated over telecommunication networks and, as for voice communications, a certain amount of security and secrecy was expected and delivered.\nBut with the Internet in the 1990s came a new type of network, virtual private networks, built over this public infrastructure, using encryption to protect the data traffic from eaves-dropping. So the enterprise networks are now commonly referred to as enterprise private networks in order to clarify that these are private networks, in contrast to public networks.\nHow does an intranet facilitate group work and teleconferencing?Q: How can intranets be used as a corporate culture-change platform?Q: How can intranets help to improve communication within an organization?Q: How can intranets be used to maintain and access corporate knowledge?Q: How can intranets be used as a platform for developing and deploying applications to support business operations and decisions?Q: How can intranets help to improve workforce productivity?Q: How can intranets help to reduce costs?Q: How can intranets help to enhance collaboration?Q: How can intranets be built for a specific audience?Q: How can intranets help to promote a common corporate culture?Q: How can intranets be linked to a company's management information system?Q: How can intranets be used to support employee engagement?Q: How are intranets typically managed and maintained?Q: How can intranets be used to distribute information to employees on an as-needed basis?Q: How can intranets be used to improve the services provided to users?",

      "context": "Intranet\n\n==Introduction==\nAn intranet is a computer network for sharing information, easier communication, collaboration tools, operational systems, and other computing services within an organization, usually to the exclusion of access by outsiders. The term is used in contrast to public networks, such as the Internet, but uses the same technology based on the Internet protocol suite.An organization-wide intranet can constitute an important focal point of internal communication and collaboration, and provide a single starting point to access internal and external resources. In its simplest form, an intranet is established with the technologies for local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs). Many modern intranets have search engines, user profiles, blogs, mobile apps with notifications, and events planning within their infrastructure.\nAn intranet is sometimes contrasted to an extranet. While an intranet is generally restricted to employees of the organization, extranets may also be accessed by customers, suppliers, or other approved parties. Extranets extend a private network onto the Internet with special provisions for authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA protocol).\n\n== Uses ==\nIncreasingly, intranets are being used to deliver tools, e.g. collaboration (to facilitate working in groups and teleconferencing) or sophisticated corporate directories, sales and customer relationship management tools, project management etc.,\nIntranets are also being used as corporate culture-change platforms. For example, large numbers of employees discussing key issues in an intranet forum application could lead to new ideas in management, productivity, quality, and other corporate issues.\nIn large intranets, website traffic is often similar to public website traffic and can be better understood by using web metrics software to track overall activity. User surveys also improve intranet website effectiveness.\nLarger businesses allow users within their intranet to access public internet through firewall servers. They have the ability to screen messages coming and going, keeping security intact. When part of an intranet is made accessible to customers and others outside the business, it becomes part of an extranet. Businesses can send private messages through the public network, using special encryption/decryption and other security safeguards to connect one part of their intranet to another.\nIntranet user-experience, editorial, and technology teams work together to produce in-house sites. Most commonly, intranets are managed by the communications, HR or CIO departments of large organizations, or some combination of these.\nBecause of the scope and variety of content and the number of system interfaces, intranets of many organizations are much more complex than their respective public websites. Intranets and their use are growing rapidly. According to the Intranet Design Annual 2007 from Nielsen Norman Group, the number of pages on participants' intranets averaged 200,000 over the years 2001 to 2003 and has grown to an average of 6 million pages over 2005\u20132007.\n\n== Benefits ==\nWorkforce productivity: Intranets can help users to locate and view information faster and use applications relevant to their roles and responsibilities. With the help of a web browser interface, users can access data held in any database the organization wants to make available, anytime and \u2014 subject to security provisions \u2014 from anywhere within the company workstations, increasing the employees ability to perform their jobs faster, more accurately, and with confidence that they have the right information. It also helps to improve the services provided to the users.\nTime: Intranets allow organizations to distribute information to employees on an as-needed basis; Employees may link to relevant information at their convenience, rather than being distracted indiscriminately by email.\nCommunication: Intranets can serve as powerful tools for communication within an organization, vertically strategic initiatives that have a global reach throughout the organization. The type of information that can easily be conveyed is the purpose of the initiative and what the initiative is aiming to achieve, who is driving the initiative, results achieved to date, and whom to speak to for more information. By providing this information on the intranet, staff have the opportunity to keep up-to-date with the strategic focus of the organization. Some examples of communication would be chat, email, and/or blogs. A great real-world example of where an intranet helped a company communicate is when Nestle had a number of food processing plants in Scandinavia. Their central support system had to deal with a number of queries every day.\tWhen Nestle decided to invest in an intranet, they quickly realized the savings.\tMcGovern says the savings from the reduction in query calls was substantially greater than the investment in the intranet.\nWeb publishing allows cumbersome corporate knowledge to be maintained and easily accessed throughout the company using hypermedia and Web technologies.Examples include employee manuals, benefits documents, company policies, business standards, news feeds, and even training, can be accessed using common Internet standards (Acrobat files, Flash files, CGI applications). Because each business unit can update the online copy of a document, the most recent version is usually available to employees using the intranet.\nBusiness operations and management: Intranets are also being used as a platform for developing and deploying applications to support business operations and decisions across the internetworked enterprise.\nWorkflow: a collective term that reduces delay, such as automating meeting scheduling and vacation planning\nCost-effectiveness: Users can view information and data via web-browser rather than maintaining physical documents such as procedure manuals, internal phone list and requisition forms. This can potentially save the business money on printing, duplicating documents, and the environment as well as document maintenance overhead. For example, the HRM company PeopleSoft \"derived significant cost savings by shifting HR processes to the intranet\". McGovern goes on to say the manual cost of enrolling in benefits was found to be US$109.48 per enrollment. \"Shifting this process to the intranet reduced the cost per enrollment to $21.79; a saving of 80 percent\".

    "instruction": "Modular exponentiation\n\n==Introduction==\nModular exponentiation is exponentiation performed over a modulus. It is useful in computer science, especially in the field of public-key cryptography, where it is used in both Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange and RSA public/private keys.\nModular exponentiation is the remainder when an integer b (the base) is raised to the power e (the exponent), and divided by a positive integer m (the modulus); that is, c = be mod m. From the definition of division, it follows that 0 \u2264 c < m.\nFor example, given b = 5, e = 3 and m = 13, dividing 53 = 125 by 13 leaves a remainder of c = 8.\nModular exponentiation can be performed with a negative exponent e by finding the modular multiplicative inverse d of b modulo m using the extended Euclidean algorithm. That is:\n\nc = be mod m = d\u2212e mod m, where e < 0 and b \u22c5 d \u2261 1 (mod m).Modular exponentiation is efficient to compute, even for very large integers.  On the other hand, computing the modular discrete logarithm \u2013 that is, finding the exponent e when given b, c, and m \u2013 is believed to be difficult. This one-way function behavior makes modular exponentiation a candidate for use in cryptographic algorithms.\n\n== Direct method ==\nThe most direct method of calculating a modular exponent is to calculate be directly, then to take this number modulo m.

It is a combination of the previous method and a more general principle called exponentiation by squaring (also known as binary exponentiation).\nFirst, it is required that the exponent e be converted to binary notation.  That is, e can be written as:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        e\n\n== Left-to-right binary method ==\nWe can also use the bits of the exponent in left to right order.

It is considered difficult to compute because it is a one-way function, which means that it is easy to compute in one direction (from e to c) but difficult to compute in the opposite direction (from c to e).answer: The direct method of calculating a modular exponent involves calculating be directly and then taking this number modulo m. However, this method can be inefficient for very large integers because it requires a large amount of memory to store the intermediate results.answer: The memory-efficient method of calculating a modular exponent reduces the size of the numbers being used by performing additional modular reduction operations.

From the definition of division, it follows that 0 \u2264 c < m.\nFor example, given b = 5, e = 3 and m = 13, dividing 53 = 125 by 13 leaves a remainder of c = 8.\nModular exponentiation can be performed with a negative exponent e by finding the modular multiplicative inverse d of b modulo m using the extended Euclidean algorithm. That is:\n\nc = be mod m = d\u2212e mod m, where e < 0 and b \u22c5 d \u2261 1 (mod m).Modular exponentiation is efficient to compute, even for very large integers.

    "instruction": "Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (JWICS,  JAY-wiks) is the United States Department of Defense's secure intranet system that houses top secret and sensitive compartmented information. JWICS superseded the earlier DSNET2 and DSNET3, the Top Secret and SCI levels of the Defense Data Network based on ARPANET technology.The system deals primarily with intelligence information and was one of the networks accessed by Chelsea Manning, in the leaking of sensitive footage and intelligence during the Afghanistan and Iraq wars to whistleblower organization WikiLeaks in 2010. The video used in WikiLeaks' Collateral Murder and US diplomatic cables were leaked by Manning. In 2023, it was also accessed by Jack Teixeira who leaked information about the war in Ukraine.\nBecause of the information it houses, JWICS is subject to discussion around cybersecurity and the United States' vulnerability to cyber threats.\nOpinions surrounding the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication system are varied. Some emphasize its importance as a measure to protect intelligence that helps to ensure the safety of US military interests and personnel. Others scrutinize the system for standing in the way of the transparency and accountability of government.\n\n\n\n== JWICS in practice ==\nThe Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) is a secure intranet system utilized by the United States Department of Defense to house \"Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information\" In day-to-day usage, the JWICS is used primarily by members of the Intelligence Community, such as the DIA within the DoD, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation under the Justice Department. Conversely, SIPRNet and NIPRNet account for the overwhelming bulk of usage within DoD and non-intelligence government agencies and departments.\nThere are three main router networks operated by the Department of Defense. Each is separated by the types of information they deal with.At the most open level, the Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) is the hub for non-classified but still specialized information relating to important logistics and planning.Above this lies the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET). SIPRNET deals with information classified as Confidential or Secret. SIPRNET is another of the networks accessed by Chelsea Manning (See Automation bias, #JWICS, WikiLeaks, and Chelsea Manning).Finally, the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System houses the top level of data, consisting primarily of top-secret intelligence information. The system deals with transmissions coming from across the globe. The transmission of information across the JWICS network is summarized by Jeffrey R. Cares in the Encyclopedia of Cyber Warfare: See Joint All-Domain Command and Control\n\nJWICS can utilize satellite network connections, and the traffic moving across the network can be sent in prioritized premarked packets, meaning that the most important and   sensitive information can be sent on the fastest and most secure routes ... Once transmitted, the information is housed on JWICS and is accessible from \"highly secured rooms known as Secret Compartmentalized Information Facilities. Such rooms are incredibly important facilities, and can be highly vulnerable if compromised.\n\n== JWICS, WikiLeaks, and Chelsea Manning ==\nThe vulnerability of secure networks such as JWICS to insider threats was revealed with the leak of hundreds of thousands of secret US intelligence documents, the largest in US history at the time. At the epicenter of these leaks was an intelligence analyst, Chelsea Manning. While serving in Iraq in 2010, Manning accessed JWICS, along with its lower-level counterpart SIPRNET, to leak documents to WikiLeaks, a non-profit platform for whistleblowers headed by Julian Assange. Manning was directly involved in the leaks known as \"Collateral Murder,\" \"The Iraqi War Logs,\" \"The Afghan War Diary,\" and \"Cablegate\". Manning is allegedly responsible for the leaking of over 700,000 files. At the time this was the largest data leak in US military history. Manning was arrested in late 2010 after confiding in fellow hacker, Adrian Lamo, who reported Manning to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.It is believed that Manning's decision to supply the files to WikiLeaks began partly as a result of directly experiencing \"war porn\", graphic videos watched by analysts for entertainment. A notable video viewed by Manning that would later also capture public attention involved a US Apache helicopter firing on civilians. This video would be named \"Collateral Murder.\" Manning was also uncomfortable with and perceived censorship of Iraqi citizens in their published opinions on government, and the \"don't ask, don't tell\" construct surrounding homosexuality in the US military. All of this information was contained in secure networks such as JWICS, causing their legitimacy as a form of a protection, rather than censorship, to be widely scrutinized in media and academic discourse.Manning was sentenced in 2013 to 35 years at Fort Leavenworth. This sentence was commuted by the Obama administration for release after 7 years in 2017. Manning was again jailed after refusing to testify at the grand jury investigation against Wikileaks, and was released in March 2020.The events surrounding Manning led to widespread reforms. Training and monitoring is now in place to identify risk factors in analysts to prevent them using their position to leak documents from secure networks. In addition, more widespread monitoring of the daily use of networks is undertaken. Cybersecurity concerns are often discussed with a focus on hacking and external threats, but Mark Ambidner of The Atlantic highlighted the susceptibility of defense networks to trusted actors:\n\nAll it took was one disaffected young man [Sic] with a rudimentary knowledge of computer systems to bring down an entire edifice of code names, secret networks, compartmented channels, and protected information.\n\n== Public interest ==\nSome argue from a pro-public interest perspective that JWICS allows government to manipulate releases of information (as occurred in \"Collateral Murder\") to shirk accountability for wrongdoings.Others, who take a more conservative approach to information release, cite the importance of protecting troops on the ground and deny the idea that full transparency is essential for democracy.\n\n\n*** Arguments ***\n\nWith the development of secure intranet networks and the increased use of technology in government and military operations, networks such as JWICS have come under scrutiny due to their perceived capacity to keep public interest information behind closed networks.At the heart of pro-public interest arguments is the desire to hold governments accountable for their wrongdoings. Academics posit that pre-1991 there was a layer of separation allowing organizations to be selective about what they released to the public. Thus, the advent of the World Wide Web in 1991 was viewed as a triumph of public interest, allowing individuals to \"freely share what they knew.\" Since then, however, the development of secure networks such as JWICS has reinstated levels of separation between individuals and government and has again prevented the public from holding government to account. This has been exacerbated since 9/11 with the war on terror providing a 'scape-goat' for governments in hiding public interest information (such as the shooting of Iraqi journalists in \"collateral murder\") under the guise of protecting against foreign interests and terrorism.One of the main pro-protection arguments surrounding JWICS is that JWICS is essential to prevent the identities of individuals from being released. By releasing these documents en-masse without adequate care, leakers are putting these individuals at risk. In the case of military operations, JWICS is also said to protect troops on the ground by safeguarding their strategy and movements.Pro-protection parties argue that leaking agents such as Wikileaks need to better censor the identities of individuals contained in their leaks to prevent harm.In several of WikiLeaks' leaks involving JWICS in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, they worked alongside publications such as the New York Times. In publishing documents, the Times  employed censorship efforts, consulting the CIA and the DoD about what to omit from their publication.The central counterargument to protection is that releases must balance the opposing forces of public interest and potential harm. Pro-public interest speaker Simon Jenkins states that \"The Job of Media is not to protect power from embarrassment.\" Nonetheless, from a pro-protection standpoint, media does have a role in defining the limits of public interest in their publications to protect the safety of certain stakeholders.\n\n== Counterterrorism ==\nJWICS operates as the highest level network in the DoD's information cyberspace. It is a controlled network, and the information contained within it is of great importance to both the US, and other parties looking for information.Because of its importance, a key issue surrounding JWICS is the threat of cyberterrorism. Foundations like JWICS present critically important assets that if infiltrated, can lead to information and/or strategic advantages. This is not dissimilar to how strategic points like bases or fortresses would be infiltrated in regular warfare.The vulnerability of cyber networks lies in their construction. Structures are created through software written by individuals whose mistakes create vulnerabilities for those who want to protect information, and opportunities for those seeking it. In addition, cyberterrorism is not restricted by geographical bounds. Networks can be hacked remotely from across the globe without warning. This creates jurisdictional issues for enforcement.A key vulnerability for secret level networks such as JWICS is what is described as a 'sneakernet threat.' These systems are designed to be separate from the unclassified internet, creating a protection from malware. However, the systems also rely on users uploading documents from the internet. This creates a risk of viruses being passed on along with the information into the secure system.An example of this threat came to reality in 2008 when Russian malware made its way into the SIPRNET system by way of a thumb-drive which was plugged into classified-level computers accessing the network. These computers lacked virus protection due to their detachment from the internet, and were compromised as a result. The virus, once gaining access to these networks, acted as a 'beachhead' which allowed the transfer of data to foreign computers The hack was, at the time, the largest compromise of US cybersecurity in history, and initially led to a ban on the use of thumb-drives. this was later repealed.JWICS is structured slightly differently to SIPRNET. JWICS is accessed via \"terminals\" in protected facilities known as Secret Compartmentalized Information Facilities. These physical facilities are highly protected as physical structures. This is because they present strategic advantage. If one terminal is accessed by an enemy, all of JWICS is available to them until that terminal is disconnected from the network. Because of JWICS' structure, allowing access only through secure facilities, it is relatively protected from outside threats. However, there is an intrinsic vulnerability in JWICS that is summarized by Clarke and Knake in Cyber War: The Next Threat to National Security and What to do About It:\n\nAccess to these terminals is more restricted because of their location, but the information flowing on the network still has to go across fiber optic cables and through routers and servers, just as with any other network. Routers can be attacked to cut communications. The hardware used ... can all be compromised at the point of manufacture of later one. Therefore we cannot assume that even this network is reliable.\nThe mounting threat to US cybersecurity has led to some developments surrounding defense. In 2011, Leon Panetta and other intelligence officials gave statements about the growing vulnerability of the US to cyber attacks. This stemmed from Pentagon Reports about critical security breaches in government and business networks.Since then the Department of Defense has rolled out and continually developed 'Einstein' software aimed at detecting and preventing intrusion into federal government networks. In addition, \"the Department of Homeland Security and the NSA signed a memorandum of understanding the improve collaboration between the agencies.\"The 2008 Russian infiltration of SIPRNET led to large reforms in terms of defense strategy. In 2008, then defense Secretary Robert Gates moved to create a dedicated infrastructure dealing specializing with cyber warfare strategy \u2013 the Cyber Command. Cyber command was originally designed by Colonel Paul Nakasone, Lieutenant Colonel Jen Easterly, Navy Captain T. J. White, and Air Force Colonel Stephen Davis. These four became colloquially known as 'The Four Horsemen' and set out to create the framework for Cyber Command, the US's dedicated cyber-strategy wing.In 2016, Cyber Command gained separation from the NSA, elevating it to have a direct line to the White House. The Trump administration has further stretched the team's authority, allowing them to take a more offensive approach to cyber strategy.\nHow does JWICS help ensure the safety of US military interests and personnel?Q: What networks does the JWICS supersede and what type of information did they handle?Q: How is JWICS different from SIPRNET in terms of the type of information they handle?Q: What is the role of satellite network connections in JWICS?Q: What are Secret Compartmentalized Information Facilities and how are they related to JWICS?Q: How did Chelsea Manning access JWICS and what was her role in the leaks to WikiLeaks?Q: What were some of the factors that led to Chelsea Manning's decision to leak classified documents?Q: What are some of the arguments for and against the use of secure intranet networks such as JWICS?Q: What is a 'sneakernet threat' and how can it affect secret level networks such as JWICS?Q: How does the structure of JWICS make it relatively protected from outside threats?Q: What measures has the US Department of Defense taken to detect and prevent intrusion into federal government networks?Q: Who are 'The Four Horsemen' and what role did they play in the creation of the US's dedicated cyber-strategy wing?Q: How has the authority of Cyber Command changed under the Trump administration?Q: What was the largest compromise of US cybersecurity in history and how did it occur?Q: What was the response to the 2008 Russian infiltration of SIPRNET?",

Cares in the Encyclopedia of Cyber Warfare: See Joint All-Domain Command and Control\n\nJWICS can utilize satellite network connections, and the traffic moving across the network can be sent in prioritized premarked packets, meaning that the most important and   sensitive information can be sent on the fastest and most secure routes ... Once transmitted, the information is housed on JWICS and is accessible from \"highly secured rooms known as Secret Compartmentalized Information Facilities. Such rooms are incredibly important facilities, and can be highly vulnerable if compromised.\n\n== JWICS, WikiLeaks, and Chelsea Manning ==\nThe vulnerability of secure networks such as JWICS to insider threats was revealed with the leak of hundreds of thousands of secret US intelligence documents, the largest in US history at the time. At the epicenter of these leaks was an intelligence analyst, Chelsea Manning. While serving in Iraq in 2010, Manning accessed JWICS, along with its lower-level counterpart SIPRNET, to leak documents to WikiLeaks, a non-profit platform for whistleblowers headed by Julian Assange. Manning was directly involved in the leaks known as \"Collateral Murder,\" \"The Iraqi War Logs,\" \"The Afghan War Diary,\" and \"Cablegate\". Manning is allegedly responsible for the leaking of over 700,000 files. At the time this was the largest data leak in US military history. Manning was arrested in late 2010 after confiding in fellow hacker, Adrian Lamo, who reported Manning to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.It is believed that Manning's decision to supply the files to WikiLeaks began partly as a result of directly experiencing \"war porn\", graphic videos watched by analysts for entertainment. A notable video viewed by Manning that would later also capture public attention involved a US Apache helicopter firing on civilians. This video would be named \"Collateral Murder.\" Manning was also uncomfortable with and perceived censorship of Iraqi citizens in their published opinions on government, and the \"don't ask, don't tell\" construct surrounding homosexuality in the US military. All of this information was contained in secure networks such as JWICS, causing their legitimacy as a form of a protection, rather than censorship, to be widely scrutinized in media and academic discourse.Manning was sentenced in 2013 to 35 years at Fort Leavenworth. This sentence was commuted by the Obama administration for release after 7 years in 2017. Manning was again jailed after refusing to testify at the grand jury investigation against Wikileaks, and was released in March 2020.The events surrounding Manning led to widespread reforms. Training and monitoring is now in place to identify risk factors in analysts to prevent them using their position to leak documents from secure networks. In addition, more widespread monitoring of the daily use of networks is undertaken. Cybersecurity concerns are often discussed with a focus on hacking and external threats, but Mark Ambidner of The Atlantic highlighted the susceptibility of defense networks to trusted actors:\n\nAll it took was one disaffected young man [Sic] with a rudimentary knowledge of computer systems to bring down an entire edifice of code names, secret networks, compartmented channels, and protected information.\n\n== Public interest ==\nSome argue from a pro-public interest perspective that JWICS allows government to manipulate releases of information (as occurred in \"Collateral Murder\") to shirk accountability for wrongdoings.Others, who take a more conservative approach to information release, cite the importance of protecting troops on the ground and deny the idea that full transparency is essential for democracy.\n\n\n*** Arguments ***\n\nWith the development of secure intranet networks and the increased use of technology in government and military operations, networks such as JWICS have come under scrutiny due to their perceived capacity to keep public interest information behind closed networks.At the heart of pro-public interest arguments is the desire to hold governments accountable for their wrongdoings. Academics posit that pre-1991 there was a layer of separation allowing organizations to be selective about what they released to the public. Thus, the advent of the World Wide Web in 1991 was viewed as a triumph of public interest, allowing individuals to \"freely share what they knew.\" Since then, however, the development of secure networks such as JWICS has reinstated levels of separation between individuals and government and has again prevented the public from holding government to account. This has been exacerbated since 9/11 with the war on terror providing a 'scape-goat' for governments in hiding public interest information (such as the shooting of Iraqi journalists in \"collateral murder\") under the guise of protecting against foreign interests and terrorism.One of the main pro-protection arguments surrounding JWICS is that JWICS is essential to prevent the identities of individuals from being released. By releasing these documents en-masse without adequate care, leakers are putting these individuals at risk. In the case of military operations, JWICS is also said to protect troops on the ground by safeguarding their strategy and movements.Pro-protection parties argue that leaking agents such as Wikileaks need to better censor the identities of individuals contained in their leaks to prevent harm.In several of WikiLeaks' leaks involving JWICS in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, they worked alongside publications such as the New York Times. In publishing documents, the Times  employed censorship efforts, consulting the CIA and the DoD about what to omit from their publication.The central counterargument to protection is that releases must balance the opposing forces of public interest and potential harm. Pro-public interest speaker Simon Jenkins states that \"The Job of Media is not to protect power from embarrassment.\" Nonetheless, from a pro-protection standpoint, media does have a role in defining the limits of public interest in their publications to protect the safety of certain stakeholders.\n\n== Counterterrorism ==\nJWICS operates as the highest level network in the DoD's information cyberspace. It is a controlled network, and the information contained within it is of great importance to both the US, and other parties looking for information.Because of its importance, a key issue surrounding JWICS is the threat of cyberterrorism. Foundations like JWICS present critically important assets that if infiltrated, can lead to information and/or strategic advantages. This is not dissimilar to how strategic points like bases or fortresses would be infiltrated in regular warfare.The vulnerability of cyber networks lies in their construction. Structures are created through software written by individuals whose mistakes create vulnerabilities for those who want to protect information, and opportunities for those seeking it. In addition, cyberterrorism is not restricted by geographical bounds. Networks can be hacked remotely from across the globe without warning. This creates jurisdictional issues for enforcement.A key vulnerability for secret level networks such as JWICS is what is described as a 'sneakernet threat.' These systems are designed to be separate from the unclassified internet, creating a protection from malware. However, the systems also rely on users uploading documents from the internet. This creates a risk of viruses being passed on along with the information into the secure system.An example of this threat came to reality in 2008 when Russian malware made its way into the SIPRNET system by way of a thumb-drive which was plugged into classified-level computers accessing the network. These computers lacked virus protection due to their detachment from the internet, and were compromised as a result. The virus, once gaining access to these networks, acted as a 'beachhead' which allowed the transfer of data to foreign computers The hack was, at the time, the largest compromise of US cybersecurity in history, and initially led to a ban on the use of thumb-drives. this was later repealed.JWICS is structured slightly differently to SIPRNET. JWICS is accessed via \"terminals\" in protected facilities known as Secret Compartmentalized Information Facilities. These physical facilities are highly protected as physical structures. This is because they present strategic advantage. If one terminal is accessed by an enemy, all of JWICS is available to them until that terminal is disconnected from the network. Because of JWICS' structure, allowing access only through secure facilities, it is relatively protected from outside threats. However, there is an intrinsic vulnerability in JWICS that is summarized by Clarke and Knake in Cyber War: The Next Threat to National Security and What to do About It:\n\nAccess to these terminals is more restricted because of their location, but the information flowing on the network still has to go across fiber optic cables and through routers and servers, just as with any other network. Routers can be attacked to cut communications. The hardware used ... can all be compromised at the point of manufacture of later one. Therefore we cannot assume that even this network is reliable.\nThe mounting threat to US cybersecurity has led to some developments surrounding defense. In 2011, Leon Panetta and other intelligence officials gave statements about the growing vulnerability of the US to cyber attacks. This stemmed from Pentagon Reports about critical security breaches in government and business networks.Since then the Department of Defense has rolled out and continually developed 'Einstein' software aimed at detecting and preventing intrusion into federal government networks. In addition, \"the Department of Homeland Security and the NSA signed a memorandum of understanding the improve collaboration between the agencies.\"The 2008 Russian infiltration of SIPRNET led to large reforms in terms of defense strategy. In 2008, then defense Secretary Robert Gates moved to create a dedicated infrastructure dealing specializing with cyber warfare strategy \u2013 the Cyber Command. Cyber command was originally designed by Colonel Paul Nakasone, Lieutenant Colonel Jen Easterly, Navy Captain T. J. White, and Air Force Colonel Stephen Davis. These four became colloquially known as 'The Four Horsemen' and set out to create the framework for Cyber Command, the US's dedicated cyber-strategy wing.In 2016, Cyber Command gained separation from the NSA, elevating it to have a direct line to the White House. The Trump administration has further stretched the team's authority, allowing them to take a more offensive approach to cyber strategy.",

    "instruction": "Underhanded C Contest\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Underhanded C Contest is a programming contest to turn out code that is malicious, but passes a rigorous inspection, and looks like an honest mistake even if discovered. The contest rules define a task, and a malicious component. Entries must perform the task in a malicious manner as defined by the contest, and hide the malice. Contestants are allowed to use C-like compiled languages to make their programs.The contest was organized by Dr. Scott Craver of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Binghamton University. The contest was initially inspired by Daniel Horn's Obfuscated V contest in the fall of 2004. For the 2005 to 2008 contests, the prize was a $100 gift certificate to ThinkGeek. The 2009 contest had its prize increased to $200 due to the very late announcement of winners, and the prize for the 2013 contest is also a $200 gift certificate.\n\n\n\n== Contests ==\n\n\n*** 2005 ***\nThe 2005 contest had the task of basic image processing, such as resampling or smoothing, but covertly inserting unique and useful \"fingerprinting\" data into the image. Winning entries from 2005 used uninitialized data structures, reuse of pointers, and an embedding of machine code in constants.\n\n\n*** 2006 ***\nThe 2006 contest required entries to count word occurrences, but have vastly different runtimes on different platforms. To accomplish the task, entries used fork implementation errors, optimization problems, endian differences and various API implementation differences. The winner called strlen() in a loop, leading to quadratic complexity which was optimized out by a Linux compiler but not by Windows.\n\n\n*** 2007 ***\nThe 2007 contest required entries to encrypt and decrypt files with a strong, readily available encryption algorithm such that a low percentage (1% - 0.01%) of the encrypted files may be cracked in a reasonably short time. The contest commenced on April 16 and ended on July 4.  Entries used misimplementations of RC4, misused API calls, and incorrect function prototypes.\n\n\n*** 2008 ***\nThe 2008 contest required entries to redact a rectangular portion of a PPM image in a way that the portion may be reconstructed. Any method of \"blocking out\" the rectangle was allowed, as long as the original pixels were removed, and the pixel reconstruction didn't have to be perfect (although the reconstruction's fidelity to the original file would be a factor in judging).  The contest began on June 12, and ended on September 30.  Entries tended to either xor the region with a retrievable pseudo-random mask or append the masked data to the end of the file format.  The second placing programs both used improperly defined macros while the winner, choosing to work with an uncommon text based format, zeroed out pixel values while keeping the number of digits intact.\n\n\n*** 2009 ***\nThe 2009 contest required participants to write a program that sifts through routing directives but redirects a piece of luggage based on some innocuous-looking comment in the space-delimited input data file. The contest began December 29, 2009, and was due to end on March 1, 2010. However, no activity occurred for three years. The winners were only announced on April 1, 2013, with one overall winner and six runners-up.\n\n\n*** 2013 ***\nThe 2013 contest was announced on April 1, 2013, and was due July 4, 2013; results were announced on September 29, 2014. It was about a fictional social website called \"ObsessBook\". The challenge was to write a function to compute the DERPCON (Degrees of Edge-Reachable Personal CONnection) between two users that \"accidentally\" computes a too low distance for a special user.\n\n\n*** 2014 ***\nThe 2014 contest was announced on November 2, 2014, and was due January 1, 2015. The results were announced on June 1, 2015.  The objective was to write surveillance code for a Twitter-like social networking service, to comply with a secret government surveillance request; but for non-obvious reasons, the code must subtly leak the act of surveillance to a user. The general approach is to obfuscate writes to the user data as writing to surveillance data, and the winning entry did so by implementing a buggy time-checking function that overwrites the input.\n\n\n*** 2015 ***\nThe 2015 contest was announced on August 15, 2015, and was due November 15, 2015. The results were announced on January 15, 2016. The scenario was a nuclear disarmament process between the Peoples Glorious Democratic Republic of Alice and the Glorious Democratic Peoples Republic of Bob (Alice and Bob), and the mission was to write a test function for comparing potentially fissile material against a reference sample, which under certain circumstances would label a warhead as containing fissile material when it doesn't.

      "answers": "The Underhanded C Contest encourages programmers to create malicious code that appears innocent by challenging them to write a program that performs a specific task in a malicious manner, while also making the malice difficult to detect. This is achieved by defining a task and a malicious component, and contestants must fulfill both requirements in order to win.A: The Underhanded C Contest was initially organized by Dr. Scott Craver of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Binghamton University in 2005. It was inspired by Daniel Horn's Obfuscated V contest and aims to encourage programmers to create malicious code that is difficult to detect, making it a valuable platform for raising awareness about the importance of cybersecurity.A: The winning entries in the 2005 Underhanded C Contest used various techniques to hide their malicious intent, such as using uninitialized data structures, reusing pointers, and embedding machine code in constants. These techniques allowed the entries to fulfill the task requirement while also covertly inserting unique and useful \"fingerprinting\" data into the image.A: The 2006 Underhanded C Contest required entries to count word occurrences, but have vastly different runtimes on different platforms. The winner called strlen() in a loop, leading to quadratic complexity, which was optimized out by a Linux compiler but not by Windows. This resulted in a significant difference in runtime between the two platforms, making the malicious intent difficult to detect.A: The 2007 Underhanded C Contest required entries to encrypt and decrypt files with a strong, readily available encryption algorithm, such that a low percentage (1% - 0.01%) of the encrypted files may be cracked in a reasonably short time. Entries used misimplementations of RC4, misused API calls, and incorrect function prototypes to accomplish this task.A: The entries in the 2008 Underhanded C Contest tended to either xor the region with a retrievable pseudo-random mask or append the masked data to the end of the file format. Additionally, the second placing programs both used improperly defined macros, while the winner, working with an uncommon text-based format, zeroed out pixel values while keeping the number of digits intact.A: The 2009 Underhanded C Contest required participants to write a program that sifts through routing directives but redirects a piece of luggage based on some innocuous-looking comment in the space-delimited input data file. This was different from previous contests as it required participants to create a program that subtly manipulated data based on a specific input, rather than exploiting programming errors or misusing APIs.A: The 2013 Underhanded C Contest was about a fictional social website called \"ObsessBook\". The challenge was to write a function to compute the DERPCON (Degrees of Edge-Reachable Personal CONnection) between two users that \"accidentally\" computes a too low distance for a special user. This required participants to write a function that appeared to compute a distance between two users, but subtly manipulated the result for a specific user.A: The 2014 Underhanded C Contest required participants to write surveillance code for a Twitter-like social networking service that subtly leaked the act of surveillance to a user. The winning entry implemented a buggy time-checking function that overwrote the input, thereby obfuscating writes to the user data as writing to surveillance data.A: The 2015 Underhanded C Contest was about a nuclear disarmament process between two countries, Alice and Bob. The mission was to write a test function for comparing potentially fissile material against a reference sample, which under certain circumstances would label a warhead as containing fissile material when it doesn't. The most common technique used by the submissions was NaN poisoning by erroneous floating-point operations.A: The winning entry in the 2015 Underhanded C Contest used a confusion of datatypes between double and float to distort values, rather than using the more common technique of NaN poisoning by erroneous floating-point operations.A: The entries in the 2008 Underhanded C Contest were required to redact a rectangular portion of a PPM image. The winner chose to work with an uncommon text-based format and zeroed out pixel values while keeping the number of digits intact. This allowed the winner to fulfill the task requirement while also hiding the malicious intent.A: The winner in the 2006 Underhanded C Contest called strlen() in a loop, leading to quadratic complexity, which was optimized out by a Linux compiler but not by Windows. This resulted in a significant difference in runtime between the two platforms, making the malicious intent difficult to detect.A: The malicious component in the 2005 Underhanded C Contest was to covertly insert unique and useful \"fingerprinting\" data into the image. The winning entries used uninitialized data structures, reuse of pointers, and an embedding of machine code in constants to fulfill this requirement.A: The winning entry in the 2014 Underhanded C Contest implemented a buggy time-checking function that overwrote the input, thereby obfuscating writes to the user data as writing to surveillance data. This allowed the entry to fulfill the task requirement while also hiding the malicious intent.A: The second placing programs in the 2008 Underhanded C Contest both used improperly defined macros, which allowed them to exploit the PPM image format and fulfill the task requirement while also hiding the malicious intent.A: The winning entry in the 2015 Underhanded C Contest used a confusion of datatypes between double and float to distort values by taking advantage of the different ranges and precisions of the two data types. This allowed the entry to fulfill the task requirement while also hiding the malicious intent.A: The 2009 Underhanded C Contest required participants to write a program that sifts through routing directives but redirects a piece of luggage based on some innocuous-looking comment in the space-delimited input data file. This was different from previous contests as it required participants to create a program that subtly manipulated data based on a specific input, rather than exploiting programming errors or misusing APIs. Additionally, the contest had no activity for three years, making it unique in its lack of urgency."

    "instruction": "Read this and answer the below questions\n\nPacket drop attack\n\n==Introduction==\nIn computer networking, a packet drop attack or blackhole attack is a type of denial-of-service attack in which a router that is supposed to relay packets instead discards them. This usually occurs from a router becoming compromised from a number of different causes. One cause mentioned in research is through a denial-of-service attack on the router using a known DDoS tool.  Because packets are routinely dropped from a lossy network, the packet drop attack is very hard to detect and prevent.\nThe malicious router can also accomplish this attack selectively, e.g. by dropping packets for a particular network destination, at a certain time of the day, a packet every n packets or every t seconds, or a randomly selected portion of the packets. If the malicious router attempts to drop all packets that come in, the attack can actually be discovered fairly quickly through common networking tools such as traceroute. Also, when other routers notice that the compromised router is dropping all traffic, they will generally begin to remove that router from their forwarding tables and eventually no traffic will flow to the attack.  However, if the malicious router begins dropping packets on a specific time period or over every n packets, it is often harder to detect because some traffic still flows across the network.The packet drop attack can be frequently deployed to attack wireless ad hoc networks. Because wireless networks have a much different architecture than that of a typical wired network, a host can broadcast that it has the shortest path towards a destination. By doing this, all traffic will be directed to the host that has been compromised, and the host is able to drop packets at will. Also over a mobile ad hoc network, hosts are specifically vulnerable to collaborative attacks where multiple hosts will become compromised and deceive the other hosts on the network.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can a packet drop attack be used to target specific networks or time periods, and what makes it difficult to detect in these scenarios?Question: How can packet drop attacks be deployed in wireless ad hoc networks, and what makes these networks particularly vulnerable to such attacks?Question: How can a router become compromised and start performing a packet drop attack, and what are some potential countermeasures against this type of attack?",

    "instruction": "Real-time adaptive security\n\n==Introduction==\nReal-time Adaptive Security is the network security model necessary to accommodate the emergence of multiple perimeters and moving parts on the network, and increasingly advanced threats targeting enterprises.

    "instruction": "Here are some questions about this text: XML Signature\n\n==Introduction==\nXML Signature (also called XMLDSig, XML-DSig, XML-Sig) defines an XML syntax for digital signatures and is defined in the W3C recommendation XML Signature Syntax and Processing. Functionally, it has much in common with PKCS #7 but is more extensible and geared towards signing XML documents. It is used by various Web technologies such as SOAP, SAML, and others.\nXML signatures can be used to sign data\u2013a resource\u2013of any type, typically XML documents, but anything that is accessible via a URL can be signed. An XML signature used to sign a resource outside its containing XML document is called a detached signature; if it is used to sign some part of its containing document, it is called an enveloped signature; if it contains the signed data within itself it is called an enveloping signature.\n\n== Structure ==\nAn XML Signature consists of a Signature element in the http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig# namespace. The basic structure is as follows:\n\nThe SignedInfo element contains or references the signed data and specifies what algorithms are used.\nThe SignatureMethod and CanonicalizationMethod elements are used by the SignatureValue element and are included in SignedInfo to protect them from tampering.\nOne or more Reference elements specify the resource being signed by URI reference and any transformations to be applied to the resource prior to signing.\nTransforms contains the transformations applied to the resource prior to signing. A transformation can be a XPath-expression that selects a defined subset of the document tree.\nDigestMethod specifies the hash algorithm before applying the hash.\nDigestValue contains the Base64 encoded result of applying the hash algorithm to the transformed resource(s) defined in the Reference element attributes.\nThe SignatureValue element contains the Base64 encoded signature result - the signature generated with the parameters specified in the SignatureMethod element - of the SignedInfo element after applying the algorithm specified by the CanonicalizationMethod.\nKeyInfo element optionally allows the signer to provide recipients with the key that validates the signature, usually in the form of one or more X.509 digital certificates. The relying party must identify the key from context if KeyInfo is not present.\nThe Object element (optional) contains the signed data if this is an enveloping signature.\n\n== Validation and security considerations ==\nWhen validating an XML Signature, a procedure called Core Validation is followed.\n\nReference Validation: Each Reference's digest is verified by retrieving the corresponding resource and applying any transforms and then the specified digest method to it. The result is compared to the recorded DigestValue; if they do not match, validation fails.\nSignature Validation: The SignedInfo element is serialized using the canonicalization method specified in CanonicalizationMethod, the key data is retrieved using KeyInfo or by other means, and the signature is verified using the method specified in SignatureMethod.This procedure establishes whether the resources were really signed by the alleged party. However, because of the extensibility of the canonicalization and transform methods, the verifying party must also make sure that what was actually signed or digested is really what was present in the original data, in other words, that the algorithms used there can be trusted not to change the meaning of the signed data.\nBecause the signed document's structure can be tampered with leading to \"signature wrapping\" attacks, the validation process should also cover XML document structure. Signed element and signature element should be selected using absolute XPath expression, not getElementByName methods.\n\n== XML canonicalization ==\nThe creation of XML Signatures is substantially more complex than the creation of an ordinary digital signature because a given XML Document (an \"Infoset\", in common usage among XML developers) may have more than one legal serialized representation. For example, whitespace inside an XML Element is not syntactically significant, so that <Elem > is syntactically identical to <Elem>.\nSince the digital signature ensures data integrity, a single-byte difference would cause the signature to vary. Moreover, if an XML document is transferred from computer to computer, the line terminator may be changed from CR to LF to CR LF, etc. A program that digests and validates an XML document may later render the XML document in a different way, e.g. adding excess space between attribute definitions with an element definition, or using relative (vs. absolute) URLs, or by reordering namespace definitions. Canonical XML is especially important when an XML Signature refers to a remote document, which may be rendered in time-varying ways by an errant remote server.\nTo avoid these problems and guarantee that logically-identical XML documents give identical digital signatures, an XML canonicalization transform (frequently abbreviated C14n) is employed when signing XML documents (for signing the SignedInfo, a canonicalization is mandatory). These algorithms guarantee that semantically-identical documents produce exactly identical serialized representations.\nAnother complication arises because of the way that the default canonicalization algorithm handles namespace declarations; frequently a signed XML document needs to be embedded in another document; in this case the original canonicalization algorithm will not yield the same result as if the document is treated alone. For this reason, the so-called Exclusive Canonicalization, which serializes XML namespace declarations independently of the surrounding XML, was created.\n\n== Benefits ==\nXML Signature is more flexible than other forms of digital signatures such as Pretty Good Privacy and Cryptographic Message Syntax, because it does not operate on binary data, but on the XML Infoset, allowing to work on subsets of the data (this is also possible with binary data in non-standard ways, for example encoding blocks of binary data in base64 ASCII), having various ways to bind the signature and signed information, and perform transformations. Another core concept is canonicalization, that is to sign only the \"essence\", eliminating meaningless differences like whitespace and line endings.\n\n== Issues ==\nThere are criticisms directed at the architecture of XML security in general, and at the suitability of XML canonicalization in particular as a front end to signing and encrypting XML data due to its complexity, inherent processing requirement, and poor performance characteristics. The argument is that performing XML canonicalization causes excessive latency that is simply too much to overcome for transactional, performance sensitive SOA applications.\nThese issues are being addressed in the XML Security Working Group.Without proper policy and implementation the use of XML Dsig in SOAP and WS-Security can lead to vulnerabilities, such as XML signature wrapping.\n\n== Applications ==\nAn example of applications of XML Signatures:\n\nDigital signing of XBRL annual reports by auditors in the Netherlands. A PKIoverheid X.509 certificate, approved by the Royal National Institute of Chartered Accountants, is required. The electronic signature is legally binding. The SBR Assurance standard is part of the Dutch Standard Business Reporting program.\nWhat are the answers to these questions: How does XML Signature ensure data integrity in the presence of multiple serialized representations of an XML document?question: What is the role of the SignedInfo element in an XML Signature?question: How does XML Signature provide recipients with the key to validate the signature?question: What is the difference between an enveloped signature and a detached signature in XML Signature?question: How does XML Signature handle namespace declarations during canonicalization?question: What are some benefits of using XML Signature compared to other forms of digital signatures?question: What are some issues with the architecture of XML security and XML canonicalization?question: How does XML Signature help prevent signature wrapping attacks?question: What is the significance of the DigestValue element in an XML Signature?question: What is the purpose of the SignatureMethod element in an XML Signature?question: How does the validation process for XML Signatures establish the authenticity of the signed resources?question: What is the role of the Object element in an XML Signature?",

    "instruction": "Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG) is a unit of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British intelligence agency. The existence of JTRIG was revealed as part of the global surveillance disclosures in documents leaked by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.\n\n== Mission ==\n\nThe scope of the JTRIG's mission includes using \"dirty tricks\" to \"destroy, deny, degrade [and] disrupt\" enemies by \"discrediting\" them, planting misinformation and shutting down their communications. Known as \"Effects\" operations, the work of JTRIG had become a \"major part\" of GCHQ's operations by 2010. Slides leaked by Snowden also disclose the deployment of \"honey traps\" of a sexual nature by British intelligence agents.\n\n== Operations ==\n\nIn 2011, the JTRIG conducted a denial-of-service attack (DoS) on the activist network Anonymous. Other JTRIG targets have included the government of Iran and the Taliban in Afghanistan.Campaigns operated by JTRIG have broadly fallen into two categories; cyber attacks and propaganda efforts. The propaganda efforts (named \"Online Covert Action\" utilize \"mass messaging\" and the \"pushing [of] stories\" via the medium of Twitter, Flickr, Facebook and YouTube. Online \"false flag\" operations are also used by JTRIG against targets. JTRIG have also changed photographs on social media sites, as well as emailing and texting colleagues and neighbours with \"unsavory information\" about the targeted individual.JTRIG developed a URL shortening service called Lurl.me to manipulate and collect intelligence on social media users. The service was used to spread pro-revolution messages in the Middle East during the Arab Spring.A computer virus named Ambassadors Reception has been used by GCHQ \"in a variety of different areas\" and has been described in the slides as \"very effective.\" The virus can \"encrypt itself, delete all emails, encrypt all files, [and] make [the] screen shake\" when sent to adversaries. The virus can also block a user from logging on to their computer. Information obtained by GCHQ is also used in \"close access technical operations,\" in which targets are physically observed by intelligence officers, sometimes in person at hotels. Telephone calls can also be listened to and hotel computers tapped, the documents asking \"Can we influence hotel choice? Can we cancel their visits?\".In a \"honey trap\", an identified target is lured \"to go somewhere on the Internet, or a physical location\" to be met by \"a friendly face\", with the aim to discredit them. A \"honey trap\" is described as \"very successful when it works\" by the slides. The disclosures also revealed the technique of \"credential harvesting\", in which journalists could be used to disseminate information and identify non-British journalists who, once manipulated, could give information to the intended target of a secret campaign, perhaps providing access during an interview. It is unknown whether the journalists would be aware that they were being manipulated.A JTRIG operation saw GCHQ \"significantly disrupt\" the communications of the Taliban in Afghanistan with a \"blizzard\" of faxes, phone calls and text messages scheduled to arrive every minute. Specific JTRIG operations also targeted the nuclear programme of Iran with negative information on blogs attacking private companies, to affect business relationships and scupper business deals.JTRIG also undertook cyber-operations as part of a wider GCHQ mission to prevent the Argentine takeover of the Falkland Islands. The scope of the cyber tactics used in this operation was unclear.

      "context": "Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG) is a unit of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British intelligence agency. The existence of JTRIG was revealed as part of the global surveillance disclosures in documents leaked by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.\n\n== Mission ==\n\nThe scope of the JTRIG's mission includes using \"dirty tricks\" to \"destroy, deny, degrade [and] disrupt\" enemies by \"discrediting\" them, planting misinformation and shutting down their communications. Known as \"Effects\" operations, the work of JTRIG had become a \"major part\" of GCHQ's operations by 2010. Slides leaked by Snowden also disclose the deployment of \"honey traps\" of a sexual nature by British intelligence agents.\n\n== Operations ==\n\nIn 2011, the JTRIG conducted a denial-of-service attack (DoS) on the activist network Anonymous. Other JTRIG targets have included the government of Iran and the Taliban in Afghanistan.Campaigns operated by JTRIG have broadly fallen into two categories; cyber attacks and propaganda efforts. The propaganda efforts (named \"Online Covert Action\" utilize \"mass messaging\" and the \"pushing [of] stories\" via the medium of Twitter, Flickr, Facebook and YouTube. Online \"false flag\" operations are also used by JTRIG against targets. JTRIG have also changed photographs on social media sites, as well as emailing and texting colleagues and neighbours with \"unsavory information\" about the targeted individual.JTRIG developed a URL shortening service called Lurl.me to manipulate and collect intelligence on social media users. The service was used to spread pro-revolution messages in the Middle East during the Arab Spring.A computer virus named Ambassadors Reception has been used by GCHQ \"in a variety of different areas\" and has been described in the slides as \"very effective.\" The virus can \"encrypt itself, delete all emails, encrypt all files, [and] make [the] screen shake\" when sent to adversaries. The virus can also block a user from logging on to their computer. Information obtained by GCHQ is also used in \"close access technical operations,\" in which targets are physically observed by intelligence officers, sometimes in person at hotels. Telephone calls can also be listened to and hotel computers tapped, the documents asking \"Can we influence hotel choice? Can we cancel their visits?\".In a \"honey trap\", an identified target is lured \"to go somewhere on the Internet, or a physical location\" to be met by \"a friendly face\", with the aim to discredit them. A \"honey trap\" is described as \"very successful when it works\" by the slides. The disclosures also revealed the technique of \"credential harvesting\", in which journalists could be used to disseminate information and identify non-British journalists who, once manipulated, could give information to the intended target of a secret campaign, perhaps providing access during an interview. It is unknown whether the journalists would be aware that they were being manipulated.A JTRIG operation saw GCHQ \"significantly disrupt\" the communications of the Taliban in Afghanistan with a \"blizzard\" of faxes, phone calls and text messages scheduled to arrive every minute. Specific JTRIG operations also targeted the nuclear programme of Iran with negative information on blogs attacking private companies, to affect business relationships and scupper business deals.JTRIG also undertook cyber-operations as part of a wider GCHQ mission to prevent the Argentine takeover of the Falkland Islands. The scope of the cyber tactics used in this operation was unclear.

    "instruction": "text: MAC address anonymization\n\n==Introduction==\nMAC address anonymization performs a one-way function on a MAC address so that the result may be used in tracking systems for reporting and the general public, while making it nearly impossible to obtain the original MAC address from the result. The idea is that this process allows companies like Google, Apple and CrowdVision - which track users movements via computer hardware to simultaneously preserve the identities of the people they are tracking, as well as the hardware itself.\n\n\n\n== Flawed approaches ==\n\n\n*** Simple hashing ***\nAn example of MAC address anonymization would be to use a simple hash algorithm. Given an address of 11:22:33:44:55:66, the MD5 hash algorithm produces eb341820cd3a3485461a61b1e97d31b1 (32 hexadecimal digits). An address only one character different (11:22:33:44:55:67) produces 391907146439938c9821856fa181052e, an entirely different hash due to the avalanche effect.\nThe problem lies in the fact that there are only 248 (281,474,976,710,656) possible MAC addresses. Given the encoding algorithm, an index can easily be created for each possible address. By using rainbow table compression, the index can be made small enough to be portable. Building the index is an embarrassingly parallel problem, and so the work can be accelerated greatly e.g. by renting a large amount of cloud computing resources temporarily.\nFor example, if a single CPU can compute 1,000,000 encrypted MACs per second, then generating the full table takes 8.9 CPU-years. With a fleet of 1,000 CPUs, this would only take around 78 hours. Using a rainbow table with a \"depth\" of 1,000,000 hashes per entry, the resulting table would only contain a few hundred million entries (a few GB) and require 0.5 seconds (on average, ignoring I/O time) to reverse any encrypted MAC into its original form.\nIn 2018, academics found that with modern computing equipment with the ability to calculate 6 Giga MD5 hashes and 844 Mega SHA-256 hashes per second the authors are able to recover 100% of 1 million hashes in:\n4 minutes 1 second for MD5 hashes, and;\n13 minutes 22 seconds for SHA-256 respectively.\n\n\n*** Truncation ***\nAnother approach that has been tested is truncating the MAC Address by removing the Organizationally unique identifier (the first 24 bits of the 48 bit MAC Address). However, as only 0.1% of the total Organizationally unique identifier space has been allocated and not all manufacturers fully utilise their allocated MAC Address space, this fails to offer any meaningful privacy benefit. Furthermore, manufacturers will frequently assign contiguous address blocks to specific devices allows for fine-grained mapping of the devices in use - allowing the device type to be identified with only a small part of the MAC Address.\n\n== Ali and Dyo approach ==\nDue to the pitfalls of existing approaches, more robust anonymization approaches have been developed by academics. In particular, Junade Ali and Vladimir Dyo developed an approach which works by:\nUsing computationally expensive hash functions like Bcrypt to prevent background knowledge attacks\nTruncating the resulting hash to achieve K-anonymityThe degree to which a resulting hash is truncated is a balancing act between the privacy offered and the desired collision rate (the probability that one anonymised MAC Address will overlap with another). Previous work has suggested that it is therefore difficult to control the anonymity set size when using approximations of the Birthday Paradox.

    "instruction": "text: Trojan horse (computing)\n\n==Introduction==\nIn computing, a Trojan horse  is any malware that misleads users of its true intent by disguising itself as a standard program. The term is derived from the ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy.Trojans generally spread by some form of social engineering. For example, where a user is duped into executing an email attachment disguised to appear innocuous (e.g., a routine form to be filled in), or by clicking on some fake advertisement on social media or anywhere else. Although their payload can be anything, many modern forms act as a backdoor, contacting a controller who can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer. Ransomware attacks are often carried out using a Trojan.\nUnlike computer viruses and worms, Trojans generally do not attempt to inject themselves into other files or otherwise propagate themselves.\n\n== Use of the term ==\nIt's not clear where or when the concept, and this term for it, was first used, but by 1971 the first Unix manual assumed its readers knew both:\nAlso, one may not change the owner of a file with the set\u2014user\u2014ID bit on, otherwise one could create Trojan Horses able to misuse other\u2019s files.\nAnother early reference is in a US Air Force report in 1974 on the analysis of vulnerability in the Multics computer systems.It was made popular by Ken Thompson in his 1983 Turing Award acceptance lecture \"Reflections on Trusting Trust\", subtitled: To what extent should one trust a statement that a program is free of Trojan horses?  Perhaps it is more important to trust the people who wrote the software. He mentioned that he knew about the possible existence of Trojans from a report on the security of Multics.\n\n== Behavior ==\nOnce installed, Trojans may perform a range of malicious actions. Many tend to contact one or more Command and Control (C2) servers across the Internet and await instruction. Since individual Trojans typically use a specific set of ports for this communication, it can be relatively simple to detect them. Moreover, other malware could potentially \"take over\" the Trojan, using it as a proxy for malicious action.In German-speaking countries, spyware used or made by the government is sometimes called govware. Govware is typically a Trojan software used to intercept communications from the target computer. Some countries like Switzerland and Germany have a legal framework governing the use of such software. Examples of govware Trojans include the Swiss MiniPanzer and MegaPanzer and the German \"state Trojan\" nicknamed R2D2. German govware works by exploiting security gaps unknown to the general public and accessing smartphone data before it becomes encrypted via other applications.Due to the popularity of botnets among hackers and the availability of advertising services that permit authors to violate their users' privacy, Trojans are becoming more common.

      "context": "Trojan horse (computing)\n\n==Introduction==\nIn computing, a Trojan horse  is any malware that misleads users of its true intent by disguising itself as a standard program. The term is derived from the ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy.Trojans generally spread by some form of social engineering. For example, where a user is duped into executing an email attachment disguised to appear innocuous (e.g., a routine form to be filled in), or by clicking on some fake advertisement on social media or anywhere else. Although their payload can be anything, many modern forms act as a backdoor, contacting a controller who can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer. Ransomware attacks are often carried out using a Trojan.\nUnlike computer viruses and worms, Trojans generally do not attempt to inject themselves into other files or otherwise propagate themselves.\n\n== Use of the term ==\nIt's not clear where or when the concept, and this term for it, was first used, but by 1971 the first Unix manual assumed its readers knew both:\nAlso, one may not change the owner of a file with the set\u2014user\u2014ID bit on, otherwise one could create Trojan Horses able to misuse other\u2019s files.\nAnother early reference is in a US Air Force report in 1974 on the analysis of vulnerability in the Multics computer systems.It was made popular by Ken Thompson in his 1983 Turing Award acceptance lecture \"Reflections on Trusting Trust\", subtitled: To what extent should one trust a statement that a program is free of Trojan horses?  Perhaps it is more important to trust the people who wrote the software. He mentioned that he knew about the possible existence of Trojans from a report on the security of Multics.\n\n== Behavior ==\nOnce installed, Trojans may perform a range of malicious actions. Many tend to contact one or more Command and Control (C2) servers across the Internet and await instruction. Since individual Trojans typically use a specific set of ports for this communication, it can be relatively simple to detect them. Moreover, other malware could potentially \"take over\" the Trojan, using it as a proxy for malicious action.In German-speaking countries, spyware used or made by the government is sometimes called govware. Govware is typically a Trojan software used to intercept communications from the target computer. Some countries like Switzerland and Germany have a legal framework governing the use of such software. Examples of govware Trojans include the Swiss MiniPanzer and MegaPanzer and the German \"state Trojan\" nicknamed R2D2. German govware works by exploiting security gaps unknown to the general public and accessing smartphone data before it becomes encrypted via other applications.Due to the popularity of botnets among hackers and the availability of advertising services that permit authors to violate their users' privacy, Trojans are becoming more common. According to a survey conducted by BitDefender from January to June 2009, \"Trojan-type malware is on the rise, accounting for 83% of the global malware detected in the world.\" Trojans have a relationship with worms, as they spread with the help given by worms and travel across the internet with them.

Economics of information security includes models of the strictly rational \u201chomo economicus\u201d as well as behavioral economics. Economics of security addresses individual and organizational decisions and behaviors with respect to security and privacy as market decisions.\nEconomics of security addresses a core question: why do agents choose technical risks when there exists technical solutions to mitigate security and privacy risks?  Economics addresses not only this question, but also inform design decisions in security engineering.\n\n\n\n== Emergence of economics of security ==\nNational security is the canonical public good. The economic status of information security came to the intellectual fore around 2000. As is the case with innovations it arose simultaneously in multiple venues.\nIn 2000, Ross Anderson wrote, Why Information Security is Hard.  Anderson explained that a significant difficulty in optimal development of security technology is that incentives must be aligned with the technology to enable rational adoption. Thus, economic insights should be integrated into technical design. A security technology should enable the party at risk to invest to limit that risk. Otherwise, the designers are simply counting on altruism for adoption and diffusion. Many consider this publication the birth of economics of security.\nAlso in 2000 at Harvard, Camp at the School of Government and Wolfram in the Department of Economics argued that security is not a public good but rather each extant vulnerabilities has an associated negative externality value.  Vulnerabilities were defined in this work as tradable goods. Six years later, iDEFENSE, ZDI and Mozilla have extant markets for vulnerabilities.\nIn 2000, the scientists at the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University proposed an early mechanism for risk assessment. The Hierarchical Holographic Model provided the first multi-faceted evaluation tool to guide security investments using the science of risk. Since that time, CERT has developed a suite of systematic mechanism for organizations to use in risk evaluations, depending on the size and expertise of the organization: OCTAVE. The study of computer security as an investment in risk avoidance has become standard practice.\nIn 2001, in an unrelated development, Lawrence A. Gordon and Martin P. Loeb published Using Information Security as a Response to Competitor Analysis System. A working paper of the published article was written in 2000. These professors, from Maryland's Smith School of Business, present a game-theoretic framework that demonstrates how information security can prevent rival firms from gaining sensitive information. In this context, the article considers the economic (i.e., cost-benefit) aspects of information security.\nThe authors came together to develop and expand a series of flagship events under the name Workshop on the Economics of Information Security.\n\n== Examples of findings in economics of security ==\nProof of work is a security technology designed to stop spam by altering the economics. An early paper in economics of information security argued that proof of work cannot work. In fact, the finding was that proof of work cannot work without price discrimination as illustrated by a later paper, Proof of Work can Work.\nAnother finding, one that is critical to an understanding of current American data practices, is that the opposite of privacy is not, in economic terms anonymity, but rather price discrimination. Privacy and price discrimination was authored by Andrew Odlyzko and illustrates that what may appear as information pathology in collection of data is in fact rational organizational behavior.\nHal Varian presented three models of security using the metaphor of the height of walls around a town to show security as a normal good, public good, or good with externalities. Free riding is the end result, in any case.\nLawrence A. Gordon and Martin P. Loeb wrote the \"Economics of Information Security Investment\". The Gordon\u2013Loeb model is considered by many as the first economic model that determines the optimal amount to invest to protect a given set of information. The model takes into account the vulnerability of the information to a security breach and the potential loss should such a breach occur.\nWhat are the answers to these questions: How does economics of security address individual and organizational decisions and behaviors with respect to security and privacy?Q: Why do agents choose technical risks when there exist technical solutions to mitigate security and privacy risks?Q: What significant difficulty in the optimal development of security technology was identified in Ross Anderson's 2000 publication, Why Information Security is Hard?Q: In what sense is security not a public good, as argued by Camp and Wolfram in 2000?Q: What organization proposed an early mechanism for risk assessment in 2000, and what was the name of this mechanism?Q: In what context did Lawrence A.

    "instruction": "Read this and answer the below questions\n\nChallenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol\n\n==Introduction==\nIn computing, the Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) is an authentication protocol originally used by Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) to validate users. CHAP is also carried in other authentication protocols such as RADIUS and Diameter.\nAlmost all network operating systems support PPP with CHAP, as do most network access servers.  CHAP is also used in PPPoE, for authenticating DSL users.\nAs the PPP sends data unencrypted and \"in the clear\", CHAP is vulnerable to any attacker who can observe the PPP session.  An attacker can see the user's name, CHAP challenge, CHAP response, and any other information associated with the PPP session. The attacker can then mount an offline dictionary attack in order to obtain the original password. When used in PPP, CHAP also provides protection against replay attacks by the peer through the use of a challenge which is generated by the authenticator, which is typically a network access server.\nWhere CHAP is used in other protocols, it may be sent in the clear, or it may be protected by a security layer such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). For example, when CHAP is sent over RADIUS using User Datagram Protocol (UDP), any attacker who can see the RADIUS packets can mount an offline dictionary attack, as with PPP.\nCHAP requires that both the client and server know the clear-text version of the password, although the password itself is never sent over the network.  Thus when used in PPP, CHAP provides better security as compared to Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) which is vulnerable for both these reasons.\n\n== Benefits of CHAP ==\nWhen the peer sends CHAP, the authentication server will receive it, and obtain the \"known good\" password from a database, and perform the CHAP calculations.  If the resulting hashes match, then the user is deemed to be authenticated.  If the hashes do not match, then the users authentication attempt is rejected.\nSince the authentication server has to store the password in clear-text, it is impossible to use different formats for the stored password.  If an attacker were to steal the entire database of passwords, all of those passwords would be visible \"in the clear\" in the database.\nAs a result, while CHAP can be more secure than PAP when used over a PPP link, it prevents more secure storage \"at rest\" than with other methods such as PAP.\n\n== Variants ==\nMS-CHAP is similar to CHAP but uses a different hash algorithm, and allows for each party to authenticate the other.\n\n== Working cycle ==\nCHAP is an authentication scheme originally used by Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) servers to validate the identity of remote clients. CHAP periodically verifies the identity of the client by using a three-way handshake. This happens at the time of establishing the initial link (LCP), and may happen again at any time afterwards. The verification is based on a shared secret (such as the client's password).\nAfter the completion of the link establishment phase, the authenticator sends a \"challenge\" message to the peer.\nThe peer responds with a value calculated using a one-way hash function on the challenge and the secret combined.\nThe authenticator checks the response against its own calculation of the expected hash value. If the values match, the authenticator acknowledges the authentication; otherwise it should terminate the connection.\nIn PPP, the authenticator may send a new challenge at random intervals to the peer and repeats steps 1 through 3.  However, when CHAP is used in most situations (e.g. RADIUS), this step is not performed.\n\n== CHAP packets ==\nThe ID chosen for the random challenge is also used in the corresponding response, success, and failure packets. A new challenge with a new ID must be different from the last challenge with another ID. If the success or failure is lost, the same response can be sent again, and it triggers the same success or failure indication. For MD5 as hash the response value is MD5(ID||secret||challenge), the MD5 for the concatenation of ID, secret, and challenge.\n\nWhat is Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) and in what type of protocols is it used?q: How is CHAP vulnerable to attacks?q: How does CHAP protect against replay attacks in PPP?q: How is CHAP different from Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) in terms of security?q: What is the downside of using CHAP in terms of password storage?q: What is MS-CHAP and how is it different from CHAP?q: What is the working cycle of CHAP and how is the client's identity verified?q: What happens after the link establishment phase in CHAP?q: How does the authenticator check the response in CHAP?q: How are challenges and responses handled in CHAP packets?q: What is the format of the response value in CHAP packets when using MD5 as the hash function?q: What is the purpose of the ID in CHAP packets?q: How often does the authenticator send a new challenge to the peer in CHAP when used in PPP?q: Is it possible to use different formats for the stored password in CHAP?q: How does CHAP prevent attackers from mounting an offline dictionary attack when used in other protocols such as RADIUS?",

A new challenge with a new ID must be different from the last challenge with another ID. If the success or failure is lost, the same response can be sent again, and it triggers the same success or failure indication.a: For MD5 as the hash, the response value is MD5(ID||secret||challenge), the MD5 for the concatenation of ID, secret, and challenge.a: The ID in CHAP packets is used to identify the challenge and is also used in the corresponding response, success, and failure packets.a: The authenticator may send a new challenge at random intervals to the peer when CHAP is used in PPP.a: No, it is not possible to use different formats for the stored password in CHAP as the authentication server has to store the password in clear-text.a: When CHAP is used in other protocols, it may be sent in the clear or protected by a security layer such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). If it is sent in the clear, any attacker who can see the packets can mount an offline dictionary attack."

    "instruction": "Read this and answer the below questions\n\nDNSChanger\n\n==Introduction==\nDNSChanger is a DNS hijacking Trojan. The work of an Estonian company known as Rove Digital, the malware-infected computers by modifying a computer's DNS entries to point toward its own rogue name servers, which then injected its own advertising into Web pages. At its peak, DNSChanger was estimated to have infected over four million computers, bringing in at least US$14 million in profits to its operator from fraudulent advertising revenue.Both Windows and Mac OS X variants of DNSChanger were circulated, the latter taking the form of a related Trojan known as RSPlug. The FBI raided the malicious servers on November 8, 2011, but they kept the servers up after they capturing it to avoid affected users from losing Internet access until July 9, 2012.\n\n== Operation ==\nDNSChanger was distributed as a drive-by download claiming to be a video codec needed to view content on a Web site, particularly appearing on rogue pornography sites. Once installed, the malware then modified the system's Domain Name System (DNS) configuration, pointing them to rogue name servers operated through affiliates of Rove Digital. These rogue name servers primarily substituted advertising on Web pages with advertising sold by Rove. Additionally, the rogue DNS server redirected links to certain Web sites to those of advertisers, such as, for example, redirecting the IRS Web site to that of a tax preparation company. The effects of DNSChanger could also spread itself to other computers within a LAN by mimicking a DHCP server, pointing other computers toward the rogue DNS servers. In its indictment against Rove, the United States Department of Justice also reported that the rogue servers had blocked access to update servers for antivirus software.\n\n== Shutdown and interim DNS servers ==\nOn October 1, 2011, as part of Operation Ghost Click (a collaborative investigation into the operation), the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced charges against six Estonian nationals and one Russian national connected to DNSChanger and Rove Digital for wire fraud, computer intrusion, and conspiracy. Estonian authorities made arrests, and the FBI seized servers connected to the malware located in the United States.Due to concerns by FBI agents that users still infected by DNSChanger could lose Internet access if the rogue DNS servers were shut down entirely, a temporary court order was obtained to allow the Internet Systems Consortium to operate replacement servers, which would serve DNS requests from those who had not yet removed the infection, and to collect information on those still infected in order to promptly notify them about the presence of the malware. While the court order was set to expire on March 8, 2012, an extension was granted until July 9, 2012 due to concerns that there were still many infected computers.

    "instruction": "Read this and answer the below questions\n\nTrellix\n\n==Introduction==\nTrellix (formerly FireEye and McAfee Enterprise) is a privately held cybersecurity company founded in 2022. It has been involved in the detection and prevention of major cybersecurity attacks.\nIt provides hardware, software, and services to investigate cybersecurity attacks, protect against malicious software, and analyze IT security risks.In March 2021, Symphony Technology Group (STG) announced its acquisition of McAfee Enterprise in an all-cash transaction for US$4.0 billion. STG completed the acquisition of McAfee\u2019s Enterprise business in July 2021 with plans for re-branding. In June 2021, FireEye sold its name and products business to STG for $1.2bn. STG combined FireEye with its acquisition of McAfee's enterprise business to launch Trellix, an extended detection and response (XDR) company. Meanwhile, McAfee Enterprise's security service edge (SSE) business would operate as a separate company to be known as Skyhigh Security.\n\n== Products and services ==\nFireEye started as a \"sandboxing\" company. Sandboxing is where incoming network traffic is opened within a virtual machine to test it for malicious software, before being introduced into the network. FireEye's products diversified over time, in part through acquisitions. In 2017, FireEye transitioned from primarily selling appliances, to a software-as-a-service model.FireEye sells technology products including network, email, and endpoint security, a platform for managing security operations centers called Helix, consulting services primarily based on incident response, and threat intelligence products.The Central Management System (CMS) consolidates the management, reporting, and data sharing of Web MPS (Malware Protection System), Email MPS, File MPS, and Malware Analysis System (MAS) into a single network-based appliance by acting as a distribution hub for malware security intelligence.The FireEye Cloud crowd-sources Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI) detected by individual FireEye MPS appliances and automatically distributes this time-sensitive zero-day intelligence globally to all subscribed customers in frequent updates. Content Updates include a combination of DTI and FireEye Labs generated intelligence identified through research efforts.\nAs of its inception in January 2022, Trellix has more than 40,000 customers, 5,000 employees, and $2bn in annual revenue. Trellix includes the endpoint, cloud, collaboration, data and user, application, and infrastructure security capabilities of FireEye and McAfee. The business focuses on threat detection and response using machine learning and automation, with security technology that can learn and adapt to combat advanced threats.\n\n== Operations ==\nFireEye has been known for uncovering high-profile hacking groups.\n\n\n*** 2008\u20132014 ***\nIn October/November 2009, FireEye participated to take down the Mega-D botnet (also known as Ozdok). On March 16, 2011, the Rustock botnet was taken down through action by Microsoft, US federal law enforcement agents, FireEye, and the University of Washington. In July 2012, FireEye was involved in the analysis of the Grum botnet's command and control servers located in the Netherlands, Panama, and Russia.In 2013, Mandiant (before being acquired by FireEye) uncovered a multi-year espionage effort by a Chinese hacking group called APT1.In 2014, the FireEye Labs team identified two new zero-day vulnerabilities \u2013 CVE-2014\u20134148 and CVE-2014\u20134113 \u2013 as part of limited, targeted attacks against major corporations. Both zero-days exploit the Windows kernel. Microsoft addressed the vulnerabilities in October 2014 Security Bulletin. Also in 2014, FireEye provided information on a threat group it calls FIN4. FIN4 appears to conduct intrusions that are focused on a single objective: obtaining access to insider information capable of making or breaking the stock prices of public companies. The group has targeted hundreds of companies and specifically targets the emails of C-level executives, legal counsel, regulatory, risk, and compliance personnel, and other individuals who would regularly discuss confidential, market-moving information. Also in 2014, FireEye released a report focused on a threat group it refers to as APT28. APT28 focuses on collecting intelligence that would be most useful to a government. FireEye found that since at least 2007, APT28 has been targeting privileged information related to governments, militaries, and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government.\n\n\n*** 2015 ***\nIn 2015, FireEye confirmed the existence of at least 14 router implants spread across four different countries: Ukraine, the Philippines, Mexico, and India. Referred to as SYNful Knock, the implant is a stealthy modification of the router\u2019s firmware image that can be used to maintain persistence within a victim\u2019s network.In September 2015, FireEye obtained an injunction against a security researcher attempting to report vulnerabilities in FireEye Malware Protection System.In 2015, FireEye uncovered an attack exploiting two previously unknown vulnerabilities, one in Microsoft Office (CVE-2015\u20132545) and another in Windows (CVE-2015\u20132546). The attackers hid the exploit within a Microsoft Word document (.docx) that appeared to be a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The combination of these two exploits grants fully privileged remote code execution. Both vulnerabilities were patched by Microsoft.In 2015, the FireEye as a Service team in Singapore uncovered a phishing campaign exploiting an Adobe Flash Player zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015\u20133113). Adobe released a patch for the vulnerability with an out-of-band security bulletin. FireEye attributed the activity to a China-based threat group it tracks as APT3.\n\n\n*** 2016 ***\nIn 2016, FireEye announced that it has been tracking a pair of cybercriminals referred to as the \u201cVendetta Brothers.\u201d The company said that the enterprising duo uses various strategies to compromise point-of-sale systems, steal payment card information and sell it on their underground marketplace \u201cVendetta World.\u201d\nIn mid-2016, FireEye released a report on the impact of the 2015 agreement between former U.S. President Barack Obama and China's paramount leader Xi Jinping that neither government would \u201cconduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property\u201d for economic advantage. The security firm reviewed the activity of 72 groups that it suspects are operating in China or otherwise support Chinese state interests and determined that, as of mid-2014, there was an overall decrease in successful network compromises by China-based groups against organizations in the U.S. and 25 other countries.In 2016, FireEye announced that it had identified several versions of an ICS-focused malware \u2013 dubbed IRON GATE \u2013 crafted to manipulate a specific industrial process running within a simulated Siemens control system environment. Although Siemens Product Computer Emergency Readiness Team (ProductCERT) confirmed to FireEye that IRON GATE is not viable against operational Siemens control systems and that IRON GATE does not exploit any vulnerabilities in Siemens products, the security firm said that IRON GATE invokes ICS attack concepts first seen in Stuxnet.On May 8, 2016, FireEye detected an attack exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2016\u20134117). The security firm reported the issue to the Adobe Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) and Adobe released a patch for the vulnerability just four days later.In 2016, FireEye discovered a widespread vulnerability affecting Android devices that permits local privilege escalation to the built-in user \u201cradio\u201d, making it so an attacker can potentially perform activities such as viewing the victim\u2019s SMS database and phone history. FireEye reached out to Qualcomm in January 2016 and subsequently worked with the Qualcomm Product Security Team to address the issue.In 2016, FireEye provided details on FIN6, a cybercriminal group that steals payment card data for monetization from targets predominately in the hospitality and retail sectors. The group was observed aggressively targeting and compromising point-of-sale (POS) systems, and making off millions of payment card numbers that were later sold on an underground marketplace.\n\n\n*** 2017\u20132019 ***\nIn 2017, FireEye detected malicious Microsoft Office RTF documents leveraging a previously undisclosed vulnerability, CVE-2017-0199. This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to download and execute a Visual Basic script containing PowerShell commands when a user opens a document containing an embedded exploit. FireEye shared the details of the vulnerability with Microsoft and coordinated public disclosure timed with the release of a patch by Microsoft to address the vulnerability.In 2018, FireEye helped Facebook identify 652 fake accounts.\n\n\n*** 2020\u20132021 ***\nFireEye revealed on Tuesday, December 8, 2020, that its systems were pierced by what it called \"a nation with top-tier offensive capabilities\". The company said the attackers used \"novel techniques\" to steal copies of FireEye's red team tool kit, which the attackers could potentially use in other attacks. The same day, FireEye published countermeasures against the tools that had been stolen.A week later in December 2020, FireEye reported the SolarWinds supply chain attack to the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), the federal agency responsible for defending the U.S. from cyberattacks, and said its tools were stolen by the same actors. The NSA is not known to have been aware of the attack before being notified by FireEye. The NSA uses SolarWinds software itself.Within a week of FireEye's breach, cyber-security firm McAfee said the stolen tools had been used in at least 19 countries, including the US, the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Australia.During the continued investigation of the hack of their data and that of federal agencies revealed on December 8, 2020, FireEye reported in early January that the hacks originated from inside the USA, sometimes very close to the facilities affected, which enabled the hackers to evade surveillance by the National Security Agency and the defenses used by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\n*** 2022 ***\nA 2022 report by Trellix noted that hacking groups Wicked Panda (linked to China) and Cozy Bear (linked to Russia) were behind 46% of all state-sponsored hacking campaigns in the third quarter of 2021 and that in a third of all state-sponsored cyber attacks, the hackers abused Cobalt Strike security tools to get access to the victim's network. In a January 2022 report on Fox News, Trellix CEO Bryan Palma stated that there is an increasing level of cyberwarfare threats from Russia and China.A 2022 Trellix report stated that hackers are using Microsoft OneDrive in an espionage campaign against government officials in Western Asia. The malware, named by Trellix as Graphite, employs Microsoft Graph to use OneDrive as a command and control server and execute the malware. The attack is split into multiple stages to remain hidden for as long as possible.\n\n== Acquisitions ==\n\nHow did Trellix's predecessor, FireEye, contribute to the takedown of the Rustock botnet in 2011?Q: What is the significance of the FireEye Cloud in distributing Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI)?Q: How does Trellix's technology focus on threat detection and response?Q: What was the impact of the 2015 agreement between former U.S. President Barack Obama and China's paramount leader Xi Jinping on China-based cyber-attacks against organizations in the U.S. and 25 other countries?Q: How did FireEye contribute to discovering the SYNful Knock router implants in 2015?Q: What is the significance of FireEye's red team tool kit being stolen in December 2020?Q: How did FireEye help Facebook identify fake accounts in 2018?Q: What is the purpose of the Graphite malware employing Microsoft Graph to use OneDrive as a command and control server?Q: How did the hackers behind the 2020 SolarWinds supply chain attack evade surveillance by the National Security Agency?Q: What is the role of the Central Management System (CMS) in managing security operations at FireEye?Q: How does Trellix's software-as-a-service model benefit its customers?Q: What are the implications of the widespread vulnerability affecting Android devices discovered by FireEye in 2016?Q: How does FireEye's Helix platform assist in managing security operations centers?Q: What is the significance of FireEye's role in uncovering the Mega-D botnet (also known as Ozdok) in 2009?Q: How does Trellix's focus on machine learning and automation enhance its security technology?Q: What is the role of the FireEye Labs team in identifying zero-day vulnerabilities?Q: How did FireEye contribute to the analysis of the Grum botnet's command and control servers in 2012?",

The business focuses on threat detection and response using machine learning and automation, with security technology that can learn and adapt to combat advanced threats.\n\n== Operations ==\nFireEye has been known for uncovering high-profile hacking groups.\n\n\n*** 2008\u20132014 ***\nIn October/November 2009, FireEye participated to take down the Mega-D botnet (also known as Ozdok). On March 16, 2011, the Rustock botnet was taken down through action by Microsoft, US federal law enforcement agents, FireEye, and the University of Washington. In July 2012, FireEye was involved in the analysis of the Grum botnet's command and control servers located in the Netherlands, Panama, and Russia.In 2013, Mandiant (before being acquired by FireEye) uncovered a multi-year espionage effort by a Chinese hacking group called APT1.In 2014, the FireEye Labs team identified two new zero-day vulnerabilities \u2013 CVE-2014\u20134148 and CVE-2014\u20134113 \u2013 as part of limited, targeted attacks against major corporations. Both zero-days exploit the Windows kernel. Microsoft addressed the vulnerabilities in October 2014 Security Bulletin. Also in 2014, FireEye provided information on a threat group it calls FIN4. FIN4 appears to conduct intrusions that are focused on a single objective: obtaining access to insider information capable of making or breaking the stock prices of public companies. The group has targeted hundreds of companies and specifically targets the emails of C-level executives, legal counsel, regulatory, risk, and compliance personnel, and other individuals who would regularly discuss confidential, market-moving information. Also in 2014, FireEye released a report focused on a threat group it refers to as APT28. APT28 focuses on collecting intelligence that would be most useful to a government. FireEye found that since at least 2007, APT28 has been targeting privileged information related to governments, militaries, and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government.\n\n\n*** 2015 ***\nIn 2015, FireEye confirmed the existence of at least 14 router implants spread across four different countries: Ukraine, the Philippines, Mexico, and India. Referred to as SYNful Knock, the implant is a stealthy modification of the router\u2019s firmware image that can be used to maintain persistence within a victim\u2019s network.In September 2015, FireEye obtained an injunction against a security researcher attempting to report vulnerabilities in FireEye Malware Protection System.In 2015, FireEye uncovered an attack exploiting two previously unknown vulnerabilities, one in Microsoft Office (CVE-2015\u20132545) and another in Windows (CVE-2015\u20132546). The attackers hid the exploit within a Microsoft Word document (.docx) that appeared to be a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The combination of these two exploits grants fully privileged remote code execution. Both vulnerabilities were patched by Microsoft.In 2015, the FireEye as a Service team in Singapore uncovered a phishing campaign exploiting an Adobe Flash Player zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015\u20133113). Adobe released a patch for the vulnerability with an out-of-band security bulletin. FireEye attributed the activity to a China-based threat group it tracks as APT3.\n\n\n*** 2016 ***\nIn 2016, FireEye announced that it has been tracking a pair of cybercriminals referred to as the \u201cVendetta Brothers.\u201d The company said that the enterprising duo uses various strategies to compromise point-of-sale systems, steal payment card information and sell it on their underground marketplace \u201cVendetta World.\u201d\nIn mid-2016, FireEye released a report on the impact of the 2015 agreement between former U.S. President Barack Obama and China's paramount leader Xi Jinping that neither government would \u201cconduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property\u201d for economic advantage. The security firm reviewed the activity of 72 groups that it suspects are operating in China or otherwise support Chinese state interests and determined that, as of mid-2014, there was an overall decrease in successful network compromises by China-based groups against organizations in the U.S. and 25 other countries.In 2016, FireEye announced that it had identified several versions of an ICS-focused malware \u2013 dubbed IRON GATE \u2013 crafted to manipulate a specific industrial process running within a simulated Siemens control system environment. Although Siemens Product Computer Emergency Readiness Team (ProductCERT) confirmed to FireEye that IRON GATE is not viable against operational Siemens control systems and that IRON GATE does not exploit any vulnerabilities in Siemens products, the security firm said that IRON GATE invokes ICS attack concepts first seen in Stuxnet.On May 8, 2016, FireEye detected an attack exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2016\u20134117). The security firm reported the issue to the Adobe Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) and Adobe released a patch for the vulnerability just four days later.In 2016, FireEye discovered a widespread vulnerability affecting Android devices that permits local privilege escalation to the built-in user \u201cradio\u201d, making it so an attacker can potentially perform activities such as viewing the victim\u2019s SMS database and phone history. FireEye reached out to Qualcomm in January 2016 and subsequently worked with the Qualcomm Product Security Team to address the issue.In 2016, FireEye provided details on FIN6, a cybercriminal group that steals payment card data for monetization from targets predominately in the hospitality and retail sectors. The group was observed aggressively targeting and compromising point-of-sale (POS) systems, and making off millions of payment card numbers that were later sold on an underground marketplace.\n\n\n*** 2017\u20132019 ***\nIn 2017, FireEye detected malicious Microsoft Office RTF documents leveraging a previously undisclosed vulnerability, CVE-2017-0199. This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to download and execute a Visual Basic script containing PowerShell commands when a user opens a document containing an embedded exploit. FireEye shared the details of the vulnerability with Microsoft and coordinated public disclosure timed with the release of a patch by Microsoft to address the vulnerability.In 2018, FireEye helped Facebook identify 652 fake accounts.\n\n\n*** 2020\u20132021 ***\nFireEye revealed on Tuesday, December 8, 2020, that its systems were pierced by what it called \"a nation with top-tier offensive capabilities\". The company said the attackers used \"novel techniques\" to steal copies of FireEye's red team tool kit, which the attackers could potentially use in other attacks. The same day, FireEye published countermeasures against the tools that had been stolen.A week later in December 2020, FireEye reported the SolarWinds supply chain attack to the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), the federal agency responsible for defending the U.S. from cyberattacks, and said its tools were stolen by the same actors. The NSA is not known to have been aware of the attack before being notified by FireEye. The NSA uses SolarWinds software itself.Within a week of FireEye's breach, cyber-security firm McAfee said the stolen tools had been used in at least 19 countries, including the US, the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Australia.During the continued investigation of the hack of their data and that of federal agencies revealed on December 8, 2020, FireEye reported in early January that the hacks originated from inside the USA, sometimes very close to the facilities affected, which enabled the hackers to evade surveillance by the National Security Agency and the defenses used by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\n*** 2022 ***\nA 2022 report by Trellix noted that hacking groups Wicked Panda (linked to China) and Cozy Bear (linked to Russia) were behind 46% of all state-sponsored hacking campaigns in the third quarter of 2021 and that in a third of all state-sponsored cyber attacks, the hackers abused Cobalt Strike security tools to get access to the victim's network. In a January 2022 report on Fox News, Trellix CEO Bryan Palma stated that there is an increasing level of cyberwarfare threats from Russia and China.A 2022 Trellix report stated that hackers are using Microsoft OneDrive in an espionage campaign against government officials in Western Asia. The malware, named by Trellix as Graphite, employs Microsoft Graph to use OneDrive as a command and control server and execute the malware. The attack is split into multiple stages to remain hidden for as long as possible.\n\n== Acquisitions ==",

    "instruction": "Here are some questions about this text: Wireless intrusion prevention system\n\n==Introduction==\nIn computing, a wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS) is a network device that monitors the radio spectrum for the presence of unauthorized access points (intrusion detection), and can automatically take countermeasures (intrusion prevention).\n\n\n\n== Purpose ==\nThe primary purpose of a WIPS is to prevent unauthorized network access to local area networks and other information assets by wireless devices.  These systems are typically implemented as an overlay to an existing Wireless LAN infrastructure, although they may be deployed standalone to enforce no-wireless policies within an organization.  Some advanced wireless infrastructure has integrated WIPS capabilities.\nLarge organizations with many employees are particularly vulnerable to security breaches caused by rogue access points.  If an employee (trusted entity) in a location brings in an easily available wireless router, the entire network can be exposed to anyone within range of the signals.\nIn July 2009, the PCI Security Standards Council published wireless guidelines for PCI DSS recommending the use of WIPS to automate wireless scanning for large organizations.\n\n== Intrusion detection ==\nA wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) monitors the radio spectrum for the presence of unauthorized, rogue access points and the use of wireless attack tools. The system monitors the radio spectrum used by wireless LANs, and immediately alerts a systems administrator whenever a rogue access point is detected. Conventionally it is achieved by comparing the MAC address of the participating wireless devices.\nRogue devices can spoof MAC address of an authorized network device as their own. New research uses fingerprinting approach to weed out devices with spoofed MAC addresses. The idea is to compare the unique signatures exhibited by the signals emitted by each wireless device against the known signatures of pre-authorized, known wireless devices.\n\n== Intrusion prevention ==\nIn addition to intrusion detection, a WIPS also includes features that prevent against the threat automatically. For automatic \nprevention, it is required that the WIPS is able to accurately detect and automatically classify a threat.\nThe following types of threats can be prevented by a good WIPS:\n\nRogue access points \u2013 WIPS should understand the difference between rogue APs and external (neighbor's) APs\nMis-configured AP\nClient mis-association\nUnauthorized association\nMan-in-the-middle attack\nAd hoc networks\nMAC spoofing\nHoneypot / evil twin attack\nDenial-of-service attack\n\n== Implementation ==\nWIPS configurations consist of three components:\n\nSensors \u2014 These devices contain antennas and radios that scan the wireless spectrum for packets and are installed throughout areas to be protected\nServer \u2014 The WIPS server centrally analyzes packets captured by sensors\nConsole \u2014 The console provides the primary user interface into the system for administration and reportingA simple intrusion detection system can be a single computer, connected to a wireless signal processing device, and antennas placed throughout the facility.  For huge organizations, a Multi Network Controller provides central control of multiple WIPS servers, while for SOHO or SMB customers, all the functionality of WIPS is available in single box.\nIn a WIPS implementation, users first define the operating wireless policies in the WIPS. The WIPS sensors then analyze the traffic in the air and send this information to WIPS server. The WIPS server correlates the information, validates it against the defined policies, and classifies if it is a threat. The administrator of the WIPS is then notified of the threat, or, if a policy has been set accordingly, the WIPS takes automatic protection measures.\nWIPS is configured as either a network implementation or a hosted implementation.\n\n\n*** Network implementation ***\nIn a network WIPS implementation, server, sensors and the console are all placed inside a private network and are not accessible from the Internet.\nSensors communicate with the server over a private network using a private port. Since the server resides on the private network, users can access the console only from within the private network.\nA network implementation is suitable for organizations where all locations are within the private network.\n\n\n*** Hosted implementation ***\nIn a hosted WIPS implementation, sensors are installed inside a private network. However, the server is hosted in secure data center and is accessible on the Internet. Users can access the WIPS console from anywhere on the Internet. A hosted WIPS implementation is as secure as a network implementation because the data flow is encrypted between sensors and server, as well as between server and console. A hosted WIPS implementation requires very little configuration because the sensors are programmed to automatically look for the server on the Internet over a secure TLS connection.\nFor a large organization with locations that are not a part of a private network, a hosted WIPS implementation simplifies deployment significantly because sensors connect to the Server over the Internet without requiring any special configuration.

      "answers": "A WIPS prevents unauthorized network access by detecting the presence of unauthorized access points and taking countermeasures to prevent access. It typically works as an overlay to an existing Wireless LAN infrastructure, and can also be deployed standalone to enforce no-wireless policies within an organization.a: Intrusion detection in a WIPS involves monitoring the radio spectrum for the presence of unauthorized, rogue access points and the use of wireless attack tools. The system alerts a systems administrator whenever a rogue access point is detected.a: A WIDS can detect rogue access points with spoofed MAC addresses by comparing the unique signatures exhibited by the signals emitted by each wireless device against the known signatures of pre-authorized, known wireless devices.a: A good WIPS can prevent rogue access points, mis-configured APs, client mis-association, unauthorized association, man-in-the-middle attacks, ad hoc networks, MAC spoofing, honeypot/evil twin attacks, and denial-of-service attacks.a: The three components of a WIPS configuration are sensors, a server, and a console.a: The WIPS server centrally analyzes packets captured by sensors and correlates the information, validates it against the defined policies, and classifies if it is a threat.a: A WIPS can be implemented as a network implementation or a hosted implementation.a: In a network WIPS implementation, the server resides on the private network and users can access the console only from within the private network.a: A network WIPS implementation is suitable for organizations where all locations are within the private network.a: In a hosted WIPS implementation, sensors are installed inside a private network and the server is hosted in a secure data center and is accessible on the Internet.a: In a hosted WIPS implementation, sensors connect to the server over the Internet without requiring any special configuration, making deployment simpler for organizations with locations that are not a part of a private network.a: Hosted WIPS implementations are available in an on-demand, subscription-based software as a service model.a: Hosted WIPS implementations may be appropriate for organizations looking to fulfill the minimum scanning requirements of PCI DSS.a: A WIPS can be deployed standalone to enforce no-wireless policies within an organization.a: Large organizations with many employees are particularly vulnerable to security breaches caused by rogue access points because if an employee brings in an easily available wireless router, the entire network can be exposed to anyone within range of the signals."

    "instruction": "Here are some questions about this text: Microsoft Office password protection\n\n==Introduction==\nMicrosoft Office password protection is a security feature to protect Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) with a user-provided password.\n\n== Types ==\nThere are two groups of passwords that can be set to a document:\nA password to encrypt a document restricts opening and viewing it. This is possible in all Microsoft Office applications. Since Office 2007 they are hard to break, if a sufficient complex password was chosen. If the password can be determined through social engineering, the underlying cipher is not important.Passwords that do not encrypt, but restrict modification. They can be circumvented easily.\nIn Word and PowerPoint the password restricts modification of the entire document.\nIn Excel passwords restrict modification of the workbook, a worksheet within it, or individual elements in the worksheet.\n\n== History of Office Encryption ==\n\n\n*** Weak encryptions ***\nIn Excel and Word 95 and prior editions a weak protection algorithm is used that converts a password to a 16-bit verifier and a 16-byte XOR obfuscation array key. Hacking software is now readily available to find a 16-byte key and decrypt the password-protected document. Because it's only like a Vigenere Cipher. They can be cracked instantly with the help of precomputation tables.Office 97, 2000, XP and 2003 use RC4 with 40 bits. The Office-algorithm contains multiple vulnerabilities rendering it insecure. Also RC4 is now considered to be weak. The protection presents no difficulties to hacking software.In Office XP and 2003 an opportunity to use a custom protection algorithm was added. Choosing a non-standard Cryptographic Service Provider allows increasing the key length. Weak passwords can still be recovered quickly even if a custom CSP is on.\n\n\n*** AES since Office 2007 ***\nIn Office 2007 (Word, Excel and PowerPoint), protection was significantly enhanced since a modern protection algorithm named Advanced Encryption Standard was used. At present there is no software that can break this encryption. With the help of the SHA-1 hash function, the password is stretched into a 128-bit key 50,000 times before opening the document; as a result, the time required to crack it is vastly increased, similar to PBKDF2, scrypt or other KDFs.\nExcel and Word 2010 employed AES and a 128-bit key, but the number of SHA-1 conversions doubled to 100,000.Office 2013 (Access, Excel, OneNote, PowerPoint, Project, and Word) uses 128-bit AES, again with hash algorithm SHA-1 by default.Office 2013 introduces SHA-512 hashes in the encryption algorithm, making brute-force and rainbow table attacks slower.Office 2016 (Access, Excel, OneNote, PowerPoint, Project, and Word) uses 256-bit AES, the SHA-1 hash algorithm, 16 bytes of salt and CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) by default.Attacks that target the password include dictionary attack, rule-based attack, brute-force attack, mask attack and statistics-based attack. Attacks can be speed up through multiple CPUs, also in the cloud, and GPGPU (applicable only to Microsoft Office 2007\u20132010 documents).\nA modern graphics card like Nvidia RTX2070 can try 12.000 password per second for Office 2016-19 documents.\n\n== Excel worksheets and macro protection ==\nThe protection for worksheets and macros is necessarily weaker than that for the entire workbook as the software itself must be able to display or use them.\nFor xlsx files that can be opened but not edited, there is another attack, as the file format is a group of XML files within a zip, unzipping editing and replacing the workbook.xml file, and/or the individual worksheet XML files with identical copies, except that the unknown key and salt are replaced with a known pair, or removing the key altogether allows the sheets to be edited.\nWhat are the answers to these questions: How does Microsoft Office password protection restrict document opening and viewing?Question: What is the difference between passwords that encrypt and those that restrict modification in Microsoft Office?Question: How does the protection algorithm used in Excel and Word 95 and prior editions work?Question: What vulnerabilities does the RC4 encryption algorithm used in Office 97, 2000, XP, and 2003 have?Question: How does the custom protection algorithm in Office XP and 2003 work?Question: How does the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm used in Office 2007 enhance protection?Question: How does the SHA-1 hash function work in the encryption algorithm used in Office 2010?Question: How does Office 2013 introduce SHA-512 hashes in the encryption algorithm?Question: How does the encryption algorithm used in Office 2016 differ from that used in Office 2013?Question: What are some attacks that target the password in Microsoft Office password protection?Question: How can attacks on Microsoft Office password protection be speeded up?Question: How many passwords can a modern graphics card try per second for Office 2016-19 documents?Question: How is protection for worksheets and macros in Microsoft Office different from protection for the entire workbook?Question: What is the attack on xlsx files that can be opened but not edited in Microsoft Office?Question: How does the XML file format of xlsx files affect the protection of worksheets and macros?",

      "answers": "A VPN service provides a proxy server to help users bypass Internet censorship such as geoblocking and protect their communications against data profiling or MitM attacks on hostile networks. People often use VPN services to disguise or obfuscate their physical location or IP address, typically as a means to evade Internet censorship or geo-blocking.Answer: A true private network involves a secure connection between two or more devices, while an Internet proxy that uses VPN technologies only provides a secure connection between a device and a proxy server. The latter does not necessarily provide end-to-end encryption.Answer: Encryption is important for VPN services to protect the transmitted content from being visible at the receiving endpoint. Content should be encrypted before it enters the tunnel for the VPN to be truly secure.Answer: When evaluating the privacy and anonymity of VPN services, users should consider the provider's own guarantees, reputation, privacy and security practices, and whether the provider is based in a country with data retention laws. Additionally, users should read the provider's logging policy before signing up for the service.Answer: Some limitations and criticisms of VPN services include misinformation in the market, poor privacy and security practices by providers, hyperbolic claims, insufficiency for protection against browser fingerprinting, and dependence on the provider's reputation.Answer: Free VPN services should be avoided because they may sell their users' browsing data in aggregated form to researchers and marketers, or only offer a minimal amount of data transfer per month.Answer: Choosing a VPN provider based in a country with no data retention laws makes it easier for the service to keep a promise of no logging.Answer: Some technical features to consider when evaluating VPN services include connection speeds, server count and locations, and interface usability.Answer: VPN services typically utilize the operating system's VPN interfaces to capture the user's data to send to the proxy, including virtual network adapters on computer OSes and specialized \"VPN\" interfaces on mobile operating systems.Answer: In March 2018, the use of unapproved VPN services was banned in China, and operators received prison sentences and were penalized with fines. Russia also banned various VPN service providers in 2021.Answer: VPN services help users bypass Internet censorship and geoblocking by disguising or obfuscating their physical location or IP address, allowing them to access content that may be restricted in their region.Answer: VPN services protect users' communications against data profiling and MitM attacks by encrypting the data transmitted between the user's device and the proxy server.Answer: VPN services use encryption to secure users' data by encrypting the data before it enters the tunnel, ensuring that it is protected from being visible at the receiving endpoint.Answer: VPN services can affect users' privacy and anonymity by collecting information about their customers' VPN usage, logging their activity, and potentially selling their browsing data.Answer: VPN services use proxy servers to provide a secure connection by routing users' data through a proxy server, which can help bypass Internet censorship and protect users' communications. However, the security and privacy of the connection depend on the provider's logging policy and encryption practices."

    "output": "Cryptography is the practice and study of hiding information to ensure secure communication. It intersects the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and engineering. The main application areas of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, electronic commerce, commitment schemes, secure multiparty computation, electronic voting, authentication, digital signatures, crypto systems, dining cryptographers problem, anonymous remailer, pseudonymity, onion routing, and digital currency.A: A cryptographer is a professional who designs, creates, and analyzes cryptographic systems to ensure secure communication. The two main components in the essence of cryptography are encryption/decryption and cryptographic key. Encryption is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext to ensure confidentiality, while decryption is the reverse process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext. A cryptographic key is a piece of information (a string of bits) that determines the functionalities of a cryptographic algorithm.A: Symmetric key algorithms use the same key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric key algorithms use different keys for encryption and decryption. Examples of symmetric key algorithms include AES, Blowfish, and DES, while examples of asymmetric key algorithms include RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and ElGamal.A: A block cipher operates on fixed-size blocks of plaintext, while a stream cipher operates on a continuous stream of plaintext. Examples of block ciphers include AES, Blowfish, and DES, while examples of stream ciphers include RC4 and Salsa20.A: A key authentication system is a cryptographic system that ensures the authenticity of a cryptographic key. The main components of a key authentication system include public key infrastructure, X.509, OpenPGP, public key certificate, certificate authority, certificate revocation, ID-based cryptography, certificate-based encryption, secure key issuing cryptography, and certificateless cryptography.A: A message authentication code (MAC) is a cryptographic checksum that verifies the integrity and authenticity of a message, while a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) is a specific type of MAC that uses a cryptographic hash function in combination with a secret key.A: A key derivation function (KDF) is a cryptographic function that derives a cryptographic key from a secret value or password. The main applications of KDFs include key strengthening, password-authenticated key agreement, and passphrase-based key derivation.A: A chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) is a type of attack where the attacker can choose plaintext messages to be encrypted, while a chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) is a type of attack where the attacker can choose ciphertext messages to be decrypted.A: A known-plaintext attack (KPA) is a type of attack where the attacker has access to both the plaintext and the corresponding ciphertext, while a ciphertext-only attack (COA) is a type of attack where the attacker only has access to the ciphertext.A: A hash function is a cryptographic function that maps an input (message) to a fixed-size output (hash value). The main applications of hash functions include message authentication codes, keyed-hash message authentication codes, and digital signatures.A: A one-way function is a mathematical function that is easy to compute in one direction but difficult to invert, while a trapdoor function is a mathematical function that is easy to compute in both directions if a secret piece of information (the trapdoor) is known.A: A digital signature is a cryptographic mechanism that provides authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of a digital message or document. The main applications of digital signatures include electronic commerce, electronic voting, and secure communication.A: A symmetric key algorithm uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, while an asymmetric key algorithm uses different keys for encryption and decryption. Symmetric key algorithms are generally faster than asymmetric key algorithms, but the key distribution is a major challenge in symmetric key algorithms.A: A key exchange protocol is a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties to securely establish a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel. The main applications of key exchange protocols include secure communication, secure file transfer, and secure virtual private networks.A: A man-in-the-middle attack (MitM) is a type of attack where the attacker intercepts and alters the communication between two parties, while a replay attack is a type of attack where the attacker intercepts and retransmits a previous communication to gain unauthorized access.",

      "answers": "Cryptography is the practice and study of hiding information to ensure secure communication. It intersects the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and engineering. The main application areas of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, electronic commerce, commitment schemes, secure multiparty computation, electronic voting, authentication, digital signatures, crypto systems, dining cryptographers problem, anonymous remailer, pseudonymity, onion routing, and digital currency.A: A cryptographer is a professional who designs, creates, and analyzes cryptographic systems to ensure secure communication. The two main components in the essence of cryptography are encryption/decryption and cryptographic key. Encryption is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext to ensure confidentiality, while decryption is the reverse process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext. A cryptographic key is a piece of information (a string of bits) that determines the functionalities of a cryptographic algorithm.A: Symmetric key algorithms use the same key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric key algorithms use different keys for encryption and decryption. Examples of symmetric key algorithms include AES, Blowfish, and DES, while examples of asymmetric key algorithms include RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and ElGamal.A: A block cipher operates on fixed-size blocks of plaintext, while a stream cipher operates on a continuous stream of plaintext. Examples of block ciphers include AES, Blowfish, and DES, while examples of stream ciphers include RC4 and Salsa20.A: A key authentication system is a cryptographic system that ensures the authenticity of a cryptographic key. The main components of a key authentication system include public key infrastructure, X.509, OpenPGP, public key certificate, certificate authority, certificate revocation, ID-based cryptography, certificate-based encryption, secure key issuing cryptography, and certificateless cryptography.A: A message authentication code (MAC) is a cryptographic checksum that verifies the integrity and authenticity of a message, while a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) is a specific type of MAC that uses a cryptographic hash function in combination with a secret key.A: A key derivation function (KDF) is a cryptographic function that derives a cryptographic key from a secret value or password. The main applications of KDFs include key strengthening, password-authenticated key agreement, and passphrase-based key derivation.A: A chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) is a type of attack where the attacker can choose plaintext messages to be encrypted, while a chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) is a type of attack where the attacker can choose ciphertext messages to be decrypted.A: A known-plaintext attack (KPA) is a type of attack where the attacker has access to both the plaintext and the corresponding ciphertext, while a ciphertext-only attack (COA) is a type of attack where the attacker only has access to the ciphertext.A: A hash function is a cryptographic function that maps an input (message) to a fixed-size output (hash value). The main applications of hash functions include message authentication codes, keyed-hash message authentication codes, and digital signatures.A: A one-way function is a mathematical function that is easy to compute in one direction but difficult to invert, while a trapdoor function is a mathematical function that is easy to compute in both directions if a secret piece of information (the trapdoor) is known.A: A digital signature is a cryptographic mechanism that provides authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of a digital message or document. The main applications of digital signatures include electronic commerce, electronic voting, and secure communication.A: A symmetric key algorithm uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, while an asymmetric key algorithm uses different keys for encryption and decryption. Symmetric key algorithms are generally faster than asymmetric key algorithms, but the key distribution is a major challenge in symmetric key algorithms.A: A key exchange protocol is a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties to securely establish a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel. The main applications of key exchange protocols include secure communication, secure file transfer, and secure virtual private networks.A: A man-in-the-middle attack (MitM) is a type of attack where the attacker intercepts and alters the communication between two parties, while a replay attack is a type of attack where the attacker intercepts and retransmits a previous communication to gain unauthorized access."

    "instruction": "Context: Mix network\n\n==Introduction==\nMix networks are routing protocols that create hard-to-trace communications by using a chain of proxy servers known as mixes which take in messages from multiple senders, shuffle them, and send them back out in random order to the next destination (possibly another mix node). This breaks the link between the source of the request and the destination, making it harder for eavesdroppers to trace end-to-end communications. Furthermore, mixes only know the node that it immediately received the message from, and the immediate destination to send the shuffled messages to, making the network resistant to malicious mix nodes.Each message is encrypted to each proxy using public key cryptography; the resulting encryption is layered like a Russian doll (except that each \"doll\" is of the same size) with the message as the innermost layer.  Each proxy server strips off its own layer of encryption to reveal where to send the message next.  If all but one of the proxy servers are compromised by the tracer, untraceability can still be achieved against some weaker adversaries.\nThe concept of mix networks was first described by David Chaum in 1981.  Applications that are based on this concept include anonymous remailers (such as Mixmaster), onion routing, garlic routing, and key-based routing (including  Tor, I2P, and Freenet).\n\n== How it works ==\n\nParticipant A prepares a message for delivery to participant B by appending a random value R to the message, sealing it with the addressee's public key \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            b\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{b}}\n  , appending B's address, and then sealing the result with the mix's public key \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            m\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{m}}\n  .\nM opens it with his private key, now he knows B's address, and he sends \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        (\n        m\n        e\n        s\n        s\n        a\n        g\n        e\n        ,\n        R\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{b}(message,R)}\n   to B.\n\n\n*** Message format ***\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            m\n          \n        \n        (\n        R\n        1\n        ,\n        \n          K\n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        (\n        R\n        0\n        ,\n        m\n        e\n        s\n        s\n        a\n        g\n        e\n        )\n        ,\n        B\n        )\n        \u27f6\n        (\n        \n          K\n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        (\n        R\n        0\n        ,\n        m\n        e\n        s\n        s\n        a\n        g\n        e\n        )\n        ,\n        B\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{m}(R1,K_{b}(R0,message),B)\\longrightarrow (K_{b}(R0,message),B)}\n  \nTo accomplish this, the sender takes the mix's public key (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            m\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{m}}\n  ), and uses it to encrypt an envelope containing a random string (\n  \n    \n      \n        R\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R1}\n  ), a nested envelope addressed to the recipient, and the email address of the recipient (B). This nested envelope is encrypted with the recipient's public key (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            b\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{b}}\n  ), and contains another random string (R0), along with the body of the message being sent. Upon receipt of the encrypted top-level envelope, the mix uses its secret key to open it. Inside, it finds the address of the recipient (B) and an encrypted message bound for B. The random string (\n  \n    \n      \n        R\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R1}\n  ) is discarded.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        R\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R0}\n   is needed in the message in order to prevent an attacker from guessing messages.

Adversaries can provide long term correlation attacks and track the sender and receiver of the packets.\n\n\n*** Threat model ***\nAn adversary can perform a passive attack by monitoring the traffic to and from the mix network. Analyzing the arrival times between multiple packets can reveal information. Since no changes are actively made to the packets, an attack like this is hard to detect. In a worst case of an attack, we assume that all the links of the network are observable by the adversary and the strategies and infrastructure of the mix network are known.A packet on an input link cannot be correlated to a packet on the output link based on information about the time the packet was received, the size of the packet, or the content of the packet. Packet correlation based on packet timing is prevented by batching and correlation based on content and packet size is prevented by encryption and packet padding, respectively.\nInter-packet intervals, that is, the time difference between observation of two consecutive packets on two network links, is used to infer if the links carry the same connection. The encryption and padding does not affect the inter-packet interval related to the same IP flow. Sequences of inter-packet interval vary greatly between connections, for example in web browsing, the traffic occurs in bursts. This fact can be used to identify a connection.\n\n\n*** Active attack ***\nActive attacks can be performed by injecting bursts of packets that contain unique timing signatures into the targeted flow. The attacker can perform attacks to attempt to identify these packets on other network links. The attacker might not be able to create new packets due to the required knowledge of symmetric keys on all the subsequent  mixes. Replay packets cannot be used either as they are easily preventable through hashing and caching.\n\n\n*** Artificial gap ***\nLarge gaps can be created in the target flow, if the attacker drops large volumes of consecutive packets in the flow. For example, a simulation is run sending 3000 packets to the target flow, where the attacker drops the packets 1 second after the start of the flow. As the number of consecutive packets dropped increases, the effectiveness of defensive dropping decreases significantly. Introducing a large gap will almost always create a recognizable feature.\n\n\n*** Artificial bursts ***\nThe attacker can create artificial bursts. This is done by creating a signature from artificial packets by holding them on a link for a certain period of time and then releasing them all at once. Defensive dropping provides no defense in this scenario and the attacker can identify the target flow. There are other defense measures that can be taken to prevent this attack. One such solution can be adaptive padding algorithms. The more the packets are delayed, the easier it is to identify the behavior and thus better defense can be observed.\n\n\n*** Other time analysis attacks ***\nAn attacker may also look into other timing attacks other than inter-packet intervals. The attacker can actively modify packet streams to observe the changes caused in the network's behavior. Packets can be corrupted to force re-transmission of TCP packets, which the behavior is easily observable to reveal information.\n\n\n*** Sleeper attack ***\nAssuming an adversary can see messages being sent and received into threshold mixes but they can't see the internal working of these mixes or what is sent by the same. If the adversary has left their own messages in respective mixes and they receive one of the two, they are able to determine the message sent and the corresponding sender. The adversary has to place their messages (active component) in the mix at any given time and the messages must remain there prior to a message being sent. This is not typically an active attack. Weaker adversaries can use this attack in combination with other attacks to cause more issues.\nMix networks derive security by changing order of messages they receive to avoid creating significant relation between the incoming and outgoing messages. Mixes create interference between messages. The interference puts bounds on the rate of information leak to an observer of the mix. In a mix of size n, an adversary observing input to and output from the mix has an uncertainty of order n in determining a match. A sleeper attack can take advantage of this. In a layered network of threshold mixes with a sleeper in each mix, there is a layer receiving inputs from senders and a second layer of mixes that forward messages to the final destination. From this, the attacker can learn the received message could not have come from the sender into any layer 1 mix that did not fire. There is a higher probability of matching the sent and received messages with these sleepers thus communication is not completely anonymous. Mixes may also be purely timed: they randomize the order of messages received in a particular interval and attach some of them with the mixes, forwarding them at the end of the interval despite what has been received in that interval. Messages that are available for mixinthat tg will interfere, but if no messages are available, there is no interference with received messages.\n\nNow answer the following questions: How does the concept of mix networks contribute to creating hard-to-trace communications?Question: What type of encryption is used in mix networks to ensure secure communication?Question: How does the use of random values in messages enhance the security of mix networks?Question: How does the recipient's address get included in the encrypted message?Question: How does a mix node process incoming messages?Question: What type of attack can an adversary perform by monitoring traffic to and from the mix network?Question: How does packet padding help prevent correlation based on packet size?Question: How can inter-packet intervals be used to infer if links carry the same connection?Question: What type of active attack involves injecting bursts of packets with unique timing signatures?Question: How can an attacker create artificial gaps in a target flow?Question: How can attackers use adaptive padding algorithms to defend against artificial bursts?Question: What is the goal of modifying packet streams in time analysis attacks?Question: How does a sleeper attack exploit the interference in mix networks?Question: How do purely timed mixes randomize the order of messages in a particular interval?Question: What is the effect of a sleeper attack on a layered network of threshold mixes with a sleeper in each mix?",

      "context": "Mix network\n\n==Introduction==\nMix networks are routing protocols that create hard-to-trace communications by using a chain of proxy servers known as mixes which take in messages from multiple senders, shuffle them, and send them back out in random order to the next destination (possibly another mix node). This breaks the link between the source of the request and the destination, making it harder for eavesdroppers to trace end-to-end communications. Furthermore, mixes only know the node that it immediately received the message from, and the immediate destination to send the shuffled messages to, making the network resistant to malicious mix nodes.Each message is encrypted to each proxy using public key cryptography; the resulting encryption is layered like a Russian doll (except that each \"doll\" is of the same size) with the message as the innermost layer.  Each proxy server strips off its own layer of encryption to reveal where to send the message next.  If all but one of the proxy servers are compromised by the tracer, untraceability can still be achieved against some weaker adversaries.\nThe concept of mix networks was first described by David Chaum in 1981.  Applications that are based on this concept include anonymous remailers (such as Mixmaster), onion routing, garlic routing, and key-based routing (including  Tor, I2P, and Freenet).\n\n== How it works ==\n\nParticipant A prepares a message for delivery to participant B by appending a random value R to the message, sealing it with the addressee's public key \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            b\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{b}}\n  , appending B's address, and then sealing the result with the mix's public key \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            m\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{m}}\n  .\nM opens it with his private key, now he knows B's address, and he sends \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        (\n        m\n        e\n        s\n        s\n        a\n        g\n        e\n        ,\n        R\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{b}(message,R)}\n   to B.\n\n\n*** Message format ***\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            m\n          \n        \n        (\n        R\n        1\n        ,\n        \n          K\n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        (\n        R\n        0\n        ,\n        m\n        e\n        s\n        s\n        a\n        g\n        e\n        )\n        ,\n        B\n        )\n        \u27f6\n        (\n        \n          K\n          \n            b\n          \n        \n        (\n        R\n        0\n        ,\n        m\n        e\n        s\n        s\n        a\n        g\n        e\n        )\n        ,\n        B\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{m}(R1,K_{b}(R0,message),B)\\longrightarrow (K_{b}(R0,message),B)}\n  \nTo accomplish this, the sender takes the mix's public key (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            m\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{m}}\n  ), and uses it to encrypt an envelope containing a random string (\n  \n    \n      \n        R\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R1}\n  ), a nested envelope addressed to the recipient, and the email address of the recipient (B).

Adversaries can provide long term correlation attacks and track the sender and receiver of the packets.\n\n\n*** Threat model ***\nAn adversary can perform a passive attack by monitoring the traffic to and from the mix network. Analyzing the arrival times between multiple packets can reveal information. Since no changes are actively made to the packets, an attack like this is hard to detect. In a worst case of an attack, we assume that all the links of the network are observable by the adversary and the strategies and infrastructure of the mix network are known.A packet on an input link cannot be correlated to a packet on the output link based on information about the time the packet was received, the size of the packet, or the content of the packet. Packet correlation based on packet timing is prevented by batching and correlation based on content and packet size is prevented by encryption and packet padding, respectively.\nInter-packet intervals, that is, the time difference between observation of two consecutive packets on two network links, is used to infer if the links carry the same connection. The encryption and padding does not affect the inter-packet interval related to the same IP flow. Sequences of inter-packet interval vary greatly between connections, for example in web browsing, the traffic occurs in bursts. This fact can be used to identify a connection.\n\n\n*** Active attack ***\nActive attacks can be performed by injecting bursts of packets that contain unique timing signatures into the targeted flow. The attacker can perform attacks to attempt to identify these packets on other network links. The attacker might not be able to create new packets due to the required knowledge of symmetric keys on all the subsequent  mixes. Replay packets cannot be used either as they are easily preventable through hashing and caching.\n\n\n*** Artificial gap ***\nLarge gaps can be created in the target flow, if the attacker drops large volumes of consecutive packets in the flow. For example, a simulation is run sending 3000 packets to the target flow, where the attacker drops the packets 1 second after the start of the flow. As the number of consecutive packets dropped increases, the effectiveness of defensive dropping decreases significantly. Introducing a large gap will almost always create a recognizable feature.\n\n\n*** Artificial bursts ***\nThe attacker can create artificial bursts.

    "instruction": "Answer questions about:\nMAC spoofing\n\n==Introduction==\nMAC spoofing is a technique for changing a factory-assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device. The MAC address that is hard-coded on a network interface controller (NIC) cannot be changed. However, many drivers allow the MAC address to be changed. Additionally, there are tools which can make an operating system believe that the NIC has the MAC address of a user's choosing. The process of masking a MAC address is known as MAC spoofing.  Essentially, MAC spoofing entails changing a computer's identity, for any reason.\n\n== Motivation ==\nChanging the assigned MAC address may allow the user to bypass access control lists on servers or routers, either hiding a computer on a network or allowing it to impersonate another network device. It may also allow the user to bypass MAC address blacklisting to regain access to a Wi-Fi network. However, MAC spoofing does not work when trying to bypass parental controls if automatic MAC filtering is turned on. MAC spoofing is done for legitimate and illicit purposes alike.\n\n\n*** New hardware for existing Internet Service Providers (ISP) ***\nMany ISPs register the client's MAC address for service and billing services. Since MAC addresses are unique and hard-coded on network interface controller (NIC) cards, when the client wants to connect a new device or change an existing one, the ISP will detect different MAC addresses and might not grant Internet access to those new devices. This can be circumvented easily by MAC spoofing, with the client only needing to spoof the new device's MAC address so it appears to be the MAC address that was registered by the ISP. In this case, the client spoofs their MAC address to gain Internet access from multiple devices. While this is generally a legitimate case, MAC spoofing of new devices can be considered illegal if the ISP's user agreement prevents the user from connecting more than one device to their service. Moreover, the client is not the only person who can spoof their MAC address to gain access to the ISP.  Computer crackers can gain unauthorized access to the ISP via the same technique. This allows them to gain access to unauthorized services, while being difficult to identify and track as they are using the client's identity. This action is considered an illegitimate and illegal use of MAC spoofing.This also applies to customer-premises equipment, such as cable and DSL modems.  If leased to the customer on a monthly basis, the equipment has a hard-coded MAC address known to the provider's distribution networks, allowing service to be established as long as the customer is not in billing arrears. In cases where the provider allows customers to provide their own equipment (and thus avoid the monthly leasing fee on their bill), the provider sometimes requires that the customer provide the MAC address of their equipment before service is established.\n\n\n*** Fulfilling software requirements ***\nSome software can only be installed and run on systems with pre-defined MAC addresses as stated in the software end-user license agreement, and users have to comply with this requirement in order to gain access to the software. If the user has to install different hardware due to malfunction of the original device or if there is a problem with the user's NIC card, then the software will not recognize the new hardware. However, this problem can be solved using MAC spoofing. The user has to spoof the new MAC address so that it appears to be the address that was in use when the software was registered.  Legal issues might arise if the software is run on multiple devices at once by using MAC spoofing. At the same time, the user can access software for which they have not secured a license. Contacting the software vendor might be the safest route to take if there is a hardware problem preventing access to the software.\nSome softwares may also perform MAC filtering in an attempt to ensure unauthorized users cannot gain access to certain networks which would otherwise be freely accessible with the software. Such cases can be considered illegitimate or illegal activity and legal action may be taken.\n\n\n*** Identity masking ***\nIf a user chooses to spoof their MAC address in order to protect their privacy, this is called identity masking. As an example motivation, on Wi-Fi network connections a MAC address is not encrypted. Even the secure IEEE 802.11i-2004 (WPA) encryption method does not prevent Wi-Fi networks from sending out MAC addresses. Hence, in order to avoid being tracked, the user might choose to spoof the device's MAC address. However, computer crackers use the same technique to bypass access control methods such as MAC filtering, without revealing their identity. MAC filtering prevents access to a network if the MAC address of the device attempting to connect does not match any addresses marked as allowed, which is used by some networks. Computer crackers can use MAC spoofing to gain access to networks utilising MAC filtering if any of the allowed MAC addresses are known to them, possibly with the intent of causing damage, while appearing to be one of the legitimate users of the network. As a result, the real offender may go undetected by law enforcement.\n\n\n*** MAC Address Randomization in WiFi ***\nTo prevent third parties from using MAC addresses to track devices, Android, Linux, iOS, and Windows have implemented MAC address randomization. In June 2014, Apple announced that future versions of iOS would randomize MAC addresses for all WiFi connections.  The Linux kernel has supported MAC address randomization during network scans since March 2015, but drivers need to be updated to use this feature. Windows has supported it since the release of Windows 10 in July 2015.\n\n== Controversy ==\nAlthough MAC address spoofing is not illegal, its practice has caused controversy in some cases.

      "context": "MAC spoofing\n\n==Introduction==\nMAC spoofing is a technique for changing a factory-assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device. The MAC address that is hard-coded on a network interface controller (NIC) cannot be changed. However, many drivers allow the MAC address to be changed. Additionally, there are tools which can make an operating system believe that the NIC has the MAC address of a user's choosing. The process of masking a MAC address is known as MAC spoofing.  Essentially, MAC spoofing entails changing a computer's identity, for any reason.\n\n== Motivation ==\nChanging the assigned MAC address may allow the user to bypass access control lists on servers or routers, either hiding a computer on a network or allowing it to impersonate another network device. It may also allow the user to bypass MAC address blacklisting to regain access to a Wi-Fi network. However, MAC spoofing does not work when trying to bypass parental controls if automatic MAC filtering is turned on. MAC spoofing is done for legitimate and illicit purposes alike.\n\n\n*** New hardware for existing Internet Service Providers (ISP) ***\nMany ISPs register the client's MAC address for service and billing services. Since MAC addresses are unique and hard-coded on network interface controller (NIC) cards, when the client wants to connect a new device or change an existing one, the ISP will detect different MAC addresses and might not grant Internet access to those new devices. This can be circumvented easily by MAC spoofing, with the client only needing to spoof the new device's MAC address so it appears to be the MAC address that was registered by the ISP. In this case, the client spoofs their MAC address to gain Internet access from multiple devices. While this is generally a legitimate case, MAC spoofing of new devices can be considered illegal if the ISP's user agreement prevents the user from connecting more than one device to their service. Moreover, the client is not the only person who can spoof their MAC address to gain access to the ISP.  Computer crackers can gain unauthorized access to the ISP via the same technique. This allows them to gain access to unauthorized services, while being difficult to identify and track as they are using the client's identity. This action is considered an illegitimate and illegal use of MAC spoofing.This also applies to customer-premises equipment, such as cable and DSL modems.  If leased to the customer on a monthly basis, the equipment has a hard-coded MAC address known to the provider's distribution networks, allowing service to be established as long as the customer is not in billing arrears. In cases where the provider allows customers to provide their own equipment (and thus avoid the monthly leasing fee on their bill), the provider sometimes requires that the customer provide the MAC address of their equipment before service is established.\n\n\n*** Fulfilling software requirements ***\nSome software can only be installed and run on systems with pre-defined MAC addresses as stated in the software end-user license agreement, and users have to comply with this requirement in order to gain access to the software. If the user has to install different hardware due to malfunction of the original device or if there is a problem with the user's NIC card, then the software will not recognize the new hardware. However, this problem can be solved using MAC spoofing. The user has to spoof the new MAC address so that it appears to be the address that was in use when the software was registered.  Legal issues might arise if the software is run on multiple devices at once by using MAC spoofing. At the same time, the user can access software for which they have not secured a license. Contacting the software vendor might be the safest route to take if there is a hardware problem preventing access to the software.\nSome softwares may also perform MAC filtering in an attempt to ensure unauthorized users cannot gain access to certain networks which would otherwise be freely accessible with the software. Such cases can be considered illegitimate or illegal activity and legal action may be taken.\n\n\n*** Identity masking ***\nIf a user chooses to spoof their MAC address in order to protect their privacy, this is called identity masking. As an example motivation, on Wi-Fi network connections a MAC address is not encrypted. Even the secure IEEE 802.11i-2004 (WPA) encryption method does not prevent Wi-Fi networks from sending out MAC addresses. Hence, in order to avoid being tracked, the user might choose to spoof the device's MAC address. However, computer crackers use the same technique to bypass access control methods such as MAC filtering, without revealing their identity. MAC filtering prevents access to a network if the MAC address of the device attempting to connect does not match any addresses marked as allowed, which is used by some networks. Computer crackers can use MAC spoofing to gain access to networks utilising MAC filtering if any of the allowed MAC addresses are known to them, possibly with the intent of causing damage, while appearing to be one of the legitimate users of the network. As a result, the real offender may go undetected by law enforcement.\n\n\n*** MAC Address Randomization in WiFi ***\nTo prevent third parties from using MAC addresses to track devices, Android, Linux, iOS, and Windows have implemented MAC address randomization. In June 2014, Apple announced that future versions of iOS would randomize MAC addresses for all WiFi connections.  The Linux kernel has supported MAC address randomization during network scans since March 2015, but drivers need to be updated to use this feature. Windows has supported it since the release of Windows 10 in July 2015.\n\n== Controversy ==\nAlthough MAC address spoofing is not illegal, its practice has caused controversy in some cases. In the 2012 indictment against Aaron Swartz, an Internet hacktivist who was accused of illegally accessing files from the JSTOR digital library, prosecutors claimed that because he had spoofed his MAC address, this showed purposeful intent to commit criminal acts. In June 2014, Apple announced that future versions of their iOS platform would randomize MAC addresses for all WiFi connections, making it more difficult for internet service providers to track user activities and identities, which resurrected moral and legal arguments surrounding the practice of MAC spoofing among several blogs and newspapers.\n\n== Limitations ==\nMAC address spoofing is limited to the local broadcast domain.

    "instruction": "Read this and answer the below questions\n\nKey stretching\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, key stretching techniques are used to make a possibly weak key, typically a password or passphrase, more secure against a brute-force attack by increasing the resources (time and possibly space) it takes to test each possible key.  Passwords or passphrases created by humans are often short or predictable enough to allow password cracking, and key stretching is intended to make such attacks more difficult by complicating a basic step of trying a single password candidate.  Key stretching also improves security in some real-world applications where the key length has been constrained, by mimicking a longer key length from the perspective of a brute-force attacker.There are several ways to perform key stretching. One way is to apply a cryptographic hash function or a block cipher repeatedly in a loop. For example, in applications where the key is used for a cipher, the key schedule in the cipher may be modified so that it takes a specific length of time to perform. Another way is to use cryptographic hash functions that have large memory requirements \u2013 these can be effective in frustrating attacks by memory-bound adversaries.\n\n== Process ==\nKey stretching algorithms depend on an algorithm which receives an input key and then expends considerable effort to generate a stretched cipher (called an enhanced key) mimicking randomness and longer key length.  The algorithm must have no known shortcut, so the most efficient way to relate the input and cipher is to repeat the key stretching algorithm itself.  This compels brute-force attackers to expend the same effort for each attempt.  If this added effort compares to a brute-force key search of all keys with a certain key length, then the input key may be described as stretched by that same length.Key stretching leaves an attacker with two options: \n\nAttempt possible combinations of the enhanced key, but this is infeasible if the enhanced key is sufficiently long and unpredictable (\u200a\u2060i.e.,\u2009the algorithm mimics randomness well enough that the attacker must trial the entire stretched key space)\nAttempt possible combinations of the weaker initial key, potentially commencing with a dictionary attack if the initial key is a password or passphrase, but the attacker's added effort for each trial could render the attack uneconomic should the costlier computation and memory consumption outweigh the expected profitIf the attacker uses the same class of hardware as the user, each guess will take the similar amount of time to process as it took the user (for example, one second). Even if the attacker has much greater computing resources than the user, the key stretching will still slow the attacker down while not seriously affecting the usability of the system for any legitimate user. This is because the user's computer only has to compute the stretching function once upon the user entering their password, whereas the attacker must compute it for every guess in the attack.\nThis process does not alter the original key-space entropy.  The key stretching algorithm is deterministic, allowing a weak input to always generate the same enhanced key, but therefore limiting the enhanced key to no more possible combinations than the input key space.  Consequently, this attack remains vulnerable if unprotected against certain time-memory tradeoffs such as developing rainbow tables to target multiple instances of the enhanced key space in parallel (effectively a shortcut to repeating the algorithm).  For this reason, key stretching is often combined with salting.\n\n== Hash-based ==\nMany libraries provide functions which perform key stretching as part of their function; see crypt(3) for an example. PBKDF2 is for generating an encryption key from a password, and not necessarily for password authentication. PBKDF2 can be used for both if the number of output bits is less than or equal to the internal hashing algorithm used in PBKDF2, which is usually SHA-2 (up to 512 bits), or used as an encryption key to encrypt static data.\n\n== Strength and time ==\nThese examples assume that a consumer CPU can do about 65,000 SHA-1 hashes in one second. Thus, a program that uses key stretching can use 65,000 rounds of hashes and delay the user for at most one second.\nTesting a trial password or passphrase typically requires one hash operation. But if key stretching was used, the attacker must compute a strengthened key for each key they test, meaning there are 65,000 hashes to compute per test. This increases the attacker's workload by a factor of 65,000, approximately 216, which means the enhanced key is worth about 16 additional bits in key strength.\nMoore's law asserts that computer speed doubles roughly every 2 years. Under this assumption, every 2 years one more bit of key strength is plausibly brute-forcible. This implies that 16 extra bits of strength is worth about 16\u00d72\n\n== Some systems that use key stretching ==\nSome but not all disk encryption software (see comparison of disk encryption software):\n\n7-Zip\nApache .htpasswd \"APR1\" and OpenSSL \"passwd\" use 1000 rounds of MD5 key stretching.\nKeePass and KeePassXC, open-source password manager utilities. As of 2020, the latest version uses Argon2d with default 1 second key stretching delay.\nLinux and some other Unix-like systems offer SHAcrypt modes that perform 5000 SHA256 or SHA512 hash iterations by default, with a minimum of 1000, and a maximum of 999,999,999.\nPassword Safe open-source password manager.\nPGP, GPG encryption software. GPG by default iterates a hash 65536 times.\nWi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) wireless encryption protocol in personal mode used PBKDF2 with 4096 iterations. (WPA3 uses Simultaneous Authentication of Equals which claims to not expose password hashes.)\n\nHow do key stretching techniques enhance the security of a password or passphrase?Question: What is the purpose of key stretching in the key schedule of a cipher?Question: What is the role of the key stretching algorithm in generating a stretched cipher?Question: How does key stretching affect brute-force attackers?Question: How does key stretching slow down attackers without affecting the usability of the system for legitimate users?Question: Does key stretching alter the original key-space entropy?Question: Why is key stretching often combined with salting?Question: What is the purpose of the PBKDF2 function in key stretching?Question: How does the number of rounds of hashes used in key stretching affect the attacker's workload?Question: What is the implication of 16 extra bits of key strength in key stretching?Question: What is the default key stretching delay used in KeePass and KeePassXC?Question: How many SHA256 or SHA512 hash iterations are performed by default in SHAcrypt modes offered by Linux and some other Unix-like systems?Question: How many iterations of a hash does GPG use by default in its encryption software?Question: How many iterations of PBKDF2 does Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) wireless encryption protocol in personal mode use?Question: What is the primary purpose of key stretching in password-based cryptography?",

If this added effort compares to a brute-force key search of all keys with a certain key length, then the input key may be described as stretched by that same length.Key stretching leaves an attacker with two options: \n\nAttempt possible combinations of the enhanced key, but this is infeasible if the enhanced key is sufficiently long and unpredictable (\u200a\u2060i.e.,\u2009the algorithm mimics randomness well enough that the attacker must trial the entire stretched key space)\nAttempt possible combinations of the weaker initial key, potentially commencing with a dictionary attack if the initial key is a password or passphrase, but the attacker's added effort for each trial could render the attack uneconomic should the costlier computation and memory consumption outweigh the expected profitIf the attacker uses the same class of hardware as the user, each guess will take the similar amount of time to process as it took the user (for example, one second). Even if the attacker has much greater computing resources than the user, the key stretching will still slow the attacker down while not seriously affecting the usability of the system for any legitimate user. This is because the user's computer only has to compute the stretching function once upon the user entering their password, whereas the attacker must compute it for every guess in the attack.\nThis process does not alter the original key-space entropy.  The key stretching algorithm is deterministic, allowing a weak input to always generate the same enhanced key, but therefore limiting the enhanced key to no more possible combinations than the input key space.  Consequently, this attack remains vulnerable if unprotected against certain time-memory tradeoffs such as developing rainbow tables to target multiple instances of the enhanced key space in parallel (effectively a shortcut to repeating the algorithm).  For this reason, key stretching is often combined with salting.\n\n== Hash-based ==\nMany libraries provide functions which perform key stretching as part of their function; see crypt(3) for an example. PBKDF2 is for generating an encryption key from a password, and not necessarily for password authentication. PBKDF2 can be used for both if the number of output bits is less than or equal to the internal hashing algorithm used in PBKDF2, which is usually SHA-2 (up to 512 bits), or used as an encryption key to encrypt static data.\n\n== Strength and time ==\nThese examples assume that a consumer CPU can do about 65,000 SHA-1 hashes in one second. Thus, a program that uses key stretching can use 65,000 rounds of hashes and delay the user for at most one second.\nTesting a trial password or passphrase typically requires one hash operation. But if key stretching was used, the attacker must compute a strengthened key for each key they test, meaning there are 65,000 hashes to compute per test. This increases the attacker's workload by a factor of 65,000, approximately 216, which means the enhanced key is worth about 16 additional bits in key strength.\nMoore's law asserts that computer speed doubles roughly every 2 years. Under this assumption, every 2 years one more bit of key strength is plausibly brute-forcible. This implies that 16 extra bits of strength is worth about 16\u00d72\n\n== Some systems that use key stretching ==\nSome but not all disk encryption software (see comparison of disk encryption software):\n\n7-Zip\nApache .htpasswd \"APR1\" and OpenSSL \"passwd\" use 1000 rounds of MD5 key stretching.\nKeePass and KeePassXC, open-source password manager utilities. As of 2020, the latest version uses Argon2d with default 1 second key stretching delay.\nLinux and some other Unix-like systems offer SHAcrypt modes that perform 5000 SHA256 or SHA512 hash iterations by default, with a minimum of 1000, and a maximum of 999,999,999.\nPassword Safe open-source password manager.\nPGP, GPG encryption software. GPG by default iterates a hash 65536 times.\nWi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) wireless encryption protocol in personal mode used PBKDF2 with 4096 iterations. (WPA3 uses Simultaneous Authentication of Equals which claims to not expose password hashes.)",

      "answers": "Key stretching techniques enhance the security of a password or passphrase by increasing the resources (time and possibly space) it takes to test each possible key, making brute-force attacks more difficult. This is achieved by applying a cryptographic hash function or a block cipher repeatedly in a loop, or using cryptographic hash functions that have large memory requirements.Answer: The purpose of key stretching in the key schedule of a cipher is to take a specific length of time to perform, mimicking a longer key length from the perspective of a brute-force attacker.Answer: The key stretching algorithm receives an input key and exerts considerable effort to generate a stretched cipher, mimicking randomness and longer key length. The algorithm must have no known shortcut, so the most efficient way to relate the input and cipher is to repeat the key stretching algorithm itself.Answer: Key stretching compels brute-force attackers to expend the same effort for each attempt, leaving them with two options: attempting possible combinations of the enhanced key, which is infeasible if the enhanced key is sufficiently long and unpredictable, or attempting possible combinations of the weaker initial key, potentially commencing with a dictionary attack.Answer: Key stretching slows down attackers by requiring them to compute the stretching function for every guess in the attack, while the user's computer only has to compute the stretching function once upon the user entering their password.Answer: No, key stretching does not alter the original key-space entropy.

    "instruction": "Please answer questions about the following article about: Candiru (spyware company)\n\n==Introduction==\nCandiru, today known as SAITO TECH is a Tel Aviv-based technology company offering surveillance and cyberespionage technology to governmental clients.Candiru offers cyberespionage tools that can be used to infiltrate computers, servers, mobile devices, and cloud accounts. Its specialty appears to be infiltration of computers, particularly those running Windows OS., though in recent years the company has begun developing tools against both iOS and android devices. Also some effort has been spent for developing macOS attacking tools.\nThe company has been described as secretive, with Haaretz describing it as \"one of Israel\u2019s most mysterious cyber warfare companies\". It does not have a website and requires employees to sign non-disclosure agreements and not to reveal their place of employment on LinkedIn. The company recruits heavily from the IDF's intelligence unit Unit 8200.The company is named after the candiru, an Amazonian parasitic fish notorious for its apocryphal ability to invade and parasitise the human urethra. The company also uses a silhouette of the candiru fish as its logo. The company changes its name frequently (most recently to Saito Tech) in an effort to obscure its existence.\n\n\n\n== Corporate profile ==\nOverview\nCandiru was founded by Eran Shorer and Yaakov Weizman in 2014 as Candiru Ltd. Its chairman and largest shareholder is Isaac Zach, who is also a founding funder of the NSO Group. Additionally, Candiru was reportedly financially backed by Founders Group, which was co-founded by Omri Lavie, who is also one of the founders of NSO Groups. Candiru is thought to be Israel's second-largest cyberespionage company after NSO Group, and it has been suggested that Candiru may seek to merge with NSO Group.The company has frequently relocated its offices and \u2013 though still known under its original name Candiru \u2013 has also undergone multiple changes of its registered name (including to Grindavik Solutions, LDF Associates, Taveta, D.F. Associates, Greenwick Solutions, Tabatha, and, finally, Saito Tech (current registered name)).Corporate history\nCandiru was founded by Eran Shorer and Yaakov Weizman in 2014 as Candiru Ltd.According to information from court filings of a lawsuit filed against Candiru by a former senior employee, the company had 12 employees at the end of 2015, 70 employees by the end of 2018, and had since grown to a 150 employees. During the first year after its founding, the company had no clients, but by the beginning 2016, the company had a number of deals in the advanced stage with clients from Europe, former Soviet Union, the Persian Gulf, Asia, and Latin America. According to the plaintiff, the company grossed $10 million worth in sales in 2016, and nearly $30 million in 2017, though the figures appear to refer to multi-year deals. In another part of the lawsuit, the plaintiff indicates that the company's 2018 revenues were worth about $20 million. A document appended to the lawsuit suggests that the company was in negotiations with potential clients from over 60 countries with a total value of $367 million. According to information from the lawsuit provided to the court by the defendant (Candiru), the company collaborates with intermediaries in target countries that help complete the deals and earn a 15% commission for their services. According to the plaintiff, Candiru senior management decided to begin development of spyware for mobile phones in 2017, however, the sale and marketing of phone spyware was halted by the company's chairman in early 2018. As defendant, Candiru complained that the plaintiff had revealed secret security information in the lawsuit and demanded that the proceedings continue as closed hearings and that information about the proceedings be concealed from the public.According to reporting from January 2019, Candiru was believed to employ 120 people and to have generated annual sales of $30 million, which would make it Israel's second-largest cyberespionage firm.According to reporting from December 2019, Candiru's market capitalisation was $90 million (based on the sale of a 10% stake in Candiru which was sold by venture capitalist Eli Wartman to Universal Motors for $9 million).Candiru has reportedly been carrying out business negotiations with Singapore (reported in 2019), and Qatar (reported in 2020). A company linked to the Qatari sovereign wealth fund has invested in Candiru.According to a report in July 2021 by CitizenLab, Candiru\u2019s exploits have been linked to nation-state malware attacks observed in Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates.The cyber firm receives boost from the investors of Qatar, as several investment funds ties to Qatar Investment Authority took a stake in the spyware firm Candiru.Candiru has at least one subsidiary \u2013 Sokoto \u2013 which was incorporated in March 2020.As of December 2020, the company's board members were Shorer, Weitzman, Zach, and a representative of Universal Motors Israel (which is a Candiru shareholder). According to 2021 filings, the largest shareholders were Shorer, Weitzman, and Zach. Other shareholders were Universal Motors Israel LTD, ESOP management and trust services, and Optas Industry Ltd.\n\n== Products and services ==\nCandiru offers its products and services to governmental law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies to aid surveillance, data exfiltration, and offensive cyber operations. It deals with government clients only. The company states that it prohibits deployment of its products within the U.S., Israel, Russia, China, or Iran (though Microsoft identified Candiru targets in Israel and Iran).Candidate target platforms, infiltration methods, and capabilities\nCandiru's specialty appears to be computer spyware (particularly for Windows devices, though it has also developed spyware for computers running Apple's MacOS). It also offers spyware for mobile platforms, servers, and cloud accounts. Candiru allegedly offers a range of target infiltration approaches, including infiltration through hyperlinks, man-in-the-middle attacks, weaponised files, physical attack, and a program called \"Sherlock\" (it is unclear what the program does, but is claimed to be effective for Windows, iOS, and Android, according to Candiru). The company would reportedly also design new custom spyware in cases where none of the tools in its standard repertoire are successful in infiltrating the target.According to a leaked company document published in 2020, the company's products can be used to infiltrate PC computers, networks, mobile handsets, are compatible with multiple operating system environments (\"PC/Windows, iOX, and Android\"), require minimal target interaction to achieve infiltration, and are \"silently deployed\" and \"untraceable\". The leaked document goes on to state that once deployed, the spyware can exfiltrate data from the compromised device (including data from social media accounts, communication programs/apps, or the device's microphone or camera) and can also identify and map networks the target is connected to. According to a 2019 marketing document, the spyware does not cause any interruption of the target device.Services and prices\nAccording to a leaked Candiru document, the company offers various services bundles to customers that vary in price depending on the number of devices targeted and number of countries in which the spyware is deployed against targets (the client is offered an unlimited number of deployment attempts). Clients are also charged extra if they choose to capture browser cookie data or data from apps (including Twitter, Viber, and Signal), or if they wish to gain full command-and-control access to the target's device (which may be used to implant incriminating materials onto the devices). The basic bundle was priced at \u20ac16 million and allowed for monitoring of 10 devices, the ability to monitor 15 additional devices and operate in one additional countries cost a further \u20ac1.5 million, the ability to monitor 25 additional devices and conduct espionage in 5 more countries cost a further \u20ac5.5 million, and remote control access of a device cost a further \u20ac1.5 million, with exfiltration of cookies or app data costing \u20ac200.000 or \u2013 in the case of Signal \u2013 \u20ac500.000.Uncovered Candiru spyware vulnerability exploits\nAccording to findings of a joint investigation by CitizenLab and Microsoft (published in July 2021), Candiru uses sham websites with URLs made to resemble real websites to covertly infiltrate devices, potentially enabling persistent access to the device (including exfiltration capabilities). Microsoft's threat intelligence center identified and patched a Windows vulnerability exploited by Candiru spyware in July 2021. Microsoft's analysis of the spyware revealed that in addition to enabling exfiltration of files, messages, and passwords, the spyware also enables the operator to send messages from logged in email and social media accounts directly from the target's computer. Additionally, CitizenLab reported that Candiru exploited two vulnerabilities in the browser Google Chrome. Google also linked a Microsoft Office exploit to Candiru.\n\nWho are the founders of Candiru and what is the company's year of establishment?Question: What is the role of Candiru in the cybersecurity industry?Question: How secretive is Candiru as a company?Question: What are some of the operating systems that Candiru's spyware targets?Question: Who are some of Candiru's financiers?Question: How many employees does Candiru have?Question: Who are some of Candiru's clients?Question: What is Candiru's policy on deploying its products within certain countries?Question: What are some of the infiltration approaches that Candiru allegedly offers?Question: What can Candiru's spyware do once it is deployed on a device?Question: What are the prices for Candiru's services?Question: How does Candiru covertly infiltrate devices?Question: What vulnerabilities has Candiru exploited in its spyware?Question: What is Candiru's market capitalization?Question: Who are some of Candiru's subsidiaries?",

    "instruction": "text: German Parliamentary Committee investigation of the NSA spying scandal\n\n==Introduction==\nThe German Parliamentary Committee investigation of the NSA spying scandal (official title: 1. Untersuchungsausschuss \u201eNSA\u201c) was started on March 20, 2014, by the German Parliament in order to investigate the extent and background of foreign secret services spying in Germany in the light of the Global surveillance disclosures (2013\u2013present).\nThe Committee is also in search of strategies on how to protect telecommunication with technical means.\n\n\n\n== Members ==\nThe committee is formed by eight members of the German Parliament. The parliamentarian of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Clemens Binninger was head of the committee but stepped down after six days. In a statement, Binninger clarified that the other committee members had insisted on inviting Edward Snowden to testify; Binninger objected to this and resigned in protest. Patrick Sensburg (CDU) succeeded him.\n\n== Witnesses ==\n\n\n*** Discussion about the witness Snowden ***\nOn May 8, 2014, the committee unanimously decided to let US whistleblower Edward Snowden testify as a witness.On September 23, 2014, the Green Party and The Left filed a constitutional complaint against the Christian Democratic Union, the Social Democrats and the NSA Parliamentary Committee because of the Christian Democrats' and the Social Democrats' refusal to let the witness Edward Snowden testify in Berlin. The accused proposed a video conference from Moscow which Snowden had refused.On September 28, 2014, the Green Party and The Left filed a constitutional complaint against German chancellor Merkel. According to them, she refuses to comply with her duty according to Chapter 44 of the German constitution to ensure a real investigation; especially by refusing to ensure the legal requirements to allow the witness Edward Snowden to testify.\n\n\n*** Testimony of Binney and Drake ***\nOn July 3, 2014, the former Technical Director of the NSA,  William Binney, who had become a whistleblower after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, testified to the committee. He said that the NSA has a totalitarian approach that has previously only been known from dictatorships and that there is no longer such a thing as privacy. Former NSA employee Thomas Andrews Drake described the close cooperation between the NSA and the German foreign intelligence service BND.\n\n\n*** Failed testimony of Greenwald ***\nThe US journalist Glenn Greenwald was asked to testify in September, 2014. On August 1, 2014, he wrote in a letter that he was willing to support the Parliament's investigation on the espionage in Germany by the NSA. By their refusal to let the crucial witness Edward Snowden testify, German politicians had however shown that it is more important to them not to annoy the US than to really investigate and he was not willing to take part in a \"ritual\" that \"shall seem like an investigation\".\n\n== Operation Eikonal selectors ==\nIn Operation Eikonal German BND agents received \"Selector Lists\" from the NSA \u2212 search terms for their dragnet surveillance. They contain IP addresses, mobile phone numbers and email accounts with the BND surveillance system containing hundreds of thousands and possibly more than a million such targets. These lists have been subject of controversy as in 2008 it was revealed that they contained some terms targeting the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS), the Eurocopter project as well as French administration, which were first noticed by BND employees in 2005. Other selectors were found to target the administration of Austria. After the revelations made by whistleblower Edward Snowden the BND decided to investigate the issue whose October 2013 conclusion was that at least 2,000 of these selectors were aimed at Western European or even German interests which has been a violation of the Memorandum of Agreement that the US and Germany signed in 2002 in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks. After reports emerged in 2014 that EADS and Eurocopter had been surveillance targets the Left Party and the Greens filed an official request to obtain evidence of the violations.The investigative Parliamentary Committee was set up in spring 2014 and reviewed the selectors and discovered 40,000 suspicious search parameters, including espionage targets in Western European governments and numerous companies. The group also confirmed suspicions that the NSA had systematically violated German interests and concluded that the Americans could have perpetrated economic espionage directly under the Germans' noses. The investigative parliamentary committee was not granted access to the NSA's selectors list as an appeal led by opposition politicians failed at Germany's top court - instead the ruling coalition appointed an administrative judge, Kurt Graulich, as a \"person of trust\" who was granted access to the list and briefed the investigative commission on its contents after analyzing the 40,000 parameters. In his almost 300-paged report Graulich concluded that European government agencies were targeted massively and that Americans hence broke contractual agreements. He also found that German targets which received special protection from surveillance of domestic intelligence agencies by Germany's Basic Law (Grundgesetz) \u2212 including numerous enterprises based in Germany \u2212 were featured in the NSA's wishlist in a surprising plenitude. While the magnitude differs there have also been problematic BND-internal selectors which have been used until end of 2013 - around two thirds of 3300 targets were related to EU and NATO states. Klaus Landefeld, member of the board at the Internet industry association Eco International, has met intelligence officials and legislators to present suggestions for improvement, like streamlining the selector system.\n\n== Spying on the committee ==\nOn July 4, 2014, it was revealed to the public that BND agent Markus R. had been arrested on July 2, 2014, for apparently having spied. The 31-year-old German is accused of having worked for the CIA. After his arrest, the US ambassador John B. Emerson was summoned for talks at the German Foreign Office.It was revealed that the BND-agent had saved 218 secret BND documents on USB sticks since 2012 and sold them to US agents for a sum of 25,000 Euro in Salzburg, Austria. At least three of the documents were about the NSA Parliamentary Committee.\nThe Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution had mistaken him for a Russian spy and asked US colleagues to help uncover him.On July 9, 2014, a second US spy was discovered, who worked for the Secretary of Defense.In July 2014 a Parliament technician found out that the mobile phone of Roderich Kiesewetter, representative of the Christian Democratic Union in the committee, was spied on. Kiesewetter said there is evidence that all four Party representatives in the committee have been spied on.\n\n== Document leaks ==\nIn the months following May 2015, Peter Pilz, a member of the Austrian parliament for the Green Party, disclosed several documents and transcripts related to operation Eikonal, in which NSA and BND cooperated for tapping transit cables at a facility of Deutsche Telekom in Frankfurt. These documents were highly sensitive and handed over to the committee for investigating the Eikonal operation. Therefore, it seems likely someone from the committee leaked these documents to Pilz. Among them are lists of communication channels from many European countries, including most of Germany's neighbours. Peter Pilz also discovered NSA spying facilities in Austria, and therefore wants a parliamentary committee on the NSA spying in his own country too.On December 1, 2016, WikiLeaks released over 2,400 documents which it claims are from the investigation.\n\nQuestions: What was the reason for Clemens Binninger's resignation as head of the German Parliamentary Committee investigation of the NSA spying scandal?question: Who succeeded Clemens Binninger as head of the German Parliamentary Committee investigation of the NSA spying scandal?question: Why did the Green Party and The Left file a constitutional complaint against the Christian Democratic Union, the Social Democrats and the NSA Parliamentary Committee?question: Why did the Green Party and The Left file a constitutional complaint against German chancellor Merkel?question: Who is William Binney and what is his role in the NSA spying scandal?question: Who is Thomas Andrews Drake and what is his role in the NSA spying scandal?question: Why was Glenn Greenwald not willing to testify in September 2014?question: What were the \"Selector Lists\" from the NSA that the German BND agents received in Operation Eikonal?question: What were the controversial targets in the \"Selector Lists\" from the NSA in Operation Eikonal?question: Who is Markus R. and what is he accused of?question: Why was the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution mistaken about Markus R.?question: Who discovered a second US spy in July 2014?question: Who found out that the mobile phone of Roderich Kiesewetter was spied on in July 2014?question: Who is Peter Pilz and what did he disclose in the months following May 2015?question: What did WikiLeaks release on December 1, 2016?",

    "instruction": "text: ZeroAccess botnet\n\n==Introduction==\nZeroAccess is a Trojan horse computer malware that affects Microsoft Windows operating systems. It is used to download other malware on an infected machine from a botnet while remaining hidden using rootkit techniques.\n\n== History and propagation ==\nThe ZeroAccess botnet was discovered at least around May 2011. The ZeroAccess rootkit responsible for the botnet's spread is estimated to have been present on at least 9 million systems. Estimates botnet size vary across sources; antivirus vendor Sophos estimated the botnet size at around 1 million active and infected machines in the third quarter of 2012, and security firm Kindsight estimated 2.2 million infected and active systems.The bot itself is spread through the ZeroAccess rootkit through a variety of attack vectors. One attack vector is a form of social engineering, where a user is persuaded to execute malicious code either by disguising it as a legitimate file, or including it hidden as an additional payload in an executable that announces itself as, for example, bypassing copyright protection (a keygen). A second attack vector utilizes an advertising network in order to have the user click on an advertisement that redirects them to a site hosting the malicious software itself. Finally, a third infection vector used is an affiliate scheme where third-party persons are paid for installing the rootkit on a system.In December 2013 a coalition led by Microsoft moved to destroy the command and control network for the botnet. The attack was ineffective though because not all C&C were seized, and its peer-to-peer command and control component was unaffected - meaning the botnet could still be updated at will.\n\n== Operation ==\nOnce a system has been infected with the ZeroAccess rootkit it will start one of the two main botnet operations: bitcoin mining or click fraud. Machines involved in bitcoin mining generate bitcoins for their controller, the estimated worth of which was 2.7 million US dollars per year in September 2012. The machines used for click fraud simulate clicks on website advertisements paid for on a pay per click basis. The estimated profit for this activity may be as high as 100,000 US dollars per day, costing advertisers $900,000 a day in fraudulent clicks. Typically, ZeroAccess infects the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the infected machine. It may alternatively infect a random driver in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Drivers giving it total control over the operating system. It also disables the Windows Security Center, Firewall, and Windows Defender from the operating system. ZeroAccess also hooks itself into the TCP/IP stack to help with the click fraud.\nThe software also looks for the Tidserv malware and removes it if it finds it.\n\nQuestions: How does the ZeroAccess botnet affect Windows operating systems?q: What is the purpose of the ZeroAccess rootkit in the botnet's operation?q: How is the ZeroAccess botnet spread through social engineering?q: How does the ZeroAccess botnet use advertising networks to propagate?q: How does the ZeroAccess botnet use affiliate schemes to spread?q: What was the outcome of the December 2013 attack on the ZeroAccess botnet?q: What are the two main operations of the ZeroAccess botnet?q: How much revenue did the ZeroAccess botnet generate through bitcoin mining in September 2012?q: How much profit does the ZeroAccess botnet make through click fraud per day?q: Where does the ZeroAccess botnet typically infect the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the infected machine?q: How does the ZeroAccess botnet disable the Windows Security Center, Firewall, and Windows Defender?q: How does the ZeroAccess botnet hook itself into the TCP/IP stack?q: What other malware does the ZeroAccess botnet look for and remove?q: How does the ZeroAccess botnet use peer-to-peer command and control?q: What is the estimated size of the ZeroAccess botnet in the third quarter of 2012?",

It helps the botnet to remain hidden on the infected machine while performing malicious activities such as downloading other malware, bitcoin mining, and click fraud.a: The ZeroAccess botnet can be spread through social engineering by disguising malicious code as a legitimate file or including it hidden as an additional payload in an executable that announces itself as a legitimate program such as bypassing copyright protection (a keygen).a: The ZeroAccess botnet can use an advertising network to have the user click on an advertisement that redirects them to a site hosting the malicious software itself.a: The ZeroAccess botnet can use affiliate schemes where third-party persons are paid for installing the rootkit on a system.a: The attack was ineffective because not all command and control (C&C) servers were seized, and the peer-to-peer command and control component was unaffected, meaning the botnet could still be updated at will.a: The two main operations of the ZeroAccess botnet are bitcoin mining and click fraud.a: The ZeroAccess botnet generated an estimated 2.7 million US dollars per year in September 2012 through bitcoin mining.a: The estimated profit for click fraud activity is as high as 100,000 US dollars per day, costing advertisers $900,000 a day in fraudulent clicks.a: Typically, ZeroAccess infects the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the infected machine, giving it total control over the operating system.a: The ZeroAccess botnet disables the Windows Security Center, Firewall, and Windows Defender from the operating system, making it harder for the user to detect and remove the malware.a: The ZeroAccess botnet hooks itself into the TCP/IP stack to help with the click fraud operation.a: The ZeroAccess botnet looks for the Tidserv malware and removes it if it finds it.a: The ZeroAccess botnet uses a peer-to-peer command and control component that was unaffected by the December 2013 attack, meaning the botnet could still be updated at will.a: The estimated size of the ZeroAccess botnet in the third quarter of 2012 was around 1 million active and infected machines."

    "instruction": "Audio injection\n\n==Introduction==\nAudio injection is the exploitation of digital assistants such as Amazon Echo, Google Home or Apple SIRI by unwanted instructions from a third party. These services lack authentication when reacting to user commands, making it possible for attackers to issue activation words and commands and trigger the execution of desired actions. Injection results include fraud, burglary, data espionage and takeover of connected systems.\n\n\n\n== Approach ==\nMost digital assistants require an activation word to trigger the complete recording and audio analysis of spoken commands (e.g. \"OK Google\"). These commands, spoken in natural language, will be processed and executed. The activation word itself is different for each manufacturer, most often connected to product\u2019s name. It is not possible for the product's owner to customize this activation word, meaning that all models react to the same word.\nProcessed language is not analyzed in regards to voice and recognition or authorization of individual users. As a result, all users which are in the audible range of a device have the same authorizations to trigger and execute actions. Depending on functionality, these actions can range from simple actions like music playback or controlling lights, to security critical or sensitive actions such as opening gates, executing or ordering chargeable transactions or reading out private information.\nAudio injection attacks can be performed remotely. If the access into the audible area of a digital assistant is restricted, it can be attacked by increasing the distance of transmission. Either this can be reached by overcoming existent acoustic barriers (e.g. via vending opening or a momentary opened window) or via unusual loud playback via amplifiers and loudspeakers. With such an approach it is possible to control digital assistants from other rooms, floors or outside of a building.\nDigital assistants do not distinguish whether voice commands are directly spoken or reproduced by a loudspeaker system.

      "context": "Audio injection\n\n==Introduction==\nAudio injection is the exploitation of digital assistants such as Amazon Echo, Google Home or Apple SIRI by unwanted instructions from a third party. These services lack authentication when reacting to user commands, making it possible for attackers to issue activation words and commands and trigger the execution of desired actions. Injection results include fraud, burglary, data espionage and takeover of connected systems.\n\n\n\n== Approach ==\nMost digital assistants require an activation word to trigger the complete recording and audio analysis of spoken commands (e.g. \"OK Google\"). These commands, spoken in natural language, will be processed and executed. The activation word itself is different for each manufacturer, most often connected to product\u2019s name. It is not possible for the product's owner to customize this activation word, meaning that all models react to the same word.\nProcessed language is not analyzed in regards to voice and recognition or authorization of individual users. As a result, all users which are in the audible range of a device have the same authorizations to trigger and execute actions. Depending on functionality, these actions can range from simple actions like music playback or controlling lights, to security critical or sensitive actions such as opening gates, executing or ordering chargeable transactions or reading out private information.\nAudio injection attacks can be performed remotely. If the access into the audible area of a digital assistant is restricted, it can be attacked by increasing the distance of transmission. Either this can be reached by overcoming existent acoustic barriers (e.g. via vending opening or a momentary opened window) or via unusual loud playback via amplifiers and loudspeakers. With such an approach it is possible to control digital assistants from other rooms, floors or outside of a building.\nDigital assistants do not distinguish whether voice commands are directly spoken or reproduced by a loudspeaker system. This means that attacks can be performed via devices which support audio playback via loudspeaker. Radio and television can be used to run mass-attacks, and telephones, hands-free systems, other digital assistants or systems for text-to-speech-processing can be misused.\nSystems which can be accessed randomly, anonymously and in absence of the owner, as well as being activated remotely, are critical.

    "instruction": "Here are some questions about this text: OS-level virtualization\n\n==Introduction==\nOS-level virtualization is an operating system (OS) paradigm in which the kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user space instances, called containers (LXC, Solaris containers, Docker, Podman), zones (Solaris containers), virtual private servers (OpenVZ), partitions, virtual environments (VEs), virtual kernels (DragonFly BSD), or jails (FreeBSD jail or chroot jail). Such instances may look like real computers from the point of view of programs running in them. A computer program running on an ordinary operating system can see all resources (connected devices, files and folders, network shares, CPU power, quantifiable hardware capabilities) of that computer. However, programs running inside of a container can only see the container's contents and devices assigned to the container.\nOn Unix-like operating systems, this feature can be seen as an advanced implementation of the standard chroot mechanism, which changes the apparent root folder for the current running process and its children. In addition to isolation mechanisms, the kernel often provides resource-management features to limit the impact of one container's activities on other containers. Linux containers are all based on the virtualization, isolation, and resource management mechanisms provided by the Linux kernel, notably Linux namespaces and cgroups.The term container, while most popularly referring to OS-level virtualization systems, is sometimes ambiguously used to refer to fuller virtual machine environments operating in varying degrees of concert with the host OS, e.g. Microsoft's Hyper-V containers. A more historic overview of virtualization in general since 1960 can be found in the Timeline of virtualization development.\n\n== Operation ==\nOn ordinary operating systems for personal computers, a computer program can see (even though it might not be able to access) all the system's resources. They include:\n\nHardware capabilities that can be employed, such as the CPU and the network connection\nData that can be read or written, such as files, folders and network shares\nConnected peripherals it can interact with, such as webcam, printer, scanner, or faxThe operating system may be able to allow or deny access to such resources based on which program requests them and the user account in the context of which it runs. The operating system may also hide those resources, so that when the computer program enumerates them, they do not appear in the enumeration results. Nevertheless, from a programming point of view, the computer program has interacted with those resources and the operating system has managed an act of interaction.\nWith operating-system-virtualization, or containerization, it is possible to run programs within containers, to which only parts of these resources are allocated. A program expecting to see the whole computer, once run inside a container, can only see the allocated resources and believes them to be all that is available. Several containers can be created on each operating system, to each of which a subset of the computer's resources is allocated. Each container may contain any number of computer programs. These programs may run concurrently or separately, and may even interact with one another.\nContainerization has similarities to application virtualization: In the latter, only one computer program is placed in an isolated container and the isolation applies to file system only.\n\n== Uses ==\nOperating-system-level virtualization is commonly used in virtual hosting environments, where it is useful for securely allocating finite hardware resources among a large number of mutually-distrusting users.  System administrators may also use it for consolidating server hardware by moving services on separate hosts into containers on the one server.\nOther typical scenarios include separating several programs to separate containers for improved security, hardware independence, and added resource management features. The improved security provided by the use of a chroot mechanism, however, is not perfect. Operating-system-level virtualization implementations capable of live migration can also be used for dynamic load balancing of containers between nodes in a cluster.\n\n\n*** Overhead ***\nOperating-system-level virtualization usually imposes less overhead than full virtualization because programs in OS-level virtual partitions use the operating system's normal system call interface and do not need to be subjected to emulation or be run in an intermediate virtual machine, as is the case with full virtualization (such as VMware ESXi, QEMU, or Hyper-V) and paravirtualization (such as Xen or User-mode Linux).  This form of virtualization also does not require hardware support for efficient performance.\n\n\n*** Flexibility ***\nOperating-system-level virtualization is not as flexible as other virtualization approaches since it cannot host a guest operating system different from the host one, or a different guest kernel.  For example, with Linux, different distributions are fine, but other operating systems such as Windows cannot be hosted. Operating systems using variable input systematics are subject to limitations within the virtualized architecture. Adaptation methods including cloud-server relay analytics maintain the OS-level virtual environment within these applications.Solaris partially overcomes the limitation described above with its branded zones feature, which provides the ability to run an environment within a container that emulates an older Solaris 8 or 9 version in a Solaris 10 host. Linux branded zones (referred to as \"lx\" branded zones) are also available on x86-based Solaris systems, providing a complete Linux user space and support for the execution of Linux applications; additionally, Solaris provides utilities needed to install Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.x or CentOS 3.x Linux distributions inside \"lx\" zones.  However, in 2010 Linux branded zones were removed from Solaris; in 2014 they were reintroduced in Illumos, which is the open source Solaris fork, supporting 32-bit Linux kernels.\n\n\n*** Storage ***\nSome implementations provide file-level copy-on-write (CoW) mechanisms.  (Most commonly, a standard file system is shared between partitions, and those partitions that change the files automatically create their own copies.)  This is easier to back up, more space-efficient and simpler to cache than the block-level copy-on-write schemes common on whole-system virtualizers.  Whole-system virtualizers, however, can work with non-native file systems and create and roll back snapshots of the entire system state.\n\n== Implementations ==\nLinux containers not listed above include:\n\nLXD, an alternative wrapper around LXC developed by Canonical\nPodman, a drop-in replacement for Docker\nCharliecloud, a set of container tools used on HPC systems\nKata Containers MicroVM Platform\nBottlerocket is a Linux-based open-source operating system that is purpose-built by Amazon Web Services for running containers on virtual machines or bare metal hosts\nCBL-Mariner is an open-source Linux distribution that is purpose-built by Microsoft Azure and similar to Fedora CoreOS\nWhat are the answers to these questions: What is OS-level virtualization and how does it differ from traditional virtualization methods?q: How does operating-system-level virtualization help in allocating hardware resources?q: What is the purpose of Linux containers like LXD, Podman, Charliecloud, and Kata Containers MicroVM Platform?q: How does Solaris' branded zones feature overcome the limitations of OS-level virtualization?q: How does containerization enhance security compared to traditional operating systems?q: How does operating-system-level virtualization impact resource management?q: What are some common file-level copy-on-write mechanisms used in operating-system-level virtualization?q: How do whole-system virtualizers differ from operating-system-level virtualizers in terms of storage?q: How can containerization be used for improved security and hardware independence?q: What are the performance implications of using operating-system-level virtualization compared to full virtualization?q: How do operating-system-level virtualization solutions like LXC and Docker differ from each other?q: How does the chroot mechanism contribute to the security of containerization?q: What are some use cases for operating-system-level virtualization?q: How do Linux branded zones in Illumos support 32-bit Linux kernels?q: How do operating-system-level virtualization solutions like LXD, Podman, and Charliecloud enhance container management?q: How does the Linux kernel provide resource-management features in OS-level virtualization?",

This helps overcome the limitations of OS-level virtualization by enabling the use of a different guest kernel.a: Operating-system-level virtualization solutions like LXD, Podman, and Charliecloud provide enhanced container management capabilities compared to traditional virtualization methods. These solutions offer features such as improved resource allocation, simplified container deployment, and more efficient use of resources.a: The Linux kernel provides resource-management features in OS-level virtualization through mechanisms such as Linux namespaces and cgroups. These features enable containerization solutions to limit the impact of one container's activities on other containers, ensuring efficient use of resources and improved performance."

      "answers": "The branch number of a vectorial Boolean function F is a numerical value that characterizes the diffusion introduced by F. It is calculated by applying nonzero input values to F, calculating the Hamming weight of each input value and the output value, and selecting the smallest combined weight across all nonzero input values.A: A higher branch number suggests a higher resistance to differential cryptanalysis. This is because small variations in the input produce large changes in the output, requiring large changes in the input value to produce small variations in the output.A: The concept of branch number was introduced by Daemen and Rijmen in the early 2000s.A: The maximum possible value of the branch number for a vectorial Boolean function with s components is s+1. This occurs when any single nonzero component in the input causes all components of the output to be non-zero.A: The differential branch number of a vectorial Boolean function F is calculated by obtaining the minimum combined weight across all nonzero input values constructed by independently sweeping all the values of two nonzero and unequal vectors.A: The branch number is calculated using a single input value, while the differential branch number is calculated using two nonzero and unequal input values.A: A higher differential branch number suggests a higher resistance to differential cryptanalysis. This is because the small variations of input will produce large changes on the output and in order to obtain small variations of the output, large changes of the input value will be required.A: The Hamming weight is used to calculate the number of nonzero components in an input value and the output value of a vectorial Boolean function. The smallest combined weight across all nonzero input values is selected to calculate the branch number.A: No, the branch number of a vectorial Boolean function is always limited by the number of components in the output plus one.A: The branch number concept is not limited to linear transformations, but it is commonly used to assess the diffusion properties of linear transformations.A: The inputs of a vectorial Boolean function are selected by independently sweeping all the values of two nonzero and unequal vectors.A: The branch number is a numerical value that characterizes the diffusion introduced by a vectorial Boolean function, while the avalanche effect refers to the property of a cryptographic algorithm where a small change in the input produces a significant change in the output.A: Yes, the branch number of a vectorial Boolean function can be equal to the number of components in the output, but it cannot be equal to the number of components in the output minus one.A: The differential branch number is not directly related to the resistance of a vectorial Boolean function to linear cryptanalysis, but a high differential branch number can suggest a higher resistance to differential cryptanalysis, which in turn can suggest a higher resistance to linear cryptanalysis.A: A high differential branch number suggests a higher resistance to differential cryptanalysis, which suggests that small variations of input will produce large changes on the output and in order to obtain small variations of the output, large changes of the input value will be required. This is an indicator of good diffusion properties."

    "instruction": "Context: Enigmail\n\n==Introduction==\nEnigmail is a data encryption and decryption extension for Mozilla Thunderbird and the Postbox that provides OpenPGP public key e-mail encryption and signing. Enigmail works under Microsoft Windows, Unix-like, and Mac OS X operating systems. Enigmail can operate with other mail clients compatible with PGP/MIME and inline PGP such as: Microsoft Outlook with Gpg4win package installed, Gnome Evolution, KMail, Claws Mail, Gnus, Mutt. Its cryptographic functionality is handled by GNU Privacy Guard.\nIn their default configuration, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey provide e-mail encryption and signing using S/MIME, which relies on X.509 keys provided by a centralised certificate authority. Enigmail adds an alternative mechanism where cooperating users can instead use keys provided by a web of trust, which relies on multiple users to endorse the authenticity of the sender's and recipient's credentials. In principle this enhances security, since it does not rely on a centralised entity which might be compromised by security failures or engage in malpractice due to commercial interests or pressure from the jurisdiction in which it resides.\nEnigmail was first released in 2001 by Ramalingam Saravanan, and since 2003 maintained by Patrick Brunschwig.

      "context": "Enigmail\n\n==Introduction==\nEnigmail is a data encryption and decryption extension for Mozilla Thunderbird and the Postbox that provides OpenPGP public key e-mail encryption and signing. Enigmail works under Microsoft Windows, Unix-like, and Mac OS X operating systems. Enigmail can operate with other mail clients compatible with PGP/MIME and inline PGP such as: Microsoft Outlook with Gpg4win package installed, Gnome Evolution, KMail, Claws Mail, Gnus, Mutt. Its cryptographic functionality is handled by GNU Privacy Guard.\nIn their default configuration, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey provide e-mail encryption and signing using S/MIME, which relies on X.509 keys provided by a centralised certificate authority. Enigmail adds an alternative mechanism where cooperating users can instead use keys provided by a web of trust, which relies on multiple users to endorse the authenticity of the sender's and recipient's credentials. In principle this enhances security, since it does not rely on a centralised entity which might be compromised by security failures or engage in malpractice due to commercial interests or pressure from the jurisdiction in which it resides.\nEnigmail was first released in 2001 by Ramalingam Saravanan, and since 2003 maintained by Patrick Brunschwig.

    "instruction": "Read this and answer the below questions\n\nData care\n\n==Introduction==\nData care refers to treating people and their private information fairly and with dignity. Data has progressively become more and more utilized in our society all over the world. When it comes to securely storing a medical patient's data, an employee's data, or a citizen's private data. The concept of data care emerged from the increase of data usage over the years, it is a term used to describe the act of treating people and their data with care and respect. This concept elaborates on how caring for people's data is the responsibility of those who govern data, for example, businesses and policy makers. Along with how to care for it in an ethical manner, while keeping in mind the people that the data belongs to. And discussing the concept of 'slow computing' on how this can be properly utilized to help in creating and maintaining proper data care.\n\n\n\n== Defining data care ==\nTo define data care means treating people and their private information fairly and with dignity in terms of their data. Data care is a term used by the cybersecurity industry, to teach people to be more careful with their data on social media and their mobile devices. Such information could be their banking information, address, and other personal information. In 2019, a United States bill required social media platforms to be more responsible with their users' private data, which will help in ensuring proper data care. This is one example in how implementing proper data care policy will help put pressure on these companies to achieve data justice. Data care aims to allow data navigation while countering data power, and encourages \"slow computing\" (see below), all of which will help in reducing datafication, and making it more difficult for people's data to become traceable. This will also encourage open source alternatives for data to become more difficult to trace. This is something the cybersecurity industry has been working toward for some time, as a means to help protect people's privacy. Proper data care will help those with weaker data literacy, it will help manage data in political campaigns, and help place pressure on companies to be more ethical in their data use. This can help in producing open source apps, and creating technology that prioritizes the public's private information. Proper data care will help achieve data justice, and lead to data sovereignty.\n\n== Ethics of care ==\nPrioritizing proper care and respect towards people's data is of utmost importance, requiring good morals and proper ethical choices to protect people's privacy. Data care involves protecting people's data in medical practices, law, politics, the organization of society, war, and international relations. Hospitals keep their patient's data secure, data such as; routine healthcare data and patient contact. Data is now being kept electronically, replacing paper files. Data obtained from hospitals will often be subject to research, the results cannot be traced to individual participants, and the patients are informed beforehand in case they want to opt out of having their data used in research. Data care is seen as a form of ethics, considering moralities of justice and rights.\n\n== Understanding data ==\nThe global rise in digital data has led to billions of consumers worldwide, this could allow corporations to utilize this data in an unethical way. Data can be used by authority figures to access, use, or manage people's data, data could also be used to discriminate against low income individuals. Digital data is also being used to track and monitor people. With the rise of smart cities, the increase in digital and biometric registration are becoming the norm around the world. The concept of \"data justice\" brings awareness to this phenomenon, and encourages data to be used morally and ethically by establishing rules of law. Methods that can be used to enhance data care are to utilize tools such as ad blockers, cookie blockers, proper malware detection and interception, site blocking, encryption tools, and services to opt out of databases controlled by data brokers.\n\n== Slow computing ==\nData care calls for \"slow computing,\" which is an ethical way to morally utilize people's data that intends to protect their privacy in regards to data-driven systems. In other words, slow computing prioritizes protecting people's private information on digital and mobile devices, so they may use these devices without feeling harassed, stressed, or exploited in any way. Then people will be able to enjoy using these devices in conjunction with the slow living movement of enjoyment, patience, sovereignty, authenticity, responsibility, and sustainability. Enforcing the idea of slow computing would involve encouraging corporations to employ market-led regulations on data, and promoting practices such as privacy-by-design. Also encouraging political parties to implement slow computing ideologies into their systems as policy proposals. Governments could also implement their own forms of slow computing for better data care, encouraging fair information principles, privacy-by-design, enacting new legislations that protect people's rights, while also employing other methods of slow computing in their programs and practices. Avoiding data extraction will also help improve data care; industry-led moves, government and policy makers employing new regulations, and data sovereignty agreed upon by communities. A digital society and economy that focuses on a slow computing world would focus on fairness, equity, and justice.\n\nHow does data care relate to the responsibility of businesses and policy makers in handling people's data?q: What is the goal of data care in terms of data navigation and countering data power?q: How does data care help in managing data in political campaigns?q: In what ways does data care promote ethical choices in protecting people's data?q: How can data care be used to protect people's privacy in regards to data-driven systems?q: What role does data care play in the concept of \"data justice\"?q: How can data care be employed by corporations to improve data care?q: How do governments play a role in implementing data care?q: How does data care aim to help those with weaker data literacy?q: How does data care relate to the use of digital and biometric registration in smart cities?q: How does data care aim to make it more difficult for people's data to become traceable?q: How does data care relate to the ethical use of data in research?q: How does data care aim to protect people's privacy in regards to data-driven systems?q: How can data care be used to protect people's privacy in the context of the global rise in digital data?q: How does data care relate to the concept of \"data sovereignty\"?",

    "instruction": "Here are some questions about this text: PhishTank\n\n==Introduction==\nPhishTank is an anti-phishing site.\nPhishTank was launched in October 2006 by entrepreneur David Ulevitch as an offshoot of OpenDNS. The company offers a community-based phish verification system where users submit suspected phishes and other users \"vote\" if it is a phish or not. OpenDNS was acquired by Cisco and in turn the Phishtank system was turned over to Cisco Talos.PhishTank is used by Opera, WOT, Yahoo! Mail, Mcafee, APWG, CMU, ST Benard, Mozilla, Kaspersky, Firetrust, Officer Blue, FINRA, Message Level, SURBL, Sanesecurity for ClamAV, Career Builder, Site Truth, Avira, C-SIRT, and by PhishTank SiteChecker.PhishTank data is provided free for download or for access via an API call, including for commercial use, under a restrictive license.  \nIn 2018, it was announced that PhishTank will be rebuilding the website, with new features and functionality. In 2020, because of flagrant abuse of the Phishtank system, \"new user\" registration was removed, and will remain off for the foreseeable future.  Phishtank is currently being rethought from the ground up to provide better support, remove abuse, and operate faster with a machine learning backend phish identification system.  This redesign is being run by the Cisco Talos Communities team under Joel Esler. There is currently no completion date for this project.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the answers to these questions: How does PhishTank's community-based phish verification system function and what organizations use its data?q: What changes has PhishTank undergone in recent years, and what is the current status of its redesign project?q: What is PhishTank's licensing and commercial use policy, and how does Cisco's acquisition of OpenDNS impact PhishTank?",

    "output": "PhishTank operates a community-based phish verification system where users submit suspected phishing websites, and other users vote on whether the submitted link is indeed a phish or not. This crowdsourced approach allows for a more democratic and rapid identification of phishing threats. Organizations such as Opera, WOT, Yahoo! Mail, Mcafee, APWG, CMU, ST Benard, Mozilla, Kaspersky, Firetrust, Officer Blue, FINRA, Message Level, SURBL, Sanesecurity for ClamAV, Career Builder, Site Truth, Avira, C-SIRT, and PhishTank SiteChecker utilize PhishTank's data for various purposes, including enhancing their security solutions and improving user protection.a: PhishTank has experienced several changes in recent years. In 2018, it announced a rebuild of its website, which aimed to introduce new features and functionality. However, in 2020, due to increasing abuse of the PhishTank system, the organization decided to remove \"new user\" registration indefinitely. Currently, PhishTank is undergoing a comprehensive redesign led by the Cisco Talos Communities team under Joel Esler. This redesign focuses on improving support, eliminating abuse, and increasing the system's speed through the implementation of a machine learning backend phish identification system. A completion date for the project has not yet been announced.a: PhishTank provides its data for free, allowing both non-commercial and commercial use under a restrictive license. This enables various organizations and security solutions to incorporate PhishTank's data into their systems, further enhancing the collective fight against phishing attacks.

      "context": "PhishTank\n\n==Introduction==\nPhishTank is an anti-phishing site.\nPhishTank was launched in October 2006 by entrepreneur David Ulevitch as an offshoot of OpenDNS. The company offers a community-based phish verification system where users submit suspected phishes and other users \"vote\" if it is a phish or not. OpenDNS was acquired by Cisco and in turn the Phishtank system was turned over to Cisco Talos.PhishTank is used by Opera, WOT, Yahoo! Mail, Mcafee, APWG, CMU, ST Benard, Mozilla, Kaspersky, Firetrust, Officer Blue, FINRA, Message Level, SURBL, Sanesecurity for ClamAV, Career Builder, Site Truth, Avira, C-SIRT, and by PhishTank SiteChecker.PhishTank data is provided free for download or for access via an API call, including for commercial use, under a restrictive license.  \nIn 2018, it was announced that PhishTank will be rebuilding the website, with new features and functionality. In 2020, because of flagrant abuse of the Phishtank system, \"new user\" registration was removed, and will remain off for the foreseeable future.  Phishtank is currently being rethought from the ground up to provide better support, remove abuse, and operate faster with a machine learning backend phish identification system.  This redesign is being run by the Cisco Talos Communities team under Joel Esler. There is currently no completion date for this project.\n\n\n\n",

      "answers": "PhishTank operates a community-based phish verification system where users submit suspected phishing websites, and other users vote on whether the submitted link is indeed a phish or not. This crowdsourced approach allows for a more democratic and rapid identification of phishing threats. Organizations such as Opera, WOT, Yahoo! Mail, Mcafee, APWG, CMU, ST Benard, Mozilla, Kaspersky, Firetrust, Officer Blue, FINRA, Message Level, SURBL, Sanesecurity for ClamAV, Career Builder, Site Truth, Avira, C-SIRT, and PhishTank SiteChecker utilize PhishTank's data for various purposes, including enhancing their security solutions and improving user protection.a: PhishTank has experienced several changes in recent years. In 2018, it announced a rebuild of its website, which aimed to introduce new features and functionality. However, in 2020, due to increasing abuse of the PhishTank system, the organization decided to remove \"new user\" registration indefinitely. Currently, PhishTank is undergoing a comprehensive redesign led by the Cisco Talos Communities team under Joel Esler. This redesign focuses on improving support, eliminating abuse, and increasing the system's speed through the implementation of a machine learning backend phish identification system. A completion date for the project has not yet been announced.a: PhishTank provides its data for free, allowing both non-commercial and commercial use under a restrictive license. This enables various organizations and security solutions to incorporate PhishTank's data into their systems, further enhancing the collective fight against phishing attacks. Cisco's acquisition of OpenDNS in 2015 led to PhishTank being transferred to Cisco Talos, which has since overseen its operations and continued to develop and improve its community-based phish verification system."

In formal terms, there is no probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) algorithm that computes b(x) from f(x) with probability significantly greater than one half over random choice of x.:\u200a34\u200a In other words, if x is drawn uniformly at random, then given f(x), any PPT adversary can only distinguish the hard-core bit b(x) and a uniformly random bit with negligible advantage over the length of x.A hard-core function can be defined similarly. That is, if x is chosen uniformly at random, then given f(x), any PPT algorithm can only distinguish the hard-core function value h(x) and uniformly random bits of length |h(x)| with negligible advantage over the length of x.A hard-core predicate captures \"in a concentrated sense\" the hardness of inverting f.\nWhile a one-way function is hard to invert, there are no guarantees about the feasibility of computing partial information about the preimage c from the image f(x).

Using multiple solutions from the same category would not constitute multi-factor authentication.Answer: A common class of definitions for strong authentication relates to a cryptographic process, or more precisely, authentication based on a challenge-response protocol.Answer: No, the secret key used in a challenge-response authentication scheme can be simply derived from a password, but it doesn't have to be.Answer: Yes, for example, the definition found in the Fermilab documentation is one such example, where strong authentication is defined as any form of authentication in which the verification is accomplished without the transmission of a password.Answer: The European Economic Area has given legal standing to the term Strong Customer Authentication, but the document does not provide a definition for it.Answer: The Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance is an organization that has been striving to establish technical specifications for strong authentication. They currently have over 250 members and over 150 certified products.Answer: No, the term strong authentication can only be used as long as the notion of strong is defined in the context of use.Answer: Strong authentication is not necessarily multi-factor authentication, two-factor authentication is a type of strong authentication that requires the use of solutions from two or more of the three categories of factors.Answer: No, using multiple solutions from the same category would not constitute multi-factor authentication according to the FFIEC.Answer: Yes, a secret key used in a challenge-response authentication scheme can be derived from something other than a password.Answer: No, the definition of strong authentication provided in the Handbook of Applied Cryptography is not a legal definition within the European Economic Area.Answer: The Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) Alliance currently has over 250 members.Answer: No, the verification for strong authentication cannot be accomplished with the transmission of a password according to the definition found in the Fermilab documentation.Answer: The FFIEC (Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council) is a body that sets guidelines for financial institutions. In August 2006, they issued supplemental guidance on strong authentication, in which they clarified that true multi-factor authentication requires the use of solutions from two or more of the three categories of factors."

    "instruction": "NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization\n\n==Introduction==\nPost-Quantum Cryptography Standardization is a program and competition by NIST to update their standards to include post-quantum cryptography. It was announced at PQCrypto 2016. 23 signature schemes and 59 encryption/KEM schemes were submitted by the initial submission deadline at the end of 2017 of which 69 total were deemed complete and proper and participated in the first round. Seven of these, of which 3 are signature schemes, have advanced to the third round, which was announced on July 22, 2020.\n\n== Background ==\nAcademic research on the potential impact of quantum computing dates back to at least 2001. A NIST published report from April 2016 cites experts that acknowledge the possibility of quantum technology to render the commonly used RSA algorithm insecure by 2030. As a result, a need to standardize quantum-secure cryptographic primitives was pursued. Since most symmetric primitives are relatively easy to modify in a way that makes them quantum resistant, efforts have focused on public-key cryptography, namely digital signatures and key encapsulation mechanisms. In December 2016 NIST initiated a standardization process by announcing a call for proposals.The competition is now in its third round out of expected four, where in each round some algorithms are discarded and others are studied more closely. NIST hopes to publish the standardization documents by 2024, but may speed up the process if major breakthroughs in quantum computing are made.\nIt is currently undecided whether the future standards be published as FIPS or as NIST Special Publication (SP).\n\n== Round one ==\nUnder consideration were:(strikethrough means it had been withdrawn)\n\n\n*** Round one submissions published attacks ***\nGuess Again by Lorenz Panny \nRVB by Lorenz Panny\nRaCoSS by Daniel J.

They are:\n\n== Round three ==\nOn July 22, 2020, NIST announced seven finalists (\"first track\"), as well as eight alternate algorithms (\"second track\").

      "context": "NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization\n\n==Introduction==\nPost-Quantum Cryptography Standardization is a program and competition by NIST to update their standards to include post-quantum cryptography. It was announced at PQCrypto 2016. 23 signature schemes and 59 encryption/KEM schemes were submitted by the initial submission deadline at the end of 2017 of which 69 total were deemed complete and proper and participated in the first round. Seven of these, of which 3 are signature schemes, have advanced to the third round, which was announced on July 22, 2020.\n\n== Background ==\nAcademic research on the potential impact of quantum computing dates back to at least 2001. A NIST published report from April 2016 cites experts that acknowledge the possibility of quantum technology to render the commonly used RSA algorithm insecure by 2030. As a result, a need to standardize quantum-secure cryptographic primitives was pursued. Since most symmetric primitives are relatively easy to modify in a way that makes them quantum resistant, efforts have focused on public-key cryptography, namely digital signatures and key encapsulation mechanisms. In December 2016 NIST initiated a standardization process by announcing a call for proposals.The competition is now in its third round out of expected four, where in each round some algorithms are discarded and others are studied more closely. NIST hopes to publish the standardization documents by 2024, but may speed up the process if major breakthroughs in quantum computing are made.\nIt is currently undecided whether the future standards be published as FIPS or as NIST Special Publication (SP).\n\n== Round one ==\nUnder consideration were:(strikethrough means it had been withdrawn)\n\n\n*** Round one submissions published attacks ***\nGuess Again by Lorenz Panny \nRVB by Lorenz Panny\nRaCoSS by Daniel J.

    "instruction": "Answer questions about:\nInformation security operations center\n\n==Introduction==\nAn information security operations center (ISOC or SOC) is a facility where enterprise information systems (web sites, applications, databases, data centers and servers, networks, desktops and other endpoints) are monitored, assessed, and defended.\n\n\n\n== Objective ==\nA SOC is related to the people, processes and technologies that provide situational awareness through the detection, containment, and remediation of IT threats in order to manage and enhance an organization's security posture.  A SOC will handle, on behalf of an institution or company, any threatening IT incident, and will ensure that it is properly identified, analyzed, communicated, investigated and reported.  The SOC also monitors applications to identify a possible cyber-attack or intrusion (event), and determines if it is a genuine malicious threat (incident), and if it could affect business.\n\n\n*** Regulatory requirements ***\nEstablishing and operating a SOC is expensive and difficult; organisations should need a good reason to do it. This may include:\n\nProtecting sensitive data\nComplying with industry rules such as PCI DSS.\nComplying with government rules, such as CESG GPG53.\n\n== Alternative names ==\nA security operations center (SOC) can also be called a security defense center (SDC), security analytics center (SAC), network security operations center (NSOC), security intelligence center, cyber security center, threat defense center, security intelligence and operations center (SIOC). In the Canadian Federal Government the term, infrastructure protection center (IPC), is used to describe a SOC.\n\n== Technology ==\nSOCs typically are based around a security information and event management (SIEM) system which aggregates and correlates data from security feeds such as network discovery and vulnerability assessment systems; governance, risk and compliance (GRC) systems; web site assessment and monitoring systems, application and database scanners; penetration testing tools; intrusion detection systems (IDS); intrusion prevention system (IPS); log management systems; network behavior analysis and Cyber threat intelligence; wireless intrusion prevention system; firewalls, enterprise antivirus and unified threat management (UTM).  The SIEM technology creates a \"single pane of glass\" for the security analysts to monitor the enterprise.\n\n== People ==\nSOC staff includes analysts, security engineers, and SOC managers who should be seasoned IT and networking professionals. They are usually trained in computer engineering, cryptography, network engineering, or computer science and may have credentials such as CISSP or GIAC.\nSOC staffing plans range from eight hours a day, five days a week (8x5) to twenty four hours a day, seven days a week (24x7). Shifts should include at least two analysts and the responsibilities should be clearly defined.\n\n== Organization ==\nLarge organizations and governments may operate more than one SOC to manage different groups of information and communication technology or to provide redundancy in the event one site is unavailable. SOC work can be outsourced, for instance, by using a managed security service. The term SOC was traditionally used by governments and managed computer security providers, although a growing number of large corporations and other organizations also have such centers.\nThe SOC and the network operations center (NOC) complement each other and work in tandem. The NOC is usually responsible for monitoring and maintaining the overall network infrastructure, and its primary function is to ensure uninterrupted network service. The SOC is responsible for protecting networks, as well as web sites, applications, databases, servers and data centers, and other technologies.  Likewise, the SOC and the physical security operations center coordinate and work together. The physical SOC is a facility in large organizations where security staff monitor and control security officers/guards, alarms, CCTV, physical access, lighting, vehicle barriers, etc.\nNot every SOC has the same role. There are three different focus areas in which a SOC may be active, and which can be combined in any combination:\n\nControl - focusing on the state of the security with compliancy testing, penetration testing, vulnerability testing, etc.\nMonitoring - focusing on events and the response with log monitoring, SIEM administration, and incident response\nOperational - focusing on the operational security administration such as identity & access management, key management, firewall administration, etc.In some cases the SOC, NOC or physical SOC may be housed in the same facility or organizationally combined, especially if the focus is on operational tasks. If the SOC originates from a CERT organisation, then the focus is usually more on monitoring and control, in which case the SOC operates independently from the NOC to maintain separation of duties. Typically, larger organizations maintain a separate SOC to ensure focus and expertise. The SOC then collaborates closely with network operations and physical security operations.\n\n== Facilities ==\nSOCs usually are well protected with physical, electronic, computer, and personnel security. Centers are often laid out with desks facing a video wall, which displays significant status, events and alarms; ongoing incidents; a corner of the wall is sometimes used for showing a news or weather TV channel, as this can keep the SOC staff aware of current events which may affect information systems.

      "context": "Information security operations center\n\n==Introduction==\nAn information security operations center (ISOC or SOC) is a facility where enterprise information systems (web sites, applications, databases, data centers and servers, networks, desktops and other endpoints) are monitored, assessed, and defended.\n\n\n\n== Objective ==\nA SOC is related to the people, processes and technologies that provide situational awareness through the detection, containment, and remediation of IT threats in order to manage and enhance an organization's security posture.  A SOC will handle, on behalf of an institution or company, any threatening IT incident, and will ensure that it is properly identified, analyzed, communicated, investigated and reported.  The SOC also monitors applications to identify a possible cyber-attack or intrusion (event), and determines if it is a genuine malicious threat (incident), and if it could affect business.\n\n\n*** Regulatory requirements ***\nEstablishing and operating a SOC is expensive and difficult; organisations should need a good reason to do it. This may include:\n\nProtecting sensitive data\nComplying with industry rules such as PCI DSS.\nComplying with government rules, such as CESG GPG53.\n\n== Alternative names ==\nA security operations center (SOC) can also be called a security defense center (SDC), security analytics center (SAC), network security operations center (NSOC), security intelligence center, cyber security center, threat defense center, security intelligence and operations center (SIOC). In the Canadian Federal Government the term, infrastructure protection center (IPC), is used to describe a SOC.\n\n== Technology ==\nSOCs typically are based around a security information and event management (SIEM) system which aggregates and correlates data from security feeds such as network discovery and vulnerability assessment systems; governance, risk and compliance (GRC) systems; web site assessment and monitoring systems, application and database scanners; penetration testing tools; intrusion detection systems (IDS); intrusion prevention system (IPS); log management systems; network behavior analysis and Cyber threat intelligence; wireless intrusion prevention system; firewalls, enterprise antivirus and unified threat management (UTM).  The SIEM technology creates a \"single pane of glass\" for the security analysts to monitor the enterprise.\n\n== People ==\nSOC staff includes analysts, security engineers, and SOC managers who should be seasoned IT and networking professionals. They are usually trained in computer engineering, cryptography, network engineering, or computer science and may have credentials such as CISSP or GIAC.\nSOC staffing plans range from eight hours a day, five days a week (8x5) to twenty four hours a day, seven days a week (24x7). Shifts should include at least two analysts and the responsibilities should be clearly defined.\n\n== Organization ==\nLarge organizations and governments may operate more than one SOC to manage different groups of information and communication technology or to provide redundancy in the event one site is unavailable. SOC work can be outsourced, for instance, by using a managed security service. The term SOC was traditionally used by governments and managed computer security providers, although a growing number of large corporations and other organizations also have such centers.\nThe SOC and the network operations center (NOC) complement each other and work in tandem. The NOC is usually responsible for monitoring and maintaining the overall network infrastructure, and its primary function is to ensure uninterrupted network service. The SOC is responsible for protecting networks, as well as web sites, applications, databases, servers and data centers, and other technologies.  Likewise, the SOC and the physical security operations center coordinate and work together. The physical SOC is a facility in large organizations where security staff monitor and control security officers/guards, alarms, CCTV, physical access, lighting, vehicle barriers, etc.\nNot every SOC has the same role. There are three different focus areas in which a SOC may be active, and which can be combined in any combination:\n\nControl - focusing on the state of the security with compliancy testing, penetration testing, vulnerability testing, etc.\nMonitoring - focusing on events and the response with log monitoring, SIEM administration, and incident response\nOperational - focusing on the operational security administration such as identity & access management, key management, firewall administration, etc.In some cases the SOC, NOC or physical SOC may be housed in the same facility or organizationally combined, especially if the focus is on operational tasks. If the SOC originates from a CERT organisation, then the focus is usually more on monitoring and control, in which case the SOC operates independently from the NOC to maintain separation of duties. Typically, larger organizations maintain a separate SOC to ensure focus and expertise. The SOC then collaborates closely with network operations and physical security operations.\n\n== Facilities ==\nSOCs usually are well protected with physical, electronic, computer, and personnel security. Centers are often laid out with desks facing a video wall, which displays significant status, events and alarms; ongoing incidents; a corner of the wall is sometimes used for showing a news or weather TV channel, as this can keep the SOC staff aware of current events which may affect information systems. A security engineer or security analyst may have several computer monitors on their desk.\n\n== Process and procedures ==\nProcesses and procedures within a SOC will clearly spell out roles and responsibilities as well as monitoring procedures. These processes include business, technology, operational and analytical processes. They lay out what steps are to be taken in the event of an alert or breach including escalation procedures, reporting procedures, and breach response procedures.\n\n== CloudSOC ==\nA cloud security operations center (CloudSOC) may be set up to monitor cloud service use within an enterprise (and keep the Shadow IT problem under control), or parse and audit IT infrastructure and application logs via  SIEM technologies and machine data platforms to provide alerts and details of suspicious activity.\n\n== Smart SOC ==\nA Smart SOC (Security Operations Center) is a comprehensive, technology agnostic cybersecurity solution that utilizes leading-edge technology and tools, highly skilled and experienced human talent (composed of cyber intelligence gatherers, analysts, and security experts), and proactive cyberwarfare principles to prevent and neutralize threats against an organization\u2019s digital infrastructure, assets, and data.\n\n== Other types and references ==\nIn addition, there are many other commonly referenced terms related to the original \"ISOC\" title including the following:\n\nSNOC, Security Network Operations Center\nASOC, Advanced Security Operations Center\nGSOC, Global Security Operations Center\nvSOC, Virtual Security Operations Center",

    "instruction": "Read this and answer the below questions\n\nKaspersky Internet Security\n\n==Introduction==\nKaspersky Internet Security (often abbreviated to KIS) is an internet security suite developed by Kaspersky Lab compatible with Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. Kaspersky Internet Security offers protection from malware, as well as email spam, phishing and hacking attempts, and data leaks. Kaspersky Lab Diagnostics results are distributed to relevant developers through the MIT License.\n\n\n\n== Windows edition ==\n\n\n*** Version 2007 (6.0) ***\nVersion 6.0 was the first release of KIS. PC World magazine praised version 6.0's detection of malware. KIS detected 100 percent of threats on a subset of the January 2006 wild-list, a list of prevalent threats. The suite detected almost 100 (99.57%) percent of adware samples. KIS has the ability to scan within compressed or packed files, detecting 83.3 percent of the \"hidden\" malware. However, version 6.0 was criticized for not completely removing malware by leaving Registry entries and files. PC World also highlighted the suite's false positives \u2014 eight of 20,000 clean files were incorrectly flagged as malicious \u2014 and its noticeable impact on computer performance. However, data is cached from each scan, making each subsequent scan faster. The firewall blocked all attacks from inside and outside the computer when tested.The magazine found the graphical user interface to be awkward to navigate. Features such as parental controls and instant messaging protection, found in competing suites from Symantec and McAfee, were not a part of version 6.0. Both CNET and PC World criticized the suite's relatively high retail price, US$79.95.\nKIS 6.0 supports Windows 98 SE, ME, NT Workstation 4.0, 2000 Professional, XP Home Edition, XP Professional, XP Professional x64, and Vista. 50 megabytes of free space, Internet Explorer 5.5, and Windows Installer 2.0 are required. RAM and CPU requirements are dependent on the operating system.\n\n\n*** Version 2008 (7.0) ***\nVersion 7.0 introduced a redesigned GUI. Components were renamed and reorganized; the Anti-hacker module was renamed to the Firewall, and the Anti-Spy module was integrated with the Privacy Control module. PC World described the new interface as \"intuitive\" and \"great-looking\".Parental controls were introduced, with specific settings for different age categories, such as \"child\" or \"parent\". Within age categories are content categories, such as drugs or violence. Users can manually configure profiles. Filtering profiles can be associated with users. Since content is filtered at the network level, the feature will work with any Internet browser. The filter relies on a database of known URLs and can analyse websites in real-time. Attempts to access forbidden URLs are logged, and sites visited are tracked as well, raising privacy issues. Limits on Internet access may be set based on time, and chat rooms along with webmail sites can be manually blocked.Spam filtering integrates with Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Windows Mail, and The Bat!. E-mail content is analysed and scored, and e-mail with scores above two specified thresholds are either marked as \"!!spam\" or \"??probably spam\". The Mail Dispatcher feature shows subject and sender information for messages, and allows users to avoid downloading blatant spam by selecting which messages to download. The filter self-trains by analyzing incoming and outgoing e-mail not marked as spam, or by analyzing folders only containing spam or valid e-mail. Senders of verified valid e-mail are whitelisted. E-mail can also be whitelisted or blacklisted based on phrases present in the text. E-mail with non-ASCII characters or invisible text can also be blocked. However, version 7.0 had a relatively poor showing, misidentifying 30 percent of valid messages in PC Magazine testing. 30 percent of spam also made to the inbox.Protection against data leaks was incorporated in this release. The suite warns users when programs attempt to access or send data from certain areas, such as where Internet Explorer stores webform information.Malware protection was mostly positive in detection and disinfection tests by AV-Test.org. Version 7.0 detected 100 percent of wildlist threats. Using one-month-old signatures and a set of new malware, however, detection fell to 14 percent. Files were scanned at 5.24 megabytes per second. Version 7.0 successfully identified all six actively running rootkits, four of six inactive rootkits, and was only able to remove two of six rootkits. The firewall correctly blocked all attempted outside connections, with a reasonable level of security when left on default settings.This version drops support for the Windows 98, 2000, and NT. Windows XP Service Pack 2 is required, except in the case of XP Professional x64 edition. Vista is supported as well. RAM and CPU requirements are dependent on the operating system. 75 megabytes of free space, Internet Explorer 5.5, and Windows Installer 2.0.\n\n\n*** Version 2009 (8.0) ***\nThis version introduces a revised user interface, an application filtering module, an updated anti-virus engine, and a vulnerability scanner. The main window separates settings in four categories, compared to eight in its predecessor. A status bar changes colour (green, yellow, and red) to reflect overall program status and flashes to divert attention when needed. PC Magazine also noted pop-up notifications were kept to a minimum.Kaspersky claims the core anti-virus engine was revised to increase scan speed. PC Magazine found an initial scan took over two hours, however subsequent scans took two minutes to complete. However, malware detection was relatively low in comparison to other anti-virus applications tested. Out of 650 thousand samples, version 8.0 detected 95.6 percent. The top score was around 99 percent. Using two-week-old signatures, version 8.0 detected 52 percent of viruses in a different set of samples. Kaspersky also blocked about 60 percent of malware based solely on behaviour. The top performers scored 55.3 percent and 80 percent respectively. Version 2009 detected 98.1 percent of adware. However, PC World noted to achieve that kind of performance, users will have to modify program settings. On default settings, KIS allowed Zango to install. To block the installation, users must enable KIS to scan for \"other malware\".The Security Analyzer looks for operating system and program patches. It also looks for vulnerable system settings, presenting users with a list of recommended actions to prevent malware from gaining access to a system. However, PC World criticized the amount of computer jargon used and lack of information about how adjust settings appropriately. On the other hand, PC Magazine found the feature straightforward, and often the solution involved downloading and installing an update.KIS uses a whitelist by Carbon Black to classify trusted and malicious programs. Malicious programs are not allowed to run at all. Unknown programs falling in between the two categories are restricted in the actions they can perform. Its firewall blocked all attacks in PC Magazine testing. Phishing protection was introduced in this release. Testing by PC Magazine found the feature blocked 44 percent of phishing URLs. Internet Explorer 7 blocked 67 percent of the URLs, and Mozilla Firefox blocked 81 percent.Spam filtering now integrates with Mozilla Thunderbird and scans NNTP traffic. Spam can be automatically diverted to its own folder. When using an unsupported e-mail client to download POP3, IMAP or NNTP mail, Kaspersky will still generate a report of all messages. However, in an unsupported client, there will be no toolbar nor will the program classify any messages as spam in the client itself.\n\n\n*** Version 2010 (9.0) ***\nVersion 2010 of Kaspersky Internet Security introduced an overhauled user interface and a sandbox for running applications in a virtualized environment. The 9.0.0.736 build of KIS 2010 fully supported the Windows 7 operating system.\n\n\n*** Version 2011 (11.0) ***\nThe beta version was released for all windows users on 8 June 2010.  This version included a new interface, as well as a gadget only available for Windows Vista and Windows 7 users.  PC Mag rated this version \"very good\" (4/5 stars).  Its firewall was noted to be very good, but that made up for its only adequate malware detection rates. Two critical fixes have been released by Kaspersky Lab, making the current version 11.0.2.556.\n\n\n*** Version 2012 (12.0) ***\nOn 1 March 2011, Kaspersky released the first build of version 2012, it came out as beta version and in English, French and Russian version, with more versions due out later. On 7 June 2011 Kaspersky Lab announced the commercial release of Kaspersky Internet Security 2012 in France, Germany, Switzerland. The current version is 12.0.0.374.\n\n\n*** Version 2013 (13.0) ***\nThe beta version was released for all windows users on 3 March 2012.  This version includes an interface which looks (currently, at least) much like Internet Security 2012.

      "context": "Kaspersky Internet Security\n\n==Introduction==\nKaspersky Internet Security (often abbreviated to KIS) is an internet security suite developed by Kaspersky Lab compatible with Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. Kaspersky Internet Security offers protection from malware, as well as email spam, phishing and hacking attempts, and data leaks. Kaspersky Lab Diagnostics results are distributed to relevant developers through the MIT License.\n\n\n\n== Windows edition ==\n\n\n*** Version 2007 (6.0) ***\nVersion 6.0 was the first release of KIS. PC World magazine praised version 6.0's detection of malware. KIS detected 100 percent of threats on a subset of the January 2006 wild-list, a list of prevalent threats. The suite detected almost 100 (99.57%) percent of adware samples. KIS has the ability to scan within compressed or packed files, detecting 83.3 percent of the \"hidden\" malware. However, version 6.0 was criticized for not completely removing malware by leaving Registry entries and files. PC World also highlighted the suite's false positives \u2014 eight of 20,000 clean files were incorrectly flagged as malicious \u2014 and its noticeable impact on computer performance. However, data is cached from each scan, making each subsequent scan faster. The firewall blocked all attacks from inside and outside the computer when tested.The magazine found the graphical user interface to be awkward to navigate. Features such as parental controls and instant messaging protection, found in competing suites from Symantec and McAfee, were not a part of version 6.0. Both CNET and PC World criticized the suite's relatively high retail price, US$79.95.\nKIS 6.0 supports Windows 98 SE, ME, NT Workstation 4.0, 2000 Professional, XP Home Edition, XP Professional, XP Professional x64, and Vista. 50 megabytes of free space, Internet Explorer 5.5, and Windows Installer 2.0 are required. RAM and CPU requirements are dependent on the operating system.\n\n\n*** Version 2008 (7.0) ***\nVersion 7.0 introduced a redesigned GUI. Components were renamed and reorganized; the Anti-hacker module was renamed to the Firewall, and the Anti-Spy module was integrated with the Privacy Control module. PC World described the new interface as \"intuitive\" and \"great-looking\".Parental controls were introduced, with specific settings for different age categories, such as \"child\" or \"parent\". Within age categories are content categories, such as drugs or violence. Users can manually configure profiles. Filtering profiles can be associated with users. Since content is filtered at the network level, the feature will work with any Internet browser. The filter relies on a database of known URLs and can analyse websites in real-time. Attempts to access forbidden URLs are logged, and sites visited are tracked as well, raising privacy issues. Limits on Internet access may be set based on time, and chat rooms along with webmail sites can be manually blocked.Spam filtering integrates with Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Express, Windows Mail, and The Bat!. E-mail content is analysed and scored, and e-mail with scores above two specified thresholds are either marked as \"!!spam\" or \"??probably spam\". The Mail Dispatcher feature shows subject and sender information for messages, and allows users to avoid downloading blatant spam by selecting which messages to download. The filter self-trains by analyzing incoming and outgoing e-mail not marked as spam, or by analyzing folders only containing spam or valid e-mail. Senders of verified valid e-mail are whitelisted. E-mail can also be whitelisted or blacklisted based on phrases present in the text. E-mail with non-ASCII characters or invisible text can also be blocked. However, version 7.0 had a relatively poor showing, misidentifying 30 percent of valid messages in PC Magazine testing. 30 percent of spam also made to the inbox.Protection against data leaks was incorporated in this release. The suite warns users when programs attempt to access or send data from certain areas, such as where Internet Explorer stores webform information.Malware protection was mostly positive in detection and disinfection tests by AV-Test.org. Version 7.0 detected 100 percent of wildlist threats. Using one-month-old signatures and a set of new malware, however, detection fell to 14 percent. Files were scanned at 5.24 megabytes per second. Version 7.0 successfully identified all six actively running rootkits, four of six inactive rootkits, and was only able to remove two of six rootkits. The firewall correctly blocked all attempted outside connections, with a reasonable level of security when left on default settings.This version drops support for the Windows 98, 2000, and NT. Windows XP Service Pack 2 is required, except in the case of XP Professional x64 edition. Vista is supported as well. RAM and CPU requirements are dependent on the operating system. 75 megabytes of free space, Internet Explorer 5.5, and Windows Installer 2.0.\n\n\n*** Version 2009 (8.0) ***\nThis version introduces a revised user interface, an application filtering module, an updated anti-virus engine, and a vulnerability scanner. The main window separates settings in four categories, compared to eight in its predecessor. A status bar changes colour (green, yellow, and red) to reflect overall program status and flashes to divert attention when needed. PC Magazine also noted pop-up notifications were kept to a minimum.Kaspersky claims the core anti-virus engine was revised to increase scan speed. PC Magazine found an initial scan took over two hours, however subsequent scans took two minutes to complete. However, malware detection was relatively low in comparison to other anti-virus applications tested. Out of 650 thousand samples, version 8.0 detected 95.6 percent. The top score was around 99 percent. Using two-week-old signatures, version 8.0 detected 52 percent of viruses in a different set of samples. Kaspersky also blocked about 60 percent of malware based solely on behaviour. The top performers scored 55.3 percent and 80 percent respectively. Version 2009 detected 98.1 percent of adware. However, PC World noted to achieve that kind of performance, users will have to modify program settings. On default settings, KIS allowed Zango to install. To block the installation, users must enable KIS to scan for \"other malware\".The Security Analyzer looks for operating system and program patches. It also looks for vulnerable system settings, presenting users with a list of recommended actions to prevent malware from gaining access to a system. However, PC World criticized the amount of computer jargon used and lack of information about how adjust settings appropriately. On the other hand, PC Magazine found the feature straightforward, and often the solution involved downloading and installing an update.KIS uses a whitelist by Carbon Black to classify trusted and malicious programs. Malicious programs are not allowed to run at all. Unknown programs falling in between the two categories are restricted in the actions they can perform. Its firewall blocked all attacks in PC Magazine testing. Phishing protection was introduced in this release. Testing by PC Magazine found the feature blocked 44 percent of phishing URLs. Internet Explorer 7 blocked 67 percent of the URLs, and Mozilla Firefox blocked 81 percent.Spam filtering now integrates with Mozilla Thunderbird and scans NNTP traffic. Spam can be automatically diverted to its own folder. When using an unsupported e-mail client to download POP3, IMAP or NNTP mail, Kaspersky will still generate a report of all messages. However, in an unsupported client, there will be no toolbar nor will the program classify any messages as spam in the client itself.\n\n\n*** Version 2010 (9.0) ***\nVersion 2010 of Kaspersky Internet Security introduced an overhauled user interface and a sandbox for running applications in a virtualized environment. The 9.0.0.736 build of KIS 2010 fully supported the Windows 7 operating system.\n\n\n*** Version 2011 (11.0) ***\nThe beta version was released for all windows users on 8 June 2010.  This version included a new interface, as well as a gadget only available for Windows Vista and Windows 7 users.  PC Mag rated this version \"very good\" (4/5 stars).  Its firewall was noted to be very good, but that made up for its only adequate malware detection rates. Two critical fixes have been released by Kaspersky Lab, making the current version 11.0.2.556.\n\n\n*** Version 2012 (12.0) ***\nOn 1 March 2011, Kaspersky released the first build of version 2012, it came out as beta version and in English, French and Russian version, with more versions due out later. On 7 June 2011 Kaspersky Lab announced the commercial release of Kaspersky Internet Security 2012 in France, Germany, Switzerland. The current version is 12.0.0.374.\n\n\n*** Version 2013 (13.0) ***\nThe beta version was released for all windows users on 3 March 2012.  This version includes an interface which looks (currently, at least) much like Internet Security 2012. There is no Safe Run option, no Proactive Defense, while instead the behavioural monitoring System Watcher seems to be taking greater responsibility for detecting malware and a Safe Banking feature has been added.\nThe release candidate (build 13.0.1.4088 RC) was released for all windows users on 20 July 2012.\nThe Final Version was released on 28 August 2012 build 13.0.1.4190\n\n\n*** Version 2014 (14.0) ***\nBeta testing started on 12 March 2013. This version introduced a Windows 8 like GUI design. The final version was released on 3 August 2013 build 14.0.0.4651 in India and Russia, then on August 13 in the US and August 27 in the UK. The 2014 release was frequently characterized as inferior to user expectations, largely due to its removal of a range of granular fine-tuning options in 2013 and earlier, which were used by experienced users; a number of these were added back in the 2015 beta by the time of its technical release (build 463).\nAs of February 13, 2014 build 14.0.0.4651(E) was released. Build 14.0.0.4651(I) is the latest (current) version.\n\n\n*** Version 2015 (15.0) ***\nIn April 2014, a beta version of the 2015 product, build 463, was released, followed by a technical release preview, of the near-complete 2015 product. The first official release of the product was in Bangladesh in June 2014.\n\n\n*** Version 2017 (17.0) ***\n\n\n*** Version 2018 (18.0) ***\n\n\n*** Version 2019 (19.0) ***\n\n\n*** Version 2020 (20.0) ***\n\n\n*** Version 2021 (21.0) ***\n\n== Controversies regarding security ==\nIn March 2015, Bloomberg accused Kaspersky of having close ties to Russian military and intelligence officials. \nKaspersky slammed the claims in his blog, calling the coverage \"sensationalist\" and guilty of \"exploiting paranoia\" to \"increase readership\".As a result of alleged Russian involvement in the 2016 Presidential Election and ongoing investigations, the Department of Homeland Security officially banned the use of the Kaspersky Internet Security by the United States federal government in September, 2017.As of December 12, 2017, the use of Kaspersky software is banned from use by the American federal government by law.",

    "instruction": "text: Clickjacking\n\n==Introduction==\nClickjacking (classified as a user interface redress attack or UI redressing) is a malicious technique of tricking a user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives, thus potentially revealing confidential information or allowing others to take control of their computer while clicking on seemingly innocuous objects, including web pages.Clickjacking is an instance of the confused deputy problem, wherein a computer is tricked into misusing its authority.\n\n== Description ==\nOne form of clickjacking takes advantage of vulnerabilities that are present in applications or web pages to allow the attacker to manipulate the user's computer for their own advantage.\nFor example, a clickjacked page tricks a user into performing undesired actions by clicking on concealed links. On a clickjacked page, the attackers load another page over the original page in a transparent layer to trick the user into taking actions, the outcomes of which will not be the same as the user expects. The unsuspecting users think that they are clicking visible buttons, while they are actually performing actions on the invisible page, clicking buttons of the page below the layer. The hidden page may be an authentication page; therefore, the attackers can trick users into performing actions which the users never intended. There is no way of tracing such actions to the attackers later, as the users would have been genuinely authenticated on the hidden page.\n\n== Clickjacking categories ==\nClassic: works mostly through a web browser\nLikejacking: utilizes Facebook's social media capabilities\nNested: clickjacking tailored to affect Google+\nCursorjacking: manipulates the cursor's appearance and location\nMouseJacking: inject keyboard or mouse input via remote RF link\nBrowserless: does not use a browser\nCookiejacking: acquires cookies from browsers\nFilejacking: capable of setting up the affected device as a file server\nPassword manager attack: clickjacking that utilizes a vulnerability in the autofill capability of browsers\n\n\n*** Classic ***\nClassic clickjacking refers to a situation when an attacker uses hidden layers on web pages to manipulate the actions a user's cursor does, resulting in misleading the user about what truly is being clicked on.A user might receive an email with a link to a video about a news item, but another webpage, say a product page on Amazon, can be \"hidden\" on top or underneath the \"PLAY\" button of the news video. The user tries to \"play\" the video but actually \"buys\" the product from Amazon. The hacker can only send a single click, so they rely on the fact that the visitor is both logged into Amazon and has 1-click ordering enabled.\nWhile technical implementation of these attacks may be challenging due to cross-browser incompatibilities, a number of tools such as BeEF or Metasploit Project offer almost fully automated exploitation of clients on vulnerable websites. Clickjacking may be facilitated by \u2013 or may facilitate \u2013 other web attacks, such as XSS.\n\n\n*** Likejacking ***\nLikejacking is a malicious technique of tricking users viewing a website into \"liking\" a Facebook page or other social media posts/accounts that they did not intentionally mean to \"like\". The term \"likejacking\" came from a comment posted by Corey Ballou in the article How to \"Like\" Anything on the Web (Safely), which is one of the first documented postings explaining the possibility of malicious activity regarding Facebook's \"like\" button.According to an article in IEEE Spectrum, a solution to likejacking was developed at one of Facebook's hackathons. A \"Like\" bookmarklet is available that avoids the possibility of likejacking present in the Facebook like button.\n\n\n*** Nested ***\nNested clickjacking, compared to classic clickjacking, works by embedding a malicious web frame between two frames of the original, harmless web page: that from the framed page and that which is displayed on the top window. This works due to a vulnerability in the HTTP header X-Frame-Options, in which, when this element has the value SAMEORIGIN, the web browser only checks the two aforementioned layers. The fact that additional frames can be added in between these two while remaining undetected means that attackers can use this for their benefit.\nIn the past, with Google+ and the faulty version of X-Frame-Options, attackers were able to insert frames of their choice by using the vulnerability present in Google's Image Search engine. In between the image display frames, which were present in Google+ as well, these attacker-controlled frames were able to load and not be restricted, allowing for the attackers to mislead whoever came upon the image display page.\n\n\n*** Cursorjacking ***\nCursorJacking is a UI redressing technique to change the cursor from the location the user perceives, discovered in 2010 by Eddy Bordi, a researcher at Vulnerability.fr, Marcus Niemietz demonstrated this with a custom cursor icon, and in 2012 Mario Heiderich by hiding the cursor.Jordi Chancel, a researcher at Alternativ-Testing.fr, discovered a CursorJacking vulnerability using Flash, HTML and JavaScript code in Mozilla Firefox on Mac OS X systems (fixed in Firefox 30.0) which can lead to arbitrary code execution and webcam spying.A second CursorJacking vulnerability was again discovered by Jordi Chancel in Mozilla Firefox on Mac OS X systems (fixed in Firefox 37.0) using once again Flash, HTML and JavaScript code which can also lead to spying via a webcam and the execution of a malicious addon, allowing the execution of malware on the affected user's computer.\n\n\n*** MouseJack ***\nDifferent from other clickjacking techniques that redress a UI, MouseJack is a wireless hardware-based UI vulnerability first reported by Marc Newlin of Bastille.net in 2016 which allows external keyboard input to be injected into vulnerable dongles. Logitech supplied firmware patches but other manufacturers failed to respond to this vulnerability.\n\n\n*** Browserless ***\nIn Browserless clickjacking, attackers utilize vulnerabilities in programs to replicate classic clickjacking in them, without being required to use the presence of a web browser.\nThis method of clickjacking is mainly prevalent among mobile devices, usually on Android devices, especially due to the way in which toast notifications work. Because toast notifications have a small delay in between the moment the notification is requested and the moment the notification actually displays on-screen, attackers are capable of using that gap to create a dummy button that lies hidden underneath the notification and can still be clicked on.\n\n\n*** CookieJacking ***\nCookieJacking is a form of clickjacking in which cookies are stolen from the victim's web browsers. This is done by tricking the user into dragging an object which seemingly appears harmless, but is in fact making the user select the entire content of the cookie being targeted. From there, the attacker can acquire the cookie and all of the data that it possesses.\n\n\n*** FileJacking ***\nIn fileJacking, attackers use the web browser's capability to navigate through the computer and access computer files in order to acquire personal data. It does so by tricking the user into establishing an active file server (through the file and folder selection window that browsers use). With this, attackers can now access and take files from their victims' computers.\n\n\n*** Password manager attack ***\nA 2014 paper from researcher at the Carnegie Mellon University found that while browsers refuse to autofill if the protocol on the current login page is different from the protocol at the time the password was saved, some password managers would insecurely fill in passwords for the http version of https-saved passwords. Most managers did not protect against iFrame- and redirection-based attacks and exposed additional passwords where password synchronization had been used between multiple devices.\n\n== Prevention ==\n\n\n*** Client-side ***\n\n\n**** NoScript ****\nProtection against clickjacking (including likejacking) can be added to Mozilla Firefox desktop and mobile versions by installing the NoScript add-on: its ClearClick feature, released on 8 October 2008, prevents users from clicking on invisible or \"redressed\" page elements of embedded documents or applets. According to Google's \"Browser Security Handbook\" from 2008, NoScript's ClearClick is a \"freely available product that offers a reasonable degree of protection\" against Clickjacking. Protection from the newer cursorjacking attack was added to NoScript 2.2.8 RC1.\n\n\n**** NoClickjack ****\nThe \"NoClickjack\" web browser add-on (browser extension) adds client-side clickjack protection for users of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Microsoft Edge without interfering with the operation of legitimate iFrames. NoClickjack is based on technology developed for GuardedID. The NoClickjack add-on is free of charge.\n\n\n**** GuardedID ****\nGuardedID (a commercial product) includes client-side clickjack protection for users of Internet Explorer without interfering with the operation of legitimate iFrames. GuardedID clickjack protection forces all frames to become visible. GuardedID teams with the add-on NoClickjack to add protection for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Microsoft Edge.\n\n\n**** Gazelle ****\nGazelle is a Microsoft Research project secure web browser based on IE, that uses an OS-like security model, and has its own limited defenses against clickjacking. In Gazelle, a window of different origin may only draw dynamic content over another window's screen space if the content it draws is opaque.\n\n\n**** Intersection Observer v2 ****\nThe Intersection Observer v2 API introduces the concept of tracking the actual \"visibility\" of a target element as a human being would define it. This allows a framed widget to detect when it's being covered. The feature is enabled by default since Google Chrome 74, released in April 2019. Chrome is the only browser to implement the API at this time.\n\n\n*** Server-side ***\n\n\n**** Framekiller ****\nWeb site owners can protect their users against UI redressing (frame based clickjacking) on the server side by including a framekiller JavaScript snippet in those pages they do not want to be included inside frames from different sources.Such JavaScript-based protection is not always reliable. This is especially true on Internet Explorer, where this kind of countermeasure can be circumvented \"by design\" by including the targeted page inside an <IFRAME SECURITY\n\nQuestions: How does clickjacking manipulate user actions on web pages through hidden layers?Q: What is likejacking and how does it take advantage of social media capabilities?Q: How does nested clickjacking differ from classic clickjacking and what vulnerabilities does it exploit?Q: What is cursorjacking and how can it lead to arbitrary code execution and webcam spying?Q: How does MouseJack differ from other clickjacking techniques and what vulnerabilities does it exploit?Q: In what ways can browserless clickjacking be utilized and what devices are most susceptible?Q: What is cookiejacking and how does it steal cookies from web browsers?Q: How does fileJacking use web browsers' capabilities to access computer files and what are the risks?Q: What are the vulnerabilities in password managers that can lead to insecure password filling and exposure of additional passwords?Q: How does NoScript's ClearClick feature protect users from clickjacking and likejacking in Mozilla Firefox?Q: How does the NoClickjack web browser add-on provide clickjack protection without interfering with legitimate iFrames?Q: How does Gazelle, a Microsoft Research project secure web browser, defend against clickjacking?Q: What is the Intersection Observer v2 API and how does it help detect when a framed widget is being covered?Q: How can web site owners protect their users against UI redressing on the server-side using framekiller JavaScript snippets?Q: What are the limitations of JavaScript-based protection against UI redressing on Internet Explorer?",

    "output": "Coppersmith's attack is a class of cryptographic attacks that targets the RSA public-key cryptosystem. It uses the Coppersmith method to exploit cases where the public exponent e is small or when partial knowledge of a prime factor of the secret key is available.a: In the RSA system, the public key is a tuple of integers (N, e), where N is the product of two primes p and q, and the secret key is an integer d that satisfies the equation ed \u2261 1 (mod (p-1)(q-1)). The secret key can also be represented as d\\_p \u2261 d (mod p-1) and d\\_q \u2261 d (mod q-1) using the Chinese Remainder Theorem for faster decryption.a: The purpose of using a small public exponent in RSA is to reduce encryption or signature verification time. Common choices for e include 3, 17, and 65537, which are Fermat primes.a: Theorem 1 in Coppersmith's method states that if N is an integer, f is a monic polynomial of degree d over the integers, and X is a bound, then it is possible to find all integer solutions x to the equation f(x) \u2261 0 (mod N) with |x| < X using the Coppersmith method.a: H\u00e5stad's broadcast attack is a cryptographic attack that exploits the use of a small public exponent in RSA. It involves a sender sending the same message in encrypted form to multiple recipients using the same small public exponent. By analyzing the resulting ciphertexts, it is possible to recover the original message.a: The Coppersmith method can be used to generalize H\u00e5stad's broadcast attack by allowing for the analysis of ciphertexts produced using different public exponents.a: The Franklin-Reiter related-message attack is a cryptographic attack that exploits the use of related messages in RSA. If two messages differ only by a known fixed difference and are RSA-encrypted under the same RSA modulus, then it is possible to recover both of them.a: Coppersmith\u2019s short-pad attack exploits the fact that if an RSA message is padded with a short string, it is possible to recover the original message by analyzing the resulting ciphertext. This attack can be used to break RSA encryption with a small public exponent.a: Coppersmith's method can be applied to find small roots of modular equations when the modulus is smooth, the polynomial is monic and the root is small enough.a: The Coppersmith method uses lattice-based techniques to convert the problem of finding small roots of modular polynomial equations into finding short vectors in a lattice, which can then be efficiently solved using lattice reduction algorithms.a: If partial knowledge of a prime factor of the secret key is available, it can be used to construct a polynomial equation that has a small root modulo the prime factor. Coppersmith's method can then be used to efficiently find the small root, which can be used to factor the RSA modulus and recover the secret key.a: The public exponent e being small in RSA encryption can significantly reduce encryption and signature verification time. However, it can also be exploited by cryptographic attacks, such as the low public exponent attack, H\u00e5stad's broadcast attack, and Coppersmith's short-pad attack, which can recover the original message or factor the RSA modulus.a: The Chinese Remainder Theorem can be used to represent the secret key d as d\\_p \u2261 d (mod p-1) and d\\_q \u2261 d (mod q-1), which can then be used to efficiently decrypt messages by computing C^d\\_p (mod p) and C^d\\_q (mod q) and combining the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.a: The Franklin-Reiter related-message attack differs from H\u00e5stad's broadcast attack in that it involves the encryption of related messages, rather than the same message, under the same RSA modulus using a small public exponent. It can be used to recover both messages if they differ only by a known fixed difference.a: The Coppersmith method has important practical implications for the security of RSA encryption, as it can be used to efficiently find small roots of modular polynomial equations, which can be used to factor the RSA modulus and recover the secret key. This highlights the importance of using sufficiently large public exponents in RSA encryption to prevent such attacks.",

      "answers": "Coppersmith's attack is a class of cryptographic attacks that targets the RSA public-key cryptosystem. It uses the Coppersmith method to exploit cases where the public exponent e is small or when partial knowledge of a prime factor of the secret key is available.a: In the RSA system, the public key is a tuple of integers (N, e), where N is the product of two primes p and q, and the secret key is an integer d that satisfies the equation ed \u2261 1 (mod (p-1)(q-1)). The secret key can also be represented as d\\_p \u2261 d (mod p-1) and d\\_q \u2261 d (mod q-1) using the Chinese Remainder Theorem for faster decryption.a: The purpose of using a small public exponent in RSA is to reduce encryption or signature verification time. Common choices for e include 3, 17, and 65537, which are Fermat primes.a: Theorem 1 in Coppersmith's method states that if N is an integer, f is a monic polynomial of degree d over the integers, and X is a bound, then it is possible to find all integer solutions x to the equation f(x) \u2261 0 (mod N) with |x| < X using the Coppersmith method.a: H\u00e5stad's broadcast attack is a cryptographic attack that exploits the use of a small public exponent in RSA. It involves a sender sending the same message in encrypted form to multiple recipients using the same small public exponent. By analyzing the resulting ciphertexts, it is possible to recover the original message.a: The Coppersmith method can be used to generalize H\u00e5stad's broadcast attack by allowing for the analysis of ciphertexts produced using different public exponents.a: The Franklin-Reiter related-message attack is a cryptographic attack that exploits the use of related messages in RSA. If two messages differ only by a known fixed difference and are RSA-encrypted under the same RSA modulus, then it is possible to recover both of them.a: Coppersmith\u2019s short-pad attack exploits the fact that if an RSA message is padded with a short string, it is possible to recover the original message by analyzing the resulting ciphertext. This attack can be used to break RSA encryption with a small public exponent.a: Coppersmith's method can be applied to find small roots of modular equations when the modulus is smooth, the polynomial is monic and the root is small enough.a: The Coppersmith method uses lattice-based techniques to convert the problem of finding small roots of modular polynomial equations into finding short vectors in a lattice, which can then be efficiently solved using lattice reduction algorithms.a: If partial knowledge of a prime factor of the secret key is available, it can be used to construct a polynomial equation that has a small root modulo the prime factor. Coppersmith's method can then be used to efficiently find the small root, which can be used to factor the RSA modulus and recover the secret key.a: The public exponent e being small in RSA encryption can significantly reduce encryption and signature verification time. However, it can also be exploited by cryptographic attacks, such as the low public exponent attack, H\u00e5stad's broadcast attack, and Coppersmith's short-pad attack, which can recover the original message or factor the RSA modulus.a: The Chinese Remainder Theorem can be used to represent the secret key d as d\\_p \u2261 d (mod p-1) and d\\_q \u2261 d (mod q-1), which can then be used to efficiently decrypt messages by computing C^d\\_p (mod p) and C^d\\_q (mod q) and combining the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.a: The Franklin-Reiter related-message attack differs from H\u00e5stad's broadcast attack in that it involves the encryption of related messages, rather than the same message, under the same RSA modulus using a small public exponent. It can be used to recover both messages if they differ only by a known fixed difference.a: The Coppersmith method has important practical implications for the security of RSA encryption, as it can be used to efficiently find small roots of modular polynomial equations, which can be used to factor the RSA modulus and recover the secret key. This highlights the importance of using sufficiently large public exponents in RSA encryption to prevent such attacks."

The goal of the project was to provide accurate, detailed, current, and unbiased technical information on security vulnerabilities. The project promoted greater and more open collaboration between companies and individuals. The database's motto was \"Everything is Vulnerable\".The core of OSVDB was a relational database which tied various information about security vulnerabilities into a common, cross-referenced open security data source. As of December 2013, the database cataloged over 100,000 vulnerabilities. While the database was maintained by a 501(c)(3) non-profit public organization and volunteers, the data was prohibited for commercial use without a license.

This amendment was made to provide flexibility in sentencing for computer fraud and abuse offenses.a: The Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury are required to report to Congress annually during the first three years following the date of the enactment of this subsection concerning investigations and prosecutions under section 1030(a)(5) of title 18, United States Code. This reporting helps Congress monitor the enforcement and effectiveness of the Act.a: In the Act, 'financial institution' is a broad term that includes institutions with deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve or a member of the Federal Reserve, credit unions with accounts insured by the National Credit Union Administration, and other organizations such as broker-dealers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, branches or agencies of foreign banks, and organizations operating under section 25 or section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act.a: The Act does not prohibit any lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activity of a law enforcement agency of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, or of an intelligence agency of the United States. This provision ensures that legitimate activities carried out by these agencies are not affected by the Act's prohibitions.",

      "answers": "The National Information Infrastructure Protection Act is an amendment to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, enacted in 1996 to modify the earlier Code. The Act focuses on fraud and related activity in connection with computers, covering various aspects such as unauthorized access, obtaining sensitive information, and damaging protected computers.a: If someone knowingly accesses a computer without authorization and obtains sensitive national defense or foreign relations information, they could face fines and imprisonment for up to 10 years for a first offense, or up to 20 years if it's a subsequent offense or an attempt to commit an offense punishable under this subparagraph.a: Damage is defined as any impairment to the integrity or availability of data, a program, a system, or information. Penalties for causing damage to a protected computer range from fines and up to 5 years in prison for intentional access with reckless damage, up to 10 years for intentional access causing damage, and up to 20 years if the offense occurs after a conviction for another offense under this section.a: A 'financial record' is information derived from any record held by a financial institution pertaining to a customer's relationship with the financial institution. Obtaining financial records without authorization could lead to fines and imprisonment for up to 1 year for a first offense, or up to 5 years if it's a subsequent offense, committed for commercial advantage or private financial gain, in furtherance of any criminal or tortious act, or if the value of the information obtained exceeds $5,000.a: The United States Secret Service has the authority to investigate offenses under the Act, while the Federal Bureau of Investigation has primary authority to investigate offenses under subsection (a)(1) for cases involving espionage, foreign counterintelligence, information protected against unauthorized disclosure, or Restricted Data, except for offenses affecting the duties of the United States Secret Service. This enforcement is to be carried out in accordance with an agreement between the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General.a: A 'computer' is an electronic, magnetic, optical, electrochemical, or other high-speed data processing device performing logical, arithmetic, or storage functions, and includes any data storage facility or communications facility directly related to or operating in conjunction with such device. A 'protected computer' is a computer exclusively for the use of a financial institution or the United States Government, or used by or for a financial institution or the Government and the conduct constituting the offense affects that use. Additionally, protected computers are those used in interstate or foreign commerce or communications.a: 'Exceeds authorized access' means to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter.a: Trafficking in passwords or similar information through which a computer may be accessed without authorization could lead to fines and imprisonment for up to 1 year for a first offense, or up to 10 years if it's a subsequent offense, the computer is used by or for the Government of the United States, or if the trafficking affects interstate or foreign commerce.a: An offense under subsection (a)(7) involves transmitting a communication containing a threat to cause damage to a protected computer with the intent to extort money or other things of value from any person. This offense is punishable by fines and imprisonment for up to 5 years if it's a first offense, or up to 10 years if it's a subsequent offense, or if it occurs after a conviction for another offense under this section.a: In the Act, 'department of the United States' refers to the legislative or judicial branch of the Government or one of the executive departments enumerated in section 101 of title 5, which includes departments such as State, Treasury, Defense, Justice, and others.a: A civil action under the Act may only be brought if the conduct involves one of the factors set forth in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of subsection (a)(5)(B), and damages for a violation involving only conduct described in subsection (a)(5)(B)(i) are limited to economic damages. Additionally, such an action must be initiated within two years of the date of the act complained of or the date of the discovery of the damage, and no action may be brought for the negligent design or manufacture of computer hardware, software, or firmware.a: Section 814(e) aims to ensure that individuals convicted of a violation of section 1030 of title 18, United States Code, can be subjected to appropriate penalties without regard to any mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. This amendment was made to provide flexibility in sentencing for computer fraud and abuse offenses.a: The Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury are required to report to Congress annually during the first three years following the date of the enactment of this subsection concerning investigations and prosecutions under section 1030(a)(5) of title 18, United States Code. This reporting helps Congress monitor the enforcement and effectiveness of the Act.a: In the Act, 'financial institution' is a broad term that includes institutions with deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve or a member of the Federal Reserve, credit unions with accounts insured by the National Credit Union Administration, and other organizations such as broker-dealers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, branches or agencies of foreign banks, and organizations operating under section 25 or section 25(a) of the Federal Reserve Act.a: The Act does not prohibit any lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activity of a law enforcement agency of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, or of an intelligence agency of the United States. This provision ensures that legitimate activities carried out by these agencies are not affected by the Act's prohibitions."

HTTP referer information is freely alterable and interceptable, and is not a password, though some poorly configured systems treat it as such.\n\n== Application ==\nSome websites, especially many image hosting sites, use referer information to secure their materials: only browsers arriving from their web pages are served images.

Website owners may do this to disallow hotlinking.\nIt can also be used to defeat referer checking controls that are used to mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.\n\n== Tools ==\nSeveral software tools exist to facilitate referer spoofing in web browsers.

This was the advice that most systems followed, and was \"baked into\" a number of standards that businesses needed to follow.\n\n\n*** 2017 ***\nHowever, in 2017 a major update changed this advice, particularly that forcing complexity and regular changes is now seen as bad practice.:\u200a5.1.1.2\u200aThe key points of these are:\n\nVerifiers should not impose  composition rules e.g., requiring mixtures of different character types or prohibiting consecutively repeated characters\nVerifiers should not require passwords to be changed arbitrarily or regularly e.g. the previous 90 day rule\nPasswords must be at least 8 characters in length\nPassword systems should permit subscriber-chosen passwords at least 64 characters in length.\nAll printing ASCII characters, the space character, and Unicode characters should be acceptable in passwords\nWhen establishing or changing passwords, the verifier shall advise the subscriber that they need to select a different password if they have chosen a weak or compromised password\nVerifiers should offer guidance such as a password-strength meter, to assist the user in choosing a strong password\nVerifiers shall store passwords in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Passwords shall be salted and hashed using a suitable one-way key derivation function. Key derivation functions take a password, a salt, and a cost factor as inputs then generate a password hash. Their purpose is to make each password guessing trial by an attacker who has obtained a password hash file expensive and therefore the cost of a guessing attack high or prohibitive.NIST included a rationale for the new guidelines in its Appendix A.\n\n== Aspects ==\nTypical components of a password policy include:\n\n\n*** Password length and formation ***\n\nMany policies require a minimum password length. Eight characters is typical but may not be appropriate. Longer passwords are generally more secure, but some systems impose a maximum length for compatibility with legacy systems.\nSome policies suggest or impose requirements on what type of password a user can choose, such as:\n\nthe use of both upper-case and lower-case letters (case sensitivity)\ninclusion of one or more numerical digits\ninclusion of special characters, such as @, #, $\nprohibition of words found in a password blocklist\nprohibition of words found in the user's personal information\nprohibition of use of company name or an abbreviation\nprohibition of passwords that match the format of calendar dates, license plate numbers, telephone numbers, or other common numbersOther systems create an initial password for the user; but require then to change it to one of their own choosing within a short interval.\n\n\n*** Password block list ***\nPassword block lists are lists of passwords that are always blocked from use.  Block lists contain passwords constructed of character combinations that otherwise meet company policy, but should no longer be used because they have been deemed insecure for one or more reasons, such as being easily guessed, following a common pattern, or public disclosure from previous data breaches.  Common examples are Password1, Qwerty123, or Qaz123wsx.\n\n\n*** Password duration ***\nSome policies require users to change passwords periodically, often every 90 or 180 days. The benefit of password expiration, however, is debatable. Systems that implement such policies sometimes prevent users from picking a password too close to a previous selection.This policy can often backfire. Some users find it hard to devise \"good\" passwords that are also easy to remember, so if people are required to choose many passwords because they have to change them often, they end up using much weaker passwords; the policy also encourages users to write passwords down. Also, if the policy prevents a user from repeating a recent password, this requires that there is a database in existence of everyone's recent passwords (or their hashes) instead of having the old ones erased from memory. Finally, users may change their password repeatedly within a few minutes, and then change back to the one they really want to use, circumventing the password change policy altogether.\nThe human aspects of passwords must also be considered. Unlike computers, human users cannot delete one memory and replace it with another. Consequently, frequently changing a memorized password is a strain on the human memory, and most users resort to choosing a password that is relatively easy to guess (See Password fatigue). Users are often advised to use mnemonic devices to remember complex passwords. However, if the password must be repeatedly changed, mnemonics are useless because the user would not remember which mnemonic to use. Furthermore, the use of mnemonics (leading to passwords such as \"2BOrNot2B\") makes the password easier to guess.\nAdministration factors can also be an issue. Users sometimes have older devices that require a password that was used before the password duration expired. In order to manage these older devices, users may have to resort to writing down all old passwords in case they need to log into an older device.\nRequiring a very strong password and not requiring it be changed is often better. However, this approach does have a major drawback: if an unauthorized person acquires a password and uses it without being detected, that person may have access for an indefinite period.\nIt is necessary to weigh these factors: the likelihood of someone guessing a password because it is weak, versus the likelihood of someone managing to steal, or otherwise acquire without guessing, a stronger password.\nBruce Schneier argues that \"pretty much anything that can be remembered can be cracked\", and recommends a scheme that uses passwords which will not appear in any dictionaries.\n\n\n*** Sanction ***\nPassword policies may include progressive sanctions beginning with warnings and ending with possible loss of computer privileges or job termination. Where confidentiality is mandated by law, e.g. with classified information, a violation of password policy could be a criminal offense. Some consider a convincing explanation of the importance of security to be more effective than threats of sanctions.\n\n== Selection process ==\nThe level of password strength required depends, among other things, on how easy it is for an attacker to submit multiple guesses. Some systems limit the number of times a user can enter an incorrect password before some delay is imposed or the account is frozen. At the other extreme, some systems make available a specially hashed version of the password, so that anyone can check its validity. When this is done, an attacker can try passwords very rapidly; so much stronger passwords are necessary for reasonable security. (See password cracking and password length equation.) Stricter requirements are also appropriate for accounts with higher privileges, such as root or system administrator accounts.\n\n\n*** Usability considerations ***\nPassword policies are usually a tradeoff between theoretical security and the practicalities of human behavior. For example:\n\nRequiring excessively complex passwords and forcing them to be changed frequently can cause users to write passwords down in places that are easy for an intruder to find, such as a Rolodex or post-it note near the computer.\nUsers often have dozens of passwords to manage. It may be more realistic to recommend a single password be used for all low security applications, such as reading on-line newspapers and accessing entertainment web sites.\nSimilarly, demanding that users never write down their passwords may be unrealistic and lead users to choose weak ones (or cause a lot of inconvenience when users forget their password). An alternative is to suggest keeping written passwords in a secure place, such as a safe or an encrypted master file. The validity of this approach depends on what the most likely threat is deemed to be. While writing down a password may be problematic if potential attackers have access to the secure store, if the threat is primarily remote attackers who do not have access to the store, it can be a very secure method.\nInclusion of special characters can be a problem if a user has to log onto a computer in a different country. Some special characters may be difficult or impossible to find on keyboards designed for another language.\nSome identity management systems allow self-service password reset, where users can bypass password security by supplying an answer to one or more security questions such as \"where were you born?\", \"what's your favorite movie?\", etc. Often the answers to these questions can easily be obtained by social engineering, phishing or simple research.A 2010 examination of the password policies of 75 different websites concludes that security only partly explains more stringent policies: monopoly providers of a service, such as government sites, have more stringent policies than sites where consumers have choice (e.g. retail sites and banks). The study concludes that sites with more stringent policies \"do not have greater security concerns, they are simply better insulated from the consequences from poor usability.\"\nOther approaches are available that are generally considered to be more secure than simple passwords. These include use of a security token or one-time password system, such as S/Key, or multi-factor authentication. However, these systems heighten the tradeoff between security and convenience: according to Shuman Ghosemajumder, these systems all improve security, but come \"at the cost of moving the burden to the end user.\"\n\n== Enforcing a policy ==\nThe more complex a password policy, the harder it may be to enforce, due to user difficulty in remembering or choosing a suitable password.\nMost companies will require users to familiarize themselves with any password policy, much in the same way a company would require employees to be aware of Health & Safety regulations, or building fire exits, however it is often difficult to ensure that the relevant policies are actually being followed without systems in place that automatically enforce the policy.  Many systems, such as Microsoft Windows, require passwords have built-in methods of enforcing the set policy.  This is the only reliable way to ensure that the policy is being followed.\n\nHow does NIST's 2017 password policy guidelines differ from the 2004 guidelines in terms of composition rules?q: What is the recommended minimum password length according to NIST's 2017 guidelines?q: Why does NIST's 2017 guidelines advise against regular password changes?q: What is the purpose of salting and hashing passwords in NIST's 2017 guidelines?q: What is a password block list and why is it used?q: What is the human aspect to consider when frequently changing passwords?q: What are some potential drawbacks of requiring a very strong password and not requiring it to be changed often?q: How can sanctions be used effectively in a password policy?q: How does the ease of submitting multiple guesses affect required password strength?q: What is the significance of using a specially hashed version of the password?q: How do usability considerations factor into password policies?q: What are some alternatives to writing down a password?q: Why can inclusion of special characters be a problem?q: How can self-service password reset be a security risk?q: What are some alternatives to simple passwords for improved security?",

    "instruction": "Please answer questions about the following article about: XRumer\n\n==Introduction==\nXRumer is a piece of software made for spamming online forums and comment sections. It is marketed as a program for search engine optimization and was created by BotmasterLabs. It is able to register and post to forums (forum spam) with the aim of boosting search engine rankings. The program is able to bypass security techniques commonly used by many forums and blogs to deter automated spam, such as account registration, client detection, many forms of CAPTCHAs, and e-mail activation before posting. The program utilises SOCKS and HTTP proxies in an attempt to make it more difficult for administrators to block posts by source IP, and features a proxy checking tool to verify the integrity and anonymity of the proxies used.\nIn addition, the software can avoid the suspicions of forum administrators by first registering to make a post in the form of a question which mentions the spam product (\"Where can I get...?\"), before registering another account to post a spam link which mentions the product. The side effect of these innocent-looking posts is that helpful forum visitors may search on a search engine (e.g. Google) for the product and themselves post a link to help out, thus bolstering the product's Google ranking without falling afoul of forum posting policies. The software is also capable of avoiding detection by making posts in off-topic, spam and overflow sections of forums, thus attempting to keep its activities in high activity low content areas of the targeted forum. However, there are other platforms used to spam to, which includes website comment spam.\n\n== Method of operation ==\nXRumer is capable of posting to blogs and guestbooks in addition to its main role as an automated forum posting tool. It can also create forum profiles complete with signature in an attempt to avoid alerting forum administrators with any off-topic forum posts. The software is also able to gather and decipher artificial intelligence such as security questions (i.e. what is 2+2?) often used by forums upon registration. Since the latest version of XRumer, the software is capable of collecting such security questions from multiple sources and is much more effective in defeating them.\nHelper program Hrefer is also included. This software is used to automatically parse results from search engines including Google, Yahoo, Bing and Yandex for forums and blogs that can then be used as a target list for the main XRumer application.According to The Register, as of October 2008, XRumer can defeat captchas of Hotmail and Gmail. This enables the software to create accounts with these free email services, which are used to register in forums that it posts to. XRumer also posts slowly initially, in an attempt to avoid detection by posting unnaturally fast. Between 2009 and 2011 XRumer no longer recognized Hotmail and Gmail captchas due to a change in captcha format. Users of XRumer could only defeat such captchas utilizing external human captcha services.\n\n== Defenses ==\nWebmasters of topical forums face an ongoing battle against XRumer software, users of which are almost always in violation of forum terms of service, and/or have no interest in the actual forum topic.  The users of the software have created an entire industry whose sole purpose is to protect internet sites against users of XRumer.  Forum administration tasks against XRumer are often a constant, daily effort, which include identifying new user accounts that are from XRumer users, deleting posts/threads created by the software, and deleting/disabling the user accounts.\nThe easiest method to defeat Xrumer is to simply require the first post of any new forum member or blog poster to be approved before it can appear.  There are several resources that help block forum spam, which reference reports of forum spam by username and IP address.  If a user/IP has appeared in the site's lists, it is highly likely that it is a black-hat user of XRumer.  Common defensive actions by webmasters are to institute IP-based posting bans on subnetworks used by the spammers.\nThe spam messages in a forum typically take the form of \"link spam\" which will often be included in older topics and private messages (PMs) leaving the newer threads and posted messages \"clear\" of apparent spam.  Sophisticated spammers will copy posts from other areas of the site, giving the appearance of a valid, on-topic reply.  The best clue that it is a spammer is that the links in the user profile are completely unrelated to the forum topic, and the posted messages, while seemingly within the general topic of the forum, will be non-sequiturs and out-of-place within the topic thread.  Alternatively, the spammers post generic \"I am excited to begin posting and contributing here.\" messages that are content-neutral.\nThe damage caused to forums is classified in several areas: first and foremost, the admin time to clean the forum; second, the server bandwidth to accommodate the spam postings; third, the storage requirements at the forum server for the spam messages that are devoid of content; fourth, the community alienation and irritation around seeing spam; fifth, the offense to innocent forum members if their posts are mistaken as spam or their accounts suspended in error for suspected spamming; and sixth, the lowering of the information-to-noise ratio of the forum, which diminishes the value of the forum, skewing usage/active user statistics used to determine advertising rates.\n\n== E-mail account creation ==\nAs per the latest update to XRumer 7 the software is able to automatically register e-mail accounts on mail.ru (Russian IP addresses only) and Gmail. Support for creating e-mail accounts in an automated fashion on Hotmail and AOL has been completely removed. The technique employed by XRumer to bypass the CAPTCHA protection in Gmail and mail.ru is averaging. A captcha is a challenge-response test frequently used by internet services in order to verify that the user is actually a human rather than a computer program. Commonly, captchas are dynamically created images of random numbers and/or letters. These images are distorted in some way so that the human eye can still recognize them, but with the goal to make automatic recognition impossible. Captchas are used by free-mail services to prevent automatic creation of a huge number of email accounts and to protect automatic form submissions on blogs, forums and article directories. As of November 2012, Xrumer has once again cracked Recaptcha, and is able to successfully post to Forums/Blogs that use it.\nAveraging is a common method in physics to reduce noise in input data. The averaging attack can be used on image-based captchas if the following conditions are met:\nThe predominant distortion in the captcha is of noise-like nature.\nIt is possible to extract a series of different images with the same information encoded in them.\nAveraging of a series of images can be used to improve image quality (reduce distortion, or improve signal-to-noise ratio, so to say) of captchas and hence to make them more easily recognizable by OCR (optical character recognition) systems.\nThe fact that noise and payload behave differently on \"reload\" is exploited.

      "context": "XRumer\n\n==Introduction==\nXRumer is a piece of software made for spamming online forums and comment sections. It is marketed as a program for search engine optimization and was created by BotmasterLabs. It is able to register and post to forums (forum spam) with the aim of boosting search engine rankings. The program is able to bypass security techniques commonly used by many forums and blogs to deter automated spam, such as account registration, client detection, many forms of CAPTCHAs, and e-mail activation before posting. The program utilises SOCKS and HTTP proxies in an attempt to make it more difficult for administrators to block posts by source IP, and features a proxy checking tool to verify the integrity and anonymity of the proxies used.\nIn addition, the software can avoid the suspicions of forum administrators by first registering to make a post in the form of a question which mentions the spam product (\"Where can I get...?\"), before registering another account to post a spam link which mentions the product. The side effect of these innocent-looking posts is that helpful forum visitors may search on a search engine (e.g. Google) for the product and themselves post a link to help out, thus bolstering the product's Google ranking without falling afoul of forum posting policies. The software is also capable of avoiding detection by making posts in off-topic, spam and overflow sections of forums, thus attempting to keep its activities in high activity low content areas of the targeted forum. However, there are other platforms used to spam to, which includes website comment spam.\n\n== Method of operation ==\nXRumer is capable of posting to blogs and guestbooks in addition to its main role as an automated forum posting tool. It can also create forum profiles complete with signature in an attempt to avoid alerting forum administrators with any off-topic forum posts. The software is also able to gather and decipher artificial intelligence such as security questions (i.e. what is 2+2?) often used by forums upon registration. Since the latest version of XRumer, the software is capable of collecting such security questions from multiple sources and is much more effective in defeating them.\nHelper program Hrefer is also included. This software is used to automatically parse results from search engines including Google, Yahoo, Bing and Yandex for forums and blogs that can then be used as a target list for the main XRumer application.According to The Register, as of October 2008, XRumer can defeat captchas of Hotmail and Gmail. This enables the software to create accounts with these free email services, which are used to register in forums that it posts to. XRumer also posts slowly initially, in an attempt to avoid detection by posting unnaturally fast. Between 2009 and 2011 XRumer no longer recognized Hotmail and Gmail captchas due to a change in captcha format. Users of XRumer could only defeat such captchas utilizing external human captcha services.\n\n== Defenses ==\nWebmasters of topical forums face an ongoing battle against XRumer software, users of which are almost always in violation of forum terms of service, and/or have no interest in the actual forum topic.  The users of the software have created an entire industry whose sole purpose is to protect internet sites against users of XRumer.  Forum administration tasks against XRumer are often a constant, daily effort, which include identifying new user accounts that are from XRumer users, deleting posts/threads created by the software, and deleting/disabling the user accounts.\nThe easiest method to defeat Xrumer is to simply require the first post of any new forum member or blog poster to be approved before it can appear.  There are several resources that help block forum spam, which reference reports of forum spam by username and IP address.  If a user/IP has appeared in the site's lists, it is highly likely that it is a black-hat user of XRumer.  Common defensive actions by webmasters are to institute IP-based posting bans on subnetworks used by the spammers.\nThe spam messages in a forum typically take the form of \"link spam\" which will often be included in older topics and private messages (PMs) leaving the newer threads and posted messages \"clear\" of apparent spam.  Sophisticated spammers will copy posts from other areas of the site, giving the appearance of a valid, on-topic reply.  The best clue that it is a spammer is that the links in the user profile are completely unrelated to the forum topic, and the posted messages, while seemingly within the general topic of the forum, will be non-sequiturs and out-of-place within the topic thread.  Alternatively, the spammers post generic \"I am excited to begin posting and contributing here.\" messages that are content-neutral.\nThe damage caused to forums is classified in several areas: first and foremost, the admin time to clean the forum; second, the server bandwidth to accommodate the spam postings; third, the storage requirements at the forum server for the spam messages that are devoid of content; fourth, the community alienation and irritation around seeing spam; fifth, the offense to innocent forum members if their posts are mistaken as spam or their accounts suspended in error for suspected spamming; and sixth, the lowering of the information-to-noise ratio of the forum, which diminishes the value of the forum, skewing usage/active user statistics used to determine advertising rates.\n\n== E-mail account creation ==\nAs per the latest update to XRumer 7 the software is able to automatically register e-mail accounts on mail.ru (Russian IP addresses only) and Gmail. Support for creating e-mail accounts in an automated fashion on Hotmail and AOL has been completely removed. The technique employed by XRumer to bypass the CAPTCHA protection in Gmail and mail.ru is averaging. A captcha is a challenge-response test frequently used by internet services in order to verify that the user is actually a human rather than a computer program. Commonly, captchas are dynamically created images of random numbers and/or letters. These images are distorted in some way so that the human eye can still recognize them, but with the goal to make automatic recognition impossible. Captchas are used by free-mail services to prevent automatic creation of a huge number of email accounts and to protect automatic form submissions on blogs, forums and article directories. As of November 2012, Xrumer has once again cracked Recaptcha, and is able to successfully post to Forums/Blogs that use it.\nAveraging is a common method in physics to reduce noise in input data. The averaging attack can be used on image-based captchas if the following conditions are met:\nThe predominant distortion in the captcha is of noise-like nature.\nIt is possible to extract a series of different images with the same information encoded in them.\nAveraging of a series of images can be used to improve image quality (reduce distortion, or improve signal-to-noise ratio, so to say) of captchas and hence to make them more easily recognizable by OCR (optical character recognition) systems.\nThe fact that noise and payload behave differently on \"reload\" is exploited. This allows the program to separate them and hence defeat the captcha without the need for a sophisticated algorithm.",

    "instruction": "Read this and answer the below questions\n\nAVG AntiVirus\n\n==Introduction==\nAVG AntiVirus (previously known as AVG, an abbreviation of Anti-Virus Guard) is a line of antivirus software developed by AVG Technologies, a subsidiary of Avast, a part of Gen Digital. It is available for Windows, macOS and Android.\n\n\n\n== Platform support ==\nAVG provides AVG AntiVirus Free for Windows, AVG AntiVirus for Mac for macOS and AVG AntiVirus for Android for Android devices. All are freemium products: They are free to download, install, update and use, but for technical support a premium plan must be purchased.\nAVG stopped providing new features for Windows XP and Windows Vista in January 2019. New versions require Windows 7 or later; virus definitions are still provided for previous versions.\n\n== Features ==\nAVG features most of the common functions available in modern antivirus and Internet security programs, including periodic scans, scans of sent and received emails (including adding footers to the emails indicating this), the ability to repair some virus-infected files, and a quarantine area (virus vault) in which infected files are held.\n\n\n*** LinkScanner ***\nThe patent pending LinkScanner technology acquired from Exploit Prevention Labs and built into most AVG products, provides real-time updated protection against exploits and drive-by downloads. LinkScanner includes: Search-Shield \u2013 a safe search component that places safety ratings next to each link in Google, Yahoo! and MSN search results; plus Active Surf-Shield \u2013 a safe surf component that scans the contents of a web site in real-time to ensure it's safe being opened. Concerns regarding web analytics have made LinkScanner a controversial component (see \"LinkScanner concerns\" below).\n\n\n**** LinkScanner concerns ****\nWhen AVG 8.0 was first released, its LinkScanner safe search feature was shown to cause an increase in traffic on websites that appear high in search engine results pages. Since LinkScanner disguises the scans as coming from an Internet Explorer 6 browser when it prescans each site listed in the search results, website usage logs showed incorrect and overinflated site visitor statistics. The prescanning of every link in search results also caused websites to transfer more data than usual, resulting in higher bandwidth usage for web site operators and slow performance for users. AVG initially said that site administrators would be able to filter the LinkScanner traffic out of their site statistics, leaving the problem of excess bandwidth usage still to be solved. Pay-per-click advertising was not affected by the increase in traffic.\n\n\n*** AVG Online Shield ***\nAVG Online Shield is a feature designed to check files and ensure that they are safe. AVG Online Shield also ensures the safety of exchanging files via instant messengers and VoIP clients.In response to complaints, AVG announced that as of 9 July 2008 \"Search-Shield will no longer scan each search result online for new exploits, which was causing the spikes that webmasters addressed with us\", releasing a new build on that date that applies a local blacklist, then prefetches and scans only those links clicked on by the user.\n\n== Controversy ==\nAs of 2014, there are numerous reports dating back to 2012 that the AVG SafeGuard Toolbar installs itself without the consent of the user, as a side effect of installing other applications. The toolbar program appears to cause significant RAM issues and can be considered an intrusive potentially unwanted program (PUP). Once installed, the AVG toolbar is virtually impossible to remove. The toolbar uninstaller does not function, instead re-installing the add-on if manually removed. Consequently, many discussions and blog posts have described complex procedures for removal of the AVG toolbar, each with very mixed results.In September 2015, AVG announced that it would start tracking users for profit, analyzing their data for sale to the advertising industry. This measure received criticism from consumers, the press and security industry, as many users intended to use the software in order to protect themselves from spyware and would not expect the functions of spyware to be \"hidden\" in security software.In December 2015, the AVG Web TuneUp Google Chrome extension (automatically installed with AVG AntiVirus) was revealed to contain multiple critical security vulnerabilities. Most notably, Chrome users' browsing history could be exposed to any website, cookies from any site the user has visited could be read by an attacker, and trivial cross-site scripting (XSS) issues could allow any website to execute arbitrary code (as another domain).\nThe XSS vulnerability allowed a user's mail from \"mail.google.com\" to be read by any website, or financial information to be read from the user's online banking site. The AVG team fixed this by only allowing \"mysearch.avg.com\" and \"webtuneup.avg.com\" to execute these scripts. Despite this remediation, attackers could leverage any of these attacks if an XSS vulnerability was found on the AVG sites. As of April 2016, Web TuneUp was still not available for download from the AVG website.\n\nWhat is AVG AntiVirus and what platforms does it support?Question: What is the pricing model for AVG AntiVirus?Question: What versions of Windows does AVG AntiVirus support?Question: What are some common functions of AVG AntiVirus?Question: What is the patent pending LinkScanner technology built into most AVG products?Question: What were the concerns regarding the LinkScanner technology when it was first released?Question: What is AVG Online Shield and what does it do?Question: What were the complaints regarding the AVG SafeGuard Toolbar?Question: What measures did AVG announce in 2015 regarding user data?Question: What security vulnerabilities were found in the AVG Web TuneUp Google Chrome extension?Question: How did AVG remediate the XSS vulnerability in the Web TuneUp extension?Question: What is the current status of the AVG Web TuneUp extension as of April 2016?Question: How does AVG AntiVirus handle malicious links in search results?Question: How does AVG Online Shield ensure the safety of files and exchanged data?Question: How did the AVG SafeGuard Toolbar affect users' systems?",

LinkScanner includes: Search-Shield \u2013 a safe search component that places safety ratings next to each link in Google, Yahoo! and MSN search results; plus Active Surf-Shield \u2013 a safe surf component that scans the contents of a web site in real-time to ensure it's safe being opened. Concerns regarding web analytics have made LinkScanner a controversial component (see \"LinkScanner concerns\" below).\n\n\n**** LinkScanner concerns ****\nWhen AVG 8.0 was first released, its LinkScanner safe search feature was shown to cause an increase in traffic on websites that appear high in search engine results pages. Since LinkScanner disguises the scans as coming from an Internet Explorer 6 browser when it prescans each site listed in the search results, website usage logs showed incorrect and overinflated site visitor statistics. The prescanning of every link in search results also caused websites to transfer more data than usual, resulting in higher bandwidth usage for web site operators and slow performance for users. AVG initially said that site administrators would be able to filter the LinkScanner traffic out of their site statistics, leaving the problem of excess bandwidth usage still to be solved. Pay-per-click advertising was not affected by the increase in traffic.\n\n\n*** AVG Online Shield ***\nAVG Online Shield is a feature designed to check files and ensure that they are safe. AVG Online Shield also ensures the safety of exchanging files via instant messengers and VoIP clients.In response to complaints, AVG announced that as of 9 July 2008 \"Search-Shield will no longer scan each search result online for new exploits, which was causing the spikes that webmasters addressed with us\", releasing a new build on that date that applies a local blacklist, then prefetches and scans only those links clicked on by the user.\n\n== Controversy ==\nAs of 2014, there are numerous reports dating back to 2012 that the AVG SafeGuard Toolbar installs itself without the consent of the user, as a side effect of installing other applications. The toolbar program appears to cause significant RAM issues and can be considered an intrusive potentially unwanted program (PUP). Once installed, the AVG toolbar is virtually impossible to remove. The toolbar uninstaller does not function, instead re-installing the add-on if manually removed. Consequently, many discussions and blog posts have described complex procedures for removal of the AVG toolbar, each with very mixed results.In September 2015, AVG announced that it would start tracking users for profit, analyzing their data for sale to the advertising industry. This measure received criticism from consumers, the press and security industry, as many users intended to use the software in order to protect themselves from spyware and would not expect the functions of spyware to be \"hidden\" in security software.In December 2015, the AVG Web TuneUp Google Chrome extension (automatically installed with AVG AntiVirus) was revealed to contain multiple critical security vulnerabilities. Most notably, Chrome users' browsing history could be exposed to any website, cookies from any site the user has visited could be read by an attacker, and trivial cross-site scripting (XSS) issues could allow any website to execute arbitrary code (as another domain).\nThe XSS vulnerability allowed a user's mail from \"mail.google.com\" to be read by any website, or financial information to be read from the user's online banking site. The AVG team fixed this by only allowing \"mysearch.avg.com\" and \"webtuneup.avg.com\" to execute these scripts. Despite this remediation, attackers could leverage any of these attacks if an XSS vulnerability was found on the AVG sites. As of April 2016, Web TuneUp was still not available for download from the AVG website.",

    "instruction": "Please answer questions about the following article about: Virtual Private LAN Service\n\n==Introduction==\nVirtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a way to provide Ethernet-based multipoint to multipoint communication over IP or MPLS networks. It allows geographically dispersed sites to share an Ethernet broadcast domain by connecting sites through pseudowires. The term sites includes multiplicities of both servers and clients. The technologies that can be used as pseudo-wire can be Ethernet over MPLS, L2TPv3 or even GRE. There are two IETF standards track RFCs (RFC 4761 and RFC 4762) describing VPLS establishment.\nVPLS is a virtual private network (VPN) technology. In contrast to L2TPv3, which allows only point-to-point layer 2 tunnels, VPLS allows any-to-any (multipoint) connectivity. \nIn a VPLS, the local area network (LAN) at each site is extended to the edge of the provider network. The provider network then emulates a switch or bridge to connect all of the customer LANs to create a single bridged LAN.\nVPLS is designed for applications that require multipoint or broadcast access.\n\n\n\n== Mesh establishment ==\nSince VPLS emulates a LAN, full mesh connectivity is required.  There are two methods for full mesh establishment for VPLS: using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).  The \"control plane\" is the means by which provider edge (PE) routers communicate for auto-discovery and signalling.  Auto-discovery refers to the process of finding other PE routers participating in the same VPN or VPLS. Signalling is the process of establishing pseudowires (PW). The PWs constitute the \"data plane\", whereby PEs send customer VPN/VPLS traffic to other PEs.\nBGP provides both auto-discovery and signalling. The mechanisms used are very similar to those used in establishing Layer-3 MPLS VPNs.  Each PE is configured to participate in a given VPLS.  The PE, through the use of BGP, simultaneously discovers all other PEs in the same VPLS, and establishes a full mesh of pseudowires to those PEs.\nWith LDP, each PE router must be configured to participate in a given VPLS, and, in addition, be given the addresses of other PEs participating in the same VPLS.  A full mesh of LDP sessions is then established between these PEs. LDP is then used to create an equivalent mesh of PWs between those PEs.\nAn advantage to using PWs as the underlying technology for the data plane is that in the event of failure, traffic will automatically be routed along available backup paths in the service provider's network. Failover will be much faster than could be achieved with e.g. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). VPLS is thus a more reliable solution for linking together Ethernet networks in different locations than simply connecting a WAN link to Ethernet switches in both locations.\nVPLS has significant advantages for both service providers and customers. Service providers benefit because they can generate additional revenues by offering a new Ethernet service with flexible bandwidth and sophisticated service level agreements (SLAs). VPLS is also simpler and more cost-effective to operate than a traditional service. Customers benefit because they can connect all of their sites to an Ethernet VPN that provides a secure, high speed and homogenous network. Moreover, VPLS provides a logical next step in the continuing evolution of Ethernet from a 10 Mbit/s shared LAN protocol to a multi-Gbps global service.\n\n== Label stack ==\nVPLS MPLS packets have a two-label stack. The outer label is used for normal MPLS forwarding in the service provider's network. If BGP is used to establish the VPLS, the inner label is allocated by a PE as part of a label block. If LDP is used, the inner label is a virtual circuit ID assigned by LDP when it first established a mesh between the participating PEs. Every PE keeps track of assigned inner label, and associates these with the VPLS instance.\n\n== Ethernet emulation ==\nPEs participating in a VPLS-based VPN must appear as an Ethernet bridge to connected customer edge (CE) devices. Received Ethernet frames must be treated in such a way as to ensure CEs can be simple Ethernet devices.\nWhen a PE receives a frame from a CE, it inspects the frame and learns the CE's MAC address, storing it locally along with LSP routing information. It then checks the frame's destination MAC address. If it is a broadcast frame, or the MAC address is not known to the PE, it floods the frame to all PEs in the mesh.\nEthernet does not have a time to live (TTL) field in its frame header, so loop avoidance must be arranged by other means. In regular Ethernet deployments, Spanning Tree Protocol is used for this. In VPLS, loop avoidance is arranged by the following rule: A PE never forwards a frame received from a PE to another PE. The use of a full mesh combined with split horizon forwarding guarantees a loop-free broadcast domain.\n\n== Scalability ==\nVPLS is typically used to link a large number of sites together. Therefore, scalability is an important issue that needs addressing.\n\n\n*** Hierarchical VPLS ***\nVPLS requires a full mesh in both the control and data planes; this can be difficult to scale.  For BGP, the control plane scaling issue has long been addressed, through the use of route reflectors (RRs).  RRs are extensively used in the context of Internet routing, as well as for several types of VPNs.  To scale the data plane for multicast and broadcast traffic, there is work in progress to use point-to-multipoint LSPs as the underlying transport.\nFor LDP, a method of subdividing a VPLS VPN into two or three tiered hierarchical networks was developed. Called hierarchical VPLS (HVPLS), it introduces a new type of MPLS device: the multi-tenant unit (MTU) switch. This switch aggregates multiple customers into a single PE, which in turn needs only one control and data plane connection into the mesh. This can significantly reduce the number of LDP sessions and LSPs, and thus unburden the core network, by concentrating customers in edge devices.\nHVPLS (LDP) may also be used to join two VPLS mesh structures together. Without using HVPLS, every node in each VPLS mesh must become meshed with all nodes in the other VPLS mesh. However, with HVPLS, the two meshes can essentially be joined together at certain locations. Techniques such as redundant pseudowires can provide resiliency in case of failures at the interconnection points.\n\n\n*** MAC addresses ***\nSince VPLS links multiple Ethernet broadcast domains together, it effectively creates a much larger broadcast domain. Since every PE must keep track of all MAC addresses and associated LSP routing information, this can potentially result in a large amount of memory being needed in every PE in the mesh.\nTo counter this problem, sites may use a router as the CE device. This hides all MAC addresses on that site behind the CE's MAC address.\nPE devices may also be equipped with content-addressable memory (CAM), similar to high-end Ethernet switches.\nAn alternative mechanism is using MAT (MAC Address Translation). However, at the time of writing this, there are no vendors providing MAT functionality.\n\n\n*** PE auto-discovery ***\nIn a VPLS-based VPN with a large number of sites, manually configuring every participating PE does not scale well. If a new PE is taken into service, every existing PE needs to have its configuration adjusted to establish an LDP session with the new PE. Standardisation work is in progress to enable auto-discovery of participating PEs. Three implementations are being worked on:\n\n\n**** LDP ****\nThe LDP method of PE auto-discovery is based on that used by the Label Distribution Protocol to distribute labels across P and PE routers within a single autonomous system. \n\n\n**** BGP ****\nThe BGP method of PE auto-discovery is based on that used by Layer-3 MPLS VPNs to distribute VPN routes among PEs participating in a VPN. The BGP4 Multi-Protocol (BGP-MP) extensions are used to distribute VPN IDs and VPN-specific reachability information. Since IBGP requires either a full mesh of BGP sessions or the use of a  route reflector, enabling the VPN ID in a participating PEs existing BGP configuration provides it with a list of all PEs in that VPN.  Note that this method is for auto-discovery alone; LDP is still used for signaling.  The method of establishing VPLS with BGP described above accomplishes both auto-discovery and signalling.\n\n\n**** RADIUS ****\nThis method requires ALL PEs to be configured with one or more RADIUS servers to use. When the first CE router in a particular VPLS VPN connects to the PE, it uses the CE's identification to request authentication from the RADIUS server. This identification may be provided by the CE or may be configured into the PE for that particular CE. In addition to a username and password, the identification string also contains a VPN name and an optional provider name.\nThe RADIUS server keeps track of all PEs that requested authentication for a particular VPN and returns a list of them to the PE requesting authentication. The PE then establishes LDP sessions to every PE in the list.\n\nHow does Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) allow geographically dispersed sites to share an Ethernet broadcast domain?Question: What are the two technologies that can be used as pseudo-wire in VPLS?Question: How does VPLS differ from L2TPv3 in terms of connectivity?Question: What is the role of the control plane in VPLS?Question: How does BGP provide auto-discovery and signalling in VPLS?Question: How does LDP provide auto-discovery and signalling in VPLS?Question: What is the advantage of using PWs as the underlying technology for the data plane in VPLS?Question: How does VPLS benefit service providers?Question: How does VPLS benefit customers?Question: What is the two-label stack in VPLS MPLS packets used for?Question: How do PEs participating in a VPLS-based VPN appear to connected customer edge (CE) devices?",

      "context": "Virtual Private LAN Service\n\n==Introduction==\nVirtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a way to provide Ethernet-based multipoint to multipoint communication over IP or MPLS networks. It allows geographically dispersed sites to share an Ethernet broadcast domain by connecting sites through pseudowires. The term sites includes multiplicities of both servers and clients. The technologies that can be used as pseudo-wire can be Ethernet over MPLS, L2TPv3 or even GRE. There are two IETF standards track RFCs (RFC 4761 and RFC 4762) describing VPLS establishment.\nVPLS is a virtual private network (VPN) technology. In contrast to L2TPv3, which allows only point-to-point layer 2 tunnels, VPLS allows any-to-any (multipoint) connectivity. \nIn a VPLS, the local area network (LAN) at each site is extended to the edge of the provider network. The provider network then emulates a switch or bridge to connect all of the customer LANs to create a single bridged LAN.\nVPLS is designed for applications that require multipoint or broadcast access.\n\n\n\n== Mesh establishment ==\nSince VPLS emulates a LAN, full mesh connectivity is required.  There are two methods for full mesh establishment for VPLS: using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).  The \"control plane\" is the means by which provider edge (PE) routers communicate for auto-discovery and signalling.  Auto-discovery refers to the process of finding other PE routers participating in the same VPN or VPLS. Signalling is the process of establishing pseudowires (PW). The PWs constitute the \"data plane\", whereby PEs send customer VPN/VPLS traffic to other PEs.\nBGP provides both auto-discovery and signalling. The mechanisms used are very similar to those used in establishing Layer-3 MPLS VPNs.  Each PE is configured to participate in a given VPLS.  The PE, through the use of BGP, simultaneously discovers all other PEs in the same VPLS, and establishes a full mesh of pseudowires to those PEs.\nWith LDP, each PE router must be configured to participate in a given VPLS, and, in addition, be given the addresses of other PEs participating in the same VPLS.  A full mesh of LDP sessions is then established between these PEs. LDP is then used to create an equivalent mesh of PWs between those PEs.\nAn advantage to using PWs as the underlying technology for the data plane is that in the event of failure, traffic will automatically be routed along available backup paths in the service provider's network. Failover will be much faster than could be achieved with e.g. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). VPLS is thus a more reliable solution for linking together Ethernet networks in different locations than simply connecting a WAN link to Ethernet switches in both locations.\nVPLS has significant advantages for both service providers and customers. Service providers benefit because they can generate additional revenues by offering a new Ethernet service with flexible bandwidth and sophisticated service level agreements (SLAs). VPLS is also simpler and more cost-effective to operate than a traditional service. Customers benefit because they can connect all of their sites to an Ethernet VPN that provides a secure, high speed and homogenous network. Moreover, VPLS provides a logical next step in the continuing evolution of Ethernet from a 10 Mbit/s shared LAN protocol to a multi-Gbps global service.\n\n== Label stack ==\nVPLS MPLS packets have a two-label stack. The outer label is used for normal MPLS forwarding in the service provider's network. If BGP is used to establish the VPLS, the inner label is allocated by a PE as part of a label block. If LDP is used, the inner label is a virtual circuit ID assigned by LDP when it first established a mesh between the participating PEs. Every PE keeps track of assigned inner label, and associates these with the VPLS instance.\n\n== Ethernet emulation ==\nPEs participating in a VPLS-based VPN must appear as an Ethernet bridge to connected customer edge (CE) devices. Received Ethernet frames must be treated in such a way as to ensure CEs can be simple Ethernet devices.\nWhen a PE receives a frame from a CE, it inspects the frame and learns the CE's MAC address, storing it locally along with LSP routing information. It then checks the frame's destination MAC address. If it is a broadcast frame, or the MAC address is not known to the PE, it floods the frame to all PEs in the mesh.\nEthernet does not have a time to live (TTL) field in its frame header, so loop avoidance must be arranged by other means. In regular Ethernet deployments, Spanning Tree Protocol is used for this. In VPLS, loop avoidance is arranged by the following rule: A PE never forwards a frame received from a PE to another PE. The use of a full mesh combined with split horizon forwarding guarantees a loop-free broadcast domain.\n\n== Scalability ==\nVPLS is typically used to link a large number of sites together. Therefore, scalability is an important issue that needs addressing.\n\n\n*** Hierarchical VPLS ***\nVPLS requires a full mesh in both the control and data planes; this can be difficult to scale.  For BGP, the control plane scaling issue has long been addressed, through the use of route reflectors (RRs).  RRs are extensively used in the context of Internet routing, as well as for several types of VPNs.  To scale the data plane for multicast and broadcast traffic, there is work in progress to use point-to-multipoint LSPs as the underlying transport.\nFor LDP, a method of subdividing a VPLS VPN into two or three tiered hierarchical networks was developed. Called hierarchical VPLS (HVPLS), it introduces a new type of MPLS device: the multi-tenant unit (MTU) switch. This switch aggregates multiple customers into a single PE, which in turn needs only one control and data plane connection into the mesh. This can significantly reduce the number of LDP sessions and LSPs, and thus unburden the core network, by concentrating customers in edge devices.\nHVPLS (LDP) may also be used to join two VPLS mesh structures together. Without using HVPLS, every node in each VPLS mesh must become meshed with all nodes in the other VPLS mesh. However, with HVPLS, the two meshes can essentially be joined together at certain locations. Techniques such as redundant pseudowires can provide resiliency in case of failures at the interconnection points.\n\n\n*** MAC addresses ***\nSince VPLS links multiple Ethernet broadcast domains together, it effectively creates a much larger broadcast domain. Since every PE must keep track of all MAC addresses and associated LSP routing information, this can potentially result in a large amount of memory being needed in every PE in the mesh.\nTo counter this problem, sites may use a router as the CE device. This hides all MAC addresses on that site behind the CE's MAC address.\nPE devices may also be equipped with content-addressable memory (CAM), similar to high-end Ethernet switches.\nAn alternative mechanism is using MAT (MAC Address Translation). However, at the time of writing this, there are no vendors providing MAT functionality.\n\n\n*** PE auto-discovery ***\nIn a VPLS-based VPN with a large number of sites, manually configuring every participating PE does not scale well. If a new PE is taken into service, every existing PE needs to have its configuration adjusted to establish an LDP session with the new PE. Standardisation work is in progress to enable auto-discovery of participating PEs. Three implementations are being worked on:\n\n\n**** LDP ****\nThe LDP method of PE auto-discovery is based on that used by the Label Distribution Protocol to distribute labels across P and PE routers within a single autonomous system. \n\n\n**** BGP ****\nThe BGP method of PE auto-discovery is based on that used by Layer-3 MPLS VPNs to distribute VPN routes among PEs participating in a VPN. The BGP4 Multi-Protocol (BGP-MP) extensions are used to distribute VPN IDs and VPN-specific reachability information. Since IBGP requires either a full mesh of BGP sessions or the use of a  route reflector, enabling the VPN ID in a participating PEs existing BGP configuration provides it with a list of all PEs in that VPN.  Note that this method is for auto-discovery alone; LDP is still used for signaling.  The method of establishing VPLS with BGP described above accomplishes both auto-discovery and signalling.\n\n\n**** RADIUS ****\nThis method requires ALL PEs to be configured with one or more RADIUS servers to use. When the first CE router in a particular VPLS VPN connects to the PE, it uses the CE's identification to request authentication from the RADIUS server. This identification may be provided by the CE or may be configured into the PE for that particular CE. In addition to a username and password, the identification string also contains a VPN name and an optional provider name.\nThe RADIUS server keeps track of all PEs that requested authentication for a particular VPN and returns a list of them to the PE requesting authentication. The PE then establishes LDP sessions to every PE in the list.",
