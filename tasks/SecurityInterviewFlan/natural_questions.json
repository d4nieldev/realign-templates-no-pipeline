      "answer": "A botnet, also called a robot network, is a malware that infects networks of computers and gets them under the control of a single attacker who is called a \u2018bot herder.\u2019 A bot is an individual machine that is under the control of bot herders. The attacker acts as a central party who can command every bot to perform simultaneous and coordinated criminal actions.\nA botnet is usually always responsible for large-scale attacks since a bot herder can control millions of bots at a time. All the bot can receive updates from the attacker to change their behavior in no time."

Link and end-to-end encryption are the two main ways of encryption placement.\nEnd-to-end encryption, or E2EE, is a secure data transfer system in which data is encrypted and decrypted only at the endpoints, regardless of how many points it passes through in the middle of its virtual journey. This sort of encryption is an excellent technique to communicate in a secure and confidential manner. Because no one else has the key to decode it, no one in the middle will be able to read it.\nThe primary difference between link encryption and end-to-end encryption is that link encryption encrypts and decrypts all traffic at all points, not just at the endpoints. All data is encrypted as it travels along the communication line with this approach. When it reaches a router or another intermediary device, however, it is decrypted so that the intermediator can determine which direction to send it next.",

Monitoring IP addresses allows you to see where potential hackers for a brute force attack are coming from. It also indicates suspicious activity. This step is important for businesses whose employees work remotely.\n\n4)  Use two-factor authentication: You'll notice that many social media apps are beginning to rely on this add-security method.
