Link and end-to-end encryption are the two main ways of encryption placement.\nEnd-to-end encryption, or E2EE, is a secure data transfer system in which data is encrypted and decrypted only at the endpoints, regardless of how many points it passes through in the middle of its virtual journey. This sort of encryption is an excellent technique to communicate in a secure and confidential manner. Because no one else has the key to decode it, no one in the middle will be able to read it.\nThe primary difference between link encryption and end-to-end encryption is that link encryption encrypts and decrypts all traffic at all points, not just at the endpoints. All data is encrypted as it travels along the communication line with this approach. When it reaches a router or another intermediary device, however, it is decrypted so that the intermediator can determine which direction to send it next."

      "output": "A: The MAC address is virtually etched to the hardware by the device manufacturer, which means users cannot change or rewrite the MAC address. However, it's possible to mask the address on the software side. This masking is called MAC spoofing.\nHackers use MAC spoofing to hide their identity and imitate others. In network terminology, spoofing is manipulating or infiltrating the address system in computer networks. Other targets that hackers can spoof or manipulate are internet protocol (IP), address resolution protocol (ARP), and the domain name system (DNS).",
