This vulnerability allows an Adversary in the Middle (AiTM) to exploit the system.\n\nThe Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) application cbot\\_panel (by cbot) version \\* describes the \"cbot\\_panel\" application, which is an application released by \"cbot.\"\n\nBased on the information provided, the CPE application cbot\\_panel (by cbot) version \\* could be affected by the CVE-2023-2885 vulnerability if it is running a version of the CBOT Chatbot before Core: v4.0.3.4 and Panel: v4.0.3.7.
