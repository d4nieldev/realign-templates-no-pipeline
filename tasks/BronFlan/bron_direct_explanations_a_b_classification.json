The knowledge of local system permission groups can help adversaries determine which groups exist and which users belong to a particular group. Adversaries may use this information to determine which users have elevated permissions, such as the users found within the local administrators group. Commands such as <code>net localgroup</code> of the Net utility, <code>dscl . -list /Groups</code> on macOS, and <code>groups</code> on Linux can list local groups.\n\nmalware Flagpro (S0696) -\nFlagpro is a Windows-based, first-stage downloader that has been used by BlackTech since at least October 2020. It has primarily been used against defense, media, and communications companies in Japan.(Citations: NTT Security Flagpro new December 2021)\n\nA.  Explanation why Local Groups (T1069.001) is related to {dst_node}:\nA\n\nB.  Explanation why Local Groups (T1069.001) is not related to malware Flagpro (S0696) -\nThe malicious software Flagpro (S0696) is not using the MITRE ATT&CK sub-technique Local Groups (T1069.001) because Flagpro is a Windows-based downloader that is used to download and install additional malware, while the Local Groups technique involves querying the system for information about local groups and their members. The Flagpro malware is designed to establish a foothold in a target network and download additional malicious payloads, and there is no need for it to query local groups or permissions to achieve this goal. Therefore, the functionalities and objectives of Flagpro and the Local Groups technique are distinct and unrelated to each other.",
