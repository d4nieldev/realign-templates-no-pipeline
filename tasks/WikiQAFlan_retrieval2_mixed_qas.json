    "instruction": "context: Resource Public Key Infrastructure\n\n==Introduction==\nResource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), also known as Resource Certification, is a specialized public key infrastructure (PKI) framework to support improved security for the Internet's BGP routing infrastructure.\nRPKI provides a way to connect Internet number resource information (such as Autonomous System numbers and IP addresses) to a trust anchor. The certificate structure mirrors the way in which Internet number resources are distributed. That is, resources are initially distributed by the IANA to the regional Internet registries (RIRs), who in turn distribute them to local Internet registries (LIRs), who then distribute the resources to their customers. RPKI can be used by the legitimate holders of the resources to control the operation of Internet routing protocols to prevent route hijacking and other attacks. In particular, RPKI is used to secure the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) through BGP Route Origin Validation (ROV), as well as Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ND) for IPv6 through the Secure Neighbor Discovery protocol (SEND).\nThe RPKI architecture is documented in RFC 6480.  The RPKI specification is documented in a spread out series of RFCs: RFC 6481, RFC 6482, RFC 6483, RFC 6484, RFC 6485, RFC 6486, RFC 6487, RFC 6488, RFC 6489, RFC 6490, RFC 6491, RFC 6492, and RFC 6493. SEND is documented in RFC 6494 and RFC 6495.  These RFCs are a product of the IETF's SIDR (\"Secure Inter-Domain Routing\") working group, and are based on a threat analysis which was documented in RFC 4593. These standards cover BGP origin validation, while path validation is provided by BGPsec, which has been standardized separately in RFC 8205. Several implementations for prefix origin validation already exist.\n\n\n\n== Resource Certificates and child objects ==\nRPKI uses X.509 PKI certificates (RFC 5280) with extensions for IP addresses and AS identifiers (RFC 3779). It allows the members of regional Internet registries, known as local Internet registries (LIRs), to obtain a resource certificate listing the Internet number resources they hold. This offers them validatable proof of holdership, though the certificate does not contain identity information. Using the resource certificate, LIRs can create cryptographic attestations about the route announcements they authorise to be made with the prefixes they hold. These attestations, called Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs), are described below.\n\n\n*** Route Origin Authorizations ***\nA Route Origin Authorization (ROA) states which autonomous system (AS) is authorised to originate certain IP prefixes. In addition, it can determine the maximum length of the prefix that the AS is authorised to advertise.\n\n\n**** Maximum prefix length ****\nThe maximum prefix length is an optional field. When not defined, the AS is only authorised to advertise exactly the prefix specified. Any more specific announcement of the prefix will be considered invalid. This is a way to enforce aggregation and prevent hijacking through the announcement of a more specific prefix.\nWhen present, this specifies the length of the most specific IP prefix that the AS is authorised to advertise. For example, if the IP address prefix is 10.0.0.0/16 and the maximum length is 22, the AS is authorised to advertise any prefix under 10.0.0.0/16, as long as it is no more specific than /22. So, in this example, the AS would be authorised to advertise 10.0.0.0/16, 10.0.128.0/20 or 10.0.252.0/22, but not 10.0.255.0/24.\n\n\n**** RPKI route announcement validity ****\nWhen a ROA is created for a certain combination of origin AS and prefix, this will have an effect on the RPKI validity of one or more route announcements. They can be:\n\nVALID\nThe route announcement is covered by at least one ROA\nINVALID\nThe prefix is announced from an unauthorised AS. This means:\nThere is a ROA for this prefix for another AS, but no ROA authorising this AS; or\nThis could be a hijacking attempt\nThe announcement is more specific than is allowed by the maximum length set in a ROA that matches the prefix and AS\nUNKNOWN\nThe prefix in this announcement is not covered (or only partially covered) by an existing ROANote that invalid BGP updates may also be due to incorrectly configured ROAs.\n\n== Management ==\nThere are open source tools available to run the certificate authority and manage the resource certificate and child objects such as ROAs. In addition, the RIRs have a hosted RPKI platform available in their member portals. This allows LIRs to choose to rely on a hosted system, or run their own software.\n\n== Publication ==\nThe system does not use a single repository publication point to publish RPKI objects. Instead, the RPKI repository system consists of multiple distributed and delegated repository publication points. Each repository publication point is associated with one or more RPKI certificates' publication points. In practice this means that when running a certificate authority, an LIR can either publish all cryptographic material themselves, or they can rely on a third party for publication. When an LIR chooses to use the hosted system provided by the RIR, in principle publication is done in the RIR repository.\n\n== Validation ==\nRelying party software will fetch, cache, and validate repository data using rsync or the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RFC 8182).  It is important for a relying party to regularly synchronize with all the publication points to maintain a complete and timely view of repository data.  Incomplete or stale data can lead to erroneous routing decisions.\n\n== Routing decisions ==\nAfter validation of ROAs, the attestations can be compared to BGP routing and aid network operators in their decision making process. This can be done manually, but the validated prefix origin data can also be sent to a supported router using the RPKI to Router Protocol (RFC 6810), Cisco Systems offers native support on many platforms for fetching the RPKI data set and using it in the router configuration. Juniper offers support on all platforms that run version 12.2 or newer. Quagga obtains this functionality through BGP Secure Routing Extensions (BGP-SRx) or a RPKI implementation fully RFC-compliant based on RTRlib. The RTRlib provides an open source C implementation of the RTR protocol and prefix origin verification. The library is useful for developers of routing software but also for network operators. Developers can integrate the RTRlib into the BGP daemon to extend their implementation towards RPKI. Network operators may use the RTRlib to develop monitoring tools (e.g., to check the proper operation of caches or to evaluate their performance).\nRFC 6494 updates the certificate validation method of the Secure Neighbor Discovery protocol (SEND) security mechanisms for Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ND) to use RPKI for use in IPv6. It defines a SEND certificate profile utilizing a modified RFC 6487 RPKI certificate profile which must include a single RFC 3779 IP address delegation extension.\nNow I will ask you some questions, and you will answer.\n\n",

In computer security, a hash chain is a method to produce many one-time keys from a single key or password.  For non-repudiation a hash function can be applied successively to additional pieces of data in order to record the chronology of data's existence.\n\n== Definition ==\nA hash chain is a successive application of a cryptographic hash function \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h}\n   to a string \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  .\nFor example,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        h\n        (\n        h\n        (\n        h\n        (\n        h\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h(h(h(h(x))))}\n  \ngives a hash chain of length 4, often denoted \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          h\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h^{4}(x)}\n\n== Applications ==\n\nLeslie Lamport suggested the use of hash chains as a password protection scheme in an insecure environment. A server which needs to provide authentication may store a hash chain rather than a plain text password and prevent theft of the password in transmission or theft from the server. For example, a server begins by storing \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          h\n          \n            1000\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          p\n          a\n          s\n          s\n          w\n          o\n          r\n          d\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h^{1000}(\\mathrm {password} )}\n   which is provided by the user. When the user wishes to authenticate, they supply \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          h\n          \n            999\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          p\n          a\n          s\n          s\n          w\n          o\n          r\n          d\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h^{999}(\\mathrm {password} )}\n   to the server. The server computes \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n        (\n        \n          h\n          \n            999\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          p\n          a\n          s\n          s\n          w\n          o\n          r\n          d\n        \n        )\n        )\n\n== Binary hash chains ==\n\nBinary hash chains are commonly used in association with a hash tree. A binary hash chain takes two hash values as inputs, concatenates them and applies a hash function to the result, thereby producing a third hash value.\n\nThe above diagram shows a hash tree consisting of eight leaf nodes and the hash chain for the third leaf node.

    "instruction": "context: Trusted system\n\n==Introduction==\nIn the security engineering subspecialty of computer science, a trusted system is one that is relied upon to a specified extent to enforce a specified security policy. This is equivalent to saying that a trusted system is one whose failure would break a security policy (if a policy exists that the system is trusted to enforce).\nThe word \"trust\" is critical, as it does not carry the meaning that might be expected in everyday usage. A trusted system is one that the user feels safe to use, and trusts to perform tasks without secretly executing harmful or unauthorized programs; trusted computing refers to whether programs can trust the platform to be unmodified from the expected, and whether or not those programs are innocent or malicious or whether they execute tasks that are undesired by the user.\nA trusted system can also be seen as a level-based security system where protection is provided and handled according to different levels. This is commonly found in the military, where information is categorized as unclassified (U), confidential (C), secret (S), top secret (TS), and beyond. These also enforce the policies of no read-up and no write-down.\n\n\n\n== Trusted systems in classified information ==\nA subset of trusted systems (\"Division B\" and \"Division A\") implement mandatory access control (MAC) labels, and as such, it is often assumed that they can be used for processing classified information. However, this is generally untrue. There are four modes in which one can operate a multilevel secure system: multilevel, compartmented, dedicated, and system-high modes. The National Computer Security Center's \"Yellow Book\" specifies that B3 and A1 systems can only be used for processing a strict subset of security labels, and only when operated according to a particularly strict configuration.\nCentral to the concept of U.S. Department of Defense-style trusted systems is the notion of a \"reference monitor\", which is an entity that occupies the logical heart of the system and is responsible for all access control decisions. Ideally, the reference monitor is\n\ntamper-proof\nalways invoked\nsmall enough to be subject to independent testing, the completeness of which can be assured.According to the U.S. National Security Agency's 1983 Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), or \"Orange Book\", a set of \"evaluation classes\" were defined that described the features and assurances that the user could expect from a trusted system.\nThe dedication of significant system engineering toward minimizing the complexity (not size, as often cited) of the trusted computing base (TCB) is key to the provision of the highest levels of assurance (B3 and A1). This is defined as that combination of hardware, software, and firmware that is responsible for enforcing the system's security policy. An inherent engineering conflict would appear to arise in higher-assurance systems in that, the smaller the TCB, the larger the set of hardware, software, and firmware that lies outside the TCB and is, therefore, untrusted.  Although this may lead the more technically naive to sophists' arguments about the nature of trust, the argument confuses the issue of \"correctness\" with that of \"trustworthiness\".\nTCSEC has a precisely defined hierarchy of six evaluation classes; the highest of these, A1, is featurally identical to B3\u2014differing only in documentation standards. In contrast, the more recently introduced Common Criteria (CC), which derive from a blend of technically mature standards from various NATO countries, provide a tenuous spectrum of seven \"evaluation classes\" that intermix features and assurances in a non-hierarchical manner, and lack the precision and mathematical stricture of the TCSEC. In particular, the CC tolerate very loose identification of the \"target of evaluation\" (TOE) and support \u2013 even encourage \u2013 an inter-mixture of security requirements culled from a variety of predefined \"protection profiles.\" While a case can be made that even the seemingly arbitrary components of the TCSEC contribute to a \"chain of evidence\" that a fielded system properly enforces its advertised security policy, not even the highest (E7) level of the CC can truly provide analogous consistency and stricture of evidentiary reasoning.The mathematical notions of trusted systems for the protection of classified information derive from two independent but interrelated corpora of work. In 1974, David Bell and Leonard LaPadula of MITRE, under the technical guidance and financial sponsorship of Maj. Roger Schell, Ph.D., of the U.S. Army Electronic Systems Command (Fort Hanscom, MA), devised the Bell\u2013LaPadula model, in which a trustworthy computer system is modeled in terms of objects (passive repositories or destinations for data such as files, disks, or printers) and subjects (active entities that cause information to flow among objects e.g. users, or system processes or threads operating on behalf of users). The entire operation of a computer system can indeed be regarded as a \"history\" (in the serializability-theoretic sense) of pieces of information flowing from object to object in response to subjects' requests for such flows. At the same time, Dorothy Denning at Purdue University was publishing her Ph.D. dissertation, which dealt with \"lattice-based information flows\" in computer systems. (A mathematical \"lattice\" is a partially ordered set, characterizable as a directed acyclic graph, in which the relationship between any two vertices either \"dominates\", \"is dominated by,\" or neither.) She defined a generalized notion of \"labels\" that are attached to entities\u2014corresponding more or less to the full security markings one encounters on classified military documents, e.g. TOP SECRET WNINTEL TK DUMBO.  Bell and LaPadula integrated Denning's concept into their landmark MITRE technical report\u2014entitled, Secure Computer System: Unified Exposition and Multics Interpretation. They stated that labels attached to objects represent the sensitivity of data contained within the object, while those attached to subjects represent the trustworthiness of the user executing the subject. (However, there can be a subtle semantic difference between the sensitivity of the data within the object and the sensitivity of the object itself.) \nThe concepts are unified with two properties, the \"simple security property\" (a subject can only read from an object that it dominates [is greater than is a close, albeit mathematically imprecise, interpretation]) and the \"confinement property,\" or \"*-property\" (a subject can only write to an object that dominates it). (These properties are loosely referred to as \"no read-up\" and \"no write-down,\" respectively.) Jointly enforced, these properties ensure that information cannot flow \"downhill\" to a repository where insufficiently trustworthy recipients may discover it. By extension, assuming that the labels assigned to subjects are truly representative of their trustworthiness, then the no read-up and no write-down rules rigidly enforced by the reference monitor are sufficient to constrain Trojan horses, one of the most general classes of attacks (sciz., the popularly reported worms and viruses are specializations of the Trojan horse concept).\nThe Bell\u2013LaPadula model technically only enforces \"confidentiality\" or \"secrecy\" controls, i.e. they address the problem of the sensitivity of objects and attendant trustworthiness of subjects to not inappropriately disclose it. The dual problem of \"integrity\" (i.e. the problem of accuracy, or even provenance of objects) and attendant trustworthiness of subjects to not inappropriately modify or destroy it, is addressed by mathematically affine models; the most important of which is named for its creator, K. J. Biba. Other integrity models include the Clark-Wilson model and Shockley and Schell's program integrity model, \"The SeaView Model\"An important feature of MACs, is that they are entirely beyond the control of any user. The TCB automatically attaches labels to any subjects executed on behalf of users and files they access or modify. In contrast, an additional class of controls, termed discretionary access controls(DACs), are under the direct control of system users. Familiar protection mechanisms such as permission bits (supported by UNIX since the late 1960s and \u2013 in a more flexible and powerful form \u2013 by Multics since earlier still) and access control list (ACLs) are familiar examples of DACs.\nThe behavior of a trusted system is often characterized in terms of a mathematical model. This may be rigorous depending upon applicable operational and administrative constraints. These take the form of a finite state machine (FSM) with state criteria, state transition constraints (a set of \"operations\" that correspond to state transitions), and a descriptive top-level specification, DTLS (entails a user-perceptible interface such as an API, a set of system calls in UNIX or system exits in mainframes). Each element of the aforementioned engenders one or more model operations.\n\n== Trusted systems in trusted computing ==\nThe Trusted Computing Group creates specifications that are meant to address particular requirements of trusted systems, including attestation of configuration and safe storage of sensitive information.\n\n== Trusted systems in policy analysis ==\nIn the context of national or homeland security, law enforcement, or social control policy, trusted systems provide conditional prediction about the behavior of people or objects prior to authorizing access to system resources. For example, trusted systems include the use of \"security envelopes\" in national security and counterterrorism applications, \"trusted computing\" initiatives in technical systems security, and  credit or identity scoring systems in financial and anti-fraud applications. In general, they include any system in which\n\nprobabilistic threat or risk analysis is used to assess \"trust\" for decision-making before authorizing access or for allocating resources against likely threats (including their use in the design of systems constraints to control behavior within the system); or\ndeviation analysis or systems surveillance is used to ensure that behavior within systems complies with expected or authorized parameters.The widespread adoption of these authorization-based security strategies (where the default state is DEFAULT\n\n== Trusted systems in information theory ==\nTrusted systems in the context of information theory are based on the following definition:\n\n\"Trust is that which is essential to a communication channel but cannot be transferred from a source to a destination using that channel\" \nIn information theory, information has nothing to do with knowledge or meaning; it is simply that which is transferred from source to destination, using a communication channel. If, before transmission, the information is available at the destination, then the transfer is zero.

      "context": "Trusted system\n\n==Introduction==\nIn the security engineering subspecialty of computer science, a trusted system is one that is relied upon to a specified extent to enforce a specified security policy. This is equivalent to saying that a trusted system is one whose failure would break a security policy (if a policy exists that the system is trusted to enforce).\nThe word \"trust\" is critical, as it does not carry the meaning that might be expected in everyday usage. A trusted system is one that the user feels safe to use, and trusts to perform tasks without secretly executing harmful or unauthorized programs; trusted computing refers to whether programs can trust the platform to be unmodified from the expected, and whether or not those programs are innocent or malicious or whether they execute tasks that are undesired by the user.\nA trusted system can also be seen as a level-based security system where protection is provided and handled according to different levels. This is commonly found in the military, where information is categorized as unclassified (U), confidential (C), secret (S), top secret (TS), and beyond. These also enforce the policies of no read-up and no write-down.\n\n\n\n== Trusted systems in classified information ==\nA subset of trusted systems (\"Division B\" and \"Division A\") implement mandatory access control (MAC) labels, and as such, it is often assumed that they can be used for processing classified information. However, this is generally untrue. There are four modes in which one can operate a multilevel secure system: multilevel, compartmented, dedicated, and system-high modes. The National Computer Security Center's \"Yellow Book\" specifies that B3 and A1 systems can only be used for processing a strict subset of security labels, and only when operated according to a particularly strict configuration.\nCentral to the concept of U.S. Department of Defense-style trusted systems is the notion of a \"reference monitor\", which is an entity that occupies the logical heart of the system and is responsible for all access control decisions. Ideally, the reference monitor is\n\ntamper-proof\nalways invoked\nsmall enough to be subject to independent testing, the completeness of which can be assured.According to the U.S. National Security Agency's 1983 Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC), or \"Orange Book\", a set of \"evaluation classes\" were defined that described the features and assurances that the user could expect from a trusted system.\nThe dedication of significant system engineering toward minimizing the complexity (not size, as often cited) of the trusted computing base (TCB) is key to the provision of the highest levels of assurance (B3 and A1). This is defined as that combination of hardware, software, and firmware that is responsible for enforcing the system's security policy. An inherent engineering conflict would appear to arise in higher-assurance systems in that, the smaller the TCB, the larger the set of hardware, software, and firmware that lies outside the TCB and is, therefore, untrusted.  Although this may lead the more technically naive to sophists' arguments about the nature of trust, the argument confuses the issue of \"correctness\" with that of \"trustworthiness\".\nTCSEC has a precisely defined hierarchy of six evaluation classes; the highest of these, A1, is featurally identical to B3\u2014differing only in documentation standards. In contrast, the more recently introduced Common Criteria (CC), which derive from a blend of technically mature standards from various NATO countries, provide a tenuous spectrum of seven \"evaluation classes\" that intermix features and assurances in a non-hierarchical manner, and lack the precision and mathematical stricture of the TCSEC. In particular, the CC tolerate very loose identification of the \"target of evaluation\" (TOE) and support \u2013 even encourage \u2013 an inter-mixture of security requirements culled from a variety of predefined \"protection profiles.\" While a case can be made that even the seemingly arbitrary components of the TCSEC contribute to a \"chain of evidence\" that a fielded system properly enforces its advertised security policy, not even the highest (E7) level of the CC can truly provide analogous consistency and stricture of evidentiary reasoning.The mathematical notions of trusted systems for the protection of classified information derive from two independent but interrelated corpora of work. In 1974, David Bell and Leonard LaPadula of MITRE, under the technical guidance and financial sponsorship of Maj. Roger Schell, Ph.D., of the U.S. Army Electronic Systems Command (Fort Hanscom, MA), devised the Bell\u2013LaPadula model, in which a trustworthy computer system is modeled in terms of objects (passive repositories or destinations for data such as files, disks, or printers) and subjects (active entities that cause information to flow among objects e.g. users, or system processes or threads operating on behalf of users). The entire operation of a computer system can indeed be regarded as a \"history\" (in the serializability-theoretic sense) of pieces of information flowing from object to object in response to subjects' requests for such flows. At the same time, Dorothy Denning at Purdue University was publishing her Ph.D. dissertation, which dealt with \"lattice-based information flows\" in computer systems. (A mathematical \"lattice\" is a partially ordered set, characterizable as a directed acyclic graph, in which the relationship between any two vertices either \"dominates\", \"is dominated by,\" or neither.) She defined a generalized notion of \"labels\" that are attached to entities\u2014corresponding more or less to the full security markings one encounters on classified military documents, e.g. TOP SECRET WNINTEL TK DUMBO.  Bell and LaPadula integrated Denning's concept into their landmark MITRE technical report\u2014entitled, Secure Computer System: Unified Exposition and Multics Interpretation. They stated that labels attached to objects represent the sensitivity of data contained within the object, while those attached to subjects represent the trustworthiness of the user executing the subject. (However, there can be a subtle semantic difference between the sensitivity of the data within the object and the sensitivity of the object itself.) \nThe concepts are unified with two properties, the \"simple security property\" (a subject can only read from an object that it dominates [is greater than is a close, albeit mathematically imprecise, interpretation]) and the \"confinement property,\" or \"*-property\" (a subject can only write to an object that dominates it). (These properties are loosely referred to as \"no read-up\" and \"no write-down,\" respectively.) Jointly enforced, these properties ensure that information cannot flow \"downhill\" to a repository where insufficiently trustworthy recipients may discover it. By extension, assuming that the labels assigned to subjects are truly representative of their trustworthiness, then the no read-up and no write-down rules rigidly enforced by the reference monitor are sufficient to constrain Trojan horses, one of the most general classes of attacks (sciz., the popularly reported worms and viruses are specializations of the Trojan horse concept).\nThe Bell\u2013LaPadula model technically only enforces \"confidentiality\" or \"secrecy\" controls, i.e. they address the problem of the sensitivity of objects and attendant trustworthiness of subjects to not inappropriately disclose it. The dual problem of \"integrity\" (i.e. the problem of accuracy, or even provenance of objects) and attendant trustworthiness of subjects to not inappropriately modify or destroy it, is addressed by mathematically affine models; the most important of which is named for its creator, K. J. Biba. Other integrity models include the Clark-Wilson model and Shockley and Schell's program integrity model, \"The SeaView Model\"An important feature of MACs, is that they are entirely beyond the control of any user. The TCB automatically attaches labels to any subjects executed on behalf of users and files they access or modify. In contrast, an additional class of controls, termed discretionary access controls(DACs), are under the direct control of system users. Familiar protection mechanisms such as permission bits (supported by UNIX since the late 1960s and \u2013 in a more flexible and powerful form \u2013 by Multics since earlier still) and access control list (ACLs) are familiar examples of DACs.\nThe behavior of a trusted system is often characterized in terms of a mathematical model. This may be rigorous depending upon applicable operational and administrative constraints. These take the form of a finite state machine (FSM) with state criteria, state transition constraints (a set of \"operations\" that correspond to state transitions), and a descriptive top-level specification, DTLS (entails a user-perceptible interface such as an API, a set of system calls in UNIX or system exits in mainframes). Each element of the aforementioned engenders one or more model operations.\n\n== Trusted systems in trusted computing ==\nThe Trusted Computing Group creates specifications that are meant to address particular requirements of trusted systems, including attestation of configuration and safe storage of sensitive information.\n\n== Trusted systems in policy analysis ==\nIn the context of national or homeland security, law enforcement, or social control policy, trusted systems provide conditional prediction about the behavior of people or objects prior to authorizing access to system resources. For example, trusted systems include the use of \"security envelopes\" in national security and counterterrorism applications, \"trusted computing\" initiatives in technical systems security, and  credit or identity scoring systems in financial and anti-fraud applications. In general, they include any system in which\n\nprobabilistic threat or risk analysis is used to assess \"trust\" for decision-making before authorizing access or for allocating resources against likely threats (including their use in the design of systems constraints to control behavior within the system); or\ndeviation analysis or systems surveillance is used to ensure that behavior within systems complies with expected or authorized parameters.The widespread adoption of these authorization-based security strategies (where the default state is DEFAULT\n\n== Trusted systems in information theory ==\nTrusted systems in the context of information theory are based on the following definition:\n\n\"Trust is that which is essential to a communication channel but cannot be transferred from a source to a destination using that channel\" \nIn information theory, information has nothing to do with knowledge or meaning; it is simply that which is transferred from source to destination, using a communication channel. If, before transmission, the information is available at the destination, then the transfer is zero. Information received by a party is that which the party does not expect\u2014as measured by the uncertainty of the party as to what the message will be.\nLikewise, trust as defined by Gerck, has nothing to do with friendship, acquaintances, employee-employer relationships, loyalty, betrayal and other overly-variable concepts.

    "instruction": "context: Operation Ababil\n\n==Introduction==\nOperation Ababil was a series of cyber attacks starting in 2012, targeting various American financial institutions and carried out by a group calling itself the \"Cyber fighters of Izz Ad-Din Al Qassam\".\n\n\n\n== Details ==\nThe cyber attacks, or more specifically denial of service attacks, were launched by the Cyber fighters of Izz Ad-Din Al Qassam also known as Qassam Cyber Fighters.  The group announced the attacks on September 18, 2012 on Pastebin where they criticized Israel and the United States and justified the attacks as a response to the Innocence of Muslims video released by controversial American pastor Terry Jones. Their targets included the New York Stock Exchange as well as a number of banks including J.P. Morgan Chase. The result of the attacks was a limited disruption of the targeted websites. The attacks ended on Oct 23, 2012 because of the Eid al-Adha holiday at which point they offered to speak to the media through e-mail.\n\n== Name of the group and operation ==\nThe group\u2019s moniker, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, was a Muslim preacher who lead in the fight against British, French and Jewish nationalist organizations in the Levant in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\n== Disputed origins of attacks ==\nOn September 21, 2012, the Washington Post reported that the attacks originated not from a hacktivist group but from the government of Iran and cited U.S. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as one who was a proponent of this idea. Lieberman told C-Span that he believed the Iranian government was sponsoring the group's attacks on US banks in retaliation for Western economic sanctions. An early report by Dancho Danchev found the amateurish \"outdated and virtually irrelevant technical skills\" of the attack suspicious.  But Michael Smith, senior security evangelist at Akamai, found the size of the attacks\u201465 gigabits of traffic per second\u2014more consistent with a state actor (such as Iran) than with a typical hacktivist denial of service attack which would be less than 2 gigabits/second.The controversial hacktivist, The Jester, claimed the Qassam Cyber Fighters had help with their attacks from the hacking group Anonymous.\n\n== Phase two ==\nOn December 10, 2012, the Qassam Cyber Fighters announced the launching of phase two of Operation Ababil. In that statement, they specifically named U.S. Bancorp, J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, PNC Financial Services and SunTrust Bank as targets and identified events such as Hurricane Sandy and the 2012 US Presidential Election as reasons for the delay of phase two. This announcement also mentioned disrespect towards the Prophet Mohammed as motivation and denied the involvement of any nation state. It was during this time that media attention increased with one journalist observing, \"Operation Ababil stands out for its sophistication and focus, experts say.\" and allegations of involvement by Iran also increased. On January 29, 2013, an announcement was made that phase two would come to a conclusion due to the removal of the main copy of the video from YouTube. The announcement also identified additional copies of the movie also hosted on YouTube.\n\n== Phase three ==\nOn February 12, 2013, the Qassam Cyber Fighters issued a warning that the other copies of the movie referenced in their January 29 posting should be removed. They followed this with a \"serious warning\" and then an \"ultimatum\" after the additional copies of the video were not removed. On March 5, 2013, they announced  the beginning of Phase 3 of Operation Ababil on their Pastebin page. This was followed by several of the financial institutions on their target list reporting website disruptions.\nNow I will ask you some questions, and you will answer.\n\n",

      "context": "Operation Ababil\n\n==Introduction==\nOperation Ababil was a series of cyber attacks starting in 2012, targeting various American financial institutions and carried out by a group calling itself the \"Cyber fighters of Izz Ad-Din Al Qassam\".\n\n\n\n== Details ==\nThe cyber attacks, or more specifically denial of service attacks, were launched by the Cyber fighters of Izz Ad-Din Al Qassam also known as Qassam Cyber Fighters.  The group announced the attacks on September 18, 2012 on Pastebin where they criticized Israel and the United States and justified the attacks as a response to the Innocence of Muslims video released by controversial American pastor Terry Jones. Their targets included the New York Stock Exchange as well as a number of banks including J.P. Morgan Chase. The result of the attacks was a limited disruption of the targeted websites. The attacks ended on Oct 23, 2012 because of the Eid al-Adha holiday at which point they offered to speak to the media through e-mail.\n\n== Name of the group and operation ==\nThe group\u2019s moniker, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, was a Muslim preacher who lead in the fight against British, French and Jewish nationalist organizations in the Levant in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\n== Disputed origins of attacks ==\nOn September 21, 2012, the Washington Post reported that the attacks originated not from a hacktivist group but from the government of Iran and cited U.S. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as one who was a proponent of this idea. Lieberman told C-Span that he believed the Iranian government was sponsoring the group's attacks on US banks in retaliation for Western economic sanctions. An early report by Dancho Danchev found the amateurish \"outdated and virtually irrelevant technical skills\" of the attack suspicious.  But Michael Smith, senior security evangelist at Akamai, found the size of the attacks\u201465 gigabits of traffic per second\u2014more consistent with a state actor (such as Iran) than with a typical hacktivist denial of service attack which would be less than 2 gigabits/second.The controversial hacktivist, The Jester, claimed the Qassam Cyber Fighters had help with their attacks from the hacking group Anonymous.\n\n== Phase two ==\nOn December 10, 2012, the Qassam Cyber Fighters announced the launching of phase two of Operation Ababil. In that statement, they specifically named U.S. Bancorp, J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, PNC Financial Services and SunTrust Bank as targets and identified events such as Hurricane Sandy and the 2012 US Presidential Election as reasons for the delay of phase two. This announcement also mentioned disrespect towards the Prophet Mohammed as motivation and denied the involvement of any nation state. It was during this time that media attention increased with one journalist observing, \"Operation Ababil stands out for its sophistication and focus, experts say.\" and allegations of involvement by Iran also increased. On January 29, 2013, an announcement was made that phase two would come to a conclusion due to the removal of the main copy of the video from YouTube. The announcement also identified additional copies of the movie also hosted on YouTube.\n\n== Phase three ==\nOn February 12, 2013, the Qassam Cyber Fighters issued a warning that the other copies of the movie referenced in their January 29 posting should be removed. They followed this with a \"serious warning\" and then an \"ultimatum\" after the additional copies of the video were not removed. On March 5, 2013, they announced  the beginning of Phase 3 of Operation Ababil on their Pastebin page. This was followed by several of the financial institutions on their target list reporting website disruptions.",

The organizations included three media companies (KBS, MBC, &YTN) and three financial institutions (The National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, Shinhan Bank, & Jeju Bank). The South Korean communications watchdog Korea Communications Commission raised their alert level on cyber-attacks to three on a scale of five. North Korea has been blamed for similar attacks in 2009 and 2011 and was suspected of launching this attack as well. This attack also came at a period of elevated tensions between the two Koreas, following Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear test on 12 February. South Korean officials linked the incident to a Chinese IP address, which increased suspicion of North Korea as \"[i]ntelligence experts believe that North Korea routinely uses Chinese computer addresses to hide its cyber-attacks.\" It was later revealed that the IP address did not originate from China but from the internal network of one of the attacked organizations.The attacks on all six organizations derived from one single entity. The networks were attacked by malicious codes, rather than distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks as suspected at the beginning. It appeared to have used only hard drive overwrites. This cyberattack \u201cdamaged 32,000 computers and servers of media and financial companies.\u201d The Financial Services Commission of South Korea said that Shinhan Bank reported that its Internet banking servers had been temporarily blocked and that Jeju Bank and NongHyup reported that operations at some of their branches had been paralyzed after computers were infected with viruses and their files erased.

    "instruction": "Message authentication\n\n==Introduction==\nIn information security, message authentication or data origin authentication is a property that a message has not been modified while in transit (data integrity) and that the receiving party can verify the source of the message. Message authentication does not necessarily include the property of non-repudiation.Message authentication is typically achieved by using message authentication codes (MACs), authenticated encryption (AE) or digital signatures. The message authentication code, also known as digital authenticator, is used as an integrity check based on a secret key shared by two parties to authenticate information transmitted between them. It is based on using a cryptographic hash or symmetric encryption algorithm. The authentication key is only shared by exactly two parties (e.g. communicating devices), and the authentication will fail in the existence of a third party possessing the key since the algorithm will no longer be able to detect forgeries (i.e. to be able to validate the unique source of the message). In addition, the key must also be randomly generated to avoid its recovery through brute-force searches and related-key attacks designed to identify it from the messages transiting the medium.Some cryptographers distinguish between \"message authentication without secrecy\" systems \u2013 which allow the intended receiver to verify the source of the message, but they don't bother hiding the plaintext contents of the message \u2013 from authenticated encryption systems.

A capability describes a transferable right to perform one (or more) operations on a given object. It can be obtained by the following combination:\n\nAn unforgeable reference (in the sense of object references or protected pointers) that can be sent in messages.\nA message that specifies the operation to be performed.The security model relies on not being able to forge references. \n\nObjects can interact only by sending messages on references.\nA reference can be obtained by:Initial conditions: In the initial state of the computational world being described, object A may already have a reference to object B.\nParenthood: If A creates B, at that moment A obtains the only reference to the newly created B.\nEndowment: If A creates B, B is born with that subset of A's references with which A chose to endow it.\nIntroduction: If A has references to both B and C, A can send to B a message containing a reference to C. B can retain that reference for subsequent use.In the object-capability model, all computation is performed following the above rules.\nAdvantages that motivate object-oriented programming, such as encapsulation or information hiding, modularity, and separation of concerns, correspond to security goals such as least privilege and privilege separation in capability-based programming.The object-capability model was first proposed by Jack Dennis and Earl C.

Dean Tribble stated that in smart contracts, identity-based access control did not support well dynamically changing permissions, compared to the object-capability model. He analogized the ocap model with giving a valet the key to one's car, without handing over the right to car ownership.The structural properties of object capability systems favor modularity in code design and ensure reliable encapsulation in code implementation.\nThese structural properties facilitate the analysis of some security properties of an object-capability program or operating system. Some of these \u2013  in particular, information flow properties \u2013  can be analyzed at the level of object references and connectivity, independent of any knowledge or analysis of the code that determines the behavior of the objects. As a consequence, these security properties can be established and maintained in the presence of new objects that contain unknown and possibly malicious code.\nThese structural properties stem from the two rules governing access to existing objects:\n\n1) An object A can send a message to B only if object A holds a reference to B.\n2) An object A can obtain a reference to C only if object A receives a message containing a reference to C.As a consequence of these two rules, an object can obtain a reference to another object only through a preexisting chain of references.

    "output": "Question1: What is the object-capability model and how does it approach computer security? Answer1: The object-capability model is a computer security model that revolves around capabilities, which are transferable rights to perform specific operations on given objects. The security model emphasizes the inability to forge object references, and objects can only interact through message passing on these references. Objects can obtain references via initial conditions, parenthood, or endowment, and all computation must follow these rules. Question2: How do some object-based programming languages deviate from the object-capability model's rules? Answer2: Some object-based programming languages, such as Java, C#, and JavaScript, deviate from the object-capability model by allowing direct assignment to instance variables, direct reflective inspection of meta-data, and unrestricted access to primitive modules, which can lead to security issues. Question3: How does the object-capability model enable secure smart contract implementations? Answer3: The object-capability model supports dynamically changing permissions better than identity-based access control in smart contracts. It allows secure access by granting permissions similar to handing a valet your car key without giving ownership rights. Question4: What are the structural properties of object-capability systems that promote modularity and reliable encapsulation? Answer4: Object-capability systems have structural properties that facilitate code modularity and encapsulation by governing access to existing objects through references. This restricts objects from obtaining references to other objects without a preexisting chain of references. Question5: What is the significance of an object obtaining a reference to another object through a preexisting chain of references? Answer5: When an object obtains a reference to another object through a preexisting chain of references, it ensures that only connectivity begets connectivity. This is a crucial property of object-capability systems as it helps maintain security and encapsulation. Question6: What are the two main rules governing access to existing objects in object-capability systems? Answer6: The two main rules governing access to existing objects in object-capability systems are: (1) an object A can send a message to object B only if A holds a reference to B, and (2) an object A can obtain a reference to object C only if A receives a message containing a reference to C. Question7: How does the concept of attenuation enhance security in object-capability systems? Answer7: Attenuation is a common design pattern in object-capability systems that creates a new reference for a proxy object with security restrictions, such as read-only access or revocation. The proxy object performs security checks on incoming messages, allowing only approved messages to pass through. Question8: What is deep attenuation and how does it work in object-capability systems? Answer8: Deep attenuation is an extension of the attenuation pattern in object-capability systems, where the same security restrictions are applied to any objects obtained via the original attenuated object through the use of a \"membrane\". Question9: What are some historical systems that can be modeled as object-capability systems? Answer9: KeyKOS, EROS, Integrity, CapROS, Coyotos, seL4, OKL4, and Fiasco.OC are examples of secure operating systems that implement the object-capability model. Question10: What are some programming languages that implement object capabilities? Answer10: Some programming languages that implement object capabilities include Act 1, Eden, Emerald, Trusty Scheme, W7, Joule, Original-E, Oz-E, Joe-E, CaPerl, Emily, Caja, Monte, Pony, Wyvern, Newspeak, and Hacklang. Question11: How can the security properties of an object-capability program or operating system be analyzed? Answer11: Security properties, particularly information flow properties, can be analyzed at the object reference and connectivity level, independent of the code that determines the behavior of the objects. This allows for establishing and maintaining security properties even with new objects containing unknown or possibly malicious code. Question12: What is the role of references in object-capability systems? Answer12: In object-capability systems, references are unforgeable communications channels (protected pointers or opaque addresses) that designate a single object and grant permission to send messages to that object. Question13: What is a message in the context of object-capability systems? Answer13: In object-capability systems, a message is the information sent on a reference. Depending on the system, messages may be first-class objects themselves. Question14: What is a request in object-capability systems? Answer14: A request is an operation in object-capability systems where a message is sent on a reference, and the receiver gains access to any references included in the message. Question15: In the object-capability model, how does direct assignment to instance variables violate security principles? Answer15: In object-capability systems, direct assignment to instance variables violates security principles since it bypasses the controlled message passing mechanism, leading to potential security risks and violating the inability to forge references.",

The BID/150 was designed for use with the British Army C42 and C45 Larkspur radio system, which were widely used by various governmental agencies and departments, and remained in use until the early 1980s.\n\nq2: What was the role of the Communications-Electronics Security Group (CESG) and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in relation to the BID/150 device? a2: The Communications-Electronics Security Group (CESG), which was part of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), was responsible for the authority of BID's, including the BID/150 device. This group played a crucial role in ensuring the security and effectiveness of the BID/150 device and other similar systems.\n\nq3: What were the measures taken to ensure good radio performance for the C42-DM-BID/150 system and why were they necessary? a3: To ensure good radio performance for the C42-DM-BID/150 system, vehicles carrying the system were issued with a 27-foot mast and an elevated antenna. A 'Goodman Box' was also used to check signal strengths and antenna performance. These measures were necessary to ensure reliable secure working, as poor radio performance could negatively impact the effectiveness of the secure speech system. The operator also had specific set-up and performance drills to follow in order to optimize the performance of the system."

    "instruction": "Sender Rewriting Scheme\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) is a scheme for bypassing the Sender Policy Framework's (SPF) methods of preventing forged sender addresses. Forging a sender address is also known as email spoofing.\n\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn a number of cases, including change of email address and mailing lists, a message transfer agent (MTA) accepts an email message that is not destined to a local mailbox but needs to be forwarded.  In such cases, the question arises of who deserves to receive any related bounce message. In general, that is either the author, or a person or other entity who administers the forwarding itself.  Sending bounces to the author is administratively simpler and used to be accomplished by just keeping the original envelope sender.  However, if the author address is subject to a strict SPF policy (-all) and the target MTA happens to enforce it, the forwarding transaction can be rejected.  As a workaround, it is possible to synthesize on the fly a temporary bounce address that will direct any bounce back to the current MTA.  The scheme provides for recovering the original envelope address, so that if a bounce does arrive, it can be forwarded along the reverse path\u2014with an empty envelope sender this time.\nWhile there are other workarounds, SRS is a fairly general one.  Its notion of reversing the path resembles the original routing dispositions for email, see below.\nPlease note: Using SRS protocol fails the SPF Alignment check for your DMARC record, and it's by design. Your DMARC record can still pass with a DKIM check.\n\n== The rewriting scheme ==\nSRS is a form of variable envelope return path (VERP) inasmuch as it encodes the original envelope sender in the local part of the rewritten address. Consider example.com forwarding a message originally destined to bob@example.com to his new address <bob@example.net>:\n\n   ORIGINAL\n   envelope sender:     alice@example.org\n   envelope recipient:  bob@example.com\n\n   REWRITTEN\n   envelope sender:     SRS0\n\n== Historical background ==\nHistorically, all mail transfer agents (MTAs) added their host name to the reverse path. In the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) this reverse path is also known as MAIL FROM, but paths were also used before and outside of SMTP, e.g. as bang paths in UUCP and Usenet (NetNews). All news articles still contain a Path header, example:\n\nPath: news.server.example!other.example!not-for-mail\n\nThe same information in an RFC 5321 e-mail envelope - that is the SMTP info like MAIL FROM - would be:\n\nMAIL FROM:<not-for-mail@other.example>\nMAIL FROM:<@news.server.example:not-for-mail@other.example>The 1st step reflects the sender, the 2nd step the next MTA, etc. In this example let's assume that the 2nd MTA forwards the mail to a 3rd MTA, where it is finally delivered. The final MTA is also known as Mail delivery agent (MDA), putting the mail into the mailbox of the recipient. The MDA transforms the reverse path into the known Return-Path header field:\n\nReturn-Path:<@news.server.example:not-for-mail@other.example>\n\nSMTP uses MX records for its forward routing.\nExplicit source routes as in...\n\nRCPT TO:<@news.server.example:user@destination.example>\n\n...to route mail from other.example via MTA news.server.example to MDA destination.example were cumbersome. To make things worse sometimes the new (1982) style of addresses was mixed with old UUCP bang paths in constructs like...\n\ndestination.example!user@news.server.example\nother.example!not-for-mail@news.server.example\n\n...and various other kludges. SMTP and MX records made all this essentially useless. Therefore, source routing was deprecated 1989 in RFC 1123.\nOne special case in RFC 1123 are gateways from or to other networks like UUCP and NetNews, where the first sending MTA cannot reach the final receiver directly with TCP. It is solved by MX records and if necessary rewriting foreign addresses at the gateway. MX is an acronym for Mail eXchanger.\nAnother special case are mailing lists, where the list server rewrites all reverse paths to its own error handling address for bounces (error messages) by recipients. The list server could automatically unsubscribe bouncing recipients. This type of address rewriting is known since RFC 821 and still used today (RFC 5321, as well as RFC 2821, updated the SMTP chapter in RFC 1123).\nLast but not least forwarding to another address always worked by rewriting the address in the forward path also known as RCPT TO, if and only if the forwarding MTA accepted the responsibility for both forwarding the mail and returning potential bounce messages to the sender. RFC 821 and all later SMTP specifications offer two result codes for this situation:\n\n251 user not local (attempted forward)\n551 user not local (mail rejected)For privacy reasons these result codes are today rarely used; they include the forwarded to (251) or not forwarded to (551) address. But the meaning and the effect of forwarding to third parties is identical for result code 250 and error code 550 respectively.\nAs noted RFC 1123 deprecated source routing, that implicitly also deprecated the reverse routing of bounces. It was a relatively small Internet back in 1989, mail admins (postmasters) often knew each other and fixed problems on the fly. Routing bounce messages back via any forwarders was a waste of time and bandwidth if the MTA noting a problem (e.g. a rejection with a 5xx error code) could send the error message directly back to the MX of sender.\nSince RFC 1123. forwarders to third parties still rewrote the RCPT TO address, but kept the MAIL FROM as is. As a side effect, MTAs wishing to accept mail from forwarders generally accept any MAIL FROM address.\nMore than a decade later spammers started to abuse this flaw in post-1123 SMTP, today most mails are spam and most reverse paths are forged. Note that spammers typically forge working reverse paths, many MTAs reject mail if callback verification or other plausibility checks fail for the reverse path.\nRFC 5321, as well as RFC 2821, states that non-delivery reports (bounces) must be sent to the originator as indicated in the reverse path after an MTA accepted the responsibility for delivery.  However, the bounce message may be suppressed when the original content is hostile (cf. spam or virus mail) or the message is forged (RFC 5321, Section 6).  Note that all current forgery detection methods require the mailbox owner to supply information for them to work.  Failing to supply the criteria should not make any bounce message classifiable as backscatter, although some people mistakenly think it should.\nOpen relays and forwarders are in an unlucky position with regards to this issue, generally they can't guarantee that the MAIL FROM address indicates the originator, and they also can't guarantee that final delivery will succeed.\nThis SMTP problem caused as side effect of RFC 1123 is addressed by SPF, and the executive summary is SPF breaks forwarding - actually that's not the case, SPF FAIL only asks receivers to check SPF at their border MTA, not later.\nReceivers can arrange their forwarding in a way that works with SPF with in essence three strategies:\n\nnot checking SPF behind their border, e.g. white list forwarders\njust reject SPF FAIL, resulting in a bounce (SMTP error 550)\nrewrite the MAIL FROM at the forwarder (as done by mailing lists)Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) is one way for the third strategy.\n\nUsing the text above, answer my questions:\n\n",

    "output": "Question1: How does the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) help in bypassing the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) methods of preventing forged sender addresses? Answer1: SRS is a scheme that encodes the original envelope sender in the local part of the rewritten address, which allows it to bypass SPF methods. This is because SPF checks the domain name in the envelope sender's address, and by rewriting the address, SRS can change the domain name, thereby bypassing SPF checks.\nQuestion2: What is the historical background of the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS)? Answer2: Historically, all mail transfer agents (MTAs) added their host name to the reverse path. This reverse path, also known as MAIL FROM in SMTP, was used to identify the sender of the email. SRS is a more recent scheme that builds upon this historical background by encoding the original envelope sender in the local part of the rewritten address.\nQuestion3: How does the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) differ from the original routing dispositions for email? Answer3: The Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) resembles the original routing dispositions for email, but with the added feature of encoding the original envelope sender in the local part of the rewritten address. This allows for more flexibility in handling bounce messages, as the original envelope address can be recovered and forwarded along the reverse path.\nQuestion4: Why is sending bounces to the author not always possible when the author address is subject to a strict SPF policy? Answer4: When the author address is subject to a strict SPF policy, sending bounces to the author may not be possible because the target MTA may enforce the policy and reject the forwarding transaction. This is because SPF checks the domain name in the envelope sender's address, and if the domain name does not match the domain name in the SPF record, the transaction will be rejected.\nQuestion5: How does the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) help in handling bounce messages? Answer5: The Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) helps in handling bounce messages by encoding the original envelope sender in the local part of the rewritten address. This allows for the original envelope address to be recovered and forwarded along the reverse path, even if the author address is subject to a strict SPF policy.\nQuestion6: What is the purpose of the original envelope sender in the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS)? Answer6: The original envelope sender in the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) is encoded in the local part of the rewritten address. This allows for the original envelope address to be recovered and forwarded along the reverse path, even if the author address is subject to a strict SPF policy.\nQuestion7: How does the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) help in forwarding bounce messages along the reverse path? Answer7: The Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) helps in forwarding bounce messages along the reverse path by encoding the original envelope sender in the local part of the rewritten address. This allows for the original envelope address to be recovered and forwarded along the reverse path, even if the author address is subject to a strict SPF policy.\nQuestion8: Why is it necessary to synthesize a temporary bounce address in the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS)? Answer8: It is necessary to synthesize a temporary bounce address in the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) because if the author address is subject to a strict SPF policy, the forwarding transaction can be rejected. By synthesizing a temporary bounce address, any bounce back can be directed to the current MTA, and the original envelope address can be recovered and forwarded along the reverse path.\nQuestion9: How does the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) affect the SPF Alignment check for a DMARC record? Answer9: Using the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) fails the SPF Alignment check for a DMARC record, but it is by design. This is because SRS rewrites the envelope sender address, which can cause the SPF Alignment check to fail. However, the DMARC record can still pass with a DKIM check.\nQuestion10: How does the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) resemble the original routing dispositions for email? Answer10: The Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) resembles the original routing dispositions for email because it encodes the original envelope sender in the local part of the rewritten address. This is similar to the original routing dispositions, where the reverse path contains information about the sender and the path the email took to reach the recipient.\nQuestion11: How does the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS) affect the handling of bounce messages in a mailing list?

Fraud factory operators lure foreign nationals to scam hubs, where they are forced into modern slavery, to scam internet users around the world into fraudulently buying cryptocurrencies or withdrawing cash, via social media and online dating apps. Trafficking victims' passports are confiscated, and they are threatened with organ harvesting and forced prostitution if they do not scam sufficiently successfully.\n\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nThe term fraud factory is used by Kenya's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the activity of trafficking victims to Asia where they use digital media to meet westerners and sell them cryptocurrencies. In Chinese, the term \"fraud industrial park\" (Chinese: \u8a50\u9a19\u5712\u5340; pinyin: zh\u00e0pi\u00e0n yu\u00e1nq\u016b; lit. 'fraud park zone') has emerged in reference to these operations.\n\n== Organization and ownership ==\nFraud factories are operated by Chinese criminal gangs. The gang's traditional revenue stream of gambling reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic and their activities increasingly focus on fraud factories to regain lost revenue.\n\n== Human trafficking victims ==\nBetween August and late September 2022, the Kenya embassy to Thailand facilitated the rescue of 76 trafficking victims. The victims were mostly Kenyan, but also include Ugandans and a Burundian. The criminal gangs who operate the fraud factories target young and educated Africans. In November 2022, one Kenyan died after a botched organ harvesting operation associated with a fraud factory in Myanmar.Myanmar is also an emerging destination for international labour trafficking, especially along its border areas. Victims in Myanmar include nationals from throughout Asia, including China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand. Victims are lured by the false promise of high-paying jobs, and are trafficked through major cities like Yangon and Bangkok, and transit points like Mae Sot, Chiang Rai. They are then forced to work in \"special economic zones\" along the country's borders such as Shwe Kokko.\n\n== Operations ==\n\nBBC News reported the locations of fraud factories as being in Laos and Myanmar, notably in Kachin where the Kachin conflict is occurring, a factor that makes rescues difficult. The Japan Times reported that factories which initially started operations in Cambodia later switched locations to Laos and that victims were held special economic zones in Laos and Myanmar (and also specifically Myawaddy), as well as casinos in Cambodia.  The trafficked victims are lured with job offers, one victim the BBC of traveled to Thailand for a job before being driven to Laos.Fraud factory workers are trained to create online social media and dating personas which they use to built up trust with westerners and engage in fake romance scams with the goal of encouraging the westerners to buy cryptocurrencies. The targets of the bait and switch cyber crime were predominantly US citizens. The process of fraudulently building up trust with victims online in order to sell them cryptocurrencies is known as pig butchering.The trafficked Kenyans were prevented from leaving unless they paid 1.2m Kenyan shillings and were threatened with forced sex work and organ harvesting if they did not meet work performance targets. Two victims who spoke to the BBC were rescued by Awareness Against Human Trafficking. Trafficking victims have their passports confiscated by the traffickers, some have returned to Kenya with broken limbs, as result of beatings from their captors.\n\n== Destinations ==\nCambodia, Laos, and Myanmar in Southeast Asia are known fraud factory destinations. These countries are particularly vulnerable due to their strategic location next to China and weak law enforcement. Below are known cyber scam hotspots:\n\n Cambodia:\nSihanoukville\nPoipet\n Laos:\nGolden Triangle Special Economic Zone\n Myanmar:\nMyawaddy\nShwe Kokko\nMong La\nNow I will ask you some questions, and you will answer.\n\n",

      "context": "Fraud factory\n\n==Introduction==\nA fraud factory or fraud park is a collection of large fraud organization usually involve human trafficking operation, commonly found in Southeast Asia (including Cambodia, Myanmar, or Laos) and usually operated by a Chinese criminal gang. Fraud factory operators lure foreign nationals to scam hubs, where they are forced into modern slavery, to scam internet users around the world into fraudulently buying cryptocurrencies or withdrawing cash, via social media and online dating apps. Trafficking victims' passports are confiscated, and they are threatened with organ harvesting and forced prostitution if they do not scam sufficiently successfully.\n\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\nThe term fraud factory is used by Kenya's Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the activity of trafficking victims to Asia where they use digital media to meet westerners and sell them cryptocurrencies. In Chinese, the term \"fraud industrial park\" (Chinese: \u8a50\u9a19\u5712\u5340; pinyin: zh\u00e0pi\u00e0n yu\u00e1nq\u016b; lit. 'fraud park zone') has emerged in reference to these operations.\n\n== Organization and ownership ==\nFraud factories are operated by Chinese criminal gangs. The gang's traditional revenue stream of gambling reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic and their activities increasingly focus on fraud factories to regain lost revenue.\n\n== Human trafficking victims ==\nBetween August and late September 2022, the Kenya embassy to Thailand facilitated the rescue of 76 trafficking victims. The victims were mostly Kenyan, but also include Ugandans and a Burundian. The criminal gangs who operate the fraud factories target young and educated Africans. In November 2022, one Kenyan died after a botched organ harvesting operation associated with a fraud factory in Myanmar.Myanmar is also an emerging destination for international labour trafficking, especially along its border areas. Victims in Myanmar include nationals from throughout Asia, including China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand. Victims are lured by the false promise of high-paying jobs, and are trafficked through major cities like Yangon and Bangkok, and transit points like Mae Sot, Chiang Rai. They are then forced to work in \"special economic zones\" along the country's borders such as Shwe Kokko.\n\n== Operations ==\n\nBBC News reported the locations of fraud factories as being in Laos and Myanmar, notably in Kachin where the Kachin conflict is occurring, a factor that makes rescues difficult. The Japan Times reported that factories which initially started operations in Cambodia later switched locations to Laos and that victims were held special economic zones in Laos and Myanmar (and also specifically Myawaddy), as well as casinos in Cambodia.  The trafficked victims are lured with job offers, one victim the BBC of traveled to Thailand for a job before being driven to Laos.Fraud factory workers are trained to create online social media and dating personas which they use to built up trust with westerners and engage in fake romance scams with the goal of encouraging the westerners to buy cryptocurrencies. The targets of the bait and switch cyber crime were predominantly US citizens. The process of fraudulently building up trust with victims online in order to sell them cryptocurrencies is known as pig butchering.The trafficked Kenyans were prevented from leaving unless they paid 1.2m Kenyan shillings and were threatened with forced sex work and organ harvesting if they did not meet work performance targets. Two victims who spoke to the BBC were rescued by Awareness Against Human Trafficking. Trafficking victims have their passports confiscated by the traffickers, some have returned to Kenya with broken limbs, as result of beatings from their captors.\n\n== Destinations ==\nCambodia, Laos, and Myanmar in Southeast Asia are known fraud factory destinations. These countries are particularly vulnerable due to their strategic location next to China and weak law enforcement. Below are known cyber scam hotspots:\n\n Cambodia:\nSihanoukville\nPoipet\n Laos:\nGolden Triangle Special Economic Zone\n Myanmar:\nMyawaddy\nShwe Kokko\nMong La",

    "instruction": "Proxy re-encryption\n\n==Introduction==\nProxy re-encryption (PRE) schemes are cryptosystems which allow third parties (proxies) to alter a ciphertext which has been encrypted for one party, so that it may be decrypted by another.\n\n\n\n== Examples of use ==\nA proxy re-encryption is generally used when one party, say Bob, wants to reveal the contents of messages sent to him and encrypted with his public key to a third party, Charlie, without revealing his private key to Charlie. Bob does not want the proxy to be able to read the contents of his messages. \nBob could designate a proxy to re-encrypt one of his messages that is to be sent to Charlie.  This generates a new key that Charlie can use to decrypt the message.  Now if Bob sends Charlie a message that was encrypted under Bob's key, the proxy will alter the message, allowing Charlie to decrypt it.  This method allows for a number of applications such as e-mail forwarding, law-enforcement monitoring, and content distribution.\nA weaker re-encryption scheme is one in which the proxy possesses both parties' keys simultaneously.  One key decrypts a plaintext, while the other encrypts it.  Since the goal of many proxy re-encryption schemes is to avoid revealing either of the keys or the underlying plaintext to the proxy, this method is not ideal.\n\n== Defining functions ==\nProxy re-encryption schemes are similar to traditional symmetric or asymmetric encryption schemes, with the addition of two functions:\n\nDelegation \u2013 allows a message recipient (keyholder) to generate a re-encryption key based on his secret key and the key of the delegated user. This re-encryption key is used by the proxy as input to the re-encryption function, which is executed by the proxy to translate ciphertexts to the delegated user's key. Asymmetric proxy re-encryption schemes come in bi-directional and uni-directional varieties.\nIn a bi-directional scheme, the re-encryption scheme is reversible\u2014that is, the re-encryption key can be used to translate messages from Bob to Charlie, as well as from Charlie to Bob. This can have various security consequences, depending on the application. One notable characteristic of bi-directional schemes is that both the delegator and delegated party (e.g., Charlie and Bob) must combine their secret keys to produce the re-encryption key.\nA uni-directional scheme is effectively one-way; messages can be re-encrypted from Bob to Charlie, but not the reverse. Uni-directional schemes can be constructed such that the delegated party need not reveal its secret key. For example, Bob could delegate to Charlie by combining his secret key with Charlie's public key.\nTransitivity \u2013 Transitive proxy re-encryption schemes allow for a ciphertext to be re-encrypted an unlimited number of times. For example, a ciphertext might be re-encrypted from Bob to Charlie, and then again from Charlie to David and so on. Non-transitive schemes allow for only one (or a limited number) of re-encryptions on a given ciphertext. Most known schemes are bi-directional and transitive. Currently, the only known uni-directional, transitive proxy re-encryption is done through the use of Homomorphic Encryption.\nCloud Computing \u2013 Proxy re-encryption has potential applications for secure sharing in a cloud computing environment.  In the cloud scenario the re-encryption key is provided to the cloud operator/admin.  Looking at the Bob, Charlie, David example, the cloud would take the place of Charlie.  Bob generates a re-encryption key to supply to the cloud.  The cloud operator/admin completes a re-encrypt of Bob\u2019s encrypted files into David\u2019s files whenever David downloads Bob\u2019s files.  Challenges exist with the cloud solution.  A user could conspire with a cloud operator to gain access to all a user\u2019s, such as Bob, files.  A second potential challenge is segmentation via access control.  A cloud user can restrict access to files via the assignment of conditional values.  However, the number of re-encryption keys grows proportionately with the number of conditional values.

    "instruction": "Browser isolation\n\n==Introduction==\nBrowser isolation is a cybersecurity model which aims to physically isolate an internet user's browsing activity (and the associated cyber risks) away from their local networks and infrastructure.  Browser isolation technologies approach this model in different ways, but they all seek to achieve the same goal, effective isolation of the web browser and a user's browsing activity as a method of securing web browsers from browser-based security exploits, as well as web-borne threats such as ransomware and other malware. When a browser isolation technology is delivered to its customers as a cloud hosted service, this is known as remote browser isolation (RBI), a model which enables organizations to deploy a browser isolation solution to their users without managing the associated server infrastructure. There are also client side approaches to browser isolation, based on client-side hypervisors, which do not depend on servers in order to isolate their users browsing activity and the associated risks, instead the activity is virtually isolated on the local host machine. Client-side solutions break the security through physical isolation model, but they do allow the user to avoid the server overhead costs associated with remote browser isolation solutions.\n\n\n\n== Mechanism ==\nBrowser isolation typically leverages virtualization or containerization technology to isolate the users web browsing activity away from the endpoint device - significantly reducing the attack surface for rogue links and files. Browser isolation is a way to isolate web browsing hosts and other high-risk behaviors away from mission-critical data and infrastructure. Browser isolation is a process to physically isolate a user's browsing activity away from local networks and infrastructure, isolating malware and browser based cyber-attacks in the process while still granting full access.\n\n== Market ==\nIn 2017, the American research group Gartner identified remote browser (browser isolation) as one of the top technologies for security. The same Gartner report also forecast that more than 50% of enterprises would actively begin to isolate their internet browsing to reduce the impact of cyber attacks over the coming three years.\nAccording to Market Research Media, the remote browser isolation (RBI) market is forecast to reach $10 Billion by 2024, growing at CAGR 30% in the period 2019\u20132024.\n\n== Comparison to other techniques ==\nUnlike traditional web security approaches such as antivirus software and secure web gateways, browser isolation is a zero trust approach which does not rely on filtering content based on known threat patterns or signatures. Traditional approaches can't handle 0-day attacks since the threat patterns are unknown. Rather, browser isolation approach treats all websites and other web content that has not been explicitly whitelisted as untrusted, and isolates them from the local device in a virtual environment such as a container or virtual machine.\nWeb-based files can be rendered remotely so that end users can access them within the browser, without downloading them. Alternatively, files can be sanitized within the virtual environment, using file cleansing technologies such as Content Disarm & Reconstruction (CDR), allowing for secure file downloads to the user device.\n\n== Effectiveness ==\nTypically browser isolation solutions provide their users with 'disposable' (non-persistent) browser environments, once the browsing session is closed or times out, the entire browser environment is reset to a known good state or simply discarded. Any malicious code encountered during that session is thus prevented from reaching the endpoint or persisting within the network, regardless of whether any threat is detected. In this way, browser isolation proactively combats both known, unknown and zero-day threats, effectively complementing other security measures and contributing to a defense-in-depth, layered approach to web security.\n\nUsing the text above, answer my questions:\n\n",

      "context": "Browser isolation\n\n==Introduction==\nBrowser isolation is a cybersecurity model which aims to physically isolate an internet user's browsing activity (and the associated cyber risks) away from their local networks and infrastructure.  Browser isolation technologies approach this model in different ways, but they all seek to achieve the same goal, effective isolation of the web browser and a user's browsing activity as a method of securing web browsers from browser-based security exploits, as well as web-borne threats such as ransomware and other malware. When a browser isolation technology is delivered to its customers as a cloud hosted service, this is known as remote browser isolation (RBI), a model which enables organizations to deploy a browser isolation solution to their users without managing the associated server infrastructure. There are also client side approaches to browser isolation, based on client-side hypervisors, which do not depend on servers in order to isolate their users browsing activity and the associated risks, instead the activity is virtually isolated on the local host machine. Client-side solutions break the security through physical isolation model, but they do allow the user to avoid the server overhead costs associated with remote browser isolation solutions.\n\n\n\n== Mechanism ==\nBrowser isolation typically leverages virtualization or containerization technology to isolate the users web browsing activity away from the endpoint device - significantly reducing the attack surface for rogue links and files. Browser isolation is a way to isolate web browsing hosts and other high-risk behaviors away from mission-critical data and infrastructure. Browser isolation is a process to physically isolate a user's browsing activity away from local networks and infrastructure, isolating malware and browser based cyber-attacks in the process while still granting full access.\n\n== Market ==\nIn 2017, the American research group Gartner identified remote browser (browser isolation) as one of the top technologies for security. The same Gartner report also forecast that more than 50% of enterprises would actively begin to isolate their internet browsing to reduce the impact of cyber attacks over the coming three years.\nAccording to Market Research Media, the remote browser isolation (RBI) market is forecast to reach $10 Billion by 2024, growing at CAGR 30% in the period 2019\u20132024.\n\n== Comparison to other techniques ==\nUnlike traditional web security approaches such as antivirus software and secure web gateways, browser isolation is a zero trust approach which does not rely on filtering content based on known threat patterns or signatures. Traditional approaches can't handle 0-day attacks since the threat patterns are unknown. Rather, browser isolation approach treats all websites and other web content that has not been explicitly whitelisted as untrusted, and isolates them from the local device in a virtual environment such as a container or virtual machine.\nWeb-based files can be rendered remotely so that end users can access them within the browser, without downloading them. Alternatively, files can be sanitized within the virtual environment, using file cleansing technologies such as Content Disarm & Reconstruction (CDR), allowing for secure file downloads to the user device.\n\n== Effectiveness ==\nTypically browser isolation solutions provide their users with 'disposable' (non-persistent) browser environments, once the browsing session is closed or times out, the entire browser environment is reset to a known good state or simply discarded. Any malicious code encountered during that session is thus prevented from reaching the endpoint or persisting within the network, regardless of whether any threat is detected. In this way, browser isolation proactively combats both known, unknown and zero-day threats, effectively complementing other security measures and contributing to a defense-in-depth, layered approach to web security.",

It enables to verify the authorship of a declaration in electronic data exchange over long periods of time. Qualified electronic signatures can be considered as a digital equivalent to handwritten signatures.\n\n== Description ==\nThe purpose of eIDAS was to create a set of standards to ensure that electronic signatures could be used in a secure manner while conducting business online or while conducting official business across borders between EU member states. The qualified electronic signature is one such standard that has been outlined under eIDAS.A qualified electronic signature is an advanced electronic signature with a qualified digital certificate that has been created by a qualified signature creation device (QSCD). For an electronic signature to be considered as a qualified electronic signature, it must meet three main requirements: First, the signatory must be linked and uniquely identified to the signature. The second point is that data used to create the signature must be under the sole control of the signatory. And last it must have the ability to identify if the data that accompanies the signature has been tampered with since the signing of the message.It is important to note that creating a qualified electronic signature is more than merely adding a qualified certificate to an advanced electronic signature. The signature must also be created using a qualified signature creation device (QSCD). This device is responsible for qualifying digital signatures by using specific hardware and software that ensures that only the signatory has control of their private key. In addition, a qualified trust service provider manages the signature creation data that is produced. The signature creation data must remain unique, confidential and protected from forgery.Qualified electronic signatures that comply with eIDAS may be technically implemented through three specific digital signature standards, that were developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and then need to be complemented with a qualified digital certificate through the procedures described above:;\n\nXAdES,\nPAdES\nand CAdES.\n\n== Qualified trust service providers ==\nThe qualified trust service provider has a crucial role in the process of qualified electronic signing. A trust service provider must receive qualified status from a supervisory governmental body that allows the entity to provide qualified trust services to be used in creating qualified electronic signatures. Regulated in eIDAS, the European Union published an EU Trust List with constitutive effect, meaning that a provider or service will only be qualified if it appears in the Trusted List.\nQualified trust service providers are required to abide by the strict guidelines outlined under the eIDAS Regulation, which include as part of the certificate creation process:\n\nThe service provider must provide a valid time and date for created certificates.\nSignatures that have expired certificates must be revoked immediately.\nPersonnel employed by the qualified trust service provider must be appropriately trained.\nSoftware and hardware used by the service provider must be trustworthy and capable of preventing certificate forgery.\n\n== Vision and expected impact ==\nUnder eIDAS, the intent of the implementation of qualified electronic signatures is to serve several purposes, such as the facilitation of business and public services processes, including those that go across borders. These processes can be safely expedited using electronic signing. Under eIDAS, EU member states have been charged with establishing \"points of single contact\" (PSCs) for trust services to ensure that electronic ID schemes may be used in cross-border public sector transactions, such as exchanging and accessing healthcare information across borders.Previously, a signatory would sign a document or message and then return it to the intended recipient via the postal service, facsimile service, by hand or by scanning and then attaching it to an email. The issue with these methods is that they are not always secure or timely. Delays in delivery could occur, and there exists the possibility that signatures could be forged or the enclosed documents may be altered. The risk increases as multiple signatures are required from different people who may be located in different locations. These problems are alleviated by using qualified electronic signatures, which save time, are legally binding, and provide a higher level of technical security.The increased transparency in the electronic signing and transaction process and the enhanced interoperability are expected to spur innovation in the European internal market.\n\n== Legal implications ==\neIDAS requires that no electronic signature should be denied legal effect or admissibility as evidence solely on the grounds that it is in an electronic form or that it does not meet the requirements for qualified electronic signatures. The qualified electronic signature shall have the equivalent legal effect as a handwritten signature. Its evidentiary value depends on the circumstances, but will normally be considered very high. All EU member states are required to recognize a qualified electronic signature as valid, as long as it has been created with a qualified certificate that has been issued by another member state.\nUnder eIDAS Regulation, Article 27, Electronic signatures in public services, member states are prohibited from requesting signatures of a higher level than qualified electronic signature. Article 25 (2) of eIDAS allows a qualified electronic signature to carry the same legal weight as a handwritten signature.\nNow I will ask you some questions, and you will answer.\n\n",

    "instruction": "CAdES (computing)\n\n==Introduction==\nCAdES (CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures) is a set of extensions to Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) signed data making it suitable for advanced electronic signatures.\n\n\n\n== Description ==\nCMS is a general framework for electronic signatures for various kinds of transactions like purchase requisition, contracts or invoices. CAdES specifies precise profiles of CMS signed data making it compliant with the European eIDAS regulation (Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market). The eIDAS regulation enhances and repeals the Electronic Signatures Directive 1999/93/EC. EIDAS is legally binding in all EU member states since July 2014. An electronic signature that has been created in compliance with eIDAS has the same legal value as a handwritten signature.An electronic signature, technically implemented based on CAdES has the status of an advanced electronic signature. This means that\n\nit is uniquely linked to the signatory;\nit is capable of identifying the signatory;\nonly the signatory has control of the data used for the signature creation;\nit can be identified if data attached to the signature has been changed after signing.A resulting property of CAdES is that electronically signed documents can remain valid for long periods, even if the signer or verifying party later attempts to deny the validity of the signature.\nA CAdES-based electronic signature is accepted in a court proceeding as evidence; as advanced electronic signatures are legally binding. But it gets higher probative value when enhanced to a qualified electronic signature. To receive that legal standing, it needs to be doted with a digital certificate, encrypted by a security signature creation device (\"qualified electronic signature\"). The authorship of a statement with a qualified electronic signature cannot be challenged - the statement is non-repudiable.\nThe document ETSI TS 101 733  Electronic Signature and Infrastructure (ESI) \u2013 CMS Advanced Electronic Signature (CAdES) describes the framework.\n\n== Evolution of the framework ==\nThe main document describing the format is  ETSI TS 101 733  Electronic Signature and Infrastructure (ESI) \u2013 CMS Advanced Electronic Signature (CAdES).\nThe ETSI TS 101 733 was first issued as V1.2.2 (2000\u201312). The current release version has the release number V2.2.1 (2013-04). ETSI is working on a new draft of CAdES. All drafts and released documents are publicly accessible at [1].\nThe ETSI TS V.1.7.4 (2008-07) is technically equivalent to RFC 5126. RFC 5126 document builds on existing standards that are widely adopted.  \nThese include:\n\nRFC 3852 : \"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)\"\nISO/IEC 9594-8/ITU-T Recommendation X.509 \"Information technology - Open Systems Interconnection - The Directory: Authentication framework\"\nRFC 3280 \"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKIX) Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile\"\nRFC 3161 \"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)\".\n\n== Profiles ==\nETSI \"TS 101 733\" specifies formats for Advanced Electronic Signatures built on CMS (CAdES). It defines a number of signed and unsigned optional signature properties, resulting in support for a number of variations in the signature contents and processing requirements. In order to maximize interoperability in communities applying CAdES to particular environments it was necessary to identify a common set of options that are appropriate to that environment. Such a selection is commonly called a profile.ETSI \"TS 103 173\"  describes profiles for CAdES signatures, in particular their use in the context of the EU Services Directive, \"Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal market\".There are four profiles available:\n\nCAdES-B: Basic Electronic Signature, the simplest version, containing the SignedInfo, SignatureValue, KeyInfo and SignedProperties. This level combines the old -BES and -EPES levels. This form extends the definition of an electronic signature to conform to the identified signature policy\nCAdES-T: B-Level for which a Trust Service Provider has generated a trusted token (time-mark or time-stamp token) proving that the signature itself actually existed at a certain date and time.\nCAdES-LT: are built by direct incorporation to CAdES-T signatures conformant to the T-Level, a long-term-validation attribute containing values of certificates and values of certificate revocation status used to validate the signature.\nCAdES-LTA: a signature conformant to LT-Level to which one or more long-term-validation attribute with a poeValue has been incorporated. By using periodical timestamping (e.g. each year) it is prevented the compromising of the signature due to weakening algorithms during long time storage periods.

      "context": "CAdES (computing)\n\n==Introduction==\nCAdES (CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures) is a set of extensions to Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) signed data making it suitable for advanced electronic signatures.\n\n\n\n== Description ==\nCMS is a general framework for electronic signatures for various kinds of transactions like purchase requisition, contracts or invoices. CAdES specifies precise profiles of CMS signed data making it compliant with the European eIDAS regulation (Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market). The eIDAS regulation enhances and repeals the Electronic Signatures Directive 1999/93/EC. EIDAS is legally binding in all EU member states since July 2014. An electronic signature that has been created in compliance with eIDAS has the same legal value as a handwritten signature.An electronic signature, technically implemented based on CAdES has the status of an advanced electronic signature. This means that\n\nit is uniquely linked to the signatory;\nit is capable of identifying the signatory;\nonly the signatory has control of the data used for the signature creation;\nit can be identified if data attached to the signature has been changed after signing.A resulting property of CAdES is that electronically signed documents can remain valid for long periods, even if the signer or verifying party later attempts to deny the validity of the signature.\nA CAdES-based electronic signature is accepted in a court proceeding as evidence; as advanced electronic signatures are legally binding. But it gets higher probative value when enhanced to a qualified electronic signature. To receive that legal standing, it needs to be doted with a digital certificate, encrypted by a security signature creation device (\"qualified electronic signature\"). The authorship of a statement with a qualified electronic signature cannot be challenged - the statement is non-repudiable.\nThe document ETSI TS 101 733  Electronic Signature and Infrastructure (ESI) \u2013 CMS Advanced Electronic Signature (CAdES) describes the framework.\n\n== Evolution of the framework ==\nThe main document describing the format is  ETSI TS 101 733  Electronic Signature and Infrastructure (ESI) \u2013 CMS Advanced Electronic Signature (CAdES).\nThe ETSI TS 101 733 was first issued as V1.2.2 (2000\u201312). The current release version has the release number V2.2.1 (2013-04). ETSI is working on a new draft of CAdES. All drafts and released documents are publicly accessible at [1].\nThe ETSI TS V.1.7.4 (2008-07) is technically equivalent to RFC 5126. RFC 5126 document builds on existing standards that are widely adopted.  \nThese include:\n\nRFC 3852 : \"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)\"\nISO/IEC 9594-8/ITU-T Recommendation X.509 \"Information technology - Open Systems Interconnection - The Directory: Authentication framework\"\nRFC 3280 \"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure (PKIX) Certificate and Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile\"\nRFC 3161 \"Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)\".\n\n== Profiles ==\nETSI \"TS 101 733\" specifies formats for Advanced Electronic Signatures built on CMS (CAdES). It defines a number of signed and unsigned optional signature properties, resulting in support for a number of variations in the signature contents and processing requirements. In order to maximize interoperability in communities applying CAdES to particular environments it was necessary to identify a common set of options that are appropriate to that environment. Such a selection is commonly called a profile.ETSI \"TS 103 173\"  describes profiles for CAdES signatures, in particular their use in the context of the EU Services Directive, \"Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal market\".There are four profiles available:\n\nCAdES-B: Basic Electronic Signature, the simplest version, containing the SignedInfo, SignatureValue, KeyInfo and SignedProperties. This level combines the old -BES and -EPES levels. This form extends the definition of an electronic signature to conform to the identified signature policy\nCAdES-T: B-Level for which a Trust Service Provider has generated a trusted token (time-mark or time-stamp token) proving that the signature itself actually existed at a certain date and time.\nCAdES-LT: are built by direct incorporation to CAdES-T signatures conformant to the T-Level, a long-term-validation attribute containing values of certificates and values of certificate revocation status used to validate the signature.\nCAdES-LTA: a signature conformant to LT-Level to which one or more long-term-validation attribute with a poeValue has been incorporated. By using periodical timestamping (e.g. each year) it is prevented the compromising of the signature due to weakening algorithms during long time storage periods. This level is equivalent to the old -A level",

A10: The averaging argument is used to prove that a certain book in a library is liked by at least 1/3 of the people by assuming that each person in a group of N people likes at least B/3 of the books in the library. This assumption is then used to show that there must be at least one book that is liked by at least 1/3 of the people. This is done by showing that if each person leaves a mark on the books they like, then there will be at least one book with M marks, where M is at least B/3 times N.

    "instruction": "context: Computer-aided audit tools\n\n==Introduction==\nComputer-assisted audit tool (CAATs) or computer-assisted audit tools and techniques (CAATTs) is a growing field within the IT audit profession. CAATs is the practice of using computers to automate the IT audit processes. CAATs normally include using basic office productivity software such as spreadsheets, word processors and text editing programs and more advanced software packages involving use statistical analysis and business intelligence tools. But also more dedicated specialized software are available (see below).\nCAATs have become synonymous with data analytics in the audit process.\n\n== Traditional auditing vs CAATs ==\n\n\n*** Traditional audit example ***\nThe traditional method of auditing allows auditors to build conclusions based upon a limited sample of a population, rather than an examination of all available or a large sample of data.\n\n\n*** CAATTs alternative ***\nCAATTs, not CAATs,  addresses these problems. CAATTs, as it is commonly used, is the practice of analyzing large volumes of data looking for anomalies. A well-designed CAATTs audit will not be a sample, but rather a complete review of all transactions. Using CAATTs the auditor will extract every transaction the business unit performed during the period reviewed. The auditor will then test that data to determine if there are any problems in the data.\n\n\n*** Traditional audit vs CAATTs on specific risks ***\nAnother advantage of CAATTs is that it allows auditors to test for specific risks. For example, an insurance company may want to ensure that it doesn't pay any claims after a policy is terminated. Using traditional audit techniques this risk would be very difficult to test. The auditor would \"randomly select\" a \"statistically valid\" sample of claims (usually if any of those claims were processed after a policy was terminated). Since the insurance company might process millions of claims the odds that any of those 30\u201350 \"randomly selected\" claims occurred after the policy was terminated is extremely unlikely.\nUsing CAATTs the auditor can select every claim that had a date of service after the policy termination date. The auditor then can determine if any claims were inappropriately paid. If they were, the auditor can then figure out why the controls to prevent this failure. In a real-life audit, the CAATTs auditor noted that several claims had been paid after policies were terminated. Using CAATTs the auditor was able to identify every claim that was paid and the exact dollar amount incorrectly paid by the insurance company. Furthermore, the auditor was able to identify the reason why these claims were paid. The reason why they were paid was because the participant paid their premium. The insurance company, having received a payment, paid the claims. Then after paying the claim the participant's check bounced. When the check bounced, the participant's policy was retrospectively terminated, but the claim was still paid costing the company hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.\nWhich looks better in an audit report:\n\"Audit reviewed 50 transactions and noted one transaction that was processed incorrectly\"\nor\n\"Audit used CAATTs and tested every transaction over the past year. We noted XXX exceptions wherein the company paid YYY dollars on terminated policies.\"\nHowever, the CAATTs driven review is limited only to the data saved on files in accordance with a systematic pattern. Much data is never documented this way. In addition saved data often contains deficiencies, is poorly classified, is not easy to get, and it might be hard to become convinced about its integrity. So, for the present CAATTs is a complement to an auditor's tools and techniques. In certain audits, CAATTs can't be used at all. But there are also audits that simply can't be made with due care and efficiently without CAATTs.\n\n== Specialized software ==\nIn the most general terms, CAATTs can refer to any computer program utilized to improve the audit process. Generally, however, it is used to refer to any data extraction and analysis software. This would include programs such as data analysis and extraction tools, spreadsheets (e.g. Excel), databases (e.g. Access), statistical analysis (e.g. SAS), generalized audit software (e.g. ACL, Arbutus, EAS), business intelligence (e.g. Crystal Reports and Business Objects), etc.\nBenefits of audit software include:\n\nThey are independent of the system being audited and will use a read-only copy of the file to avoid any corruption of an organization\u2019s data.\nMany audit-specific routines are used such as sampling.\nProvides documentation of each test performed in the software that can be used as documentation in the auditor\u2019s work papers.Audit specialized software may perform the following functions:\n\nData queries.\nData stratification.\nSample extractions.\nMissing sequence identification.\nStatistical analysis.\nCalculations.\nDuplicate transaction identification.\nPivot table creation.\nCross tabulation.\n\n== CAATs Education and Professional Development ==\n\n\n*** CAATs Courses ***\nCAATs are the fundamental tool that is used by the auditors. This tool facilitates them to make search from the irregularities from the given data. With the help of this tool, the auditors and accountants of any firm will be able to provide more analytical results. These tools are used throughout every business environment and also in the industry sectors too. With the help of computer-assisted audit techniques, more forensic accounting with more analysis can be done. It\u2019s really a helpful tool that helps the firm auditor to work in an efficient and productive manner. Working with the CAATs, it is essential for the accountant or the auditor to select the right data, the selection process is very much tricky, and you need to be professional for it. After selecting the right data, import that to the CAATs, now the tool will automatically generate the analytical data. This tool contributes to the efficiency of the auditors. The fundamental course outline  include:\n\nComputer Auditing Overview\nLegal and Ethical Issues for Computer Auditors\nUnderstanding CAATs\nComputer Auditing Project Planning\nData Access Skill and Knowledge\nData Verify Skill and Knowledge\nData Analysis Skill and Knowledge\nAudit Finding Report Skill and Knowledge\n\n\n*** CAATs Certification Program ***\nThere are several certification programs from various CAATs vendors and professional associations as the following:\n\nInternational Certified CAATs Practitioner (ICCP): established by the International Computer Auditing Education Association (ICAEA).\nACL\u2122 Certified Data Analyst (ACDA): established by ACL Services Ltd.\nCertified IDEA Data Analyst (CIDA):  established by CaseWare Analytics.\nJacksoft Certified CAATs Practitioner (JCCP): established by Jacksoft Commerce Automation Ltd.\n\n== Other uses of CAATs ==\nIn addition to using data analysis software, the auditor uses CAATs throughout the audit for the following activities while performing data analysis:\n\n\n*** Creation of electronic work papers ***\nKeeping electronic work papers on a centralized audit file or database will allow the auditor to navigate through current and archived working papers with ease. The database will make it easier for auditors to coordinate current audits and ensure they consider findings from prior or related projects. Additionally, the auditor will be able to electronically standardize audit forms and formats, which can improve both the quality and consistency of the audit working papers.\n\n\n*** Fraud detection ***\nCAATs provide auditors with tools that can identify unexpected or unexplained patterns in data that may indicate fraud. Whether the CAATs is simple or complex, data analysis provides many benefits in the prevention and detection of fraud.\nCAATs can assist the auditor in detecting fraud by performing and creating the following,\n\n\n*** Analytical tests ***\nEvaluations of financial information made by studying plausible relationships among both financial and non-financial data to assess whether account balances appear reasonable (AU 329). Examples include ratio, trend, and Benford's Law tests.\n\n\n*** Data analysis reports ***\nReports produced using specific audit commands such as filtering records and joining data files.\n\n\n*** Continuous monitoring ***\nContinuous monitoring is an ongoing process for acquiring, analyzing, and reporting on business data to identify and respond to operational business risks. For auditors to ensure a comprehensive approach to acquire, analyze, and report on business data, they must make certain the organization continuously monitors user activity on all computer systems, business transactions and processes, and application controls.\n\n\n*** Curb stoning in surveys ***\nCurb stoning is the term for instances where a surveyor completes a survey form by making up data. Because some of the data should conform with Benford's law, this practice can be detected using CAATTs which provide the capability of performing such tests.\n\n\n*** Note on the acronyms CAATTs vs CAATs ***\nCAATTs and CAATs are used interchangeably. While CAATs has emerged as the more common spelling, CAATTs is the more precise acronym. The acronym CAATTs solves one of the two problems with defining the acronym. CAATs means:\nComputer Aided (or Assisted) Audit Techniques (or Tools and Techniques)\nThe first \"A\" and the \"T\" can have two different meanings depending on who uses the term. By using the term CAATTs, one is clearly incorporating both \"Tools\" AND \"Techniques.\"\n\n== Comparison of tools ==\n\n\n*** Comparison by specification ***\n\n\n*** Comparison by analysis features ***\nThe following table compares features of specialized computer-aided audit tools. The table has several fields, as follows:\n\nProduct Name: Product's name; sometime includes edition if a certain edition is targeted.\nAge analysis: Specifies whether the product supports making age analysis (stratification by date).\nBenford's law: Specifies whether the product supports finding abnormal distribution of specific digits accordingly to Benford's law.\nCalculated field: Specifies whether the product supports adding extra calculated fields into the table/file.

      "context": "Computer-aided audit tools\n\n==Introduction==\nComputer-assisted audit tool (CAATs) or computer-assisted audit tools and techniques (CAATTs) is a growing field within the IT audit profession. CAATs is the practice of using computers to automate the IT audit processes. CAATs normally include using basic office productivity software such as spreadsheets, word processors and text editing programs and more advanced software packages involving use statistical analysis and business intelligence tools. But also more dedicated specialized software are available (see below).\nCAATs have become synonymous with data analytics in the audit process.\n\n== Traditional auditing vs CAATs ==\n\n\n*** Traditional audit example ***\nThe traditional method of auditing allows auditors to build conclusions based upon a limited sample of a population, rather than an examination of all available or a large sample of data.\n\n\n*** CAATTs alternative ***\nCAATTs, not CAATs,  addresses these problems. CAATTs, as it is commonly used, is the practice of analyzing large volumes of data looking for anomalies. A well-designed CAATTs audit will not be a sample, but rather a complete review of all transactions. Using CAATTs the auditor will extract every transaction the business unit performed during the period reviewed. The auditor will then test that data to determine if there are any problems in the data.\n\n\n*** Traditional audit vs CAATTs on specific risks ***\nAnother advantage of CAATTs is that it allows auditors to test for specific risks. For example, an insurance company may want to ensure that it doesn't pay any claims after a policy is terminated. Using traditional audit techniques this risk would be very difficult to test. The auditor would \"randomly select\" a \"statistically valid\" sample of claims (usually if any of those claims were processed after a policy was terminated). Since the insurance company might process millions of claims the odds that any of those 30\u201350 \"randomly selected\" claims occurred after the policy was terminated is extremely unlikely.\nUsing CAATTs the auditor can select every claim that had a date of service after the policy termination date. The auditor then can determine if any claims were inappropriately paid. If they were, the auditor can then figure out why the controls to prevent this failure. In a real-life audit, the CAATTs auditor noted that several claims had been paid after policies were terminated. Using CAATTs the auditor was able to identify every claim that was paid and the exact dollar amount incorrectly paid by the insurance company. Furthermore, the auditor was able to identify the reason why these claims were paid. The reason why they were paid was because the participant paid their premium. The insurance company, having received a payment, paid the claims. Then after paying the claim the participant's check bounced. When the check bounced, the participant's policy was retrospectively terminated, but the claim was still paid costing the company hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.\nWhich looks better in an audit report:\n\"Audit reviewed 50 transactions and noted one transaction that was processed incorrectly\"\nor\n\"Audit used CAATTs and tested every transaction over the past year. We noted XXX exceptions wherein the company paid YYY dollars on terminated policies.\"\nHowever, the CAATTs driven review is limited only to the data saved on files in accordance with a systematic pattern. Much data is never documented this way. In addition saved data often contains deficiencies, is poorly classified, is not easy to get, and it might be hard to become convinced about its integrity. So, for the present CAATTs is a complement to an auditor's tools and techniques. In certain audits, CAATTs can't be used at all. But there are also audits that simply can't be made with due care and efficiently without CAATTs.\n\n== Specialized software ==\nIn the most general terms, CAATTs can refer to any computer program utilized to improve the audit process. Generally, however, it is used to refer to any data extraction and analysis software. This would include programs such as data analysis and extraction tools, spreadsheets (e.g. Excel), databases (e.g. Access), statistical analysis (e.g. SAS), generalized audit software (e.g. ACL, Arbutus, EAS), business intelligence (e.g. Crystal Reports and Business Objects), etc.\nBenefits of audit software include:\n\nThey are independent of the system being audited and will use a read-only copy of the file to avoid any corruption of an organization\u2019s data.\nMany audit-specific routines are used such as sampling.\nProvides documentation of each test performed in the software that can be used as documentation in the auditor\u2019s work papers.Audit specialized software may perform the following functions:\n\nData queries.\nData stratification.\nSample extractions.\nMissing sequence identification.\nStatistical analysis.\nCalculations.\nDuplicate transaction identification.\nPivot table creation.\nCross tabulation.\n\n== CAATs Education and Professional Development ==\n\n\n*** CAATs Courses ***\nCAATs are the fundamental tool that is used by the auditors. This tool facilitates them to make search from the irregularities from the given data. With the help of this tool, the auditors and accountants of any firm will be able to provide more analytical results.

With the help of computer-assisted audit techniques, more forensic accounting with more analysis can be done. It\u2019s really a helpful tool that helps the firm auditor to work in an efficient and productive manner. Working with the CAATs, it is essential for the accountant or the auditor to select the right data, the selection process is very much tricky, and you need to be professional for it.

    "instruction": "KARMA attack\n\n==Introduction==\nIn information security, KARMA is an attack that exploits a behaviour of some Wi-Fi devices, combined with the lack of access point authentication in numerous WiFi protocols. It is a variant of the evil twin attack. Details of the attack were first published in 2004 by Dino dai Zovi and Shaun Macaulay.Vulnerable client devices broadcast a \"preferred network list\" (PNL), which contains the SSIDs of access points to which they have previously connected and are willing to automatically reconnect without user intervention. These broadcasts are not encrypted and hence may be received by any WiFi access point in range. The KARMA attack consists in an access point receiving this list and then giving itself an SSID from the PNL, thus becoming an evil twin of an access point already trusted by the client.Once that has been done, if the client receives the malicious access point's signal more strongly than that of the genuine access point (for example, if the genuine access point is nowhere nearby), and if the client does not attempt to authenticate the access point, then the attack should succeed. If the attack succeeds, then the malicious access point becomes a man in the middle (MITM), which positions it to deploy other attacks against the victim device.What distinguishes KARMA from a plain evil twin attack is the use of the PNL, which allows the attacker to know, rather than simply to guess, which SSIDs (if any) the client will automatically attempt to connect to.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the text above, answer my questions:\n\n",

      "context": "KARMA attack\n\n==Introduction==\nIn information security, KARMA is an attack that exploits a behaviour of some Wi-Fi devices, combined with the lack of access point authentication in numerous WiFi protocols. It is a variant of the evil twin attack. Details of the attack were first published in 2004 by Dino dai Zovi and Shaun Macaulay.Vulnerable client devices broadcast a \"preferred network list\" (PNL), which contains the SSIDs of access points to which they have previously connected and are willing to automatically reconnect without user intervention. These broadcasts are not encrypted and hence may be received by any WiFi access point in range. The KARMA attack consists in an access point receiving this list and then giving itself an SSID from the PNL, thus becoming an evil twin of an access point already trusted by the client.Once that has been done, if the client receives the malicious access point's signal more strongly than that of the genuine access point (for example, if the genuine access point is nowhere nearby), and if the client does not attempt to authenticate the access point, then the attack should succeed. If the attack succeeds, then the malicious access point becomes a man in the middle (MITM), which positions it to deploy other attacks against the victim device.What distinguishes KARMA from a plain evil twin attack is the use of the PNL, which allows the attacker to know, rather than simply to guess, which SSIDs (if any) the client will automatically attempt to connect to.\n\n\n\n",

    "instruction": "OpenVZ\n\n==Introduction==\nOpenVZ (Open Virtuozzo) is an operating-system-level virtualization technology for Linux. It allows a physical server to run multiple isolated operating system instances, called containers, virtual private servers (VPSs), or virtual environments (VEs). OpenVZ is similar to Solaris Containers and LXC.\n\n== OpenVZ compared to other virtualization technologies ==\nWhile virtualization technologies such as VMware, Xen and KVM provide full virtualization and can run multiple operating systems and different kernel versions, OpenVZ uses a single Linux kernel and therefore can run only Linux. All OpenVZ containers share the same architecture and kernel version. This can be a disadvantage in situations where guests require different kernel versions than that of the host. However, as it does not have the overhead of a true hypervisor, it is very fast and efficient.Memory allocation with OpenVZ is soft in that memory not used in one virtual environment can be used by others or for disk caching. While old versions of OpenVZ used a common file system (where each virtual environment is just a directory of files that is isolated using chroot), current versions of OpenVZ allow each container to have its own file system.\n\n== Kernel ==\nThe OpenVZ kernel is a Linux kernel, modified to add support for OpenVZ containers. The modified kernel provides virtualization, isolation, resource management, and checkpointing. As of vzctl 4.0, OpenVZ can work with unpatched Linux 3.x kernels, with a reduced feature set.\n\n\n*** Virtualization and isolation ***\nEach container is a separate entity, and behaves largely as a physical server would. Each has its own:\n\nFiles\nSystem libraries, applications, virtualized /proc and /sys, virtualized locks, etc.Users and groups\nEach container has its own root user, as well as other users and groups.Process tree\nA container only sees its own processes (starting from init). PIDs are virtualized, so that the init PID is 1 as it should be.Network\nVirtual network device, which allows a container to have its own IP addresses, as well as a set of netfilter (iptables), and routing rules.Devices\nIf needed, any container can be granted access to real devices like network interfaces, serial ports, disk partitions, etc.IPC objects\nShared memory, semaphores, messages.\n\n\n*** Resource management ***\nOpenVZ resource management consists of four components: two-level disk quota, fair CPU scheduler, disk I/O scheduler, and user bean counters (see below). These resources can be changed during container run time, eliminating the need to reboot.\n\n\n**** Two-level disk quota ****\nEach container can have its own disk quotas, measured in terms of disk blocks and inodes (roughly number of files). Within the container, it is possible to use standard tools to set UNIX per-user and per-group disk quotas.\n\n\n**** CPU scheduler ****\nThe CPU scheduler in OpenVZ is a two-level implementation of fair-share scheduling strategy.\nOn the first level, the scheduler decides which container it is to give the CPU time slice to, based on per-container cpuunits values. On the second level the standard Linux scheduler decides which process to run in that container, using standard Linux process priorities.\nIt is possible to set different values for the CPUs in each container. Real CPU time will be distributed proportionally to these values.\nIn addition to the above, OpenVZ provides ways to:\n\nset strict CPU limits, such as 10% of a total CPU time (--cpulimit);\nlimit number of CPU cores available to container (--cpus);\nbind a container to a specific set of CPUs (--cpumask).\n\n\n**** I/O scheduler ****\nSimilar to the CPU scheduler described above, I/O scheduler in OpenVZ is also two-level, utilizing Jens Axboe's CFQ I/O scheduler on its second level.\nEach container is assigned an I/O priority, and the scheduler distributes the available I/O bandwidth according to the priorities assigned. Thus no single container can saturate an I/O channel.\n\n\n**** User Beancounters ****\nUser Beancounters is a set of per-container counters, limits, and guarantees, meant to prevent a single container from monopolizing system resources. In current OpenVZ kernels (RHEL6-based 042stab*) there are two primary parameters (ram and swap, a.k.a. physpages and swappages), and others are optional.Other resources are mostly memory and various in-kernel objects such as Inter-process communication shared memory segments and network buffers.  Each resource can be seen from /proc/user_beancounters and has five values associated with it: current usage, maximum usage (for the lifetime of a container), barrier, limit, and fail counter. The meaning of barrier and limit is parameter-dependent; in short, those can be thought of as a soft limit and a hard limit. If any resource hits the limit, the fail counter for it is increased.  This allows the owner to detect problems by monitoring /proc/user_beancounters in the container.\n\n\n*** Checkpointing and live migration ***\nA live migration and checkpointing feature was released for OpenVZ in the middle of April 2006. This makes it possible to move a container from one physical server to another without shutting down the container. The process is known as checkpointing: a container is frozen and its whole state is saved to a file on disk. This file can then be transferred to another machine and a container can be unfrozen (restored) there; the delay is roughly a few seconds.  Because state is usually preserved completely, this pause may appear to be an ordinary computational delay.\n\n== Limitations ==\nBy default, OpenVZ restricts container access to real physical devices (thus making a container hardware-independent). An OpenVZ administrator can enable container access to various real devices, such as disk drives, USB ports, PCI devices or physical network cards./dev/loopN is often restricted in deployments (as loop devices use kernel threads which might be a security issue), which restricts the ability to mount disk images. A work-around is to use FUSE.\nOpenVZ is limited to providing only some VPN technologies based on PPP (such as PPTP/L2TP) and TUN/TAP. IPsec is supported inside containers since kernel 2.6.32.\nA graphical user interface called EasyVZ was attempted in 2007, but it did not progress beyond version 0.1. Up to version 3.4, Proxmox VE could be used as an OpenVZ-based server virtualization environment with a GUI, although later versions switched to LXC.\n\nUsing the text above, answer my questions:\n\n",

Answer8: The live migration and checkpointing feature in OpenVZ allows moving a container from one physical server to another without shutting down the container. The container is frozen and its whole state is saved to a file on disk, which can then be transferred to another machine and a container can be unfrozen there.\n\nQuestion9: How does OpenVZ handle container access to real physical devices? Answer9: By default, OpenVZ restricts container access to real physical devices to make a container hardware-independent. However, an OpenVZ administrator can enable container access to various real devices, such as disk drives, USB ports, PCI devices or physical network cards.\n\nQuestion10: What are the limitations of OpenVZ in providing VPN technologies? Answer10: OpenVZ is limited to providing only some VPN technologies based on PPP (such as PPTP/L2TP) and TUN/TAP. IPsec is supported inside containers since kernel 2.6.32.\n\nQuestion11: What happened to EasyVZ, the graphical user interface for OpenVZ? Answer11: EasyVZ was attempted in 2007, but it did not progress beyond version 0.1.\n\nQuestion12: How does OpenVZ handle memory allocation for containers? Answer12: Memory allocation with OpenVZ is soft, meaning that memory not used in one virtual environment can be used by others or for disk caching. Each container can have its own file system in current versions of OpenVZ.\n\nQuestion13: What is the role of the OpenVZ kernel in container virtualization? Answer13: The OpenVZ kernel is a Linux kernel, modified to add support for OpenVZ containers. The modified kernel provides virtualization, isolation, resource management, and checkpointing.\n\nQuestion14: How does the fair CPU scheduler work in OpenVZ? Answer14: The fair CPU scheduler in OpenVZ decides which container to give the CPU time slice to, based on per-container cpuunits values. The standard Linux scheduler then decides which process to run in that container.\n\nQuestion15: How do user bean counters work in OpenVZ? Answer15: User bean counters in OpenVZ are per-container counters, limits, and guarantees, meant to prevent a single container from monopolizing system resources. Each resource can be seen from /proc/user\\_beancounters and has five values associated with it: current usage, maximum usage, barrier, limit, and fail counter."

    "output": "question1: How is an adversary's advantage defined in cryptography? answer1: In cryptography, an adversary's advantage is a measure of how successfully an adversary, which is itself an algorithm, can attack a cryptographic algorithm. It is defined as the ability to distinguish the cryptographic algorithm from an idealized version of that type of algorithm. A cryptographic algorithm is considered secure if no adversary has a non-negligible advantage, subject to specified bounds on the adversary's computational resources. question2: What is the significance of the term \"negligible\" in the context of an adversary's advantage? answer2: In this context, \"negligible\" usually means \"within O(2\u2212p)\" where p is a security parameter associated with the algorithm. For example, p might be the number of bits in a block cipher's key. question3: What is the role of an oracle in cryptography? answer3: An oracle is a probabilistic algorithm that is used to study a function. It is given as input to an adversary, which is also a probabilistic algorithm. The adversary's job is to distinguish the given oracle from an idealized version of that type of function by making queries to the oracle. question4: How is the advantage of an adversary calculated in cryptography? answer4: The advantage of an adversary is calculated by comparing the success rate of the adversary in distinguishing the given function from an idealized version of that type of function. question5: What is a chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) in cryptography? answer5: A chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) is a type of attack in which the adversary is given encrypt plaintext of their choosing. The advantage calculated in this scenario is called the CPA-advantage of a given adversary. question6: What is a chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) in cryptography? answer6: A chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) is a type of attack in which the adversary is given both encryption and decryption oracles. The advantage calculated in this scenario is called the CCA-advantage of a given adversary. question7: What is the difference between a CPA and a CCA in cryptography? answer7: The main difference between a CPA and a CCA is the availability of decryption oracles. In a CPA, the adversary is only given encrypt plaintext of their choosing, while in a CCA, the adversary is given both encryption and decryption oracles. question8: What is the role of the security parameter p in cryptography? answer8: The security parameter p is a value associated with a cryptographic algorithm that is used to specify bounds on the adversary's computational resources. It is typically the number of bits in a block cipher's key. question9: What is Stirling's approximation and how is it used in cryptography? answer9: Stirling's approximation is a formula used to approximate the factorial of a large number. In cryptography, it is used to approximate the number of possible permutations on a given number of bits. question10: How is an idealized version of a block cipher defined in cryptography? answer10: An idealized version of a block cipher is defined as a permutation selected at random from the set of all possible permutations on a given number of bits. question11: How is the advantage of an adversary calculated in the context of a block cipher? answer11: The advantage of an adversary in the context of a block cipher is calculated by comparing the success rate of the adversary in distinguishing the given block cipher from an idealized version of that type of function. question12: How is the idealized version of a block cipher implemented in cryptography? answer12: The idealized version of a block cipher can be implemented with storage space proportional to the number of queries using a random oracle. question13: What is the significance of the key length in a block cipher? answer13: The key length in a block cipher determines the number of possible keys that can be used to encrypt and decrypt data. A longer key length generally results in a more secure cipher. question14: How is the key length of an idealized block cipher defined in cryptography? answer14: The key length of an idealized block cipher is defined as the number of bits required to specify a randomly selected permutation from the set of all possible permutations on a given number of bits. question15: How is the number of possible permutations on a given number of bits calculated in cryptography? answer15: The number of possible permutations on a given number of bits is calculated using the factorial function, which is approximated using Stirling's approximation in cryptography.",

      "qa_list": "question1: How is an adversary's advantage defined in cryptography? answer1: In cryptography, an adversary's advantage is a measure of how successfully an adversary, which is itself an algorithm, can attack a cryptographic algorithm. It is defined as the ability to distinguish the cryptographic algorithm from an idealized version of that type of algorithm. A cryptographic algorithm is considered secure if no adversary has a non-negligible advantage, subject to specified bounds on the adversary's computational resources. question2: What is the significance of the term \"negligible\" in the context of an adversary's advantage? answer2: In this context, \"negligible\" usually means \"within O(2\u2212p)\" where p is a security parameter associated with the algorithm. For example, p might be the number of bits in a block cipher's key. question3: What is the role of an oracle in cryptography? answer3: An oracle is a probabilistic algorithm that is used to study a function. It is given as input to an adversary, which is also a probabilistic algorithm. The adversary's job is to distinguish the given oracle from an idealized version of that type of function by making queries to the oracle. question4: How is the advantage of an adversary calculated in cryptography? answer4: The advantage of an adversary is calculated by comparing the success rate of the adversary in distinguishing the given function from an idealized version of that type of function. question5: What is a chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) in cryptography? answer5: A chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) is a type of attack in which the adversary is given encrypt plaintext of their choosing. The advantage calculated in this scenario is called the CPA-advantage of a given adversary. question6: What is a chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) in cryptography? answer6: A chosen-ciphertext attack (CCA) is a type of attack in which the adversary is given both encryption and decryption oracles. The advantage calculated in this scenario is called the CCA-advantage of a given adversary. question7: What is the difference between a CPA and a CCA in cryptography? answer7: The main difference between a CPA and a CCA is the availability of decryption oracles. In a CPA, the adversary is only given encrypt plaintext of their choosing, while in a CCA, the adversary is given both encryption and decryption oracles. question8: What is the role of the security parameter p in cryptography? answer8: The security parameter p is a value associated with a cryptographic algorithm that is used to specify bounds on the adversary's computational resources. It is typically the number of bits in a block cipher's key. question9: What is Stirling's approximation and how is it used in cryptography? answer9: Stirling's approximation is a formula used to approximate the factorial of a large number. In cryptography, it is used to approximate the number of possible permutations on a given number of bits. question10: How is an idealized version of a block cipher defined in cryptography? answer10: An idealized version of a block cipher is defined as a permutation selected at random from the set of all possible permutations on a given number of bits. question11: How is the advantage of an adversary calculated in the context of a block cipher? answer11: The advantage of an adversary in the context of a block cipher is calculated by comparing the success rate of the adversary in distinguishing the given block cipher from an idealized version of that type of function. question12: How is the idealized version of a block cipher implemented in cryptography? answer12: The idealized version of a block cipher can be implemented with storage space proportional to the number of queries using a random oracle. question13: What is the significance of the key length in a block cipher? answer13: The key length in a block cipher determines the number of possible keys that can be used to encrypt and decrypt data. A longer key length generally results in a more secure cipher. question14: How is the key length of an idealized block cipher defined in cryptography? answer14: The key length of an idealized block cipher is defined as the number of bits required to specify a randomly selected permutation from the set of all possible permutations on a given number of bits. question15: How is the number of possible permutations on a given number of bits calculated in cryptography? answer15: The number of possible permutations on a given number of bits is calculated using the factorial function, which is approximated using Stirling's approximation in cryptography."

However, it is a truism that attacks only get better with time, and we cannot anticipate what improvements to our attacks, or entirely new attacks, may yet be discovered.\" \u2014 Nadhem J. AlFardan and Kenny Paterson\nThe researchers only examined Free Software implementations of TLS and found all examined products to be potentially vulnerable to the attack.\nThey have tested their attacks successfully against OpenSSL and GnuTLS. Because the researchers applied responsible disclosure and worked with the software vendors,\nsome software updates to mitigate the attacks were available at the time of publication.Martin R.

    "instruction": "context: Directory traversal attack\n\n==Introduction==\nA directory traversal (or path traversal) is a form of insecure direct object reference where insufficient security validation or sanitization of user-supplied file names can be exploited, such that characters representing \"traverse to parent directory\" are passed through to the operating system's file system API. An affected application can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the file system.\n\n\n\n== Example ==\nA typical example of a vulnerable application in PHP code is:\n\nAn attack against this system could be to send the following HTTP request:\n\nThe server would then generate a response such as:\n\nThe repeated ../ characters after /home/users/phpguru/templates/ have caused \ninclude() to traverse to the root directory, and then include the Unix password file /etc/passwd.\nUnix /etc/passwd is a common file used to demonstrate directory traversal, as it is often used by crackers to try cracking the passwords. However, in more recent Unix systems, the /etc/passwd file does not contain the hashed passwords, and they are instead located in the /etc/shadow file, which cannot be read by unprivileged users on the machine. Even in that case, though, reading /etc/passwd does still show a list of user accounts.\n\n== Variations ==\nDirectory traversal in its simplest form uses the ../ pattern. Some common variations are listed below:\n\n\n*** Microsoft Windows ***\nMicrosoft Windows and DOS directory traversal uses the ..\\ or ../ patterns.Each partition has a separate root directory (labeled C:\\ where C could be any partition), and there is no common root directory above that. This means that for most directory vulnerabilities on Windows, attacks are limited to a single partition.\nDirectory traversal has been the cause of numerous Microsoft vulnerabilities.\n\n\n*** Percent encoding in URIs ***\nSome web applications attempt to prevent directory traversal by scanning the path of a request URI for patterns such as ../. This check is sometimes mistakenly performed before percent-decoding, causing URIs containing patterns like %2e%2e/ to be accepted despite being decoded into ../ before actual use.\n\n\n**** Double encoding ****\nPercent decoding may accidentally be performed multiple times; once before validation, but again afterwards, making the application vulnerable to Double percent-encoding attacks in which illegal characters are replaced by their double-percent-encoded form in order to bypass security countermeasures. For example, in a double percent-encoding attack, ../ may be replaced by its double-percent-encoded form %252E%252E%252F. This kind of vulnerability notably affected versions 5.0 and earlier of Microsoft's IIS web server software.\n\n\n**** UTF-8 ****\nA badly implemented UTF-8 decoder may accept characters encoded using more bytes than necessary, leading to alternative character representations, such as %2e and %c0%ae both representing .. This is specifically forbidden by the UTF-8 standard, but has still led to directory traversal vulnerabilities in software such as the IIS web server.\n\n\n*** Archives ***\nSome archive formats like zip allow for directory traversal attacks: files in the archive can be written such that they overwrite files on the filesystem by backtracking. Code that extracts archive files can be written to check that the paths of the files in the archive do not engage in path traversal.\n\n== Prevention ==\nA possible algorithm for preventing directory traversal would be to:\n\nProcess URI requests that do not result in a file request, e.g., executing a hook into user code, before continuing below.\nWhen a URI request for a file/directory is to be made, build a full path to the file/directory if it exists, and normalize all characters (e.g., %20 converted to spaces).\nIt is assumed that a 'Document Root' fully qualified, normalized, path is known, and this string has a length N. Assume that no files outside this directory can be served.\nEnsure that the first N characters of the fully qualified path to the requested file is exactly the same as the 'Document Root'.\nIf so, allow the file to be returned.\nIf not, return an error, since the request is clearly out of bounds from what the web-server should be allowed to serve.Using a hard-coded predefined file extension to suffix the path does not necessarily limit the scope of the attack to files of that file extension.\n\nThe user can use the NULL character (indicating the end of the string) in order to bypass everything after the $_GET.

    "instruction": "context: DirectAccess\n\n==Introduction==\nDirectAccess, also known as Unified Remote Access, is a VPN technology that provides intranet connectivity to client computers when they are connected to the Internet. Unlike many traditional VPN connections, which must be initiated and terminated by explicit user action, DirectAccess connections are designed to connect automatically as soon as the computer connects to the Internet. DirectAccess was introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2, providing this service to Windows 7 and Windows 8 \"Enterprise\" edition clients. In 2010, Microsoft Forefront Unified Access Gateway (UAG) was released, which simplifies the deployment of DirectAccess for Windows 2008 R2, and includes additional components that make it easier to integrate without the need to deploy IPv6 on the network, and with a dedicated user interface for the configuration and monitoring. Some requirements and limitations that were part of the design of DirectAccess with Windows Server 2008 R2 and UAG have been changed (see requirements below). While DirectAccess is based on Microsoft technology, third-party solutions exist for accessing internal UNIX and Linux servers through DirectAccess. With Windows Server 2012, DirectAccess is fully integrated into the operating system, providing a user interface to configure and native IPv6 and IPv4 support.\n\n\n\n== Technology ==\nDirectAccess establishes IPsec tunnels from the client to the DirectAccess server, and uses IPv6 to reach intranet resources or other DirectAccess clients. This technology encapsulates the IPv6 traffic over IPv4 to be able to reach the intranet over the Internet, which still (mostly) relies on IPv4 traffic. All traffic to the intranet is encrypted using IPsec and encapsulated in IPv4 packets (if a native IPv6 connection cannot be established), which means that in most cases, no configuration of firewalls or proxies should be required. A DirectAccess client can use one of several tunneling technologies, depending on the configuration of the network the client is connected to. The client can use 6to4, Teredo tunneling, or IP-HTTPS, provided the server is configured correctly to be able to use them. For example, a client that is connected to the Internet directly will use 6to4, but if it is inside a NATed network, it will use Teredo instead. In addition, Windows Server 2012 provides two backward compatibility services DNS64 and NAT64, which allows DirectAccess clients to communicate with servers inside the corporate network even if those servers are only capable of IPv4 networking. Due to the globally routable nature of IPv6, computers on the corporate network can also initiate a connection to DirectAccess clients, which allows them to remotely manage (Manage Out) these clients at any time.\n\n== Benefits ==\nDirectAccess can be deployed for multiple sites. It allows for a secure encrypted VPN. This is controlled through Group Policies which allows the administrator to maintain a secure network.\n\n== Requirements ==\nDirectAccess With Windows Server 2008 R2 or UAG requires:\n\nOne or more DirectAccess servers running Windows Server 2008 R2 with two network adapters: one that is connected directly to the Internet, and a second that is connected to the intranet.\nOn the DirectAccess server, at least two consecutive, public IPv4 addresses assigned to the network adapter that is connected to the Internet.\nDirectAccess clients running Windows 7 \"Ultimate\" or \"Enterprise\" editions or Windows 8 \"Enterprise\" edition clients\nAt least one domain controller and Domain Name System (DNS) server running Windows Server 2008 SP2 or Windows Server 2008 R2.\nPublic key infrastructure (PKI) to issue computer certificates.DirectAccess With Windows Server 2012 requires:\n\nOne or more DirectAccess servers running Windows Server 2012 with one or more network adapters.\nAt least one domain controller and Domain Name System (DNS) server running Windows Server 2008 SP2 or Windows Server 2008 R2.\nDirectAccess clients running Windows 7 \"Ultimate\" or \"Enterprise\" editions or Windows 8 \"Enterprise\" edition clients\nA Public Key Infrastructure is not required for Windows 8 Clients.Smart card certificates, and health certificates for Network Access Protection may be used along with PKI.\nNow I will ask you some questions, and you will answer.\n\n",

      "context": "DirectAccess\n\n==Introduction==\nDirectAccess, also known as Unified Remote Access, is a VPN technology that provides intranet connectivity to client computers when they are connected to the Internet. Unlike many traditional VPN connections, which must be initiated and terminated by explicit user action, DirectAccess connections are designed to connect automatically as soon as the computer connects to the Internet. DirectAccess was introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2, providing this service to Windows 7 and Windows 8 \"Enterprise\" edition clients. In 2010, Microsoft Forefront Unified Access Gateway (UAG) was released, which simplifies the deployment of DirectAccess for Windows 2008 R2, and includes additional components that make it easier to integrate without the need to deploy IPv6 on the network, and with a dedicated user interface for the configuration and monitoring. Some requirements and limitations that were part of the design of DirectAccess with Windows Server 2008 R2 and UAG have been changed (see requirements below). While DirectAccess is based on Microsoft technology, third-party solutions exist for accessing internal UNIX and Linux servers through DirectAccess. With Windows Server 2012, DirectAccess is fully integrated into the operating system, providing a user interface to configure and native IPv6 and IPv4 support.\n\n\n\n== Technology ==\nDirectAccess establishes IPsec tunnels from the client to the DirectAccess server, and uses IPv6 to reach intranet resources or other DirectAccess clients. This technology encapsulates the IPv6 traffic over IPv4 to be able to reach the intranet over the Internet, which still (mostly) relies on IPv4 traffic. All traffic to the intranet is encrypted using IPsec and encapsulated in IPv4 packets (if a native IPv6 connection cannot be established), which means that in most cases, no configuration of firewalls or proxies should be required. A DirectAccess client can use one of several tunneling technologies, depending on the configuration of the network the client is connected to. The client can use 6to4, Teredo tunneling, or IP-HTTPS, provided the server is configured correctly to be able to use them. For example, a client that is connected to the Internet directly will use 6to4, but if it is inside a NATed network, it will use Teredo instead. In addition, Windows Server 2012 provides two backward compatibility services DNS64 and NAT64, which allows DirectAccess clients to communicate with servers inside the corporate network even if those servers are only capable of IPv4 networking. Due to the globally routable nature of IPv6, computers on the corporate network can also initiate a connection to DirectAccess clients, which allows them to remotely manage (Manage Out) these clients at any time.\n\n== Benefits ==\nDirectAccess can be deployed for multiple sites. It allows for a secure encrypted VPN. This is controlled through Group Policies which allows the administrator to maintain a secure network.\n\n== Requirements ==\nDirectAccess With Windows Server 2008 R2 or UAG requires:\n\nOne or more DirectAccess servers running Windows Server 2008 R2 with two network adapters: one that is connected directly to the Internet, and a second that is connected to the intranet.\nOn the DirectAccess server, at least two consecutive, public IPv4 addresses assigned to the network adapter that is connected to the Internet.\nDirectAccess clients running Windows 7 \"Ultimate\" or \"Enterprise\" editions or Windows 8 \"Enterprise\" edition clients\nAt least one domain controller and Domain Name System (DNS) server running Windows Server 2008 SP2 or Windows Server 2008 R2.\nPublic key infrastructure (PKI) to issue computer certificates.DirectAccess With Windows Server 2012 requires:\n\nOne or more DirectAccess servers running Windows Server 2012 with one or more network adapters.\nAt least one domain controller and Domain Name System (DNS) server running Windows Server 2008 SP2 or Windows Server 2008 R2.\nDirectAccess clients running Windows 7 \"Ultimate\" or \"Enterprise\" editions or Windows 8 \"Enterprise\" edition clients\nA Public Key Infrastructure is not required for Windows 8 Clients.Smart card certificates, and health certificates for Network Access Protection may be used along with PKI.",

    "instruction": "Zombie cookie\n\n==Introduction==\nA zombie cookie is a piece of data that could be stored in multiple locations -- since failure of removing all copies of the zombie cookie will make the removal reversible, zombie cookies can be difficult to remove. Since they do not entirely rely on normal cookie protocols, the visitor's web browser may continue to recreate deleted cookies even though the user has opted not to receive cookies.\nThe term was used by Attorney Joseph H. Malley, who initiated the Super-Cookie class actions in 2010.\n\n== Purpose ==\nWeb analytics collecting companies use cookies to track Internet usage and pages visited for marketing research. Sites that want to collect user statistics will install a cookie from a traffic tracking site that will collect data on the user. As that user surfs around the web the cookie will add more information for each site that uses the traffic tracking cookie and sends it back to the main tracking server.\nZombie cookies allow the web traffic tracking companies to retrieve information such as previous unique user ID and continue tracking personal browsing habits. When the user ID is stored outside of a single browser's cookie storage, such as in a header injected by the network into HTTP requests, zombie cookies can track users across browsers on the same machine.Zombie cookies are also used to remember unique IDs used for logging into websites. This means that for a user who deletes all their cookies regularly, a site using this would still be able to personalize to that specific user.\n\n== Implications ==\nA user who does not want to be tracked may choose to decline or block third party cookies or delete cookies after each browsing session. Deleting all cookies will prevent some sites from tracking a user but it may also interfere with sites that users want to remember them. Removing tracking cookies is not the same as declining cookies. If cookies are deleted, the data collected by tracking companies becomes fragmented. For example, counting the same person as two separate unique users would falsely increase this particular site's unique user statistic. This is why some tracking companies use a type of zombie cookie.\n\n== Implementation ==\nAccording to TRUSTe: \"You can get valuable marketing insight by tracking individual users' movements on your site. But you must disclose your use of all personally identifiable information in order to comply with the Fair Information Practices guidelines\".Possible places in which zombie cookies may be hidden include:\n\nStandard HTTP cookies\nStoring cookies in and reading out web history\nStoring cookies in HTTP ETags\nInternet Explorer userData storage (starting IE9, userData is no longer supported)\nHTML5 Session Storage\nHTML5 Local Storage\nHTML5 Global Storage\nHTML5 Database Storage via SQLite\nStoring cookies in RGB values of auto-generated, force-cached PNGs using HTML5 Canvas tag to read pixels (cookies) back out\nLocal shared objects (Flash cookies)\nSilverlight Isolated Storage\nCookie syncing scripts that function as a cache cookie and respawn the MUID cookie\nTCP Fast Open\nTLS's Session IDIf a user is not able to remove the cookie from every one of these data stores then the cookie will be recreated to all of these stores on the next visit to the site that uses that particular cookie. Every company has their own implementation of zombie cookies and those are kept proprietary. An open-source implementation of zombie cookies, called Evercookie, is available.\n\n== Controversies ==\nIn 2015, TURN, an online advertising clearinghouse, introduced zombie cookies based on Flash Local Shared objects. Privacy advocates quickly denounced the technology.An academic study of zombie cookies was completed in 2009, by a team of researchers at UC Berkeley, where they noticed that cookies which had been deleted, kept coming back, over and over again. They cited this as a serious privacy breach. Since most users are barely aware of the storage methods used, it's unlikely that users will ever delete them all. From the Berkeley report: \"few websites disclose their use of Flash in privacy policies, and many companies using Flash are privacy certified by TRUSTe.\"Ringleader Digital made an effort to keep a persistent user ID even when the user deleted cookies and their HTML5 databases. The only way to opt-out of the tracking, was to use the company's opt-out link, which gives no confirmation. This resulted in a lawsuit against Ringleader Digital.\nThe term \"zombie cookie\" was created by Attorney Joseph H. Malley who initiated the Super-Cookie Class Actions in 2010. The etiology of the phrase was derived from his prior research into Apple's third-party iPhone applications. Some of these which had been criticized as being \"zombie-like\" applications such as the \"super-cookies\" which \"re-spawned\" when deleted. Attorney Malley envisioned a cookie that seemed to come back from the \"dead\". Blending the two ideas, he first coined the phrase Zombie Cookies within his filed Class Actions, as a means to enable the court, jury, and public understand the basis of the litigation.The Zombie Cookie lawsuits were filed suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against Quantcast, Clearspring, VideoEgg, and affiliated sites owned by Walt Disney Internet Group, Warner Bros. and others. According to the charges, Adobe Flash cookies are planted to \"track Plaintiffs and Class Members that visited non-Clearspring Flash Cookie Affiliates websites by having their online transmissions intercepted, without notice or consent\".Two \"supercookie\" mechanisms were found on Microsoft websites in 2011, including cookie syncing that respawned MUID cookies. Due to media attention, Microsoft later disabled this code.Consumer outrage related to Flash cookies and violation of consumers' privacy caused U.S. Congressional Hearings, led by Senators Al Franken and John Rockefeller. Reportedly, the \"Zombie Cookie\", aka Flash Cookie filings, forced Adobe Systems Inc. to stop processing flash cookies on 98% of all consumers' computing devices.The online advertising clearinghouse TURN implemented zombie cookies on Verizon mobile phones, using a hidden, unremovable number by which Verizon could track customers. After an article by ProPublica revealed this fact in January 2015, TURN claimed it had suspended usage of their zombie cookies.\n\nUsing the text above, answer my questions:\n\n",

    "output": "Q1: What is a zombie cookie and how is it stored? A1: A zombie cookie is a type of tracking mechanism that stores data in multiple locations, making it difficult to remove. Unlike regular cookies, zombie cookies can be recreated even if the user has opted out of cookie storage. They can be found in standard HTTP cookies, web history, HTTP ETags, Internet Explorer userData storage, HTML5 Session Storage, HTML5 Local Storage, HTML5 Global Storage, HTML5 Database Storage via SQLite, RGB values of PNGs, Local Shared Objects (Flash cookies), Silverlight Isolated Storage, and TCP Fast Open.\nQ2: Who created the term \"zombie cookie\" and why? A2: The term \"zombie cookie\" was created by Attorney Joseph H. Malley, who filed the Super-Cookie Class Actions in 2010. He coined the phrase to describe a cookie that seemed to come back from the dead, inspired by his research into Apple's third-party iPhone applications, which had been criticized for having \"zombie-like\" applications such as \"super-cookies\" that re-spawned when deleted.\nQ3: How do zombie cookies impact user privacy? A3: Zombie cookies can significantly impact user privacy, as they can be used to track users even when they delete regular cookies. Most users are unaware of the various storage methods used, making it unlikely for them to delete zombie cookies. This can lead to a serious breach of privacy.\nQ4: What controversy arose from TURN's implementation of zombie cookies in 2015? A4: In 2015, TURN introduced zombie cookies based on Flash Local Shared objects, which was quickly denounced by privacy advocates. This led to U.S. Congressional Hearings, consumer outrage, and ultimately, Adobe Systems Inc. stopping the processing of flash cookies on 98% of all consumers' computing devices.\nQ5: How do zombie cookies allow companies to track users across browsers on the same machine? A5: Zombie cookies store user ID information outside of a single browser's cookie storage, such as in a header injected by the network into HTTP requests. This allows them to track users across different browsers on the same machine, even if the user deletes their cookies regularly.\nQ6: Why is removing tracking cookies not the same as declining cookies? A6: When tracking cookies are removed, the data collected by tracking companies becomes fragmented, leading to issues such as counting the same person as two separate unique users. This can falsely increase a site's unique user statistic, which is why some companies use zombie cookies to continue tracking users.\nQ7: How do zombie cookies help companies gain valuable marketing insights? A7: Zombie cookies allow companies to track individual users' movements on their sites, providing valuable marketing insights. However, to comply with the Fair Information Practices guidelines, they must disclose their use of all personally identifiable information.\nQ8: What was Ringleader Digital's approach to persistent user ID tracking? A8: Ringleader Digital made an effort to keep a persistent user ID even when the user deleted cookies and their HTML5 databases. The only way to opt-out of the tracking was through the company's opt-out link, which provided no confirmation. This led to a lawsuit against Ringleader Digital.\nQ9: How do zombie cookies violate user consent in collecting personal data? A9: Zombie cookies can violate user consent, as they can be used to track users without their knowledge or explicit agreement. This is because they can be recreated even if the user has declined or deleted regular cookies.\nQ10: Why are zombie cookies considered difficult to remove? A10: Zombie cookies are difficult to remove because they are stored in multiple locations, and failure to remove all copies will result in their recreation. They do not rely solely on normal cookie protocols, making it challenging for users to delete them completely.\nQ11: How do zombie cookies affect a user's browsing experience? A11: Zombie cookies can affect a user's browsing experience by interfering with sites that users want to remember them, even if they have chosen to decline or delete regular cookies.\nQ12: What are the implications of zombie cookies on unique user statistics? A12: Zombie cookies can skew unique user statistics by counting the same person as multiple unique users after deleting their tracking cookies. This can lead to inflated user statistics for sites using zombie cookies.\nQ13: How can the use of zombie cookies lead to legal action against companies? A13: The use of zombie cookies can lead to legal action against companies if they do not disclose their use of personally identifiable information or provide a clear opt-out mechanism for users. This can result in lawsuits and negative publicity for the companies involved.\nQ14: How have consumer outrage and media attention impacted the use of zombie cookies? A14: Consumer outrage and media attention have led to U.S. Congressional Hearings, changes in company practices, and the discontinuation of certain zombie cookie tracking methods. This has forced companies to reconsider their use of these tracking mechanisms due to privacy concerns.\nQ15: What role does trust play in the use of zombie cookies by companies? A15: Trust plays a significant role in the use of zombie cookies, as most users are unaware of their existence or how they are used. Companies using zombie cookies may face backlash and legal action if they do not disclose their use of these tracking mechanisms, compromising user trust.",

This has forced companies to reconsider their use of these tracking mechanisms due to privacy concerns.\nQ15: What role does trust play in the use of zombie cookies by companies? A15: Trust plays a significant role in the use of zombie cookies, as most users are unaware of their existence or how they are used. Companies using zombie cookies may face backlash and legal action if they do not disclose their use of these tracking mechanisms, compromising user trust."

    "instruction": "context: Juice jacking\n\n==Introduction==\nJuice jacking is a theoretical type of compromise of devices like phones and tablets which use the same cable for charging and data transfer, typically a USB cable. The goal of the attack is to either install malware on the device, or to surreptitiously copy potentially sensitive data. As of April 2023 there have been no credible reported cases of juice jacking outside of research efforts.\n\n\n\n== Published research ==\nThe Wall of Sheep, an event at Defcon has set up and allowed public access to an informational juice jacking kiosk each year at DefCon since 2011. Their intent is to bring awareness of this attack to the general public. Each of the informational juice jacking kiosks set up at the Wall of Sheep village have included a hidden CPU which is used in some way to notify the user that they should not plug their devices in to public charging kiosks. The first informational juice jacking kiosk included a screen which would change from \"Free charging station\" to a warning message that the user \"should not trust public charging stations with their devices\". One of the researchers who designed the charging station for the Wall of Sheep has given public presentations which showcase more malicious acts which could be taken via the kiosk, such as data theft, device tracking and information on compromising existing charging kiosks.Security researcher Kyle Osborn released an attack framework called P2P-ADB in 2012 which utilized USB On-The-Go to connect an attacker's phone to a target victim's device. This framework included examples and proof of concepts which would allow attackers to unlock locked phones, steal data from a phone including authentication keys granting the attacker access to the target device owner's Google account.Security researcher graduates and students from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) released a proof of concept malicious tool \"Mactans\" which utilized the USB charging port on Apple mobile devices at the 2013 Blackhat USA security briefings. They utilized inexpensive hardware components to construct a small sized malicious wall charger which could infect an iPhone with the then-current version of iOS with malicious software while it was being charged. The software could defeat any security measures built into iOS and mask itself in the same way Apple masks background processes in iOS.Security researchers Karsten Nohl and Jakob Lell from SRLabs published their research on BadUSB during the 2014 Blackhat USA security briefings. Their presentation on this attack mentions that a cellphone or tablet device charging on an infected computer would be one of the simplest method of propagating the BadUSB vulnerability. They include example malicious firmware code that would infect Android devices with BadUSB.Researchers at Aries Security and the Wall of Sheep later revisited the juice jacking concept in 2016. They set up a \"Video Jacking\" charging station which was able to record the mirrored screen from phones plugged into their malicious charging station. Affected devices at the time included Android devices supporting SlimPort or MHL protocols over USB, as well as the most recent iPhone using a lightning charge cable connector.Researchers at Symantec disclosed their findings on an attack they dubbed \"Trustjacking\" during the 2018 RSA Conference. The researchers identified that when a user approves access for a computer on an iOS device over USB, that this trusted access level is also applied to the devices's iTunes API which is accessible over Wi-Fi. This would allow attackers access to an iOS device even after the user has unplugged the device from a malicious or infected USB based charge source.\nA researcher who goes by _MG_ released a USB cable implant they dubbed the \"O.MG Cable\". The O.MG Cable has a microcontroller embedded within the cable itself, a visual inspection would likely not detect a difference between the O.MG cable and a normal charging cable. The O.MG Cable allows attackers or red team penetration testers to remotely issue commands to the cable over Wi-Fi, and have those commands run on the host computer with the O.MG cable plugged in to it.\n\n== Public warnings and popular culture ==\nBrian Krebs was the first to report on this attack and coin the term \"juice jacking.\" After seeing the informational cell phone charging kiosk set up in the Wall of Sheep at DefCon 19 in August 2011, he wrote the first article on his security journalism site Krebs on Security. The Wall of Sheep researchers\u2014including Brian Markus, Joseph Mlodzianowski, and Robert Rowley\u2014designed the kiosk as an information tool to bring awareness to the potential attack vector, and they have discussed, but not released, tools publicly which perform malicious actions on the charging devices.An episode of the hacking series Hak5 released in September 2012 showcased a number of attacks which can be conducted using an attack framework named P2P-ADB released by Kyle Osborn. The P2P-ADB attack framework discussed utilizes one phone to attack another phone over a USB On-the-Go connection.In late 2012, a document was released by the NSA warning government employees who travel about the threat of juice jacking. The document reminded readers to only use their personal power charging cables during overseas travel, to not charge in public kiosks, and to not utilize other people's computers for charging.The Android Hackers Handbook released in March 2014 has dedicated sections discussing both juice jacking and the ADB-P2P framework.Juice jacking was the central focus on an episode of CSI: Cyber. Season 1: Episode 9, \"L0M1S\" aired in April 2015In November 2019, the Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney issued a public service announcement warning about the risks of juice jacking during the upcoming holiday travel season. This PSA came under scrutiny due to the fact that no public cases have come to light related to malicious charging kiosks found in public or any criminal cases being tried under the Los Angeles District Attorney's purview at the time of the PSA.On April 6, 2023, the FBI Denver Twitter account published a warning that \"bad actors have figured out ways to use public USB ports...\" as if the attack vector were novel.  At nearly the same time, the FCC updated a warning published in 2019 about multiple hacking attempts without citations. \"In some cases, criminals may have intentionally left cables plugged in at charging stations.\"  This update, along with tweets on April 11 gave credence to social media posts and internet news articles that spread the information as fact. There were no actual instances cited of this threat being used in the wild. The original FBI tweet was not based on specific intelligence.\n\n== Mitigation ==\n\nApple's iOS has taken multiple security measures to reduce the attack surface over USB including no longer allowing the device to automatically mount as a hard drive when plugged in over USB, as well as release security patches for vulnerabilities such as those exploited by Mactans.Android devices commonly prompt the user before allowing the device to be mounted as a hard drive when plugged in over USB. Since release 4.2.2, Android has implemented a whitelist verification step to prevent attackers from accessing the Android Debug Bridge without authorization.Juice jacking is not possible if a device is charged via a trusted AC adapter, battery backup device, or by utilizing a USB cable with only power wires and no data wires present. Similarly, a USB data blocker (sometimes referred to as a USB Condom) can be connected between a device and charging port to disallow a data connection.\nNow I will ask you some questions, and you will answer.\n\n",

Sophos develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security, email security, mobile security and unified threat management. Sophos is primarily focused on providing security software to 1- to 5,000-seat organizations. While not a primary focus, Sophos also protects home users, through free and paid antivirus solutions (Sophos Home/Home Premium) intended to demonstrate product functionality. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange until it was acquired by Thoma Bravo in February 2020.\n\n\n\n== Acquisitions and partnerships ==\nFrom September 2003 to February 2006, Sophos served as the parent company of ActiveState, a developer of programming tools for dynamic programming languages: in February 2006, ActiveState became an independent company when it was sold to Vancouver-based venture capitalist firm Pender Financial. In 2007, Sophos acquired ENDFORCE, a company based in Ohio, United States, which developed and sold security policy compliance and Network Access Control (NAC) software. In May 2011, Sophos announced the acquisition of Astaro, a privately held provider of network security solutions, headquartered in Wilmington, Massachusetts, USA and Karlsruhe, Germany. At the time Astaro was the 4th largest UTM (Unified Threat Management) vendor and while the deal made sense at the time Forbes questioned its viability. Sophos subsequently renamed the Astaro UTM to Sophos UTM.  In November 2016, Sophos acquired Barricade, a pioneering start-up with a powerful behavior-based analytics engine built on machine learning techniques, to strengthen synchronized security capabilities and next-generation network and endpoint protection. In February 2017, Sophos acquired Invincea, a software company that provides malware threat detection, prevention, and pre-breach forensic intelligence.In March 2020, Thoma Bravo acquired Sophos for US$3.9 billion.\nNow I will ask you some questions, and you will answer.\n\n",

This function can be \"easily\" computed in O(b2) time, where b is the total number of bits of the inputs.  Inverting this function requires finding the factors of a given integer N.

Note that f is not one-way for randomly selected integers p, q > 1, since the product will have 2 as a factor with probability 3/4 (because the probability that an arbitrary p is odd is 1/2, and likewise for q, so if they're chosen independently, the probability that both are odd is therefore 1/4; hence the probability that p or q is even, is 1 \u2212 1/4\n\n== Universal one-way function ==\nThere is an explicit function f that has been proved to be one-way, if and only if one-way functions exist.

They allow for the creation of secure cryptographic systems by making it computationally infeasible to determine the original input given only the output.\nquestion: What is the difference between a one-way function and a one-way permutation? answer: A one-way permutation is a one-way function that is also a permutation, meaning that it is bijective and therefore has an inverse.

The existence of a one-way function implies the existence of pseudorandom function families.\nquestion: What are bit commitment schemes and how are they related to one-way functions? answer: Bit commitment schemes are cryptographic protocols that allow one party to commit to a value while keeping it hidden from other parties, and then reveal the value at a later time. The existence of a one-way function implies the existence of bit commitment schemes.\nquestion: What are private-key encryption schemes secure against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack and how are they related to one-way functions? answer: Private-key encryption schemes secure against adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack are cryptographic systems that allow two parties to securely communicate over an insecure channel using a shared secret key.

The existence of a one-way function implies the existence of message authentication codes.\nquestion: What are digital signature schemes secure against adaptive chosen-message attack and how are they related to one-way functions? answer: Digital signature schemes secure against adaptive chosen-message attack are cryptographic systems that allow a party to sign a message in such a way that the signature can be verified by any other party, and the signature is secure against adaptive chosen-message attacks. The existence of a one-way function implies the existence of such schemes.\nquestion: What is the multiplication and factoring problem and how is it related to one-way functions? answer: The multiplication and factoring problem involves finding the prime factors of a given integer N. This problem is related to one-way functions because the function that takes as input two prime numbers p and q and returns their product can be efficiently computed, but inverting this function by factoring the product is believed to be hard.\nquestion: What is the universal one-way function and what is its significance in the context of one-way functions? answer: The universal one-way function is a function that has been proved to be one-way if and only if one-way functions exist.

Therefore, proving the existence of the universal one-way function would prove the existence of one-way functions.\nquestion: What is the complexity of the best factoring algorithms known? answer: The best factoring algorithms known run in O(exp(\u221a(64/9)b(log b)^2)) time, where b is the number of bits needed to represent N.\nquestion: What is the probability that the product of two randomly selected integers p and q has 2 as a factor? answer: The probability that the product of two randomly selected integers p and q has 2 as a factor is 3/4. This is because the probability that an arbitrary p or q is even is 1/2, and the events that p and q are odd or even are independent. Therefore, the probability that both p and q are odd is 1/4, and the probability that at least one of them is even is 3/4."

It is comparable in many respects to the European Union's NESSIE project and to the Advanced Encryption Standard process run by National Institute of Standards and Technology in the U.S.\n\n== Comparison with NESSIE ==\nThere is some overlap, and some conflict, between the NESSIE selections and the CRYPTREC draft recommendations. Both efforts include some of the best cryptographers in the world therefore conflicts in their selections and recommendations should be examined with care. For instance, CRYPTREC recommends several 64 bit block ciphers while NESSIE selected none, but CRYPTREC was obliged by its terms of reference to take into account existing standards and practices, while NESSIE was not. Similar differences in terms of reference account for CRYPTREC recommending at least one stream cipher, RC4, while the NESSIE report specifically said that it was notable that they had not selected any of those considered. RC4 is widely used in the SSL/TLS protocols; nevertheless, CRYPTREC recommended that it only be used with 128-bit keys. Essentially the same consideration led to CRYPTREC's inclusion of 160-bit message digest algorithms, despite their suggestion that they be avoided in new system designs. Also, CRYPTREC was unusually careful to examine variants and modifications of the techniques, or at least to discuss their care in doing so; this resulted in particularly detailed recommendations regarding them.\n\n== Background and sponsors ==\nCRYPTREC includes members from Japanese academia, industry, and government. It was started in May 2000 by combining efforts from several agencies who were investigating methods and techniques for implementing 'e-Government' in Japan.

Furthermore, CRYPTEC has responsibilities with regard to the Japanese contribution to the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC27 standardization effort.\n\n== Selection ==\nIn the first release in 2003, many Japanese ciphers were selected for the \"e-Government Recommended Ciphers List\": CIPHERUNICORN-E (NEC), Hierocrypt-L1 (Toshiba), and MISTY1 (Mitsubishi Electric) as 64 bit block ciphers, Camellia (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Mitsubishi Electric), CIPHERUNICORN-A (NEC), Hierocrypt-3 (Toshiba), and SC2000 (Fujitsu) as 128 bit block ciphers, and finally MUGI and MULTI-S01 (Hitachi) as stream ciphers.\nIn the revised release of 2013, the list was divided into three: \"e-Government Recommended Ciphers List\", \"Candidate Recommended Ciphers List\", and \"Monitored Ciphers List\". Most of the Japanese ciphers listed in the previous list (except for Camellia) have moved from the \"Recommended Ciphers List\" to the \"Candidate Recommended Ciphers List\". There were several new proposals, such as CLEFIA (Sony) as a 128 bit block cipher as well as KCipher-2 (KDDI) and Enocoro-128v2 (Hitachi) as stream ciphers. However, only KCipher-2 has been listed on the \"e-Government Recommended Ciphers List\". The reason why most Japanese ciphers have not been selected as \"Recommended Ciphers\" is not that these ciphers are necessarily unsafe, but that these ciphers are not widely used in commercial products, open-source projects, governmental systems, or international standards. There is the possibility that ciphers listed on \"Candidate Recommended Ciphers List\" will be moved to the \"e-Government Recommended Ciphers List\" when they are utilized more widely.\nIn addition, 128 bit RC4 and SHA-1 are listed on \"Monitored Ciphers List\". These are unsafe and only permitted to remain compatible with old systems.\nAfter the revision in 2013, there are several updates such as addition of ChaCha20-Poly1305, EdDSA and SHA-3, move of Triple DES to Monitored list, and deletion of RC4, etc.\n\n== CRYPTREC Ciphers List ==\nAs of March 2022\n\n\n*** e-Government Recommended Ciphers List ***\nPublic key ciphers\nSignature\nDSA\nECDSA\nRSA-PSS\nRSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5\nConfidentiality\nRSA-OAEP\nKey exchange\nDH\nECDH\nSymmetric key ciphers\n64-bit block ciphers\nN/A\n128-bit block ciphers\nAES\nCamellia\nStream ciphers\nKCipher-2\nHash functions\nSHA-256\nSHA-384\nSHA-512\nModes of operation\nEncryption modes\nCBC\nCFB\nCTR\nOFB\nAuthenticated encryption modes\nCCM\nGCM\nMessage authentication codes\nCMAC\nHMAC\nAuthenticated encryption\nN/A\nEntity authentication\nISO/IEC 9798-2\nISO/IEC 9798-3\n\n\n*** Candidate Recommended Ciphers List ***\nPublic key ciphers\nSignature\nEdDSA\nConfidentiality\nN/A\nKey exchange\nPSEC-KEM\nSymmetric key ciphers\n64-bit block ciphers\nCIPHERUNICORN-E\nHierocrypt-L1\nMISTY1\n128-bit block ciphers\nCIPHERUNICORN-A\nCLEFIA\nHierocrypt-3\nSC2000\nStream ciphers\nMUGI\nEnocoro-128v2\nMULTI-S01\nHash functions\nSHA-512/256\nSHA3-256\nSHA3-384\nSHA3-512\nSHAKE128\nSHAKE256\nModes of operation\nEncryption modes\nXTS\nAuthenticated encryption modes\nN/A\nMessage authentication codes\nPC-MAC-AES\nAuthenticated encryption\nChaCha20-Poly1305\nEntity authentication\nISO/IEC 9798-4\n\n\n*** Monitored Ciphers List ***\nPublic key ciphers\nSignature\nN/A\nConfidentiality\nRSAES-PKCS1-v1_5\nKey exchange\nN/A\nSymmetric key ciphers\n64-bit block ciphers\n3-key Triple DES\n128-bit block ciphers\nN/A\nStream ciphers\nN/A\nHash functions\nRIPEMD-160\nSHA-1\nModes of operation\nEncryption modes\nN/A\nAuthenticated encryption modes\nN/A\nMessage authentication codes\nCBC-MAC\nAuthenticated encryption\nN/A\nEntity authentication\nN/A\nNow I will ask you some questions, and you will answer.\n\n",

    "instruction": "context: Next-Generation Secure Computing Base\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Next-Generation Secure Computing Base (NGSCB; codenamed Palladium and also known as Trusted Windows') is a software architecture designed by Microsoft which aimed to provide users of the Windows operating system with better privacy, security, and system integrity. NGSCB was the result of years of research and development within Microsoft to create a secure computing solution that equaled the security of closed platforms such as set-top boxes while simultaneously preserving the backward compatibility, flexibility, and openness of the Windows operating system. Microsoft's primary stated objective with NGSCB was to \"protect software from software.\"Part of the Trustworthy Computing initiative when unveiled in 2002, NGSCB was to be integrated with Windows Vista, then known as \"Longhorn.\" NGSCB relied on hardware designed by the Trusted Computing Group to produce a parallel operation environment hosted by a new hypervisor (referred to as a sort of kernel in documentation) called the \"Nexus\" that existed alongside Windows and provided new applications with features such as hardware-based process isolation, data encryption based on integrity measurements, authentication of a local or remote machine or software configuration, and encrypted paths for user authentication and graphics output. NGSCB would facilitate the creation and distribution of digital rights management (DRM) policies pertaining the use of information.NGSCB was subject to much controversy during its development, with critics contending that it would impose restrictions on users, enforce vendor lock-in, and undermine fair use rights and open-source software. It was first demonstrated by Microsoft at WinHEC 2003 before undergoing a revision in 2004 that would enable earlier applications to benefit from its functionality. Reports indicated in 2005 that Microsoft would change its plans with NGSCB so that it could ship Windows Vista by its self-imposed deadline year, 2006; instead, Microsoft would ship only part of the architecture, BitLocker, which can optionally use the Trusted Platform Module to validate the integrity of boot and system files prior to operating system startup. Development of NGSCB spanned approximately a decade before its cancellation, the lengthiest development period of a major feature intended for Windows Vista.\nNGSCB differed from technologies Microsoft billed as \"pillars of Windows Vista\"\u2014Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Communication Foundation, and WinFS\u2014during its development in that it was not built with the .NET Framework and did not focus on managed code software development. NGSCB has yet to fully materialize; however, aspects of it are available in features such as BitLocker of Windows Vista, Measured Boot of Windows 8, Certificate Attestation of Windows 8.1, and Device Guard of Windows 10.\n\n== Architecture and technical details ==\nA complete Microsoft-based Trusted Computing-enabled system will consist not only of software components developed by Microsoft but also of hardware components developed by the Trusted Computing Group. The majority of features introduced by NGSCB are heavily reliant on specialized hardware and so will not operate on PCs predating 2004.\nIn current Trusted Computing specifications, there are two hardware components: the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which will provide secure storage of cryptographic keys and a secure cryptographic co-processor, and a curtained memory feature in the Central Processing Unit (CPU). In NGSCB, there are two software components, the Nexus, a security kernel that is part of the Operating System which provides a secure environment (Nexus mode) for trusted code to run in, and Nexus Computing Agents (NCAs), trusted modules which run in Nexus mode within NGSCB-enabled applications.\n\n\n*** Secure storage and attestation ***\nAt the time of manufacture, a cryptographic key is generated and stored within the TPM. This key is never transmitted to any other component, and the TPM is designed in such a way that it is extremely difficult to retrieve the stored key by reverse engineering or any other method, even to the owner. Applications can pass data encrypted with this key to be decrypted by the TPM, but the TPM will only do so under certain strict conditions. Specifically, decrypted data will only ever be passed to authenticated, trusted applications, and will only ever be stored in curtained memory, making it inaccessible to other applications and the Operating System. Although the TPM can only store a single cryptographic key securely, secure storage of arbitrary data is by extension possible by encrypting the data such that it may only be decrypted using the securely stored key.\nThe TPM is also able to produce a cryptographic signature based on its hidden key. This signature may be verified by the user or by any third party, and so can therefore be used to provide remote attestation that the computer is in a secure state.\n\n\n*** Curtained memory ***\nNGSCB also relies on a curtained memory feature provided by the CPU. Data within curtained memory can only be accessed by the application to which it belongs, and not by any other application or the Operating System. The attestation features of the TPM(Trusted Platform Module) can be used to confirm to a trusted application that it is genuinely running in curtained memory; it is therefore very difficult for anyone, including the owner, to trick a trusted application into running outside of curtained memory. This in turn makes reverse engineering of a trusted application extremely difficult.\n\n\n*** Applications ***\nNGSCB-enabled applications are to be split into two distinct parts, the NCA, a trusted module with access to a limited Application Programming Interface (API), and an untrusted portion, which has access to the full Windows API. Any code which deals with NGSCB functions must be located within the NCA.\nThe reason for this split is that the Windows API has developed over many years and is as a result extremely complex and difficult to audit for security bugs. To maximize security, trusted code is required to use a smaller, carefully audited API. Where security is not paramount, the full API is available.\n\n== Uses and scenarios ==\n\nNGSCB enables new categories of applications and scenarios. Examples of uses cited by Microsoft include decentralized access control policies; digital rights management services for consumers, content providers, and enterprises; protected instant messaging conversations and online transactions; ; and more secure forms of machine health compliance, network authentication, and remote access. NGSCB-secured virtual private network access was one of the earliest scenarios envisaged by Microsoft. NGSCB can also strengthen software update mechanisms such as those belonging to antivirus software or Windows Update.An early NGSCB privacy scenario conceived of by Microsoft is the \"wine purchase scenario,\" where a user can safely conduct a transaction with an online merchant without divulging personally identifiable information during the transaction. With the release of the NGSCB Developer Preview during PDC 2003, Microsoft emphasized the following enterprise applications and scenarios: document signing, secured data viewing, secured instant messaging, and secured plug-ins for emailing.\n\"The concept of machine identity actually gives you the ability to do things like strengthen antivirus updates because you can start creating circumstances where you sort of create a little secure partition, or secure space within the PC, and that can let you do things like work around rootkits. [...] A lot of what is happening in the arms race of security today is an attempt to subvert an operating system so that the operating system is no longer behaving in the manner in which it was either designed or the user wants\u2014without the user knowing\u2014right? And in other cases, it's about creating a fake user which then does things on your behalf\u2014which are not really on your behalf: spends your money, gives away your data, gives away personally identifiable information. So anything that lets you create a stronger, more immutable identity combination like: \"this is the machine, this is the software, this is the operating system, this is the service, this is the user\" is something that can benefit users because things that work on chiseling into those spaces are less effective.\"\n\n\n*** WinHEC 2004 scenarios ***\nDuring WinHEC 2004, Microsoft revealed two features based on its revision of NGSCB, Cornerstone and Code Integrity Rooting:\nCornerstone would protect a user's login and authentication information by securely transmitting it to NGSCB-protected Windows components for validation, finalizing the user authentication process by releasing access to the SYSKEY if validation was successful. It was intended to protect data on laptops that had been lost or stolen to prevent hackers or thieves from accessing it even if they had performed a software-based attack or booted into an alternative operating system.\nCode Integrity Rooting would validate boot and system files prior to the startup of Microsoft Windows. If validation of these components failed, the SYSKEY would not be released.BitLocker is the combination of these features; \"Cornerstone\" was the codename of BitLocker, and BitLocker validates pre-boot firmware and operating system components before boot, which protects SYSKEY from unauthorized access; an unsuccessful validation prohibits access to a protected system.\n\n== Vulnerability ==\nIn an article in 2003, D. Boneh and D. Brumley indicated that projects like NGSCB may be vulnerable to timing attacks.\nNow I will ask you some questions, and you will answer.\n\n",

    "instruction": "IoT Forensics\n\n==Introduction==\nIoT Forensics is a branch of Digital forensics that has the goal of identifying and extracting digital information from devices belonging to the Internet of things field, using a forensically sound and legally acceptable process.\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nUnlike traditional digital forensics approaches, IoT forensics is characterized by a wider range of potential source of evidence: with respect to the traditional analysis of servers, computers and smartphones, IoT forensics is extracting the information directly from smart environment data including monitoring systems, traffic lights, medical implants, smart home devices and more IoT scenarios.Moreover, IoT forensics potential source of evidence can be very different in nature with respect to digital forensics common use cases: network traffic, cloud data, devices logs and more information can be extracted and used as source of evidence if extracted successfully and processed in the correct way.\n\nIoT forensics can be identified as a combination of three separate digital forensics schemes:\nIoT Device Level forensics: Process of extracting evidence from the IoT devices (i.e. in the device memory). A lot of devices can be included in this process: examples are sensors, health implants, smart meters, smart home appliances, smart cameras, networked vehicles, RFIDs, and drones. Being the devices different in hardware  and functionalities, device level evidence identification and acquisition is often challenging and not always feasible.\nNetwork forensics: Process of identifying and extracting evidence from network log, devices traffic traces and communication patterns. With respect to the traditional network investigations, IoT Network forensics branch includes additional network models such as for example Body area network or Personal area network (i.e. Bluetooth or ZigBee devices). For each type of network, there needs to be appropriate forensic methods for the investigations, involving different tools and appropriate network protocol analysis.\nCloud forensics: Process of extrapolating information in the cloud used by the devices. Since IoT devices are usually limited in memory, most of the information is stored in proprietary cloud applications that may contain a massive amount of potential evidences (i.e. devices activities). Given the amount of information that can be recovered from the different entities involved in the cloud, Cloud forensics plays an important role in the IoT Forensics domain: system logs, access logs, chat logs, sessions, cookies, user authentication and application data are examples of the information that can be retrieved from cloud services related to each IoT device.\n\n== IoT forensics process ==\n\nAn IoT forensics investigation process should be conducted using the standard guidelines so that the collected evidence can be admissible on the court. The process is analogous to digital forensics process, but faces challenges caused by the peculiarities of the IoT devices. The full process can be split temporally into six different phases: Evidence Identification, Evidence Collection, Evidence Preservation, Evidence Analysis, Attack and Deficit attribution, Evidence Presentation.  Each of the different phases of the forensic process may introduce several challenges when applied to the limitations of the IoT devices.\n\n\n*** Evidence Identification and Collection ***\nEvidence Identification and its subsequent collection are the first phases for investigators during forensic processes. Search and seizure is an important step in any forensic examination: in the particular case of the IoT forensics, detecting presence of IoT systems is not always immediate considering that these devices are usually of small dimensions and are designed to work passively and autonomously.Most of the information on IoT devices is usually sent to cloud servers, considering the very limited physical memory of the device itself. This brings new challenges for the forensic investigators that sometimes can not even know where the data is located, as it is distributed among many servers in multiple data centers. Moreover, after the identification step, cloud evidence collection is not always feasible given the different jurisdictions under which the data could be located. Data center locations of cloud service providers are usually distributed in order to reduce costs and increase service efficiency. For this reason a forensic investigator often faces multi-jurisdiction issues during the data collection when the information is stored in the cloud.In the case of Network forensics some of the evidence can be collected from network devices like routers or firewalls, but most of the network potential sources of evidence exists only in flight. For example, Network traffic can be captured only at the time it passes through a device processing it. There are devices and procedures for storing network traffic as raw data but it is impractical to capture and save all network data due to its volume. The question of privacy and legal issues of data acquisition in network forensics is even larger than in the cloud forensics case, as the network data might include a lot of information that is not related to the legal case in question. Current research in IoT network forensics is working on the development of tools based on the most popular network traffic softwares (e.g. tcpdump, Wireshark) to extract information from network devices (i.e. Wi-Fi Access Points), in order to avoid the storage of the full traffic still maintaining potential evidence for forensic investigation.At the device level, once the IoT device in question has been identified, the evidence should be extracted in its physical memory. Digital forensics traditional process guidelines suggest to turn off the evidentiary devices in order to prevent the alteration of data. Given the cloud services almost substituting the storage (ROM) of the IoT devices, most of the physical information is nevertheless located in volatile memory like RAM. The creation of an evidence copy of such memory must be done without powering down the device, which goes against traditional best-practices and is not always feasible since most of the devices have limited energy capabilities. Moreover, unplugged IoT devices may become unaccessible and need proper reconfiguration before the use, hence modifying system logs information causing loss of potential evidences. For these reasons the approach to follow when dealing with IoT device level forensics is performing live forensics data acquisition.Recent research in IoT forensics presents several frameworks and useful tools that can be used by forensics investigator for the identification and collection of evidences. Great part of the existing tools however requires a proactive process (i.e. installing the software) and is thus not always usable for forensic investigations, unless they have been set up before the crime occurs.\n\n\n*** Evidence Preservation ***\nAfter the evidence identification and its subsequent collection, the forensic investigator should preserve the gathered data and guarantee its integrity during the full process from right after the collection to the final presentation.While the preservation of data using proper techniques (i.e. hashing) is feasible in traditional digital forensics, it represents a hard challenge and needs particular attention in IoT environments. Autonomous interactions between the different devices introduce challenges to identify scope of a compromise and the boundaries of a crime scene.IoT forensics evidence preservation requires modern and distributed techniques to preserve and avoid the corruption of the collected evidence. For this reason the current research focuses on applying proper blockchain solutions to the evidence preservation phase, so to store the evidence in distributed nodes in the network avoiding possible attacks to its integrity.\n\n\n*** Evidence Analysis and Attack Attribution ***\nThis phase involves all the analysis steps required by the investigators that should process and connect all the collected evidences in order to reach an outcome for the investigation. In the case of IoT evidence, the big volume of data that are usually collected in the acquisition phase make it almost impossible to provide an end-to-end analysis of the evidences. Moreover, the majority of IoT devices in the network do not store any metadata including temporal information such as creation or modification times. This makes even harder to verify the provenance and to ensure the integrity of the collected data.\nIn the particular case of IoT device physical memory analysis, several tools can be used by electronically connecting to the devices (see Memory forensics).The trends in the current research in the Network forensics field in the particular case of IoT forensics involves the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to deal with the massive amount of data that can be extracted from devices network traffic traces.In the attack and deficit attribution phase, the evidence collected and analysed are summarized to lead to the final outcome of the investigation. In traditional digital forensics the involved source of evidence are usually extracted from personal devices and hence lead to a restricted number of suspects. The same does not hold for IoT forensics evidence that, if moreover extracted from the cloud, can be located in physical servers accessed by multiple users at the same time.\n\n\n*** Evidence Presentation ***\nThe last phase of any forensic investigation process is the final presentation of the collected and analysed evidences in front of the jury court. \nIoT forensics evidence presentation is not as simple as traditional forensic cases, in particular for finding a proper human readable representation of the evidence itself that is usually under abstract forms. Depending on legal systems it could be needed to present the collected evidence in front of the jurors in the courtroom, most probably having a very restricted knowledge of network/cloud forensics, based often on their personal experience with IoT devices. This introduces challenges for the investigator organizing the evidences in order to produce an evidence report to be easily understandable for non experts. The investigator should moreover pay particular attention in the processing phase, especially when using analytic functions, because the procedure could modify the structure of the data and alter its meaning, hence invalidating the full process.\n\n== IoT forensics vs. security ==\n\nIoT forensics should not be confused with IoT security. IoT forensics takes care of finding evidences for forensics purposes: the evidences are not always related to IoT devices attacks or to their security, but can be used for proving/disproving a traditional forensic crime (i.e. a person detected in a room from IoT devices evidence). In the other side, IoT security takes care of the risks related to the presence of IoT devices and of attacks that may target them: it protects the devices from external attacks and prevents the devices to perform attacks to other entities.\n\nUsing the text above, answer my questions:\n\n",

      "context": "IoT Forensics\n\n==Introduction==\nIoT Forensics is a branch of Digital forensics that has the goal of identifying and extracting digital information from devices belonging to the Internet of things field, using a forensically sound and legally acceptable process.\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nUnlike traditional digital forensics approaches, IoT forensics is characterized by a wider range of potential source of evidence: with respect to the traditional analysis of servers, computers and smartphones, IoT forensics is extracting the information directly from smart environment data including monitoring systems, traffic lights, medical implants, smart home devices and more IoT scenarios.Moreover, IoT forensics potential source of evidence can be very different in nature with respect to digital forensics common use cases: network traffic, cloud data, devices logs and more information can be extracted and used as source of evidence if extracted successfully and processed in the correct way.\n\nIoT forensics can be identified as a combination of three separate digital forensics schemes:\nIoT Device Level forensics: Process of extracting evidence from the IoT devices (i.e. in the device memory). A lot of devices can be included in this process: examples are sensors, health implants, smart meters, smart home appliances, smart cameras, networked vehicles, RFIDs, and drones. Being the devices different in hardware  and functionalities, device level evidence identification and acquisition is often challenging and not always feasible.\nNetwork forensics: Process of identifying and extracting evidence from network log, devices traffic traces and communication patterns. With respect to the traditional network investigations, IoT Network forensics branch includes additional network models such as for example Body area network or Personal area network (i.e. Bluetooth or ZigBee devices). For each type of network, there needs to be appropriate forensic methods for the investigations, involving different tools and appropriate network protocol analysis.\nCloud forensics: Process of extrapolating information in the cloud used by the devices. Since IoT devices are usually limited in memory, most of the information is stored in proprietary cloud applications that may contain a massive amount of potential evidences (i.e. devices activities). Given the amount of information that can be recovered from the different entities involved in the cloud, Cloud forensics plays an important role in the IoT Forensics domain: system logs, access logs, chat logs, sessions, cookies, user authentication and application data are examples of the information that can be retrieved from cloud services related to each IoT device.\n\n== IoT forensics process ==\n\nAn IoT forensics investigation process should be conducted using the standard guidelines so that the collected evidence can be admissible on the court. The process is analogous to digital forensics process, but faces challenges caused by the peculiarities of the IoT devices. The full process can be split temporally into six different phases: Evidence Identification, Evidence Collection, Evidence Preservation, Evidence Analysis, Attack and Deficit attribution, Evidence Presentation.  Each of the different phases of the forensic process may introduce several challenges when applied to the limitations of the IoT devices.\n\n\n*** Evidence Identification and Collection ***\nEvidence Identification and its subsequent collection are the first phases for investigators during forensic processes. Search and seizure is an important step in any forensic examination: in the particular case of the IoT forensics, detecting presence of IoT systems is not always immediate considering that these devices are usually of small dimensions and are designed to work passively and autonomously.Most of the information on IoT devices is usually sent to cloud servers, considering the very limited physical memory of the device itself. This brings new challenges for the forensic investigators that sometimes can not even know where the data is located, as it is distributed among many servers in multiple data centers. Moreover, after the identification step, cloud evidence collection is not always feasible given the different jurisdictions under which the data could be located. Data center locations of cloud service providers are usually distributed in order to reduce costs and increase service efficiency. For this reason a forensic investigator often faces multi-jurisdiction issues during the data collection when the information is stored in the cloud.In the case of Network forensics some of the evidence can be collected from network devices like routers or firewalls, but most of the network potential sources of evidence exists only in flight. For example, Network traffic can be captured only at the time it passes through a device processing it. There are devices and procedures for storing network traffic as raw data but it is impractical to capture and save all network data due to its volume. The question of privacy and legal issues of data acquisition in network forensics is even larger than in the cloud forensics case, as the network data might include a lot of information that is not related to the legal case in question. Current research in IoT network forensics is working on the development of tools based on the most popular network traffic softwares (e.g. tcpdump, Wireshark) to extract information from network devices (i.e. Wi-Fi Access Points), in order to avoid the storage of the full traffic still maintaining potential evidence for forensic investigation.At the device level, once the IoT device in question has been identified, the evidence should be extracted in its physical memory. Digital forensics traditional process guidelines suggest to turn off the evidentiary devices in order to prevent the alteration of data. Given the cloud services almost substituting the storage (ROM) of the IoT devices, most of the physical information is nevertheless located in volatile memory like RAM. The creation of an evidence copy of such memory must be done without powering down the device, which goes against traditional best-practices and is not always feasible since most of the devices have limited energy capabilities. Moreover, unplugged IoT devices may become unaccessible and need proper reconfiguration before the use, hence modifying system logs information causing loss of potential evidences. For these reasons the approach to follow when dealing with IoT device level forensics is performing live forensics data acquisition.Recent research in IoT forensics presents several frameworks and useful tools that can be used by forensics investigator for the identification and collection of evidences. Great part of the existing tools however requires a proactive process (i.e. installing the software) and is thus not always usable for forensic investigations, unless they have been set up before the crime occurs.\n\n\n*** Evidence Preservation ***\nAfter the evidence identification and its subsequent collection, the forensic investigator should preserve the gathered data and guarantee its integrity during the full process from right after the collection to the final presentation.While the preservation of data using proper techniques (i.e. hashing) is feasible in traditional digital forensics, it represents a hard challenge and needs particular attention in IoT environments.

    "instruction": "context: IEC 62443\n\n==Introduction==\nIEC 62443 is an international series of standards that address cybersecurity for operational technology in automation and control systems. The standard is divided into different sections and describes both technical and process-related aspects of automation and control systems cybersecurity. \nIt divides the cybersecurity topics by stakeholder category / roles including: \n\nthe operator,\nthe service providers (service providers for integration and for maintenance)\nthe component/system manufacturers.The different roles each follow a risk-based approach to prevent and manage security risks in their activities.\n\n== Structure ==\nIEC 62443 Industrial communication networks - Network and system security series of standards is organized into four parts:\nGeneral: This part covers topics that are common to the entire series.\nPolicies and Procedures: This part focuses on methods and processes associated with IACS security.\nSystem: This part is about requirements at the system level.\nComponents and Requirements: This part provides detailed requirements for IACS products.The following table lists the parts of the IEC 62443 series of standards published to date with their status and title.\n\nPart 2-1: This part of the standard is aimed at operators of automation solutions and defines requirements for how security during the operation of plants is to be considered (see ISO/IEC 27001).\nPart 2-4: This part defines requirements (\"capabilities\") for integrators. These requirements are divided into 12 topics: Assurance, architecture, wireless, security engineering systems, configuration management, remote access, event management and logging, user management, malware protection, patch management, backup & recovery, and project staffing.\nPart 4-1: This part defines how a secure product development process should look like. It is divided into eight areas (\"Practices\"): management of development, definition of security requirements, design of security solutions, secure development, testing of security features, handling of security vulnerabilities, creation and publication of updates and documentation of security features.\nPart 4-2: This part defines technical requirements for products or components. Like the requirements for systems (Section -3-3), the requirements are divided into 12 subject areas and refer to them. In addition to the technical requirements, common component security constraints (CCSC) are defined, which must be met by components to be compliant with IEC 62443-4-2:\nCCSC 1 describes that components must take into account the general security characteristics of the system in which they are used.\nCCSC 2 specifies that the technical requirements that the component cannot meet itself can be met by compensating countermeasures at system level (see IEC 62443-3-3). For this purpose, the countermeasures must be described in the documentation of the component.\nCCSC 3 requires that the \"Least Privilege\" principle is applied in the component.\nCCSC 4 requires that the component is developed and supported by IEC 62443-4-1 compliant development processes.\n\n== Maturity and Security Level ==\nIEC 62443 describes different levels of maturity for processes and technical requirements. The maturity levels for processes are based on the maturity levels from the CMMI framework.\n\n\n*** Maturity Level ***\nBased on CMMI, IEC 62443 describes different maturity levels for processes through so-called \"maturity levels\". To fulfill a certain level of a maturity level, all process-related requirements must always be practiced during product development or integration, i.e. the selection of only individual criteria (\"cherry picking\") is not standard-compliant.\nThe maturity levels are described as follows:\n\nMaturity Level 1 - Initial: Product suppliers usually carry out product development ad hoc and often undocumented (or not fully documented).\nMaturity Level 2 - Managed: The product supplier is able to manage the development of a product according to written guidelines. It must be demonstrated that the personnel who carry out the process have the appropriate expertise, are trained and/or follow written procedures. The processes are repeatable.\nMaturity Level 3 - Defined (practiced): The process is repeatable throughout the supplier's organization. The processes have been practiced and there is evidence that this has been done.\nMaturity Level 4 - Improving: Product suppliers use appropriate process metrics to monitor the effectiveness and performance of the process and demonstrate continuous improvement in these areas.\n\n\n*** Security Level ***\nTechnical requirements for systems (IEC 62443-3-3) and products (IEC 62443-4-2) are evaluated in the standard by four so-called Security Levels (SL). The different levels indicate the resistance against different classes of attackers. The standard emphasizes that the levels should be evaluated per technical requirement (see IEC 62443-1-1) and are not suitable for the general classification of products.\nThe levels are:\n\nSecurity Level 0: No special requirement or protection required.\nSecurity Level 1: Protection against unintentional or accidental misuse.\nSecurity Level 2: Protection against intentional misuse by simple means with few resources, general skills and low motivation.\nSecurity Level 3: Protection against intentional misuse by sophisticated means with moderate resources, IACS-specific knowledge and moderate motivation.\nSecurity Level 4: Protection against intentional misuse using sophisticated means with extensive resources, IACS-specific knowledge and high motivation.\n\n== Concepts ==\nThe standard explains various basic principles that should be considered for all roles in all activities.\n\n\n*** Defense in depth ***\nDefense in Depth is a concept in which several levels of security (defense) are distributed throughout the system. The goal is to provide redundancy in case a security measure fails or a vulnerability is exploited.\n\n\n*** Zones and conduits ***\nZones divide a system into homogeneous zones by grouping the (logical or physical) assets with common security requirements. The security requirements are defined by Security Level (SL). The level required for a zone is determined by the risk analysis.\nZones have boundaries that separate the elements inside the zone from those outside. Information moves within and between zones. Zones can be divided into sub-zones that define different security levels (Security Level) and thus enable defense-in-depth.\nConduits group the elements that allow communication between two zones. They provide security functions that enable secure communication and allow the coexistence of zones with different security levels.\n\n== Certification to standards ==\nProcesses, systems and products used in industrial automation environments can be certified according to IEC 62443. Many testing, inspection, and certification (TIC) companies offer product and process certifications based on IEC 62443. By accrediting according to the ISO/IEC 17000 series of standards, the companies share a single, consistent set of certification requirements for IEC 62443 certifications which elevates the usefulness of the resulting certificates of conformance.\n\n\n*** Accredited certification schemes ***\nIEC 62443 certification schemes have been established by several global testing, inspection, and certification (TIC) companies. The schemes are based on the referenced standards and define test methods, surveillance audit policies, public documentation policies, and other specific aspects of their program. Cybersecurity certification programs for IEC 62443 standards are being offered globally by many recognized Certification Bodies (CB), including Bureau Veritas, Intertek, SGS-T\u00dcV Saar, T\u00dcV Nord, T\u00dcV Rheinland, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD and UL.\nA global infrastructure of national accreditation bodies (AB) ensures consistent evaluation of the IEC 62443. The ABs operate per the requirements of ISO/IEC 17011, a standard that contains requirements for the competence, consistency, and impartiality of accreditation bodies when accrediting conformity assessment bodies. ABs are members of the IAF for work in management systems, products, services, and personnel accreditation or the ILAC for laboratory accreditation. A Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) between ABs will ensure global recognition of accredited CBs.\nTIC companies are accredited by an AB to provide inspection according to the ISO/IEC 17020, testing laboratories according to ISO/IEC 17025 and certification of products, processes, and services according to ISO/IEC 17065.\n\n\n*** IECEE CB Scheme ***\nThe IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components (IECEE) Certification Body Scheme (CB Scheme) is a multilateral agreement that facilitates market access for manufacturers of electrical and electronic products. Under the CB Scheme processes, products and systems can be certified according to IEC 62443.\nThe origin of the CB Scheme comes from the CEE (former European \"Commission for Conformity Testing of Electrical Equipment\") and was integrated into the IEC in 1985. Currently, 54 Member Bodies are in the IECEE, 88 NCBs (National Certification Bodies), and 534 CB Test Laboratories (CBTL). In the field of product certification, this procedure is used to reduce the complexity in the approval procedure for manufacturers of products tested and certified according to harmonized standards. A product that has been tested by a CBTL (certified testing laboratory) according to a harmonized standard such as the IEC 62443, can use the CB report as a basis for a later national certification and approval such as GS, PSE, CCC, NOM, GOST/R, BSMI.\n\n\n*** ISCI ISASecure ***\nThe ISA Security Compliance Institute (ISCI), a subsidiary of the ISA, created a proprietary conformity assessment scheme aligned with the IEC 62443 standards. This scheme is used to certify industrial automation control systems, components and processes. Companies certifying to the ISASecure certification scheme are accredited to the ISASecure technical readiness requirements and have their Test Laboratories and Certification Body accredited to the ISO 17025 and ISO 17065 standards, respectively.\nThe ISCI offers multiple certifications under the ISASecure brand:\n\nSSA (System Security Assurance) certification of systems according to IEC 62443-3-3 and IEC 62443-4-1\nCSA (Component Security Assurance) certification of automation components according to IEC 62443-4-1 and IEC 62443-4-2\nSDLA (Secure Development Lifecycle Assurance) certification of automation systems development organizations according to the IEC 62443-4-1\nEDSA (Embedded Device Security Assurance) certification of components based on the IEC 62443-4-2. This certification was offered in 2010 and phased out when the IEC 62443-4-2 standard was formally approved and published in 2018.\nNow I will ask you some questions, and you will answer.\n\n",

      "context": "IEC 62443\n\n==Introduction==\nIEC 62443 is an international series of standards that address cybersecurity for operational technology in automation and control systems. The standard is divided into different sections and describes both technical and process-related aspects of automation and control systems cybersecurity. \nIt divides the cybersecurity topics by stakeholder category / roles including: \n\nthe operator,\nthe service providers (service providers for integration and for maintenance)\nthe component/system manufacturers.The different roles each follow a risk-based approach to prevent and manage security risks in their activities.\n\n== Structure ==\nIEC 62443 Industrial communication networks - Network and system security series of standards is organized into four parts:\nGeneral: This part covers topics that are common to the entire series.\nPolicies and Procedures: This part focuses on methods and processes associated with IACS security.\nSystem: This part is about requirements at the system level.\nComponents and Requirements: This part provides detailed requirements for IACS products.The following table lists the parts of the IEC 62443 series of standards published to date with their status and title.\n\nPart 2-1: This part of the standard is aimed at operators of automation solutions and defines requirements for how security during the operation of plants is to be considered (see ISO/IEC 27001).\nPart 2-4: This part defines requirements (\"capabilities\") for integrators. These requirements are divided into 12 topics: Assurance, architecture, wireless, security engineering systems, configuration management, remote access, event management and logging, user management, malware protection, patch management, backup & recovery, and project staffing.\nPart 4-1: This part defines how a secure product development process should look like. It is divided into eight areas (\"Practices\"): management of development, definition of security requirements, design of security solutions, secure development, testing of security features, handling of security vulnerabilities, creation and publication of updates and documentation of security features.\nPart 4-2: This part defines technical requirements for products or components. Like the requirements for systems (Section -3-3), the requirements are divided into 12 subject areas and refer to them. In addition to the technical requirements, common component security constraints (CCSC) are defined, which must be met by components to be compliant with IEC 62443-4-2:\nCCSC 1 describes that components must take into account the general security characteristics of the system in which they are used.\nCCSC 2 specifies that the technical requirements that the component cannot meet itself can be met by compensating countermeasures at system level (see IEC 62443-3-3). For this purpose, the countermeasures must be described in the documentation of the component.\nCCSC 3 requires that the \"Least Privilege\" principle is applied in the component.\nCCSC 4 requires that the component is developed and supported by IEC 62443-4-1 compliant development processes.\n\n== Maturity and Security Level ==\nIEC 62443 describes different levels of maturity for processes and technical requirements. The maturity levels for processes are based on the maturity levels from the CMMI framework.\n\n\n*** Maturity Level ***\nBased on CMMI, IEC 62443 describes different maturity levels for processes through so-called \"maturity levels\". To fulfill a certain level of a maturity level, all process-related requirements must always be practiced during product development or integration, i.e. the selection of only individual criteria (\"cherry picking\") is not standard-compliant.\nThe maturity levels are described as follows:\n\nMaturity Level 1 - Initial: Product suppliers usually carry out product development ad hoc and often undocumented (or not fully documented).\nMaturity Level 2 - Managed: The product supplier is able to manage the development of a product according to written guidelines. It must be demonstrated that the personnel who carry out the process have the appropriate expertise, are trained and/or follow written procedures. The processes are repeatable.\nMaturity Level 3 - Defined (practiced): The process is repeatable throughout the supplier's organization. The processes have been practiced and there is evidence that this has been done.\nMaturity Level 4 - Improving: Product suppliers use appropriate process metrics to monitor the effectiveness and performance of the process and demonstrate continuous improvement in these areas.\n\n\n*** Security Level ***\nTechnical requirements for systems (IEC 62443-3-3) and products (IEC 62443-4-2) are evaluated in the standard by four so-called Security Levels (SL). The different levels indicate the resistance against different classes of attackers. The standard emphasizes that the levels should be evaluated per technical requirement (see IEC 62443-1-1) and are not suitable for the general classification of products.\nThe levels are:\n\nSecurity Level 0: No special requirement or protection required.\nSecurity Level 1: Protection against unintentional or accidental misuse.\nSecurity Level 2: Protection against intentional misuse by simple means with few resources, general skills and low motivation.\nSecurity Level 3: Protection against intentional misuse by sophisticated means with moderate resources, IACS-specific knowledge and moderate motivation.\nSecurity Level 4: Protection against intentional misuse using sophisticated means with extensive resources, IACS-specific knowledge and high motivation.\n\n== Concepts ==\nThe standard explains various basic principles that should be considered for all roles in all activities.\n\n\n*** Defense in depth ***\nDefense in Depth is a concept in which several levels of security (defense) are distributed throughout the system. The goal is to provide redundancy in case a security measure fails or a vulnerability is exploited.\n\n\n*** Zones and conduits ***\nZones divide a system into homogeneous zones by grouping the (logical or physical) assets with common security requirements. The security requirements are defined by Security Level (SL). The level required for a zone is determined by the risk analysis.\nZones have boundaries that separate the elements inside the zone from those outside. Information moves within and between zones. Zones can be divided into sub-zones that define different security levels (Security Level) and thus enable defense-in-depth.\nConduits group the elements that allow communication between two zones. They provide security functions that enable secure communication and allow the coexistence of zones with different security levels.\n\n== Certification to standards ==\nProcesses, systems and products used in industrial automation environments can be certified according to IEC 62443. Many testing, inspection, and certification (TIC) companies offer product and process certifications based on IEC 62443. By accrediting according to the ISO/IEC 17000 series of standards, the companies share a single, consistent set of certification requirements for IEC 62443 certifications which elevates the usefulness of the resulting certificates of conformance.\n\n\n*** Accredited certification schemes ***\nIEC 62443 certification schemes have been established by several global testing, inspection, and certification (TIC) companies. The schemes are based on the referenced standards and define test methods, surveillance audit policies, public documentation policies, and other specific aspects of their program. Cybersecurity certification programs for IEC 62443 standards are being offered globally by many recognized Certification Bodies (CB), including Bureau Veritas, Intertek, SGS-T\u00dcV Saar, T\u00dcV Nord, T\u00dcV Rheinland, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD and UL.\nA global infrastructure of national accreditation bodies (AB) ensures consistent evaluation of the IEC 62443. The ABs operate per the requirements of ISO/IEC 17011, a standard that contains requirements for the competence, consistency, and impartiality of accreditation bodies when accrediting conformity assessment bodies. ABs are members of the IAF for work in management systems, products, services, and personnel accreditation or the ILAC for laboratory accreditation. A Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) between ABs will ensure global recognition of accredited CBs.\nTIC companies are accredited by an AB to provide inspection according to the ISO/IEC 17020, testing laboratories according to ISO/IEC 17025 and certification of products, processes, and services according to ISO/IEC 17065.\n\n\n*** IECEE CB Scheme ***\nThe IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components (IECEE) Certification Body Scheme (CB Scheme) is a multilateral agreement that facilitates market access for manufacturers of electrical and electronic products. Under the CB Scheme processes, products and systems can be certified according to IEC 62443.\nThe origin of the CB Scheme comes from the CEE (former European \"Commission for Conformity Testing of Electrical Equipment\") and was integrated into the IEC in 1985. Currently, 54 Member Bodies are in the IECEE, 88 NCBs (National Certification Bodies), and 534 CB Test Laboratories (CBTL). In the field of product certification, this procedure is used to reduce the complexity in the approval procedure for manufacturers of products tested and certified according to harmonized standards. A product that has been tested by a CBTL (certified testing laboratory) according to a harmonized standard such as the IEC 62443, can use the CB report as a basis for a later national certification and approval such as GS, PSE, CCC, NOM, GOST/R, BSMI.\n\n\n*** ISCI ISASecure ***\nThe ISA Security Compliance Institute (ISCI), a subsidiary of the ISA, created a proprietary conformity assessment scheme aligned with the IEC 62443 standards. This scheme is used to certify industrial automation control systems, components and processes. Companies certifying to the ISASecure certification scheme are accredited to the ISASecure technical readiness requirements and have their Test Laboratories and Certification Body accredited to the ISO 17025 and ISO 17065 standards, respectively.\nThe ISCI offers multiple certifications under the ISASecure brand:\n\nSSA (System Security Assurance) certification of systems according to IEC 62443-3-3 and IEC 62443-4-1\nCSA (Component Security Assurance) certification of automation components according to IEC 62443-4-1 and IEC 62443-4-2\nSDLA (Secure Development Lifecycle Assurance) certification of automation systems development organizations according to the IEC 62443-4-1\nEDSA (Embedded Device Security Assurance) certification of components based on the IEC 62443-4-2. This certification was offered in 2010 and phased out when the IEC 62443-4-2 standard was formally approved and published in 2018.",

Named after a regular poster who often wrote humorous troll posts.\nFrea speach\nSpammers claim the right to distribute unsolicited bulk mail as part of their right to free speech under the United States Constitution. After one such person repeatedly misspelled it as \"frea speach\", newsgroup participants who argued that the right to free speech refers to the right to not be censored by the U.S. government and nothing to do with the right to employ the services of private individuals and organizations to distribute bulk mail, took to referring to this claimed right as \"frea speach\", deliberately mis-spelling it partly as a parody and partly to distinguish it from actual free speech rights.\nGray hat\nAn ISP whose stance in spam matters is somewhat ambiguous. It may terminate some spamming customers but not all of them. Compare black hat and white hat.\nHat check\nA request to determine the reputation of a given ISP in spam matters. See also black-, gray- and white hat.\nJoe job\nThe act of sending out spam made to look like it came from a person or organization which the spammer dislikes. Spamhaus, SpamCop and other anti-spam organizations are often the victims of these, as are some individual anti-spammers. Being Joe-jobbed is usually taken as a sign that the victim must have really hurt some spammer.\nLART\nA meme which jokingly refers to a fictitious hypothetical blunt instrument (i.e. a \" Luser Attitude Readjustment Tool\") whose primary and/or singular use and purpose is the metaphorically application or introduction of understanding (typically of Internet norms and conventions, but of any concept whatsoever) to a person currently lacking such understanding.

The warning is an admonition to the reader to secure liquid beverages (particularly hot ones) and cats in case uncontrollable laughter breaks out upon reading the article.\nChew toy\nFrom time to time, a spammer surfaces in the group, typically ranting about how spam control activities, such as blacklisting, amount to censorship and violate that spammer's right to free speech. These visiting spammers are referred to as chew toys (because of the slight entertainment value their tirades provide). The same chew toy may frequent the group for several years. There may not always be a chew toy active, and very seldom have there been more than one concurrently.\nChickenboner\nA derisive term used to refer to minor or amateur spammer. Named after a colorful and humorous description one newsgroup participant made of spammers living in trailers and eating at Kentucky Fried Chicken.\nCut it out, Ron\nA standard response to a posting that is suspected to be a troll. Named after a regular poster who often wrote humorous troll posts.\nFrea speach\nSpammers claim the right to distribute unsolicited bulk mail as part of their right to free speech under the United States Constitution. After one such person repeatedly misspelled it as \"frea speach\", newsgroup participants who argued that the right to free speech refers to the right to not be censored by the U.S. government and nothing to do with the right to employ the services of private individuals and organizations to distribute bulk mail, took to referring to this claimed right as \"frea speach\", deliberately mis-spelling it partly as a parody and partly to distinguish it from actual free speech rights.\nGray hat\nAn ISP whose stance in spam matters is somewhat ambiguous. It may terminate some spamming customers but not all of them. Compare black hat and white hat.\nHat check\nA request to determine the reputation of a given ISP in spam matters. See also black-, gray- and white hat.\nJoe job\nThe act of sending out spam made to look like it came from a person or organization which the spammer dislikes. Spamhaus, SpamCop and other anti-spam organizations are often the victims of these, as are some individual anti-spammers. Being Joe-jobbed is usually taken as a sign that the victim must have really hurt some spammer.\nLART\nA meme which jokingly refers to a fictitious hypothetical blunt instrument (i.e. a \" Luser Attitude Readjustment Tool\") whose primary and/or singular use and purpose is the metaphorically application or introduction of understanding (typically of Internet norms and conventions, but of any concept whatsoever) to a person currently lacking such understanding. Large mallets and anvils are popularly referred to as examples of items or tools which would be useful as LARTs.\nListwashing\nThe act of responding to complaints by removing the complainer's email address from the spammer's list, without taking any further actions against the spammer.\nLumber Cartel\nA tongue-in-cheeck conspiracy theory that claimed anti-spammers were secretly paid agents of lumber companies.\nMainsleaze\nSpam coming from a notable or well-known (\"mainstream\") company.\nNetscum\nA list of anti-spam activists published by Sanford Wallace (also known as Spamford Wallace).\nPink contract\nA contract for internet services or hosting that makes it difficult to impossible to terminate the contract for spamming.\nQuirk Objection\n'Objection! Assumes X not found in evidence!' A humorous objection, raised when the previous poster assumes the presence of something that has not yet been proven to exist. Not used to refer to things that have definitely been proven not to exist. Named after the regular poster 'Captain Gym Z. Quirk' who first raised this. Often shortened to ObQuirk!\nSock\nA poster who is suspected to be someone else (usually a spammer) using a new name. Shortened from Sock Puppet.\nSpamhaus\nOriginally, this term was used as a derogatory epithet to refer to any individual ISP that had mostly or only spammers for customers. Nowadays, it more often refers to the anti-spam organization of the same name.\n\nSpamware\nSoftware that was written explicitly for the purpose of spamming, or has features that are mostly or only useful to spammers and other abusers. Also called 'ratware'.\nTINLC\nThere is no Lumber Cartel\nTINW\nThere is no We. The poster recognizes that NANAE does not have a collective opinion.\nWhack-a-Mole\nThe act of repeatedly causing spammers' throwaway accounts and drop boxes to be terminated. Named after the Whack-A-Mole arcade game.\nWhite hat\nAn ISP which takes spam complaints seriously and terminates offenders swiftly and with extreme prejudice. Named after old westerns where the good guys usually wore white hats. Compare black hat and gray hat.",

    "instruction": "Open mail relay\n\n==Introduction==\nAn open mail relay is a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server configured in such a way that it allows anyone on the Internet to send e-mail through it, not just mail destined to or originating from known users. This used to be the default configuration in many mail servers; indeed, it was the way the Internet was initially set up, but open mail relays have become unpopular because of their exploitation by spammers and worms. Many relays were closed, or were placed on blacklists by other servers.\n\n== History and technology ==\nUntil the 1990s, mail servers were commonly intentionally configured as open relays; in fact, this was frequently the installation default setting. The traditional store and forward method of relaying e-mail to its destination required that it was passed from computer to computer (through and beyond the Internet) via modems on telephone lines. For many early networks, such as UUCPNET, FidoNet and BITNET, lists of machines that were open relays were a core part of those networks. Filtering and speed of e-mail delivery were not priorities at that time and in any case the government and educational servers that were initially on the Internet were covered by a federal edict forbidding the transfer of commercial messages.\n\n== Abuse by spammers ==\nIn the mid-1990s, with the rise of spamming, spammers resorted to re-routing their e-mail through third party e-mail servers to avoid detection and to exploit the additional resources of these open relay servers. Spammers would send one e-mail to the open relay and (effectively) include a large blind carbon copy list, then the open relay would relay that spam to the entire list. While this greatly reduced the bandwidth requirements for spammers at a time when Internet connections were limited, it forced each spam to be an exact copy and thus easier to detect. After abuse by spammers became widespread, operating an open relay came to be frowned upon among the majority of Internet server administrators and other prominent users. Open relays are recommended against in RFC 2505 and RFC 5321 (which defines SMTP). The exact copy nature of spam using open relays made it easy to create bulk e-mail detection systems such as Vipul's Razor and the Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse. To counter this, spammers were forced to switch to using hash busters to make them less effective and the advantage of using open relays was removed since every copy of spam was \"unique\" and had to be sent individually.\nSince open mail relays make no effort to authenticate the sender of an e-mail, open mail relays are vulnerable to address spoofing.\n\n== Anti-spam efforts ==\nMany Internet service providers use Domain Name System-based Blackhole Lists (DNSBL) to disallow mail from open relays. Once a mail server is detected or reported that allows third parties to send mail through them, they will be added to one or more such lists, and other e-mail servers using those lists will reject any mail coming from those sites. The relay need not actually be used for sending spam to be blacklisted; instead, it may be blacklisted after a simple test that just confirms open access.This trend reduced the percentage of mail senders that were open relays from over 90% down to well under 1% over several years. This led spammers to adopt other techniques, such as the use of botnets of zombie computers to send spam.\nOne consequence of the new unacceptability of open relays was an inconvenience for some end users and certain Internet service providers. To allow customers to use their e-mail addresses at Internet locations other than the company's systems (such as at school or work), many mail sites explicitly allowed open relaying so that customers could send e-mail via the ISP from any location. Once open relay became unacceptable because of abuse (and unusable because of blocking of open relays), ISPs and other sites had to adopt new protocols to allow remote users to send mail. These include smart hosts, SMTP-AUTH, POP before SMTP, and the use of virtual private networks (VPNs). The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has written a best current practices covering Email Submission Operations in RFC 5068.\nNote that the above only becomes an issue if the user wishes to (or has to) continue to send e-mail remotely, using the same SMTP server which they were previously accessing locally. If they have valid access to some other SMTP server from their new, remote location, then they will typically be able to use that new server to send e-mails as if from their old address, even when this server is properly secured. (Although this may involve some reconfiguration of the user's email client which may not be entirely straightforward.)\nThe CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 makes it illegal to send spam through an open relay in the United States, but makes no provision on their use for personal e-mail or their operation in general; the effectiveness of the act has been questioned.\n\n== Modern-day proponents ==\nThe most famous open mail relay operating today is probably that of John Gilmore, who argues that running an open relay is a freedom of speech issue. His server is included on many open relay blacklists (many of which are generated by \"automatic detection\", that is, by anti-spam blacklisters sending an (unsolicited) test e-mail to other servers to see if they will be relayed). These measures cause much of his outgoing e-mail to be blocked. Along with his further deliberate configuration of the server, his open relay enables people to send e-mail without their IP address being directly visible to the recipient and thereby send e-mail anonymously. In 2002, his open relay, along with 24 others, was used by a computer worm to propagate itself.John Gilmore and other open relay proponents declare that they do not support spam and spamming, but see bigger threat in attempts to limit Web capabilities that may block evolution of the new, next generation technologies. They compare the network communication restrictions with restrictions that some phone companies tried to place on their lines in the past, preventing transferring of computer data rather than speech.\n\n== Closing relays ==\nIn order not to be considered \"open\", an e-mail relay should be secure and configured to accept and forward only the following messages (details will vary from system to system \u2014 in particular, further restrictions may well apply):\nMessages from local IP addresses to local mailboxes\nMessages from local IP addresses to non-local mailboxes\nMessages from non-local IP addresses to local mailboxes\nMessages from clients that are authenticated and authorizedIn particular, a properly secured SMTP mail relay should not accept and forward arbitrary e-mails from non-local IP addresses to non-local mailboxes by an unauthenticated or unauthorized user.\nIn general, any other rules an administrator chooses to enforce (for instance, based on what an e-mail gives as its own envelope from address) must be in addition to, rather than instead of, the above. If not, the relay is still effectively open (for instance, by the above rules): it is easy to forge e-mail header and envelope information, it is considerably harder to successfully forge an IP address in a TCP/IP transaction because of the three-way handshake that occurs as a connection is started.\nOpen relays have also resulted from security flaws in software, rather than misconfiguration by system administrators. In these cases, security patches need to be applied to close the relay.\nInternet initiatives to close open relays have ultimately missed their intended purpose, because spammers have created distributed botnets of zombie computers that contain malware with mail relaying capability. The number of clients under spammers' control is now so great that previous anti-spam countermeasures that focused on closing open relays are no longer effective.\n\nUsing the text above, answer my questions:\n\n",

    "instruction": "Cyber resilience\n\n==Introduction==\nCyber resilience refers to an entity's ability to continuously deliver the intended outcome, despite cyber attacks. Resilience to cyber attacks is essential to IT systems, critical infrastructure, business processes, organizations, societies, and nation-states. \nAdverse cyber events are those that negatively impact the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of networked IT systems and associated information and services.

    "instruction": "context: Web Cryptography API\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Web Cryptography API is the World Wide Web Consortium\u2019s (W3C) recommendation for a low-level interface that would increase the security of web applications by allowing them to perform cryptographic functions without having to access raw keying material. This agnostic API would perform basic cryptographic operations, such as hashing, signature generation and verification and encryption as well as decryption from within a web application.\n\n== Description ==\nOn 26 January 2017, the W3C released its recommendation for a Web Cryptography API that could perform basic cryptographic operations in web applications. This agnostic API would utilize JavaScript to perform operations that would increase the security of data exchange within web applications. The API would provide a low-level interface to create and/or manage public keys and private keys for hashing, digital signature generation and verification and encryption and decryption for use with web applications.\nThe Web Cryptography API could be used for a wide range of uses, including:\n\nProviding authentication for users and services\nElectronic signing of documents or code\nProtecting the integrity and confidentiality of communication and digital data exchangeBecause the Web Cryptography API is agnostic in nature, it can be used on any platform. It would provide a common set of interfaces that would permit web applications and progressive web applications to conduct cryptographic functions without the need to access raw keying material. This would be done with the assistance of the SubtleCrypto interface, which defines a group of methods to perform the above cryptographic operations. Additional interfaces within the Web Cryptography API would allow for key generation, key derivation and key import and export.\n\n== Vision for using the Web Cryptography API ==\nThe W3C\u2019s specification for the Web Cryptography API places focus on the common functionality and features that currently exist between platform-specific and standardized cryptographic APIs versus those that are known to just a few implementations. The group\u2019s recommendation for the use of the Web Cryptography API does not dictate that a mandatory set of algorithms must be implemented. This is because of the awareness that cryptographic implementations will vary amongst conforming user agents because of government regulations, local policies, security practices and intellectual property concerns.\nThere are many types of existing web applications that the Web Cryptography API would be well suited for use with.\n\n\n*** Multi-factor authentication ***\nToday multi-factor authentication is considered one of the most reliable methods for verifying the identity of a user of a web application, such as online banking. Many web applications currently depend on this authentication method to protect both the user and the user agent. With the Web Cryptography API, a web application would have the ability to provide authentication from within itself instead of having to rely on transport-layer authentication to secret keying material to authenticate user access. This process would provide a richer experience for the user.\nThe Web Cryptography API would allow the application to locate suitable client keys that were previously created by the user agent or had been pre-provisioned by the web application. The application would be able to give the user agent the ability to either generate a new key or re-use an existing key in the event the user does not have a key already associated with their account. By binding this process to the Transport Layer Security that the user is authenticating through, the multi-factor authentication process can be additionally strengthened by the derivation of a key that is based on the underlying transport.\n\n\n*** Protected document exchange ***\nThe API can be used to protect sensitive or confidential documents from unauthorized viewing from within a web application, even if they have been previously securely received. The web application would use the Web Cryptography API to encrypt the document with a secret key and then wrap it with public keys that have been associated with users who are authorized to view the document. Upon navigating to the web application, the authorized user would receive the document that had been encrypted and would be instructed to use their private key to begin the unwrapping process that would allow them to decrypt and view the document.\n\n\n*** Cloud storage ***\nMany businesses and individuals rely on cloud storage. For protection, remote service provide might want their web application to give users the ability to protect their confidential documents before uploading their documents or other data. The Web Cryptography API would allow users to:\n\nChoose to select a private or secret key\nDerive an encryption key from their key if they wish\nEncrypt their document/data\nUpload their encrypted document/data using the service provider\u2019s existing APIs\n\n\n*** Electronic document signing ***\nThe ability to electronically sign documents saves time, enhances the security of important documents and can serve as legal proof of a user\u2019s acceptance of a document. Many web applications choose to accept electronic signatures instead of requiring written signatures. With the Web Cryptography API, a user would be prompted to choose a key that could be generated or pre-provisioned specifically for the web application. The key could then be used during the signing operation.\n\n\n*** Protecting data integrity ***\nWeb applications often cache data locally, which puts the data at risk for compromise if an offline attack were to occur. The Web Cryptography API permits the web application to use a public key deployed from within itself to verify the integrity of the data cache.\n\n\n*** Secure messaging ***\nThe Web Cryptography API can enhance the security of messaging for use in off-the-record (OTR) and other types of message-signing schemes through the use of key agreement. The message sender and intended recipient would negotiate shared encryption and message authentication code (MAC) keys to encrypt and decrypt messages to prevent unauthorized access.\n\n\n*** JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) ***\nThe Web Cryptography API can be used by web applications to interact with message formats and structures that are defined under JOSE Working Group. The application can read and import JSON Web Signature (JWK) keys, validate messages that have been protected through electronic signing or MAC keys and decrypt JWE messages.\n\n== Conformance to the Web Cryptography API ==\nThe W3C recommends that vendors avoid using vendor-specific proprietary extensions with specifications for the Web Cryptography API. This is because it could reduce the interoperability of the API and break up the user base since not all users would be able to access the particular content. It is recommended that when a vendor-specific extension cannot be avoided, the vendor should prefix it with vendor-specific strings to prevent clashes with future generations of the API\u2019s specifications.\nNow I will ask you some questions, and you will answer.\n\n",

Packet capture is the process of intercepting and logging traffic. As data streams flow across the network, the analyzer captures each packet and, if needed, decodes the packet's raw data, showing the values of various fields in the packet, and analyzes its content according to the appropriate RFC or other specifications.\nA packet analyzer used for intercepting traffic on wireless networks is known as a wireless analyzer or WiFi analyzer. While a packet analyzer can also be referred to as a network analyzer or protocol analyzer these terms can also have other meanings. Protocol analyzer can technically be a broader, more general class that includes packet analyzers/sniffers. However, the terms are frequently used interchangeably.\n\n\n\n== Capabilities ==\nOn wired shared-medium networks, such as Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI, depending on the network structure (hub or switch), it may be possible to capture all traffic on the network from a single machine. On modern networks, traffic can be captured using a network switch using port mirroring, which mirrors all packets that pass through designated ports of the switch to another port, if the switch supports port mirroring. A network tap is an even more reliable solution than to use a monitoring port since taps are less likely to drop packets during high traffic load.\nOn wireless LANs, traffic can be captured on one channel at a time, or by using multiple adapters, on several channels simultaneously.\nOn wired broadcast and wireless LANs, to capture unicast traffic between other machines, the network adapter capturing the traffic must be in promiscuous mode. On wireless LANs, even if the adapter is in promiscuous mode, packets not for the service set the adapter is configured for are usually ignored. To see those packets, the adapter must be in monitor mode. No special provisions are required to capture multicast traffic to a multicast group the packet analyzer is already monitoring, or broadcast traffic.\nWhen traffic is captured, either the entire contents of packets or just the headers are recorded. Recording just headers reduces storage requirements, and avoids some privacy legal issues, yet often provides sufficient information to diagnose problems.\nCaptured information is decoded from raw digital form into a human-readable format that lets engineers review exchanged information. Protocol analyzers vary in their abilities to display and analyze data.\nSome protocol analyzers can also generate traffic. These can act as protocol testers. Such testers generate protocol-correct traffic for functional testing, and may also have the ability to deliberately introduce errors to test the device under test's ability to handle errors.Protocol analyzers can also be hardware-based, either in probe format or, as is increasingly common, combined with a disk array. These devices record packets or packet headers to a disk array.\n\n== Uses ==\nPacket analyzers can:\n\nAnalyze network problems\nDetect network intrusion attempts\nDetect network misuse by internal and external users\nDocumenting regulatory compliance through logging all perimeter and endpoint traffic\nGain information for effecting a network intrusion\nIdentify data collection and sharing of software such as operating systems (for strengthening privacy, control and security)\nAid in gathering information to isolate exploited systems\nMonitor WAN bandwidth utilization\nMonitor network usage (including internal and external users and systems)\nMonitor data in transit\nMonitor WAN and endpoint security status\nGather and report network statistics\nIdentify suspect content in network traffic\nTroubleshoot performance problems by monitoring network data from an application\nServe as the primary data source for day-to-day network monitoring and management\nSpy on other network users and collect sensitive information such as login details or users cookies (depending on any content encryption methods that may be in use)\nReverse engineer proprietary protocols used over the network\nDebug client/server communications\nDebug network protocol implementations\nVerify adds, moves, and changes\nVerify internal control system effectiveness (firewalls, access control, Web filter, spam filter, proxy)Packet capture can be used to fulfill a warrant from a law enforcement agency to wiretap all network traffic generated by an individual. Internet service providers and VoIP providers in the United States must comply with Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act regulations. Using packet capture and storage, telecommunications carriers can provide the legally required secure and separate access to targeted network traffic and can use the same device for internal security purposes. Collecting data from a carrier system without a warrant is illegal due to laws about interception.  By using end-to-end encryption, communications can be kept confidential from telecommunication carriers and legal authorities.\n\n== Notable packet analyzers ==\nNow I will ask you some questions, and you will answer.\n\n",

    "instruction": "context: Usability of web authentication systems\n\n==Introduction==\nUsability of web authentication systems refers to the efficiency and user acceptance of online authentication systems. Examples of web authentication systems are passwords, federated identity systems (e.g. Google oAuth 2.0, Facebook connect, Mozilla persona), email-based single sign-on (SSO) systems (e.g. SAW, Hatchet), QR code-based systems (e.g. Snap2Pass, WebTicket) or any other system used to authenticate a user's identity on the web. Even though the usability of web authentication systems should be a key consideration in selecting a system, very few web authentication systems (other than passwords) have been subjected to formal usability studies or analysis.\n\n\n\n== Usability and users ==\nA web authentication system needs to be as usable as possible whilst not compromising the security that it needs to ensure. The system needs to restrict access by malicious users whilst allowing access to authorised users. If the authentication system does not have sufficient security, malicious users could easily gain access to the system. On the other hand, if the authentication system is too complicated and restrictive, an authorised user would not be able to (or want to) use it. Strong security is achievable in any system, but even the most secure authentication system can be undermined by the users of the system, often referred to as the \"weak links\" in computer security.Users tend to inadvertently increase or decrease security of a system. If a system is not usable, security could suffer as users will try to minimize the effort required to provide input for authentication, such as writing down their passwords on paper. A more usable system could prevent this from happening. Users are more likely to oblige to authentication requests from systems that are important (e.g. online banking), as opposed to less important systems (e.g. a forum that the user visits infrequently) where these mechanisms might just be ignored. Users accept the security measures only up to a certain point before becoming annoyed by complicated authentication mechanisms. An important factor in the usability of a web authentication system is thus the convenience factor for the user around it.\n\n== Usability and web applications ==\nThe preferred web authentication system for web applications is the password, despite its poor usability and several security concerns. This widely used system usually contains mechanisms that were intended to increase security (e.g. requiring users to have high entropy passwords) but lead to password systems being less usable and inadvertently less secure. This is because users find these high entropy passwords harder to remember. Application creators need to make a paradigm shift to develop more usable authentication systems that take the user's needs into account. Replacing the ubiquitous password based systems with more usable (and possibly more secure) systems could lead to major benefits for both the owners of the application and its users.\n\n== Measurement ==\nTo measure the usability of a web authentication system, one can use the \"usability\u2013deployability\u2013security\" or \"UDS\" framework or a standard metric, such as the system usability scale. The UDS framework looks at three broad categories, namely usability deployability and security of a web authentication system and then rates the tested system as either offering or not offering a specific benefit linked to one (or more) of the categories. An authentication system is then classified as either offering or not offering a specific benefit within the categories of usability deployability and security.Measuring usability of web authentication systems will allow for formal evaluation of a web authentication system and determine the ranking of the system relative to others. While a lot of research regarding web authentication system is currently being done, it tends to focus on security and not usability. Future research should be evaluated formally for usability using a comparable metric or technique. This will enable the comparison of various authentication systems, as well as determining whether an authentication system meets a minimum usability benchmark.\n\n== Which web authentication system to choose ==\nIt has been found that security experts tend to focus more on security and less on the usability aspects of web authentication systems. This is problematic as there needs to be a balance between the security of a system and its ease-of-use.\nA study conducted in 2015 found that users tend to prefer Single sign-on (like those provided by Google and Facebook) based systems. Users preferred these systems because they found them fast and convenient to use. Single sign-on based systems have resulted in substantial improvements in both usability and security. SSO reduces the need for users to remember many usernames and passwords as well as the time needed to authenticate themselves, thereby improving the usability of the system.\n\n\n*** Other important considerations ***\nUsers prefer systems that are not complicated and require minimal effort to use and understand.\nUsers enjoy using biometrics and phone\u2010based authentication systems.

    "output": "question: How does the usability of a web authentication system impact its security? answer: The usability of a web authentication system plays a crucial role in its security. If a system is not usable, users may resort to insecure practices, such as writing down passwords. Conversely, a more usable system can encourage users to comply with security measures, making the system as a whole more secure.\n\nquestion: Why is the password system still widely used despite its poor usability and security concerns? answer: The password system is still widely used because it is familiar and simple for users. However, its simplicity and widespread use also contribute to its poor security, as users often choose weak passwords and reuse them across multiple systems.\n\nquestion: How do high entropy passwords impact the usability and security of password systems? answer: High entropy passwords can improve the security of password systems by making them harder for attackers to guess. However, these passwords can also reduce usability as users may find them harder to remember, leading to insecure practices like writing down passwords.\n\nquestion: What factors should application creators consider when developing more usable authentication systems? answer: Application creators should consider user needs, such as ease of use and convenience, when developing more usable authentication systems. This may involve replacing password-based systems with more usable (and potentially more secure) alternatives.\n\nquestion: How does the UDS framework evaluate the usability of web authentication systems? answer: The UDS framework evaluates the usability of web authentication systems by looking at three broad categories: usability, deployability, and security. The framework then rates the system as either offering or not offering a specific benefit linked to one (or more) of the categories.\n\nquestion: Why is formal evaluation of web authentication systems important for usability? answer: Formal evaluation of web authentication systems for usability is important because it allows for comparison of different systems and ensures that a minimum usability benchmark is met.\n\nquestion: Why do security experts tend to focus more on security than usability in web authentication systems? answer: Security experts tend to focus more on security than usability because they prioritize the protection of user data. However, a balance between security and usability is important to ensure that users comply with security measures.\n\nquestion: Why do users tend to prefer Single sign-on (SSO) based systems? answer: Users tend to prefer SSO based systems because they are fast and convenient to use. These systems also reduce the need for users to remember many usernames and passwords, improving the overall usability of the system.\n\nquestion: What types of authentication systems do users enjoy using? answer: Users enjoy using biometrics and phone-based authentication systems because they are often convenient and require minimal effort to use. However, these systems may require external devices and may have lower usability if the device is unavailable or fails.\n\nquestion: How can the current password system used by many web applications be extended for better usability? answer: The current password system used by many web applications can be extended for better usability by using memorable mnemonics instead of passwords, or by using graphical or mnemonic passwords to make authentication more usable.\n\nquestion: Why will usability become more important as more applications move online? answer: Usability will become more important as more applications move online because users will require robust and reliable authentication systems that are both usable and secure.\n\nquestion: What is one possible way to achieve usable and secure authentication systems in the future? answer: One possible way to achieve usable and secure authentication systems in the future is through the use of brainwaves in authentication systems. However, more research and usability studies are required to determine the feasibility of this approach.\n\nquestion: How do users impact the security of web authentication systems? answer: Users can impact the security of web authentication systems by inadvertently increasing or decreasing security. For example, if a system is not usable, users may resort to insecure practices like writing down passwords.\n\nquestion: How do users perceive the security of web authentication systems? answer: Users are more likely to oblige to authentication requests from systems that are important, such as online banking, as opposed to less important systems where these mechanisms might just be ignored. Users accept the security measures only up to a certain point before becoming annoyed by complicated authentication mechanisms.\n\nquestion: How can web authentication systems balance usability and security? answer: Web authentication systems can balance usability and security by considering user needs and preferences, such as ease of use and convenience, while also ensuring that security measures are in place to protect user data. This may involve replacing password-based systems with more usable (and potentially more secure) alternatives, or extending the current password system for better usability.",

      "context": "Usability of web authentication systems\n\n==Introduction==\nUsability of web authentication systems refers to the efficiency and user acceptance of online authentication systems. Examples of web authentication systems are passwords, federated identity systems (e.g. Google oAuth 2.0, Facebook connect, Mozilla persona), email-based single sign-on (SSO) systems (e.g. SAW, Hatchet), QR code-based systems (e.g. Snap2Pass, WebTicket) or any other system used to authenticate a user's identity on the web. Even though the usability of web authentication systems should be a key consideration in selecting a system, very few web authentication systems (other than passwords) have been subjected to formal usability studies or analysis.\n\n\n\n== Usability and users ==\nA web authentication system needs to be as usable as possible whilst not compromising the security that it needs to ensure. The system needs to restrict access by malicious users whilst allowing access to authorised users. If the authentication system does not have sufficient security, malicious users could easily gain access to the system. On the other hand, if the authentication system is too complicated and restrictive, an authorised user would not be able to (or want to) use it.

    "instruction": "context: Linux malware\n\n==Introduction==\nLinux malware includes viruses, Trojans, worms and other types of malware that affect the Linux family of operating systems. Linux, Unix and other Unix-like computer operating systems are generally regarded as very well-protected against, but not immune to, computer viruses.\n\n\n\n== Linux vulnerability ==\nLike Unix systems, Linux implements a multi-user environment where users are granted specific privileges and there is some form of access control implemented. To gain control over a Linux system or to cause any serious consequences to the system itself, the malware would have to gain root access to the system.In the past, it has been suggested that Linux had so little malware because its low market share made it a less profitable target. Rick Moen, an experienced Linux system administrator, counters that:\n\n[That argument] ignores Unix's dominance in a number of non-desktop specialties, including Web servers and scientific workstations. A virus/trojan/worm author who successfully targeted specifically Apache httpd Linux/x86 Web servers would both have an extremely target-rich environment and instantly earn lasting fame, and yet it doesn't happen.\nIn 2008 the quantity of malware targeting Linux was noted as increasing. Shane Coursen, a senior technical consultant with Kaspersky Lab, said at the time, \"The growth in Linux malware is simply due to its increasing popularity, particularly as a desktop operating system ... The use of an operating system is directly correlated to the interest by the malware writers to develop malware for that OS.\"Tom Ferris, a researcher with Security Protocols, commented on one of Kaspersky's reports, stating, \"In people's minds, if it's non-Windows, it's secure, and that's not the case. They think nobody writes malware for Linux or Mac OS X. But that's not necessarily true.\"Some Linux users do run Linux-based anti-virus software to scan insecure documents and email which comes from or is going to Windows users. SecurityFocus's Scott Granneman stated:\n\n...some Linux machines definitely need anti-virus software. Samba or NFS servers, for instance, may store documents in undocumented, vulnerable Microsoft formats, such as Word and Excel, that contain and propagate viruses. Linux mail servers should run AV software in order to neutralize viruses before they show up in the mailboxes of Outlook and Outlook Express users.\nBecause they are predominantly used on mail servers which may send mail to computers running other operating systems, Linux virus scanners generally use definitions for, and scan for, all known viruses for all computer platforms. For example, the open source ClamAV \"Detects ... viruses, worms and trojans, including Microsoft Office macro viruses, mobile malware, and other threats.\"\n\n\n*** Viruses and trojan horses ***\nThe viruses listed below pose a potential, although minimal, threat to Linux systems. If an infected binary containing one of the viruses were run, the system would be temporarily infected, as the Linux kernel is memory resident and read-only. Any infection level would depend on which user with what privileges ran the binary. A binary run under the root account would be able to infect the entire system. Privilege escalation vulnerabilities may permit malware running under a limited account to infect the entire system.\nIt is worth noting that this is true for any malicious program that is run without special steps taken to limit its privileges. It is trivial to add a code snippet to any program that a user may download and let this additional code download a modified login server, an open mail relay, or similar program, and make this additional component run any time the user logs in. No special malware writing skills are needed for this. Special skill may be needed for tricking the user to run the (trojan) program in the first place.\nThe use of software repositories significantly reduces any threat of installation of malware, as the software repositories are checked by maintainers, who try to ensure that their repository is malware-free. Subsequently, to ensure safe distribution of the software, checksums are made available. These make it possible to reveal modified versions that may have been introduced by e.g. hijacking of communications using a man-in-the-middle attack or via a redirection attack such as ARP or DNS poisoning. Careful use of these digital signatures provides an additional line of defense, which limits the scope of attacks to include only the original authors, package and release maintainers and possibly others with suitable administrative access, depending on how the keys and checksums are handled. Reproducible builds can ensure that digitally signed source code has been reliably transformed into a binary application.\n\n\n*** Worms and targeted attacks ***\nThe classical threat to Unix-like systems are vulnerabilities in network daemons, such as SSH and web servers. These can be used by worms or for attacks against specific targets. As servers are patched quite quickly when a vulnerability is found, there have been only a few widespread worms of this kind. As specific targets can be attacked through a vulnerability that is not publicly known there is no guarantee that a certain installation is secure. Also servers without such vulnerabilities can be successfully attacked through weak passwords.\n\n\n*** Web scripts ***\nLinux servers may also be used by malware without any attack against the system itself, where e.g. web content and scripts are insufficiently restricted or checked and used by malware to attack visitors. Some attacks use complicated malware to attack Linux servers, but when most get full root access then hackers are able to attack by modifying anything like  replacing binaries or injecting modules. This may allow the redirection of users to different content on the web. Typically, a CGI script meant for leaving comments, could, by mistake, allow inclusion of code exploiting vulnerabilities in the web browser.\n\n\n*** Buffer overruns ***\nOlder Linux distributions were relatively sensitive to buffer overflow attacks: if the program did not care about the size of the buffer itself, the kernel provided only limited protection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the rights of the vulnerable application under attack. Programs that gain root access even when launched by a non-root user (via the setuid bit) were particularly attractive to attack. However, as of 2009 most of the kernels include address space layout randomization (ASLR), enhanced memory protection and other extensions making such attacks much more difficult to arrange.\n\n\n*** Cross-platform viruses ***\nAn area of concern identified in 2007 is that of cross-platform viruses, driven by the popularity of cross-platform applications. This was brought to the forefront of malware awareness by the distribution of an OpenOffice.org virus called Badbunny.\nStuart Smith of Symantec wrote the following:\n\nWhat makes this virus worth mentioning is that it illustrates how easily scripting platforms, extensibility, plug-ins, ActiveX, etc, can be abused. All too often, this is forgotten in the pursuit to match features with another vendor... The ability for malware to survive in a cross-platform, cross-application environment has particular relevance as more and more malware is pushed out via Web sites. How long until someone uses something like this to drop a JavaScript infecter on a Web server, regardless of platform?\n\n\n*** Social engineering ***\nAs is the case with any operating system, Linux is vulnerable to malware that tricks the user into installing it through social engineering. In December 2009 a malicious waterfall screensaver that contained a script that used the infected Linux PC in denial-of-service attacks was discovered.\n\n\n*** Go-written malware ***\nThe IBM Security Report: Attacks on Industries Supporting COVID-19 Response Efforts Double had as a key point that \"\"Cybercriminals Accelerate Use of Linux Malware \u2013 With a 40% increase in Linux-related malware families in the past year, and a 500% increase in Go-written malware in the first six months of 2020, attackers are accelerating a migration to Linux malware, that can more easily run on various platforms, including cloud environments.\"\" That these cybercriminals are increasingly using Linux and Unix to target hospitals and allied industries (that rely on these systems and cloud networks) that they are increasingly vulnerable during the Covid-19 crisis, such as the Red Cross cyberattack.\n\n== Anti-virus applications ==\n\nThere are a number of anti-virus applications available which will run under the Linux operating system. Most of these applications are looking for exploits which could affect users of Microsoft Windows.\n\n\n*** For Microsoft Windows-specific threats ***\nThese applications are useful for computers (typically, servers) which will pass on files to Microsoft Windows users. They do not look for Linux-specific threats.\n\n\n*** For Linux-specific threats ***\nThese applications look for actual threats to the Linux computers on which they are running.\n\nchkrootkit (free and open source software)\nClamAV (free and open source software)\nComodo (proprietary) \nCrowdstrike (proprietary)\nDr.Web (proprietary) \nESET (proprietary)\nLinux Malware Detect\nlynis (open source auditing) \nrkhunter (free and open source software)\nSamhain (free and open source software) \nSophos (proprietary)Linux malware can also be detected (and analyzed) using memory forensics tools, such as:\n\nForcepoint (proprietary)\nVolatility (free and open source software)\n\n== Threats ==\nThe following is a partial list of known Linux malware. However, few if any are in the wild, and most have been rendered obsolete by Linux updates or were never a threat. Known malware is not the only or even the most important threat: new malware or attacks directed to specific sites can use vulnerabilities previously unknown to the community or unused by malware.\n\n\n*** Botnets ***\nMayhem \u2013 32/64-bit Linux/FreeBSD multifunctional botnet\nLinux.Remaiten \u2013 a threat targeting the Internet of things.\nMirai (malware) \u2013 a DDoS botnet spreads through telnet service and designed to infect Internet of Things (IoT).\nGafGyt/BASHLITE/Qbot \u2013 a DDoS botnet spreads through SSH and Telnet service weak passwords, firstly discovered during bash Shellshock vulnerability.\nLuaBot \u2013 a botnet coded with modules component in Lua programming language, cross-compiled in C wrapper with LibC, it aims for Internet of Things in ARM, MIPS and PPC architectures, with the usage to DDoS, spreads Mirai (malware) or selling proxy access to the cyber crime.\nHydra, Aidra, LightAidra and NewAidra \u2013 another form of a powerful IRC botnet that infects Linux boxes.\nEnergyMech 2.8 overkill mod (Linux/Overkill) \u2013 a long last botnet designed to infect servers with its bot and operated through IRC protocol for the DDoS and spreading purpose.\n\n\n*** Ransomware ***\n\n\n*** Rootkits ***\nSnakso \u2013 a 64-bit Linux webserver rootkit\n\n\n*** Trojans ***\n\n\n*** Viruses ***\n\n\n*** Worms ***\nNow I will ask you some questions, and you will answer.\n\n",

If an infected binary containing one of the viruses were run, the system would be temporarily infected, as the Linux kernel is memory resident and read-only. Any infection level would depend on which user with what privileges ran the binary. A binary run under the root account would be able to infect the entire system. Privilege escalation vulnerabilities may permit malware running under a limited account to infect the entire system.\nIt is worth noting that this is true for any malicious program that is run without special steps taken to limit its privileges. It is trivial to add a code snippet to any program that a user may download and let this additional code download a modified login server, an open mail relay, or similar program, and make this additional component run any time the user logs in. No special malware writing skills are needed for this. Special skill may be needed for tricking the user to run the (trojan) program in the first place.\nThe use of software repositories significantly reduces any threat of installation of malware, as the software repositories are checked by maintainers, who try to ensure that their repository is malware-free. Subsequently, to ensure safe distribution of the software, checksums are made available. These make it possible to reveal modified versions that may have been introduced by e.g. hijacking of communications using a man-in-the-middle attack or via a redirection attack such as ARP or DNS poisoning. Careful use of these digital signatures provides an additional line of defense, which limits the scope of attacks to include only the original authors, package and release maintainers and possibly others with suitable administrative access, depending on how the keys and checksums are handled. Reproducible builds can ensure that digitally signed source code has been reliably transformed into a binary application.\n\n\n*** Worms and targeted attacks ***\nThe classical threat to Unix-like systems are vulnerabilities in network daemons, such as SSH and web servers. These can be used by worms or for attacks against specific targets. As servers are patched quite quickly when a vulnerability is found, there have been only a few widespread worms of this kind. As specific targets can be attacked through a vulnerability that is not publicly known there is no guarantee that a certain installation is secure. Also servers without such vulnerabilities can be successfully attacked through weak passwords.\n\n\n*** Web scripts ***\nLinux servers may also be used by malware without any attack against the system itself, where e.g. web content and scripts are insufficiently restricted or checked and used by malware to attack visitors. Some attacks use complicated malware to attack Linux servers, but when most get full root access then hackers are able to attack by modifying anything like  replacing binaries or injecting modules. This may allow the redirection of users to different content on the web. Typically, a CGI script meant for leaving comments, could, by mistake, allow inclusion of code exploiting vulnerabilities in the web browser.\n\n\n*** Buffer overruns ***\nOlder Linux distributions were relatively sensitive to buffer overflow attacks: if the program did not care about the size of the buffer itself, the kernel provided only limited protection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the rights of the vulnerable application under attack. Programs that gain root access even when launched by a non-root user (via the setuid bit) were particularly attractive to attack. However, as of 2009 most of the kernels include address space layout randomization (ASLR), enhanced memory protection and other extensions making such attacks much more difficult to arrange.\n\n\n*** Cross-platform viruses ***\nAn area of concern identified in 2007 is that of cross-platform viruses, driven by the popularity of cross-platform applications. This was brought to the forefront of malware awareness by the distribution of an OpenOffice.org virus called Badbunny.\nStuart Smith of Symantec wrote the following:\n\nWhat makes this virus worth mentioning is that it illustrates how easily scripting platforms, extensibility, plug-ins, ActiveX, etc, can be abused. All too often, this is forgotten in the pursuit to match features with another vendor... The ability for malware to survive in a cross-platform, cross-application environment has particular relevance as more and more malware is pushed out via Web sites. How long until someone uses something like this to drop a JavaScript infecter on a Web server, regardless of platform?\n\n\n*** Social engineering ***\nAs is the case with any operating system, Linux is vulnerable to malware that tricks the user into installing it through social engineering. In December 2009 a malicious waterfall screensaver that contained a script that used the infected Linux PC in denial-of-service attacks was discovered.\n\n\n*** Go-written malware ***\nThe IBM Security Report: Attacks on Industries Supporting COVID-19 Response Efforts Double had as a key point that \"\"Cybercriminals Accelerate Use of Linux Malware \u2013 With a 40% increase in Linux-related malware families in the past year, and a 500% increase in Go-written malware in the first six months of 2020, attackers are accelerating a migration to Linux malware, that can more easily run on various platforms, including cloud environments.\"\" That these cybercriminals are increasingly using Linux and Unix to target hospitals and allied industries (that rely on these systems and cloud networks) that they are increasingly vulnerable during the Covid-19 crisis, such as the Red Cross cyberattack.\n\n== Anti-virus applications ==\n\nThere are a number of anti-virus applications available which will run under the Linux operating system. Most of these applications are looking for exploits which could affect users of Microsoft Windows.\n\n\n*** For Microsoft Windows-specific threats ***\nThese applications are useful for computers (typically, servers) which will pass on files to Microsoft Windows users. They do not look for Linux-specific threats.\n\n\n*** For Linux-specific threats ***\nThese applications look for actual threats to the Linux computers on which they are running.\n\nchkrootkit (free and open source software)\nClamAV (free and open source software)\nComodo (proprietary) \nCrowdstrike (proprietary)\nDr.Web (proprietary) \nESET (proprietary)\nLinux Malware Detect\nlynis (open source auditing) \nrkhunter (free and open source software)\nSamhain (free and open source software) \nSophos (proprietary)Linux malware can also be detected (and analyzed) using memory forensics tools, such as:\n\nForcepoint (proprietary)\nVolatility (free and open source software)\n\n== Threats ==\nThe following is a partial list of known Linux malware. However, few if any are in the wild, and most have been rendered obsolete by Linux updates or were never a threat. Known malware is not the only or even the most important threat: new malware or attacks directed to specific sites can use vulnerabilities previously unknown to the community or unused by malware.\n\n\n*** Botnets ***\nMayhem \u2013 32/64-bit Linux/FreeBSD multifunctional botnet\nLinux.Remaiten \u2013 a threat targeting the Internet of things.\nMirai (malware) \u2013 a DDoS botnet spreads through telnet service and designed to infect Internet of Things (IoT).\nGafGyt/BASHLITE/Qbot \u2013 a DDoS botnet spreads through SSH and Telnet service weak passwords, firstly discovered during bash Shellshock vulnerability.\nLuaBot \u2013 a botnet coded with modules component in Lua programming language, cross-compiled in C wrapper with LibC, it aims for Internet of Things in ARM, MIPS and PPC architectures, with the usage to DDoS, spreads Mirai (malware) or selling proxy access to the cyber crime.\nHydra, Aidra, LightAidra and NewAidra \u2013 another form of a powerful IRC botnet that infects Linux boxes.\nEnergyMech 2.8 overkill mod (Linux/Overkill) \u2013 a long last botnet designed to infect servers with its bot and operated through IRC protocol for the DDoS and spreading purpose.\n\n\n*** Ransomware ***\n\n\n*** Rootkits ***\nSnakso \u2013 a 64-bit Linux webserver rootkit\n\n\n*** Trojans ***\n\n\n*** Viruses ***\n\n\n*** Worms ***",

The term is used more commonly for the automatically authenticated connections between Microsoft Internet Information Services, Internet Explorer, and other Active Directory aware applications.\nIWA is also known by several names like HTTP Negotiate authentication, NT Authentication, NTLM Authentication, Domain authentication, Windows Integrated Authentication, Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication, or simply Windows Authentication.\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nIntegrated Windows Authentication uses the security features of Windows clients and servers. Unlike Basic Authentication or Digest Authentication, initially, it does not prompt users for a user name and password. The current Windows user information on the client computer is supplied by the web browser through a cryptographic exchange involving hashing with the Web server. If the authentication exchange initially fails to identify the user, the web browser will prompt the user for a Windows user account user name and password.\nIntegrated Windows Authentication itself is not a standard or an authentication protocol.

Third party utilities have extended the Integrated Windows Authentication paradigm to UNIX, Linux and Mac systems.\n\n== Supported web browsers ==\nIntegrated Windows Authentication works with most modern web browsers, but does not work over some HTTP proxy servers. Therefore, it is best for use in intranets where all the clients are within a single domain.  It may work with other web browsers if they have been configured to pass the user's logon credentials to the server that is requesting authentication.

      "qa_list": "question1: What is Integrated Windows Authentication and how does it use the security features of Windows clients and servers? answer1: Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) is a term associated with Microsoft products that uses the security features of Windows clients and servers for authentication. It uses the current Windows user information on the client computer, which is supplied by the web browser through a cryptographic exchange involving hashing with the Web server. IWA does not prompt users for a user name and password initially, and if the authentication exchange fails, the web browser will prompt the user for a Windows user account user name and password. question2: What is the difference between Integrated Windows Authentication and Basic Authentication or Digest Authentication? answer2: Unlike Integrated Windows Authentication, Basic Authentication and Digest Authentication prompt users for a user name and password initially. question3: What are the underlying security mechanisms used in Integrated Windows Authentication? answer3: Integrated Windows Authentication uses the Kerberos provider and NTLMSSP authentication protocols with respect to SSPI functionality. If the Kerberos provider is functional and a Kerberos ticket can be obtained for the target, the Kerberos 5 protocol will be attempted. Otherwise, NTLMSSP authentication is attempted. question4: What is SPNEGO and how is it used in Integrated Windows Authentication? answer4: SPNEGO is a protocol used in Integrated Windows Authentication to allow initiators and acceptors to negotiate either Kerberos or NTLMSSP. question5: What are some of the web browsers that support Integrated Windows Authentication? answer5: Integrated Windows Authentication works with most modern web browsers, including Internet Explorer 2 and later versions, Mozilla Firefox on Windows operating systems, Opera 9.01 and later versions, Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge 77 and later, and Bitzer Secure Browser on iOS and Android. question6: Why does Integrated Windows Authentication not work over some HTTP proxy servers? answer6: Integrated Windows Authentication does not work over some HTTP proxy servers because it is best for use in intranets where all the clients are within a single domain. question7: How can Integrated Windows Authentication be used with Mozilla Firefox on Windows operating systems? answer7: In Mozilla Firefox on Windows operating systems, the names of the domains/websites to which the authentication is to be passed can be entered (comma delimited for multiple domains) for the \"network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris\" (for Kerberos) or in the \"network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris\" (NTLM) Preference Name on the about:config page. On the Macintosh operating systems this works if you have a kerberos ticket (use negotiate). Some websites may also require configuring the \"network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris\". question8: How does Integrated Windows Authentication work with Java applications? answer8: Where a proxy itself requires NTLM authentication, some applications like Java may not work because the protocol is not described in RFC-2069 for proxy authentication. question9: How does Integrated Windows Authentication use the Kerberos protocol? answer9: Integrated Windows Authentication uses the Kerberos protocol if the Kerberos provider is functional and a Kerberos ticket can be obtained for the target. question10: How does Integrated Windows Authentication use the NTLMSSP authentication protocol? answer10: If Kerberos authentication fails, Integrated Windows Authentication uses the NTLMSSP authentication protocol. question11: How does Integrated Windows Authentication use the SPNEGO protocol? answer11: Integrated Windows Authentication uses the SPNEGO protocol to allow initiators and acceptors to negotiate either Kerberos or NTLMSSP. question12: How does Integrated Windows Authentication work with third-party utilities on UNIX, Linux, and Mac systems? answer12: Third-party utilities have extended the Integrated Windows Authentication paradigm to UNIX, Linux and Mac systems. question13: How does Integrated Windows Authentication work with mobile browsers? answer13: Bitzer Secure Browser supports Kerberos and NTLM SSO from iOS and Android. question14: How does Integrated Windows Authentication handle authentication failures? answer14: If the authentication exchange initially fails to identify the user, the web browser will prompt the user for a Windows user account user name and password. question15: How does Integrated Windows Authentication handle the selection of underlying security mechanisms? answer15: If the Kerberos provider is functional and a Kerberos ticket can be obtained for the target, and any associated settings permit Kerberos authentication to occur, the Kerberos 5 protocol will be attempted. Otherwise NTLMSSP authentication is attempted. Similarly, if Kerberos authentication is attempted, yet it fails, then NTLMSSP is attempted."

The software program was developed with aid from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration to aid prosecutors' offices in tracking; in 1982 (by which time Inslaw became a for-profit entity) Inslaw received a $10 million contract by the Justice Department to develop an improved PROMIS application for U.S. attorneys' offices. Having previously developed a 16-bit version of PROMIS, Inslaw developed a 32-bit version, for various operating systems, specifically VAX/VMS, Unix, OS/400, and (in the 1990s) Windows NT.The Hamiltons and the Justice Department engaged in an \"unusually bitter contract dispute\" over the software, and Inslaw entered bankruptcy. The Hamiltons sued the federal government, alleging that the Justice Department had dishonestly conspired to \"drive Inslaw out of business 'through trickery, fraud and deceit'\" by withholding payments to Inslaw and then pirating the software. A bankruptcy court and federal district court agreed with the Hamiltons, although these rulings were later vacated by a court of appeals for jurisdictional reasons. Hamilton and others asserted that the Justice Department had done so in order to modify PROMIS, originally created to manage legal cases, to become a monitoring software for intelligence operations.

    "instruction": "Web threat\n\n==Introduction==\nA web threat  is any threat that uses the World Wide Web to facilitate cybercrime.  Web threats use multiple types of malware and fraud, all of which utilize HTTP or HTTPS protocols, but may also employ other protocols and components, such as links in email or IM, or malware attachments or on servers that access the Web.  They benefit cybercriminals by stealing information for subsequent sale and help absorb infected PCs into botnets.\nWeb threats pose a broad range of risks, including financial damages, identity theft, loss of confidential information/data, theft of network resources, damaged brand/personal reputation, and erosion of consumer confidence in e-commerce and online banking.\nIt is a type of threat related to information technology (IT). The IT risk, i.e. risk affecting has gained and increasing impact on society due to the spread of IT processes.\n\n== Reaching path ==\nWeb threats can be divided into two primary categories, based on delivery method \u2013 push and pull.  Push-based threats use spam, phishing, or other fraudulent means to lure a user to a malicious (often spoofed) website which then collects information and/or injects malware.  Push attacks use phishing, DNS poisoning (or pharming), and other means to appear to originate from a trusted source.\nPrecisely-targeted push-based web threats are often referred to as spear phishing to reflect the focus of their data gathering attack.  Spear phishing typically targets specific individuals and groups for financial gain.  In other push-based web threats, malware authors use social engineering such as enticing subject lines that reference holidays, popular personalities, sports, pornography, world events and other hot topics to persuade recipients to open the email and follow links to malicious websites or open attachments with malware that accesses the Web.\nPull-based web threats are often referred to as \u201cdrive-by\u201d threats by experts (and more commonly as \u201cdrive-by downloads\u201d by journalists and the general public), since they can affect any website visitor.  Cybercriminals infect legitimate websites, which unknowingly transmit malware to visitors or alter search results to take users to malicious websites.  Upon loading the page, the user's browser passively runs a malware downloader in a hidden HTML frame (IFRAME) without any user interaction.\n\n== Growth of web threats ==\nGiorgio Maone wrote in 2008 that \"if today\u2019s malware runs mostly runs on Windows because it\u2019s the commonest executable platform, tomorrow\u2019s will likely run on the Web, for the very same reason.  Because, like it or not, the Web is already a huge executable platform, and we should start thinking of it this way, from a security perspective.\"The growth of web threats is a result of the popularity of the Web \u2013 a relatively unprotected, widely and consistently used medium that is crucial to business productivity, online banking, and e-commerce as well as the everyday lives of people worldwide.  The appeal of Web 2.0 applications and websites increases the vulnerability of the Web.  Most Web 2.0 applications make use of AJAX, a group of web development programming tools used for creating interactive web applications or rich Internet applications.  While users benefit from greater interactivity and more dynamic websites, they are also exposed to the greater security risks inherent in browser client processing.\n\n== Examples ==\nIn September 2008, malicious hackers broke into several sections of BusinessWeek.com to redirect visitors to malware-hosting websites.  Hundreds of pages were compromised with malicious JavaScript pointing to third-party servers.In August 2008, popular social networking sites were hit by a worm using social engineering techniques to get users to install a piece of malware.  The worm installs comments on the sites with links to a fake site.  If users follow the link, they are told they need to update their Flash Player.  The installer then installs malware rather than the Flash Player.  The malware then downloads a rogue anti-spyware application, AntiSpy Spider.\nby humanitarian, government and news sites in the UK, Israel and Asia.  In this attack the compromised websites led, through a variety of redirects, to the download of a Trojan.\nIn September 2017, visitors to TV network Showtime's website found that the website included Coinhive code that automatically began mining for Monero cryptocurrency without user consent. The adoption of online services has brought about changes in online services operations following the advancement of mobile communication techniques and the collaboration with service providers as a result, the online service technology has become more conductive to individuals. One of the most recent mobile technological wonders  The Coinhive software was throttled to use only twenty percent of a visiting computer's CPU to avoid detection.  Shortly after this discovery was publicized on social media, the Coinhive code was removed.  Showtime declined to comment for multiple news articles.  It's unknown if Showtime inserted this code into its website intentionally or if the addition of cryptomining code was the result of a website compromise.  Coinhive offers code for websites that requires user consent prior to execution, but less than 2 percent of Coinhive implementations use this code.  German researchers have defined cryptojacking as websites executing cryptomining on visiting users' computers without prior consent.  With 1 out of every five hundred websites hosting a cryptomining script, cryptojacking is a persistent web threat.\n\n== Prevention and detection ==\nConventional approaches have failed to fully protect consumers and businesses from web threats.

      "context": "Web threat\n\n==Introduction==\nA web threat  is any threat that uses the World Wide Web to facilitate cybercrime.  Web threats use multiple types of malware and fraud, all of which utilize HTTP or HTTPS protocols, but may also employ other protocols and components, such as links in email or IM, or malware attachments or on servers that access the Web.  They benefit cybercriminals by stealing information for subsequent sale and help absorb infected PCs into botnets.\nWeb threats pose a broad range of risks, including financial damages, identity theft, loss of confidential information/data, theft of network resources, damaged brand/personal reputation, and erosion of consumer confidence in e-commerce and online banking.\nIt is a type of threat related to information technology (IT). The IT risk, i.e. risk affecting has gained and increasing impact on society due to the spread of IT processes.\n\n== Reaching path ==\nWeb threats can be divided into two primary categories, based on delivery method \u2013 push and pull.  Push-based threats use spam, phishing, or other fraudulent means to lure a user to a malicious (often spoofed) website which then collects information and/or injects malware.  Push attacks use phishing, DNS poisoning (or pharming), and other means to appear to originate from a trusted source.\nPrecisely-targeted push-based web threats are often referred to as spear phishing to reflect the focus of their data gathering attack.  Spear phishing typically targets specific individuals and groups for financial gain.  In other push-based web threats, malware authors use social engineering such as enticing subject lines that reference holidays, popular personalities, sports, pornography, world events and other hot topics to persuade recipients to open the email and follow links to malicious websites or open attachments with malware that accesses the Web.\nPull-based web threats are often referred to as \u201cdrive-by\u201d threats by experts (and more commonly as \u201cdrive-by downloads\u201d by journalists and the general public), since they can affect any website visitor.  Cybercriminals infect legitimate websites, which unknowingly transmit malware to visitors or alter search results to take users to malicious websites.  Upon loading the page, the user's browser passively runs a malware downloader in a hidden HTML frame (IFRAME) without any user interaction.\n\n== Growth of web threats ==\nGiorgio Maone wrote in 2008 that \"if today\u2019s malware runs mostly runs on Windows because it\u2019s the commonest executable platform, tomorrow\u2019s will likely run on the Web, for the very same reason.  Because, like it or not, the Web is already a huge executable platform, and we should start thinking of it this way, from a security perspective.\"The growth of web threats is a result of the popularity of the Web \u2013 a relatively unprotected, widely and consistently used medium that is crucial to business productivity, online banking, and e-commerce as well as the everyday lives of people worldwide.  The appeal of Web 2.0 applications and websites increases the vulnerability of the Web.  Most Web 2.0 applications make use of AJAX, a group of web development programming tools used for creating interactive web applications or rich Internet applications.  While users benefit from greater interactivity and more dynamic websites, they are also exposed to the greater security risks inherent in browser client processing.\n\n== Examples ==\nIn September 2008, malicious hackers broke into several sections of BusinessWeek.com to redirect visitors to malware-hosting websites.  Hundreds of pages were compromised with malicious JavaScript pointing to third-party servers.In August 2008, popular social networking sites were hit by a worm using social engineering techniques to get users to install a piece of malware.  The worm installs comments on the sites with links to a fake site.  If users follow the link, they are told they need to update their Flash Player.  The installer then installs malware rather than the Flash Player.  The malware then downloads a rogue anti-spyware application, AntiSpy Spider.\nby humanitarian, government and news sites in the UK, Israel and Asia.  In this attack the compromised websites led, through a variety of redirects, to the download of a Trojan.\nIn September 2017, visitors to TV network Showtime's website found that the website included Coinhive code that automatically began mining for Monero cryptocurrency without user consent. The adoption of online services has brought about changes in online services operations following the advancement of mobile communication techniques and the collaboration with service providers as a result, the online service technology has become more conductive to individuals. One of the most recent mobile technological wonders  The Coinhive software was throttled to use only twenty percent of a visiting computer's CPU to avoid detection.  Shortly after this discovery was publicized on social media, the Coinhive code was removed.  Showtime declined to comment for multiple news articles.  It's unknown if Showtime inserted this code into its website intentionally or if the addition of cryptomining code was the result of a website compromise.  Coinhive offers code for websites that requires user consent prior to execution, but less than 2 percent of Coinhive implementations use this code.  German researchers have defined cryptojacking as websites executing cryptomining on visiting users' computers without prior consent.  With 1 out of every five hundred websites hosting a cryptomining script, cryptojacking is a persistent web threat.\n\n== Prevention and detection ==\nConventional approaches have failed to fully protect consumers and businesses from web threats.

    "instruction": "context: Radiofrequency MASINT\n\n==Introduction==\nRadiofrequency MASINT is one of the six major disciplines generally accepted to make up the field of Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), with due regard that the MASINT subdisciplines may overlap, and MASINT, in turn, is complementary to more traditional intelligence collection and analysis disciplines such as SIGINT and IMINT.  MASINT encompasses intelligence gathering activities that bring together disparate elements that do not fit within the definitions of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), or Human Intelligence (HUMINT).\nAccording to the United States Department of Defense, MASINT is technically derived intelligence (excluding traditional imagery IMINT and signals intelligence SIGINT) that \u2013 when collected, processed, and analyzed by dedicated MASINT systems \u2013 results in intelligence that detects, tracks, identifies, or describes the signatures (distinctive characteristics) of fixed or dynamic target sources.  MASINT was recognized as a formal intelligence discipline in 1986. See Measurement and Signature Intelligence for an overview of the discipline and its unifying principles.  As with many branches of MASINT, specific techniques may overlap with the six major conceptual disciplines of MASINT defined by the Center for MASINT Studies and Research, which divides MASINT into Electro-optical, Nuclear, Geophysical, Radar, Materials, and Radiofrequency disciplines.\n\n== Disciplines ==\nMASINT is made up of six major disciplines, but the disciplines overlap and intertwine. They interact with the more traditional intelligence disciplines of HUMINT, IMINT, and SIGINT. To be more confusing, while MASINT is highly technical and is called such, TECHINT is another discipline, dealing with such things as the analysis of captured equipment.\nAn example of the interaction is \"imagery-defined MASINT (IDM)\". In IDM, a MASINT application would measure the image, pixel by pixel, and try to identify the physical materials, or types of energy, that are responsible for pixels or groups of pixels: signatures. When the signatures are then correlated to precise geography, or details of an object, the combined information becomes something greater than the whole of its IMINT and MASINT parts.\nThe Center for MASINT Studies and Research breaks MASINT into:\nElectro-optical MASINT\nNuclear MASINT\nGeophysical MASINT\nRadar MASINT\nMaterials MASINTWhere COMINT and ELINT, the two major components of SIGINT, focus on the intentionally transmitted part of the signal, radiofrequency MASINT focuses on unintentionally transmitted information. For example, a given radar antenna will have sidelobes emanating from other than the direction in which the main antenna is aimed. The RADINT (radar intelligence) MASINT subdiscipline involves learning to recognize a radar both by its primary signal, captured by ELINT, and its sidelobes, perhaps captured by the main ELINT sensor, or, more likely, a sensor aimed at the sides of the radio antenna.\nMASINT associated with COMINT might involve the detection of common background sounds expected with human voice communications. For example, if a given radio signal comes from a radio used in a tank, if the interceptor does not hear engine noise or higher voice frequency than the voice modulation usually uses, even though the voice conversation is meaningful, MASINT might suggest it is a deception, not coming from a real tank.\n\n== Frequency domain MASINT ==\nDifferent from emitter location in SIGINT, frequency analysis MASINT concentrates not on finding a specific device, but on characterizing the signatures of a class of devices, based on their intentional and unintentional radio emissions. Devices being characterized could include radars, communication radios, radio signals from foreign remote sensors, radio frequency weapons (RFW), collateral signals from other weapons, weapon precursors, or weapon simulators (for example, electromagnetic pulse signals associated with nuclear bursts); and spurious or unintentional signals.See HF/DF for a discussion of SIGINT-captured information with a MASINT flavor, such as determining the frequency to which a receiver is tuned, from detecting the frequency of the beat frequency oscillator of the superheterodyne receiver. This may also be considered unintentional RF radiation (RINT).  The local oscillator intercept technique, Operation RAFTER was first made public by a book by a retired senior officer in Britain's counterintelligence service, MI5. The book also discusses acoustic methods of capturing COMINT.\n\n== Electromagnetic pulse MASINT ==\nNuclear and large conventional explosions produce radio frequency energy. The characteristics of the EMP will vary with altitude and burst size. EMP-like effects are not always from open-air or space explosions; there has been work with controlled explosions for generating electrical pulse to drive lasers and railguns.\nFor example, in a program called BURNING LIGHT,  KC-135R tankers, temporarily modified to carry MASINT sensors, would fly around the test area, as part of Operation BURNING LIGHT. One sensor system measured the electromagnetic pulse of the detonation.While EMP often is assumed to be a characteristic of nuclear weapons alone, such is not the case. Several open-literature techniques, requiring only conventional explosives, or, in the case of high power microwave, a large electrical power supply, perhaps one-shot as with capacitors, can generate a significant EMP:\n\nExplosively pumped flux compression generators (FCG)\nExplosive and Propellant Driven MHD Generators\nHigh Power Microwave Sources - Spark gaps or the VircatorEMP intelligence deals both offensive capability to build, generate particular power vs. frequency spectra, and means of optimizing coupling or other power delivery, and defensive EMP considerations of vulnerability.\nVulnerability has two components:\n\nCoupling modes possible between the EMP source and the equipment\nFront door coupling goes through an antenna intended to receive power in the frequency range being generated\nBack door coupling in which the EMP produces surges in power (including ground) and communications wire.\nThe level of energy coupled that will damage or destroy a particular target.Another aspect of offensive EMP intelligence is to evaluate the ways in which an EMP weapon could improve coupling. One approach involves the device extruding antennas. Another, similar to other precision guided munitions, is to bring the device as close as possible to the target.\nIntelligence about EMP defense would consider the deliberate use of shielding (e.g., Faraday cages) or greater use of optical cabling.\n\n== Unintentional radiation MASINT ==\nThe integration and specialized application of MASINT techniques against unintentional radiation sources (RINT) that are incidental to the RF propagation and operating characteristics of military and civil engines, power sources, weapons systems, electronic systems, machinery, equipment, or instruments. These techniques may be valuable in detecting, tracking, and monitoring a variety of activities of interest.\n\n\n*** Black Crow: truck detection on the Ho Chi Minh trail ***\nA Vietnam-era \"Black Crow\" RINT sensor, carried aboard AC-130 gunships, detected the \"static\" produced by the ignition system of trucks on the Ho Chi Minh trail, from distances up to 10 miles, and cued weapons onto the trucks.\n\n\n*** Monitoring potentially necessary electronic emissions ***\nYet another technique that could determine the frequency to which a receiver is tuned was the technique of Operation RAFTER, which listened for the direct or additive frequency of the local oscillator in a superheterodyne receiver.\nThis technique can be countered by shielding the intermediate frequency circuitry of superheterodyne receivers, or moving into software-defined radio using digital signal processors with no local oscillator.\n\n\n*** Unintentional radiation from electronic devices ***\nThis discipline blurs into the various techniques for collecting COMINT from unintentional radiation, both electromagnetic and acoustic, from electronic devices. TEMPEST is an unclassified US code word for the set of techniques for securing equipment from eavesdropping on Van Eck radiation and other emanations.\nOne of the blurry areas, for example, is understanding the normal incidental radiation from something as basic as a television set. The signals of a consumer product such as that are sufficiently complex that it may be practical to hide a covert eavesdropping channel  within it.\n\n\n*** Covert modulators for audio surveillance ***\nAnother category, to which the US code name TEAPOT may apply, is the detection not simply of RF, but of an unintended audio modulation of an external RF signal flooding the area being surveilled. Some object within the room acoustically couples to sound in the room, and acts as a modulator. The group doing the covert surveillance examines the reflected RF for amplitude modulation at the original frequency, or across a spectral band for frequency modulation\nFor example, in 1952, the Soviets presented the US Moscow embassy with a beautiful Great Seal of the United States. The Seal, however, had an acoustic diaphragm, forming a side of a resonant cavity which, when illuminated with a microwave beam, reflected the beam back as a signal that was modulated by the audio of conversations in the room. The conversations caused the dimensions of the resonant cavity to change, producing the modulated signal, This was a Passive Resonant Cavity Bug.This effect may not require a purpose-built modulator. Items as mundane as an incandescent light bulb may act as modulators.\nTEAPOT, assuming that is the code name, has similarities to the technique of using the reflections of a laser from a window. In that technique, the window vibrates from acoustic pressure on the inside, and modulates the laser carrier.\n\n\n*** Secure signal leakage into ground ***\nAs early as the First World War, it was possible to intercept the information content of a telegraph or telephone using electrically unbalanced signals, by detecting signals of greater amplitude than the expected electrical ground. In an unbalanced transmission, the ground serves as a signal reference.\n\n\n*** Covert modulation for digital surveillance ***\nIn the 1950s, it was found that there could be electrical coupling between the unencrypted side of a \"RED\" signal inside a secure communications facility, and either the conductor carrying the \"BLACK\" encrypted signal, or possibly the electrical ground(s) of the system. TEMPEST protective measures work against the situation when the frequency of the RED and BLACK signals are the same. The RED signal, at a low power level, may be intercepted directly, or there may be intermodulation between the RED and BLACK signals.\nHIJACK is a more advanced threat, where the RED signal modulates a RF signal generated within the secure area, such as a cellular telephone. While HIJACK targets RF, NONSTOP targets the pulses of a digital device, typically a computer.\nNow I will ask you some questions, and you will answer.\n\n",

    "output": "question: How does Radiofrequency MASINT differ from SIGINT in terms of focus and techniques used? answer: Radiofrequency MASINT focuses on unintentionally transmitted information, such as sidelobes of radar antennas or electromagnetic pulses, while SIGINT, specifically COMINT and ELINT, focuses on the intentionally transmitted parts of signals, like voice communications or radar signals. MASINT techniques involve characterizing the signatures of a class of devices based on their radio emissions, whereas SIGINT techniques often involve analyzing the content of the transmitted signals.\nquestion: What is the role of the Center for MASINT Studies and Research in defining MASINT disciplines? answer: The Center for MASINT Studies and Research divides MASINT into six major conceptual disciplines: Electro-optical, Nuclear, Geophysical, Radar, Materials, and Radiofrequency. These disciplines help categorize various MASINT techniques and overlapping elements within the field.\nquestion: How does imagery-defined MASINT (IDM) combine IMINT and MASINT to create a more comprehensive intelligence product? answer: IDM involves measuring the image pixel by pixel to identify the physical materials or types of energy responsible for pixels or groups of pixels, which are referred to as signatures. When these signatures are correlated to precise geography or details of an object, the combined information becomes something greater than the whole of its IMINT and MASINT parts.\nquestion: What is the purpose of Operation BURNING LIGHT and how does it relate to EMP-like effects? answer: Operation BURNING LIGHT involved using KC-135R tankers equipped with MASINT sensors to measure the electromagnetic pulse of detonations during a program called BURNING LIGHT. This operation aimed to study the characteristics of EMP-like effects, which can be produced by both nuclear and conventional explosions, as well as other sources.\nquestion: How can explosively pumped flux compression generators (FCG) and explosive and propellant-driven MHD generators generate significant EMPs using conventional explosives or electrical power supplies? answer: FCG and explosive and propellant-driven MHD generators can generate a significant EMP by using conventional explosives or a large electrical power supply. FCG accomplishes this through the rapid compression of a magnetic flux, while MHD generators convert the kinetic energy of an explosive blast into electrical energy, which can then be radiated as an EMP.\nquestion: What are the two components of vulnerability in offensive EMP intelligence, and how do they impact equipment? answer: The two components of vulnerability in offensive EMP intelligence are coupling modes between the EMP source and the equipment, and the level of energy coupled that will damage or destroy a particular target. Coupling modes can occur through front door coupling, where the EMP goes through an antenna intended to receive power in the frequency range being generated, or back door coupling, where the EMP produces surges in power and communications wire.\nquestion: How does TEMPEST secure equipment from eavesdropping on Van Eck radiation and other emanations? answer: TEMPEST is a set of techniques that secures equipment from eavesdropping on Van Eck radiation and other emanations by shielding intermediate frequency circuitry of superheterodyne receivers or moving into software-defined radio using digital signal processors with no local oscillator.\nquestion: What is the concept behind the Passive Resonant Cavity Bug, and how does it work? answer: The Passive Resonant Cavity Bug is a covert surveillance technique where an acoustic diaphragm forms a side of a resonant cavity. When illuminated with a microwave beam, the cavity reflects the beam back as a signal that is modulated by the audio of conversations in the room. The conversations cause the dimensions of the resonant cavity to change, producing the modulated signal.\nquestion: How can unencrypted signals within a secure communications facility electrically couple with encrypted signals or electrical grounds, and what protective measures are used to prevent this? answer: Unencrypted signals within a secure communications facility can electrically couple with encrypted signals or electrical grounds through TEMPEST protective measures. These measures work against the situation when the frequency of the unencrypted (RED) and encrypted (BLACK) signals are the same, preventing the RED signal from being intercepted directly or causing intermodulation between the RED and BLACK signals.\nquestion: What is the difference between HIJACK and NONSTOP threats in the context of secure communications? answer: HIJACK targets RF signals generated within the secure area, such as cellular telephones, while NONSTOP targets the pulses of a digital device, typically a computer.\nquestion: How does the Black Crow RINT sensor work, and what was its role in the Vietnam War? answer: The Black Crow RINT sensor, used during the Vietnam War, detected the static produced by the ignition system of trucks on the Ho Chi Minh trail from distances up to 10 miles. It cued weapons onto the trucks, providing a valuable tool for tracking and monitoring enemy activities.\nquestion: What is the technique behind Operation RAFTER, and how does it determine the frequency to which a receiver is tuned? answer: Operation RAFTER listens for the direct or additive frequency of the local oscillator in a superheterodyne receiver, allowing it to determine the frequency to which the receiver is tuned. This technique can be countered by shielding the intermediate frequency circuitry of superheterodyne receivers or moving into software-defined radio using digital signal processors with no local oscillator.\nquestion: How can unintentional radiation from electronic devices be used in MASINT and COMINT collection, and what are the challenges in securing against such eavesdropping? answer: Unintentional radiation from electronic devices can be used in MASINT and COMINT collection through techniques such as TEMPEST. The challenges in securing against such eavesdropping include understanding the normal incidental radiation from common devices like televisions and countering covert modulators for audio surveillance, which can use objects in the room to modulate an external RF signal.\nquestion: What are the similarities between TEAPOT and using reflections of a laser from a window in covert surveillance? answer: Both TEAPOT and using reflections of a laser from a window involve detecting acoustic pressure on the inside of a room and modulating a carrier signal based on the acoustic information. In the case of TEAPOT, an external RF signal is modulated, while with laser reflections, the laser carrier is modulated by the vibrations of the window.\nquestion: How was the Ho Chi Minh trail monitored using unintentional radiation MASINT techniques, and what advantages did this provide? answer: The Ho Chi Minh trail was monitored using the Black Crow RINT sensor, which detected the static produced by the ignition system of trucks from up to 10 miles away. This allowed for the cueing of weapons onto the trucks, providing a valuable tool for tracking and monitoring enemy activities. The advantage of using unintentional radiation MASINT techniques in this context was the ability to detect and track targets based on their unintentional emissions, which could be done at a distance and without relying on the intentional transmission of signals.",

Coupling modes can occur through front door coupling, where the EMP goes through an antenna intended to receive power in the frequency range being generated, or back door coupling, where the EMP produces surges in power and communications wire.\nquestion: How does TEMPEST secure equipment from eavesdropping on Van Eck radiation and other emanations? answer: TEMPEST is a set of techniques that secures equipment from eavesdropping on Van Eck radiation and other emanations by shielding intermediate frequency circuitry of superheterodyne receivers or moving into software-defined radio using digital signal processors with no local oscillator.\nquestion: What is the concept behind the Passive Resonant Cavity Bug, and how does it work? answer: The Passive Resonant Cavity Bug is a covert surveillance technique where an acoustic diaphragm forms a side of a resonant cavity. When illuminated with a microwave beam, the cavity reflects the beam back as a signal that is modulated by the audio of conversations in the room. The conversations cause the dimensions of the resonant cavity to change, producing the modulated signal.\nquestion: How can unencrypted signals within a secure communications facility electrically couple with encrypted signals or electrical grounds, and what protective measures are used to prevent this? answer: Unencrypted signals within a secure communications facility can electrically couple with encrypted signals or electrical grounds through TEMPEST protective measures. These measures work against the situation when the frequency of the unencrypted (RED) and encrypted (BLACK) signals are the same, preventing the RED signal from being intercepted directly or causing intermodulation between the RED and BLACK signals.\nquestion: What is the difference between HIJACK and NONSTOP threats in the context of secure communications? answer: HIJACK targets RF signals generated within the secure area, such as cellular telephones, while NONSTOP targets the pulses of a digital device, typically a computer.\nquestion: How does the Black Crow RINT sensor work, and what was its role in the Vietnam War? answer: The Black Crow RINT sensor, used during the Vietnam War, detected the static produced by the ignition system of trucks on the Ho Chi Minh trail from distances up to 10 miles. It cued weapons onto the trucks, providing a valuable tool for tracking and monitoring enemy activities.\nquestion: What is the technique behind Operation RAFTER, and how does it determine the frequency to which a receiver is tuned? answer: Operation RAFTER listens for the direct or additive frequency of the local oscillator in a superheterodyne receiver, allowing it to determine the frequency to which the receiver is tuned. This technique can be countered by shielding the intermediate frequency circuitry of superheterodyne receivers or moving into software-defined radio using digital signal processors with no local oscillator.\nquestion: How can unintentional radiation from electronic devices be used in MASINT and COMINT collection, and what are the challenges in securing against such eavesdropping? answer: Unintentional radiation from electronic devices can be used in MASINT and COMINT collection through techniques such as TEMPEST. The challenges in securing against such eavesdropping include understanding the normal incidental radiation from common devices like televisions and countering covert modulators for audio surveillance, which can use objects in the room to modulate an external RF signal.\nquestion: What are the similarities between TEAPOT and using reflections of a laser from a window in covert surveillance? answer: Both TEAPOT and using reflections of a laser from a window involve detecting acoustic pressure on the inside of a room and modulating a carrier signal based on the acoustic information. In the case of TEAPOT, an external RF signal is modulated, while with laser reflections, the laser carrier is modulated by the vibrations of the window.\nquestion: How was the Ho Chi Minh trail monitored using unintentional radiation MASINT techniques, and what advantages did this provide? answer: The Ho Chi Minh trail was monitored using the Black Crow RINT sensor, which detected the static produced by the ignition system of trucks from up to 10 miles away. This allowed for the cueing of weapons onto the trucks, providing a valuable tool for tracking and monitoring enemy activities. The advantage of using unintentional radiation MASINT techniques in this context was the ability to detect and track targets based on their unintentional emissions, which could be done at a distance and without relying on the intentional transmission of signals."

    "instruction": "2021 Microsoft Exchange Server data breach\n\n==Introduction==\nA global wave of cyberattacks and data breaches began in January 2021 after four zero-day exploits were discovered in on-premises Microsoft Exchange Servers, giving attackers full access to user emails and passwords on affected servers, administrator privileges on the server, and access to connected devices on the same network. Attackers typically install a backdoor that allows the attacker full access to impacted servers even if the server is later updated to no longer be vulnerable to the original exploits. As of 9 March 2021, it was estimated that 250,000 servers fell victim to the attacks, including servers belonging to around 30,000 organizations in the United States, 7,000 servers in the United Kingdom, as well as the European Banking Authority, the Norwegian Parliament, and Chile's Commission for the Financial Market (CMF).On 2 March 2021, Microsoft released updates for Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, 2013, 2016 and 2019 to patch the exploit; this does not retroactively undo damage or remove any backdoors installed by attackers. Small and medium businesses, local institutions, and local governments are known to be the primary victims of the attack, as they often have smaller budgets to secure against cyber threats and typically outsource IT services to local providers that do not have the expertise to deal with cyber attacks.On 12 March 2021, Microsoft announced the discovery of \"a new family of ransomware\" being deployed to servers initially infected, encrypting all files, making the server inoperable and demanding payment to reverse the damage. On 22 March 2021, Microsoft announced that in 92% of Exchange servers the exploit has been either patched or mitigated.\n\n\n\n== Background ==\nMicrosoft Exchange is considered a high-value target for hackers looking to penetrate business networks, as it is email server software, and, according to Microsoft, it provides \"a unique environment that could allow attackers to perform various tasks using the same built-in tools or scripts that admins use for maintenance.\" In the past, Microsoft Exchange has been attacked by multiple nation-state groups.On 5 January 2021, security testing company DEVCORE made the earliest known report of the vulnerability to Microsoft, which Microsoft verified on 8 January. The first breach of a Microsoft Exchange Server instance was observed by cybersecurity company Volexity on 6 January 2021. By the end of January, Volexity had observed a breach allowing attackers to spy on two of their customers, and alerted Microsoft to the vulnerability. After Microsoft was alerted of the breach, Volexity noted the hackers became less stealthy in anticipation of a patch.On 2 March 2021, another cybersecurity company, ESET, wrote that they were observing multiple attackers besides Hafnium exploiting the vulnerabilities. Wired reported on 10 March that now that the vulnerability had been patched, many more attackers were going to reverse engineer the fix to exploit still-vulnerable servers. Analysts at two security firms reported they had begun to see evidence that attackers were preparing to run cryptomining software on the servers.On 10 March 2021, security researcher Nguyen Jang posted proof-of-concept code to Microsoft-owned GitHub on how the exploit works, totaling 169 lines of code; the program was intentionally written with errors so that while security researchers could understand how the exploit works, malicious actors would not be able to use the code to access servers. Later that day, GitHub removed the code as it \"contains proof of concept code for a recently disclosed vulnerability that is being actively exploited\". On 13 March, another group independently published exploit code, with this code instead requiring minimal modification to work; the CERT Coordination Center's Will Dormann said the \"exploit is completely out of the bag by now\" in response.The attacks came shortly after the 2020 United States federal government data breach, which also saw the compromising of Microsoft's Outlook web app and supply chain. Microsoft said there was no connection between the two incidents.\n\n== Perpetrator ==\n\nMicrosoft said that the attack was initially perpetrated by the Hafnium, a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group (advanced persistent threat) that operates out of China. Hafnium is known to install the web shell China Chopper. Microsoft identified Hafnium as \"a highly skilled and sophisticated actor\" that historically has mostly targeted \"entities in the United States for the purpose of exfiltrating information from a number of industry sectors, including infectious disease researchers, law firms, higher education institutions, defense contractors, policy think tanks and NGOs.\" Announcing the hack, Microsoft stated that this was \"the eighth time in the past 12 months that Microsoft has publicly disclosed nation-state groups targeting institutions critical to civil society.\" As of 12 March 2021, there were, in addition to Hafnium, at least nine other distinct groups exploiting the vulnerabilities, each different styles and procedures.The Chinese government denied involvement, calling the accusations \"groundless.\"In a July 19, 2021 joint statement, the US, UK, EU, NATO, and other Western nations accused the Ministry of State Security (MSS) of perpetrating the Exchange breach, along with other cyberattacks, \"attributing with a high degree of confidence that malicious cyber actors affiliated with PRC\u2019s MSS conducted cyber espionage operations utilizing the zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server disclosed in early March 2021.\"\n\n== Methodology ==\nHackers took advantage of four separate zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise Microsoft Exchange servers' Outlook Web Access (OWA), giving them access to victims' entire servers and networks as well as to emails and calendar invitations, only at first requiring the address of the server, which can be directly targeted or obtained by mass-scanning for vulnerable servers; the attacker then uses two exploits, the first allowing an attacker to connect to the server and falsely authenticate as a standard user. With that, a second vulnerability can then be exploited, escalating that user access to administrator privileges. The final two exploits allow attackers to upload code to the server in any location they wish, that automatically runs with these administrator privileges. Attackers then typically use this to install a web shell, providing a backdoor to the compromised server, which gives hackers continued access to the server as long as both the web shell remains active and the Exchange server remains on.Through the web shell installed by attackers, commands can be run remotely. Among the actions observed are the downloading of all emails from servers, downloading the passwords and email addresses of users as Microsoft Exchange stores these unencrypted in memory, adding users, adding further backdoors to affected systems, accessing other systems in the network that are unsusceptible to the original exploit, and installing ransomware. As patching the Exchange server against the exploit does not retroactively remove installed backdoors, attackers continue to have access to the server until the web shell, other backdoors and user accounts added by attackers are removed.On 27 and 28 February 2021, there was an automated attack, and on 2 and 3 March 2021, attackers used a script to return to the addresses to drop a web shell to enable them to return later. Referring to the week ending 7 March, CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch stated: \"Every possible victim that hadn't patched by mid-to-end of last week has already been hit by at least one or several actors\". After the patch was announced, the tactics changed when using the same chain of vulnerabilities.Microsoft Exchange Server versions of 2010, 2013, 2016 and 2019 were confirmed to be susceptible, although vulnerable editions are yet to be fully determined. Cloud-based services Exchange Online and Office 365 are not affected.\n\n== Impact ==\nHackers have exploited the vulnerabilities to spy on a wide range of targets, affecting an estimated 250,000 servers. Tom Burt, Microsoft's vice president for Customer Security & Trust, wrote that targets had included disease researchers, law offices, universities, defense contractors, non-governmental organizations, and think tanks.Automatic updates are typically disabled by server administrators to avoid disruption from downtime and problems in software, and are by convention installed manually by server administrators after these updates are tested with the existing software and server-setup; as smaller organizations often operate under a smaller budget to do this in-house or otherwise outsource this to local IT providers without expertise in cybersecurity, this is often not done until it becomes a necessity, if ever. This means small and medium businesses, and local institutions such as schools and local governments are known to be the primary victims of the attack as they are more likely to not have received updates to patch the exploit. Rural victims are noted to be \"largely on their own\", as they are typically without access to IT service providers. On 11 March 2021, Check Point Research revealed that in the prior 24 hours \"the number of exploitation attempts on organizations it tracks tripled every two to three hours.\"Check Point Research has observed the United States as being the most attacked country with 17% of all exploit attempts, followed by Germany with 6%, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands both at 5%, and Russia with 4% of all exploits; government/military is the most targeted sector with 23% of exploit attempts, followed by manufacturing at 15%, banking and financial services at 14%, software vendors with 7% and healthcare at 6%.The attack was discovered after attackers were discovered downloading all emails belonging to specific users on separate corporate Exchange servers. An undisclosed Washington think tank reported attackers sending convincing emails to contacts in a social engineering attack that encouraged recipients to click on a link. On 11 March 2021, Norway's parliament, the Storting, reported being a victim of the hack, stating that \"data has been extracted.\"The European Banking Authority also reported that it had been targeted in the attack, later stating in a press release that the scope of impact on its systems was \"limited\" and that \"the confidentiality of the EBA systems and data has not been compromised\".Security company ESET identified \"at least 10\" advanced persistent threat groups compromising IT, cybersecurity, energy, software development, public utility, real estate, telecommunications and engineering businesses, as well as Middle Eastern and South American governmental agencies. One APT group was identified deploying PowerShell downloaders, using affected servers for cryptocurrency mining. Cybereason CEO Lior Div noted that APT group Hafnium \"targeted small and medium-sized enterprises ... The assault against Microsoft Exchange is 1,000 times more devastating than the SolarWinds attack.\"On 12 March 2021, Microsoft Security Intelligence announced \"a new family of ransomware\" called DearCry being deployed to the servers that had been initially infected, encrypting device contents, making servers unusable and demanding payment to recover files. Microsoft stated: \"There is no guarantee that paying the ransom will give you access to your files.\"On 18 March 2021, an affiliate of ransomware cybergang REvil claimed they had stolen unencrypted data from Taiwanese hardware and electronics corporation Acer, including an undisclosed number of devices being encrypted, with cybersecurity firm Advanced Intel linking this data breach and ransomware attack to the Microsoft Exchange exploits. Advanced Intel detected one of Acer's Microsoft Exchange servers first being targeted on 5 March 2021. REvil has demanded a $50 million U.S. dollar ransom, claiming if this is paid they would \"provide a decryptor, a vulnerability report, and the deletion of stolen files\", and stating that the ransom would double to $100 million U.S. dollars if not paid on 28 March 2021.\n\n== Responses ==\nOn 2 March 2021, the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) publicly posted an out-of-band Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) release, urging its clients to patch their Exchange servers to address a number of critical vulnerabilities. On 15 March, Microsoft released a one-click PowerShell tool, The Exchange On-Premises Mitigation Tool, which installs the specific updates protecting against the threat, runs a malware scan which also detects installed web shells, and removes threats that were detected; this is recommended as a temporary mitigation measure, as it does not install other available updates.On 3 March 2021, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an emergency directive forcing government networks to update to a patched version of Exchange. On 8 March, CISA tweeted what NBC News described as an \"unusually candid message\" urging \"ALL organizations across ALL sectors\" to address the vulnerabilities.Other official bodies expressing concerns included the White House, Norway's National Security Authority and the Czech Republic's Office for Cyber and Information Security. On 7 March 2021, CNN reported that the Biden administration was expected to form a task force to address the breach; the Biden administration has invited private-sector organizations to participate in the task force and will provide them with classified information as deemed necessary. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan stated that the U.S. is not yet in a position to attribute blame for the attacks.In July 2021, the Biden administration, along with a coalition of Western allies, formally blamed China for the cyber attack. The administration highlighted the ongoing threat of from Chinese hackers, but did not accompany the condemnation with any form of sanctions. According to White House press secretary Jen Psaki, the administration is not ruling out future consequences for China.\n\nUsing the text above, answer my questions:\n\n",

REvil has demanded a $50 million U.S. dollar ransom, claiming if this is paid they would \"provide a decryptor, a vulnerability report, and the deletion of stolen files\", and stating that the ransom would double to $100 million U.S. dollars if not paid on 28 March 2021.\n\n== Responses ==\nOn 2 March 2021, the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) publicly posted an out-of-band Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) release, urging its clients to patch their Exchange servers to address a number of critical vulnerabilities. On 15 March, Microsoft released a one-click PowerShell tool, The Exchange On-Premises Mitigation Tool, which installs the specific updates protecting against the threat, runs a malware scan which also detects installed web shells, and removes threats that were detected; this is recommended as a temporary mitigation measure, as it does not install other available updates.On 3 March 2021, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an emergency directive forcing government networks to update to a patched version of Exchange. On 8 March, CISA tweeted what NBC News described as an \"unusually candid message\" urging \"ALL organizations across ALL sectors\" to address the vulnerabilities.Other official bodies expressing concerns included the White House, Norway's National Security Authority and the Czech Republic's Office for Cyber and Information Security. On 7 March 2021, CNN reported that the Biden administration was expected to form a task force to address the breach; the Biden administration has invited private-sector organizations to participate in the task force and will provide them with classified information as deemed necessary. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan stated that the U.S. is not yet in a position to attribute blame for the attacks.In July 2021, the Biden administration, along with a coalition of Western allies, formally blamed China for the cyber attack. The administration highlighted the ongoing threat of from Chinese hackers, but did not accompany the condemnation with any form of sanctions. According to White House press secretary Jen Psaki, the administration is not ruling out future consequences for China.",
      "qa_list": "Question: What kind of software is Microsoft Exchange, and why is it a high-value target for hackers? Answer: Microsoft Exchange is email server software that provides a unique environment for attackers to perform various tasks using the same built-in tools or scripts that admins use for maintenance. It is considered a high-value target for hackers looking to penetrate business networks because it can allow attackers to spy on email communications, access sensitive data, and move laterally within the network. Question: Who is Hafnium, and what is their role in the 2021 Microsoft Exchange Server data breach? Answer: Hafnium is a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group that initially perpetrated the 2021 Microsoft Exchange Server data breach. They are known to install the web shell China Chopper and historically have targeted entities in the United States for the purpose of exfiltrating information from various industry sectors. Question: What are the four zero-day vulnerabilities that were exploited in the 2021 Microsoft Exchange Server data breach, and how were they used by attackers? Answer: The four zero-day vulnerabilities that were exploited in the 2021 Microsoft Exchange Server data breach allowed attackers to access victims' entire servers and networks, as well as to emails and calendar invitations. Attackers used these vulnerabilities to connect to the server, falsely authenticate as a standard user, escalate that user access to administrator privileges, and upload code to the server in any location they wish, that automatically runs with these administrator privileges. Question: What is a web shell, and how is it used by attackers in the 2021 Microsoft Exchange Server data breach? Answer: A web shell is a type of malware that provides a backdoor to the compromised server, which gives hackers continued access to the server as long as both the web shell remains active and the Exchange server remains on. Attackers in the 2021 Microsoft Exchange Server data breach used web shells to run commands remotely, download emails and passwords, add users, add further backdoors, access other systems in the network, and install ransomware. Question: What is the impact of the 2021 Microsoft Exchange Server data breach on small and medium businesses, and local institutions such as schools and local governments? Answer: Small and medium businesses, and local institutions such as schools and local governments are known to be the primary victims of the 2021 Microsoft Exchange Server data breach as they are more likely to not have received updates to patch the exploit. Rural victims are noted to be \"largely on their own\", as they are typically without access to IT service providers. Question: What is the role of the CERT Coordination Center in the 2021 Microsoft Exchange Server data breach? Answer: The CERT Coordination Center is responsible for coordinating responses to security vulnerabilities and incidents. In the 2021 Microsoft Exchange Server data breach, they removed proof-of-concept code from Microsoft-owned GitHub that demonstrated how the exploit works, as it was being actively exploited by malicious actors. Question: What is the \"DearCry\" ransomware that was deployed to the servers that had been initially infected in the 2021 Microsoft Exchange Server data breach? Answer: DearCry is a new family of ransomware that was deployed to the servers that had been initially infected in the 2021 Microsoft Exchange Server data breach. It encrypts device contents, making servers unusable and demands payment to recover files.

    "instruction": "context: Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys\n\n==Introduction==\nKerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys (KINK) is a protocol defined in RFC 4430 used to set up an IPsec security association (SA), similar to Internet Key Exchange (IKE), utilizing the Kerberos protocol to allow trusted third parties to handle authentication of peers and management of security policies in a centralized fashion.Its motivation is given in RFC 3129 as an alternative to IKE, in which peers must each use X.509 certificates for authentication, use Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange (DH) for encryption, know and implement a security policy for every peer with which it will connect, with authentication of the X.509 certificates either pre-arranged or using DNS, preferably with DNSSEC. Utilizing Kerberos, KINK peers must only mutually authenticate with the appropriate Authentication Server (AS), with a key distribution center (KDC) in turn controlling distribution of keying material for encryption and therefore controlling the IPsec security policy.\n\n== Protocol description ==\nKINK is a command/response protocol that can create, delete, and maintain IPsec SAs.  Each command or response contains a common header along with a set of type-length-value payloads.  The type of a command or a response constrains the payloads sent in the messages of the exchange.\nKINK itself is a stateless protocol in that each command or response does not require storage of hard state for KINK. This is in contrast to IKE, which uses Main Mode to first establish an Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) SA followed by subsequent Quick Mode exchanges.\nKINK uses Kerberos mechanisms to provide mutual authentication and replay protection.  For establishing SAs, KINK provides confidentiality for the payloads that follow the Kerberos AP-REQ payload. The design of KINK mitigates denial of service attacks by requiring authenticated exchanges before the use of any public key operations and the installation of any state. KINK also provides a means of using Kerberos User-to-User mechanisms when there is not a key shared between the server and the KDC. This is typically, but not limited to, the case with IPsec peers using PKINIT for initial authentication.\nKINK directly reuses Quick Mode payloads defined in section 5.5 of IKE, with some minor changes and omissions. In most cases, KINK exchanges are a single command and its response.  An optional third message is required when creating SAs, only if the responder rejects the first proposal from the initiator or wants to contribute the keying materials. KINK also provides rekeying and Dead Peer Detection.\n\n\n*** Packet format ***\nThe KINK message includes the following fields:\n\ntype: CREATE, DELETE, REPLY, GETTGT, ACK, STATUS, or private use\nversion: the major protocol version number\nlength: length of the entire message\ndomain of interpretation (DOI): a DOI as defined in the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP)\ntransaction ID (XID): identification the transaction, defined as a command, a reply, and an optional acknowledgement\nnext payload: type of the first payload after the message header as KINK_DONE, KINK_AP_REQ, KINK_AP_REP, KINK_KRB_ERROR, KINK_TGT_REQ, KINK_TGT_REP, KINK_ISAKMP, KINK_ENCRYPT, or KINK_ERROR\nACK or ACKREQ bit: 1 if responder requires an explicit acknowledgement that a REPLY was received otherwise 0\nchecksum length: length in bytes of the cryptographic checksum of the message\npayloads: a list of Type/Length/Value (TLV) payloads\nchecksum: Kerberos keyed checksum over the entire message excluding the checksum field itself\n\n\n*** Payloads ***\nKINK payloads are defined as:\n\nnext payload: type of the first payload\nlength: length of the payloadThe following payloads are defined:\n\nKINK_AP_REQ: a payload that relays a Kerberos AP-REQ to the responder\nKINK_AP_REP: a payload that relays a Kerberos AP-REP to the initiator\nKINK_KRB_ERROR: a payload that relays Kerberos type errors back to the initiator\nKINK_TGT_REQ: a payload that provides a means to get a TGT from the peer in order to obtain a User-to-User service ticket from the KDC\nKINK_TGT_REP: a payload that contains the TGT requested in a previous KINK_TGT_REQ payload of a GETTGT command\nKINK_ISAKMP: a payload to encapsulate the ISAKMP IKE Quick Mode (phase 2) payloads, to allow backward compatibility with IKE and ISAKMP if there are subsequent revisions\nKINK_ENCRYPT: a payload to encapsulate other KINK payloads and is encrypted using the session key and the algorithm specified by its etype\nKINK_ERROR: a payload that returns an error condition\n\n== Implementations ==\nThe following open source implementations of KINK are currently available:\n\nRacoon2 Archived 2008-10-15 at the Wayback Machine from the WIDE Project.\nNow I will ask you some questions, and you will answer.\n\n",

    "instruction": "Crypto naming controversy\n\n==Introduction==\nThe meaning of the word crypto as an abbreviation is controversial. Cryptographers - people who specialize in cryptography - have used the term \"crypto\" as an abbreviation for their field of study. However, \"crypto\" has also become a common abbreviation for cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n== Etymologies and definitions ==\n\nThe word cryptography derives from the prefix \"crypto-\" of Greek origin meaning \"hidden\" and the suffix \"-graph\" also of Greek origin and meaning \"to write\". This name reflects cryptography's historical role as the study of codes for secret communication. Still, the prefix crypto appears in many other words, such as cryptofascism (secret support for fascism), cryptosporidium (a parasite), and cryptomnesia (a long-forgotten memory).The term \"cryptography\" nowadays refers to an effervescent area of research that has moved beyond secret ciphers to study message authentication, digital signatures, secure multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs, among other active areas of research.Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are currencies that use cryptography as an underlying mechanism. Nevertheless, most cryptocurrencies only use digital signatures and hash functions.\n\n== Usages ==\nDictionaries such as Merriam-Webster and the Oxford English Dictionary, define \"crypto\" as a shorthand for cryptography.Matt Blaze registered the domain crypto.com in 1993, but sold the domain in 2018 to a cryptocurrency company. In 2021, the Staples Center in Los Angeles was renamed to the Crypto.com Arena, referring to the cryptocurrency company now behind the domain.Descriptivism, as opposed to prescriptivism, is the school of thought that accepts crypto as referring to cryptocurrency rather than cryptography based on the common use of the term.\n\n== Opinions ==\nComputer scientist Matthew D. Green stated that most cryptocurrencies barely have anything to do with serious cryptography, aside from trivial use of digital signatures and hash functions.\nMatt Blaze stated in 2018 that \"I think calling cryptocurrencies 'crypto' is a poor choice, with bad consequences for both cryptography and cryptocurrencies\".Parker Higgins of the Freedom of the Press Foundation stated that the cryptography crowd is by nature deeply invested in precision.Journalist Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai from Vice compared the controversy to the meaning of the word \"hacker\", which can used for criminals and curious technology enthusiasts as part of the hacker culture.The website cryptoisnotcryptocurrency.com features the statement \"\u2018Crypto\u2019 does not mean cryptocurrency, it means cryptography\" on a red background and with an emoticon expressing incredulity.Amie Stepanovich, the executive director of the Silicon Flatirons center at the University of Colorado, created T-shirts bearing the message: \"Crypto. It means cryptography.\" This shirt is popular among cybersecurity experts; it was, for example, worn by Matt Blaze.\n\nUsing the text above, answer my questions:\n\n",
    "context": "",
    "output": "Question1: How does the term \"crypto\" relate to the field of study focused on creating secret codes for communication? Answer1: The term \"crypto\" is derived from the Greek prefix \"crypto-\" which means \"hidden.\" When combined with the suffix \"-graph\" of Greek origin, which means \"to write,\" it forms the word \"cryptography,\" which has historically referred to the study of codes for secret communication.\n\nQuestion2: What is the modern-day definition of \"cryptography\" and how does \"crypto\" fit into it? Answer2: Cryptography now refers to a diverse and active area of research that includes message authentication, digital signatures, secure multiparty computation, and zero-knowledge proofs, among other things. The term \"crypto\" is a shortened version of \"cryptography\" and is used to define this field of study.\n\nQuestion3: How does the use of the term \"crypto\" in relation to cryptocurrencies differ from its original meaning in cryptography? Answer3: In the context of cryptocurrencies, \"crypto\" refers to the use of cryptography as an underlying mechanism. However, most cryptocurrencies only use digital signatures and hash functions, which is a more limited application of cryptography compared to its original meaning.\n\nQuestion4: What is the controversy surrounding the use of the term \"crypto\" for cryptocurrencies? Answer4: The controversy arises from the fact that \"crypto\" has traditionally been used as a shorthand for cryptography, and its use to refer to cryptocurrencies is seen by some as a misappropriation of the term. This has led to debates about the proper use of the term and its impact on both cryptography and cryptocurrencies.\n\nQuestion5: What is the school of thought that accepts the use of \"crypto\" as referring to cryptocurrency rather than cryptography? Answer5: Descriptivism is the school of thought that accepts the use of \"crypto\" as referring to cryptocurrency rather than cryptography based on the common use of the term.\n\nQuestion6: What did Matt Blaze say about the use of \"crypto\" in relation to cryptocurrencies in 2018? Answer6: In 2018, Matt Blaze stated that he thinks calling cryptocurrencies \"crypto\" is a poor choice, with bad consequences for both cryptography and cryptocurrencies.\n\nQuestion7: What is the significance of Matt Blaze selling the domain crypto.com to a cryptocurrency company in 2018? Answer7: The sale of the domain crypto.com by Matt Blaze to a cryptocurrency company in 2018 further highlights the controversy surrounding the use of the term \"crypto\" for cryptocurrencies.\n\nQuestion8: Why is the cryptography crowd deeply invested in precision in the use of the term \"crypto\"? Answer8: The cryptography crowd is deeply invested in precision in the use of the term \"crypto\" because of the technical nature of the field, which requires a clear and unambiguous understanding of concepts and terminology.\n\nQuestion9: What is the significance of the website cryptoisnotcryptocurrency.com and its message about the meaning of \"crypto\"? Answer9: The website cryptoisnotcryptocurrency.com is a statement expressing the view that \"crypto\" should only be used to refer to cryptography, and not cryptocurrency. The emoticon expressing incredulity on the website further emphasizes the opposition to the use of \"crypto\" for cryptocurrencies.\n\nQuestion10: Who is Amie Stepanovich and what message does her T-shirt bearing the message \"Crypto. It means cryptography.\" convey? Answer10: Amie Stepanovich is the executive director of the Silicon Flatirons center at the University of Colorado. Her T-shirt bearing the message \"Crypto. It means cryptography.\" is a statement expressing support for the traditional meaning of \"crypto\" as referring to cryptography, and opposition to its use for cryptocurrencies.\n\nQuestion11: Why is the controversy surrounding the use of \"crypto\" for cryptocurrencies compared to the meaning of the word \"hacker\"? Answer11: The controversy surrounding the use of \"crypto\" for cryptocurrencies is compared to the meaning of the word \"hacker\" because both terms can have multiple meanings and are used in different ways by different groups, leading to debates and controversies about their proper use.\n\nQuestion12: How does the common use of \"crypto\" in relation to cryptocurrencies differ from its definition in dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster and the Oxford English Dictionary?

      "context": "Crypto naming controversy\n\n==Introduction==\nThe meaning of the word crypto as an abbreviation is controversial. Cryptographers - people who specialize in cryptography - have used the term \"crypto\" as an abbreviation for their field of study. However, \"crypto\" has also become a common abbreviation for cryptocurrency.\n\n\n\n== Etymologies and definitions ==\n\nThe word cryptography derives from the prefix \"crypto-\" of Greek origin meaning \"hidden\" and the suffix \"-graph\" also of Greek origin and meaning \"to write\". This name reflects cryptography's historical role as the study of codes for secret communication. Still, the prefix crypto appears in many other words, such as cryptofascism (secret support for fascism), cryptosporidium (a parasite), and cryptomnesia (a long-forgotten memory).The term \"cryptography\" nowadays refers to an effervescent area of research that has moved beyond secret ciphers to study message authentication, digital signatures, secure multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs, among other active areas of research.Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are currencies that use cryptography as an underlying mechanism. Nevertheless, most cryptocurrencies only use digital signatures and hash functions.\n\n== Usages ==\nDictionaries such as Merriam-Webster and the Oxford English Dictionary, define \"crypto\" as a shorthand for cryptography.Matt Blaze registered the domain crypto.com in 1993, but sold the domain in 2018 to a cryptocurrency company. In 2021, the Staples Center in Los Angeles was renamed to the Crypto.com Arena, referring to the cryptocurrency company now behind the domain.Descriptivism, as opposed to prescriptivism, is the school of thought that accepts crypto as referring to cryptocurrency rather than cryptography based on the common use of the term.\n\n== Opinions ==\nComputer scientist Matthew D. Green stated that most cryptocurrencies barely have anything to do with serious cryptography, aside from trivial use of digital signatures and hash functions.\nMatt Blaze stated in 2018 that \"I think calling cryptocurrencies 'crypto' is a poor choice, with bad consequences for both cryptography and cryptocurrencies\".Parker Higgins of the Freedom of the Press Foundation stated that the cryptography crowd is by nature deeply invested in precision.Journalist Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai from Vice compared the controversy to the meaning of the word \"hacker\", which can used for criminals and curious technology enthusiasts as part of the hacker culture.The website cryptoisnotcryptocurrency.com features the statement \"\u2018Crypto\u2019 does not mean cryptocurrency, it means cryptography\" on a red background and with an emoticon expressing incredulity.Amie Stepanovich, the executive director of the Silicon Flatirons center at the University of Colorado, created T-shirts bearing the message: \"Crypto. It means cryptography.\" This shirt is popular among cybersecurity experts; it was, for example, worn by Matt Blaze.",
      "qa_list": "Question1: How does the term \"crypto\" relate to the field of study focused on creating secret codes for communication? Answer1: The term \"crypto\" is derived from the Greek prefix \"crypto-\" which means \"hidden.\" When combined with the suffix \"-graph\" of Greek origin, which means \"to write,\" it forms the word \"cryptography,\" which has historically referred to the study of codes for secret communication.\n\nQuestion2: What is the modern-day definition of \"cryptography\" and how does \"crypto\" fit into it? Answer2: Cryptography now refers to a diverse and active area of research that includes message authentication, digital signatures, secure multiparty computation, and zero-knowledge proofs, among other things. The term \"crypto\" is a shortened version of \"cryptography\" and is used to define this field of study.\n\nQuestion3: How does the use of the term \"crypto\" in relation to cryptocurrencies differ from its original meaning in cryptography? Answer3: In the context of cryptocurrencies, \"crypto\" refers to the use of cryptography as an underlying mechanism. However, most cryptocurrencies only use digital signatures and hash functions, which is a more limited application of cryptography compared to its original meaning.\n\nQuestion4: What is the controversy surrounding the use of the term \"crypto\" for cryptocurrencies? Answer4: The controversy arises from the fact that \"crypto\" has traditionally been used as a shorthand for cryptography, and its use to refer to cryptocurrencies is seen by some as a misappropriation of the term. This has led to debates about the proper use of the term and its impact on both cryptography and cryptocurrencies.\n\nQuestion5: What is the school of thought that accepts the use of \"crypto\" as referring to cryptocurrency rather than cryptography? Answer5: Descriptivism is the school of thought that accepts the use of \"crypto\" as referring to cryptocurrency rather than cryptography based on the common use of the term.\n\nQuestion6: What did Matt Blaze say about the use of \"crypto\" in relation to cryptocurrencies in 2018? Answer6: In 2018, Matt Blaze stated that he thinks calling cryptocurrencies \"crypto\" is a poor choice, with bad consequences for both cryptography and cryptocurrencies.\n\nQuestion7: What is the significance of Matt Blaze selling the domain crypto.com to a cryptocurrency company in 2018? Answer7: The sale of the domain crypto.com by Matt Blaze to a cryptocurrency company in 2018 further highlights the controversy surrounding the use of the term \"crypto\" for cryptocurrencies.\n\nQuestion8: Why is the cryptography crowd deeply invested in precision in the use of the term \"crypto\"? Answer8: The cryptography crowd is deeply invested in precision in the use of the term \"crypto\" because of the technical nature of the field, which requires a clear and unambiguous understanding of concepts and terminology.\n\nQuestion9: What is the significance of the website cryptoisnotcryptocurrency.com and its message about the meaning of \"crypto\"? Answer9: The website cryptoisnotcryptocurrency.com is a statement expressing the view that \"crypto\" should only be used to refer to cryptography, and not cryptocurrency.

Keith Mularski infiltrated it using the alias Master Splyntr, leading to more than 60 arrests worldwide. Subramaniam, who used the alias JiLsi, admitted conspiracy to defraud and was sentenced to nearly five years in prison in February 2010.DarkMarket also refers to a new darknet market founded in 2019 under the same name. However, German prosecutors in the cities of Koblenz and Oldenburg said 12 January 2021 that they had shut down what was \"probably the largest illegal marketplace on the Darknet\" called DarkMarket and physically arrested the man believed to operate it near Germany's border with Denmark.The website allowed buyers and sellers of stolen identities and credit card data to meet and conduct criminal enterprise in an entrepreneurial, peer-reviewed environment. It had 2,500 users at its peak.According to supervisory special agent Mularski of the FBI's Cyber Initiative & Resource Fusion Unit, their undercover operation was \"very successful in getting to the upper echelons of the Dark Market group and we were actually able to run the server and host all the communications that were going on there to make our cases.\" He obtained full access to everyone using the site and what they were doing by securing the server after gaining Subramaniam's confidence.\n\nIn Congressional testimony on November 17, 2009, FBI Deputy Assistant Director, Cyber Division Steven R. Chabinsky described the FBI operation:  The FBI's infiltration and dismantlement of Darkmarket, an online virtual transnational criminal organization. Working with our international partners in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Turkey, the FBI conducted a two-year undercover operation to penetrate the organization and bring it to its knees. At its peak, the Darkmarket forum had over 2,500 members\u2014spanning countries throughout the world\u2014who were involved in buying and selling stolen financial information, including credit card data, login credentials (user names, passwords), and equipment used to carry out certain financial crimes. Using undercover techniques, the FBI penetrated the highest levels of this group and identified and located its leading members. Multi-agency and multi-national coordination with our law enforcement partners led to over 60 arrests worldwide, as well as the prevention of $70 million in economic loss that otherwise would have occurred from compromised victim accounts.\nIn a speech to the GovSec/FOSE Conference on March 23, 2010, Chabinsky related explained Not long ago, there was an online carding forum named Darkmarket. It had members worldwide who were involved in buying and selling stolen financial information, such as credit card data, login credentials, and equipment to carry out financial crimes. Darkmarket doesn't exist anymore. Why? Because the FBI infiltrated it and brought it down. Through a two-year undercover operation led by an individual known to most users only as \"Master Splyntr,\" we penetrated the highest levels of this group and identified and located its leading members, which led to over 60 arrests worldwide and the prevention of tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars in economic loss. To the shock of criminals worldwide, Master Splyntr\u2014who was on the site nearly everyday, participating anywhere from one hour to 15 hours a day\u2014was a very dedicated and talented FBI special agent, of which we are proud and fortunate to have many. Still, it's a lot of work to take down a single forum, but it shows we can succeed if we have the right people in place and the resources to apply.\nIn other words, having hired and trained special agents who can talk the talk, and given the resources to spend enough hours online for an extended period of time, we have found that almost any cyber criminal enterprise will begin to trust us, despite having never met us face-to-face. We also learned that the communication methods used by these criminals are, to them, a social outlet as well. Just as often as they are speaking about malware, crimes, and goods for sale, they are talking about their families, their girlfriends, their vacations, and their cars. After a time, members of these forums become friends. That is where the intrinsic trust stems from. When somebody first enters as a new member, they\u2019re considered a potential cop; a month later, they\u2019re less of a cop; six months later, they\u2019re a friend; a year later, they are trusted implicitly\u2014to the extent that when an outsider anonymously told a Darkmarket participant that Master Splyntr was actually the FBI (which, as you now know, was true) all Master Splyntr had to do was deny the accusation and he was believed because he was an insider, whereas the informer was an outsider.\n\nThe Darkmarket case also provides us with insight into cyber crime tradecraft. Cyber criminals deploy countermeasures that can cost them a lot of time and effort, in hopes of evading our lawful investigative techniques. Consider the fact that cyber criminals routinely change their nicknames, e-mails, digital currency accounts, and the ICQ numbers they use in forums. Not only do they change these accounts and identifying numbers, but they also use different combinations of the information in each forum they participate in.\nAnother DarkMarket member, Thomas James Frederick Smith, pleaded guilty on June 10, 2010, to conspiracy to intentionally cause damage to a protected computer and to commit computer fraud.\n\n\nNow I will ask you some questions, and you will answer.\n\n",

The attack was the first time that the \"operational integrity of the country's critical maritime infrastructure has suffered a severe disruption\" leading the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) to call its impact \"unprecedented\" in South African history.The ISS speculated that Transnet was withholding details about the attack as it was an issue of national security and because the attack might cause legal liabilities for the company. Bloomberg News stated that the attackers encrypted files on Transnet's computer systems thereby preventing the company from accessing their own information whilst leaving instructions on how to start ransom negotiations. The Bloomberg article quotes a source from the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. which states that the ransomware used in the attack was linked to \"strains known variously as \u201cDeath Kitty,\u201d \u201cHello Kitty\u201d and \u201cFive Hands.\u201d\" and likely originated from Russia or Eastern Europe. The Department of Public Enterprises stated that none of Transnet client's data had been compromised in the attack.The timing of the attack, which followed closely after the 2021 South African unrest following former South African President Jacob Zuma's imprisonment, caused speculation that the two events might have been part of a coordinated effort to disrupt economic activity in the country. The authorities stated that the two events were likely unrelated.\n\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Durban port handles 60% of South African container traffic.\n\n== Timeline ==\nJuly 22, Transnet ransomware attack occurred.\nJuly 26, most computer systems had been restored.\nJuly 27, Transnet's investigation into the attack's severity was still ongoing.\nJuly 28, Department of Public Enterprises stated that Transnet had fully restored operations at the ports.",

    "instruction": "Computer forensics\n\n==Introduction==\nComputer forensics (also known as computer forensic science) is a branch of digital forensic science pertaining to evidence found in computers and digital storage media. The goal of computer forensics is to examine digital media in a forensically sound manner with the aim of identifying, preserving, recovering, analyzing and presenting facts and opinions about the digital information.\nAlthough it is most often associated  with the investigation of a wide variety of computer crime, computer forensics may also be used in civil proceedings. The discipline involves similar techniques and principles to data recovery, but with additional guidelines and practices designed to create a legal audit trail.\nEvidence from computer forensics investigations is usually subjected to the same guidelines and practices of other digital evidence. It has been used in a number of high-profile cases and is accepted as reliable within U.S. and European court systems.\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\nIn the early 1980s, personal computers became more accessible to consumers, leading to their increased use in criminal activity (for example, to help commit fraud). At the same time, several new \"computer crimes\" were recognized (such as cracking). The discipline of computer forensics emerged during this time as a method to recover and investigate digital evidence for use in court. Since then, computer crime and computer-related crime has grown, with the FBI reporting a suspected 791,790 internet crimes alone in 2020, a 69% increase over the amount reported in 2019.  Today, computer forensics is used to investigate a wide variety of crime, including child pornography, fraud, espionage, cyberstalking, murder, and rape. The discipline also features in civil proceedings as a form of information gathering (for example, Electronic discovery)\nForensic techniques and expert knowledge are used to explain the current state of a digital artifact, such as a computer system, storage medium (e.g., hard disk or CD-ROM), or an electronic document (e.g., an email message or JPEG image). The scope of a forensic analysis can vary from simple information retrieval to reconstructing a series of events. In a 2002 book, Computer Forensics, authors Kruse and Heiser define computer forensics as involving \"the preservation, identification, extraction, documentation and interpretation of computer data\". They go on to describe the discipline as \"more of an art than a science\", indicating that forensic methodology is backed by flexibility and extensive domain knowledge. However, while several methods can be used to extract evidence from a given computer, the strategies used by law enforcement are fairly rigid and lack the flexibility found in the civilian world.\n\n\n*** Cybersecurity ***\nComputer forensics is often confused with cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is about prevention and protection, while computer forensics is more reactionary and active, involving activities such as tracking and exposing. System security usually encompasses two teams, cybersecurity and computer forensics, which work together. A cybersecurity team creates systems and programs to protect data; if these fail, then the computer forensics team recovers the data and performs the investigation into the intrusion and theft. Both areas require knowledge of computer science.\n\n\n*** Computer-related crimes ***\nComputer forensics are used to convict those involved in physical and digital crimes. Some of these computer-related crimes include interruption, interception, copyright infringement, and fabrication. Interruption relates to the destruction and stealing of computer parts and digital files. Interception is the unauthorized access of files and information stored on technological devices. Copyright Infringement is using, reproducing, and distributing copyrighted information, including software piracy. Fabrication is accusing someone of using false data and information put in the system through an unauthorized source. Examples of interceptions are the Bank NSP case, Sony.Sambandh.com case, and business email compromise scams.\n\n== Use as evidence ==\nIn court, computer forensic evidence is subject to the usual requirements for digital evidence. This requires that information be authentic, reliably obtained, and admissible. Different countries have specific guidelines and practices for evidence recovery. In the United Kingdom, examiners often follow Association of Chief Police Officers guidelines that help ensure the authenticity and integrity of evidence. While voluntary, the guidelines are widely accepted in British courts.\nComputer forensics has been used as evidence in criminal law since the mid-1980s, some notable examples include:\nBTK Killer: Dennis Rader was convicted of a string of serial killings that occurred over a period of sixteen years. Towards the end of this period, Rader sent letters to the police on a floppy disk. Metadata within the documents implicated an author named \"Dennis\" at \"Christ Lutheran Church\"; this evidence helped lead to Rader's arrest.\nJoseph Edward Duncan: A spreadsheet recovered from Duncan's computer contained evidence that showed him planning his crimes. Prosecutors used this to show premeditation and secure the death penalty.\nSharon Lopatka: Hundreds of emails on Lopatka's computer lead investigators to her killer, Robert Glass.\nCorcoran Group: This case confirmed parties' duties to preserve digital evidence when litigation has commenced or is reasonably anticipated. Hard drives were analyzed by a computer forensics expert who could not find relevant emails the Defendants should have had.  Though the expert found no evidence of deletion on the hard drives, evidence came out that the defendants were found to have intentionally destroyed emails, and misled and failed to disclose material facts to the plaintiffs and the court.\nDr. Conrad Murray: Dr. Conrad Murray, the doctor of the deceased Michael Jackson, was convicted partially by digital evidence on his computer.  This evidence included medical documentation showing lethal amounts of propofol.\n\n== Forensic process ==\n\nComputer forensic investigations usually follow the standard digital forensic process or phases: acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting. Investigations are performed on static data (i.e. acquired images) rather than \"live\" systems. This is a change from early forensic practices where a lack of specialist tools led to investigators commonly working on live data.\n\n\n*** Computer forensics lab ***\nThe computer forensic lab is a safe and protected zone where electronic data can be managed, preserved, and accessed in a controlled environment. There, there is a very much reduced risk of damage or modification to the evidence. Computer forensic examiners have the resources needed to elicit meaningful data from the devices that they are examining.\n\n\n*** Techniques ***\nA number of techniques are used during computer forensics investigations, and these include the following:\n\nCross-drive analysis\nThis is a forensic technique that correlates information found on multiple hard drives, and has been used to identify social networks and perform anomaly detection. Live analysis\nThe examination of computers from within the operating system using custom forensics or existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. The practice is useful when dealing with Encrypting File Systems, for example, where the encryption keys may be collected and, in some instances, the logical hard drive volume may be imaged (known as a live acquisition) before the computer is shut down.Deleted files\nA common technique used in computer forensics is the recovery of deleted files. Modern forensic software have their own tools for recovering or carving out deleted data. Most operating systems and file systems do not always erase physical file data, allowing investigators to reconstruct it from the physical disk sectors. File carving involves searching for known file headers within the disk image and reconstructing deleted materials.Stochastic forensics\nA method which uses stochastic properties of the computer system to investigate activities lacking digital artifacts. Its chief use is to investigate data theft.Steganography\nOne of the techniques used to hide data is via steganography, the process of hiding data inside of a picture or digital image. An example would be to hide pornographic images of children or other information that a given criminal does not want to have discovered. Computer forensics professionals can fight this by looking at the hash of the file and comparing it to the original image (if available.) While the images appear identical upon visual inspection, the hash changes as the data changes.\n\n\n*** Mobile device forensics ***\nPhone Logs: Phone companies usually keep logs of calls received, which can be helpful when creating timelines and gathering the locations of persons when the crime occurred.Contacts: Contact lists help narrow down the suspect pool due to their connections with the victim or suspect.Text messages: Messages contain timestamps and remain in company servers indefinitely, even if deleted on the original device. Because of this, messages act as crucial records of communication that can be used to convict suspects.Photos: Photos can be critical in either supporting or disproving alibis by displaying a location or scene along with a timestamp of when the photo was taken.Audio Recordings: Some victims might have been able to record pivotal moments of the struggle, like the voice of their attacker or extensive context of the situation.\n\n\n*** Volatile data ***\nVolatile data is any data that is stored in memory, or exists in transit, that will be lost when the computer loses power or is turned off. Volatile data resides in registries, cache, and random access memory (RAM). The investigation of this volatile data is called \u201clive forensics\u201d.\nWhen seizing evidence, if the machine is still active, any information stored solely in RAM that is not recovered before powering down may be lost. One application of \"live analysis\" is to recover RAM data (for example, using Microsoft's COFEE tool, WinDD, WindowsSCOPE) prior to removing an exhibit. CaptureGUARD Gateway bypasses Windows login for locked computers, allowing for the analysis and acquisition of physical memory on a locked computer.RAM can be analyzed for prior content after power loss, because the electrical charge stored in the memory cells takes time to dissipate, an effect exploited by the cold boot attack. The length of time that data is recoverable is increased by low temperatures and higher cell voltages. Holding unpowered RAM below \u221260 \u00b0C helps preserve residual data by an order of magnitude, improving the chances of successful recovery. However, it can be impractical to do this during a field examination.Some of the tools needed to extract volatile data, however, require that a computer be in a forensic lab, both to maintain a legitimate chain of evidence, and to facilitate work on the machine. If necessary, law enforcement applies techniques to move a live, running desktop computer.  These include a mouse jiggler, which moves the mouse rapidly in small movements and prevents the computer from going to sleep accidentally.  Usually, an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) provides power during transit.\nHowever, one of the easiest ways to capture data is by actually saving the RAM data to disk.  Various file systems that have journaling features such as NTFS and ReiserFS keep a large portion of the RAM data on the main storage media during operation, and these page files can be reassembled to reconstruct what was in RAM at that time.\n\n\n*** Analysis tools ***\n\nA number of open source and commercial tools exist for computer forensics investigation. Typical forensic analysis includes a manual review of material on the media, reviewing the Windows registry for suspect information, discovering and cracking passwords, keyword searches for topics related to the crime, and extracting e-mail and pictures for review. Autopsy (software), Belkasoft Evidence Center, COFEE, EnCase are the some of tools used in Digital forensics.\n\n== Jobs in computer forensics ==\n\n\n*** Digital forensics analyst ***\nA digital forensics analyst is responsible for preserving digital evidence, cataloging collected evidence, analyzing evidence in a manner relevant to the ongoing case, responding to cyber breaches (usually in a corporate context), writing reports containing findings, and testifying in court. A digital forensic analyst may alternatively be referred to as a computer forensic analyst, digital forensic examiner, cyber forensic analyst, forensic technician, or other similarly named titles, although these roles perform the same duties.\n\n== Certifications ==\nThere are several computer forensics certifications available, such as the ISFCE Certified Computer Examiner, Digital Forensics Investigation Professional (DFIP) and IACRB Certified Computer Forensics Examiner.\nThe top vendor independent certification (especially within EU) is considered the CCFP - Certified Cyber Forensics Professional.Others, worth to mention for USA or APAC are:\nThe International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists offers the Certified Computer Examiner program.\nThe International Society of Forensic Computer Examiners offers the Certified Computer Examiner program.\nMany commercial based forensic software companies are now also offering proprietary certifications on their products. For example, Guidance Software offering the (EnCE) certification on their tool EnCase, AccessData offering (ACE) certification on their tool FTK, PassMark Software offering certification on their tool OSForensics, and X-Ways Software Technology offering (X-PERT) certification for their software, X-Ways Forensics.\n\n== Laws ==\n\n\n*** India ***\nIndian Laws Sections 65-77 relate to computer crimes. All the laws are enforced by evidence left digitally and remotely on the computer due to the permanent tracking of our actions on databases.Section 66: Law preventing the hacking of computers. The crime is punishable by three years in prison or a five lakhs rupee fine.Section 66F: Law focused on cyber-terrorism such as malware, phishing, unauthorized access, identity theft, etc. If caught, it usually leads to a life sentence.Section 67B: Law to prevent the spread and publishing of child porn. It could lead to up to 7 years in prison and a ten lakhs rupee fine.\n\nUsing the text above, answer my questions:\n\n",

Prosecutors used this to show premeditation and secure the death penalty.\nSharon Lopatka: Hundreds of emails on Lopatka's computer lead investigators to her killer, Robert Glass.\nCorcoran Group: This case confirmed parties' duties to preserve digital evidence when litigation has commenced or is reasonably anticipated. Hard drives were analyzed by a computer forensics expert who could not find relevant emails the Defendants should have had.  Though the expert found no evidence of deletion on the hard drives, evidence came out that the defendants were found to have intentionally destroyed emails, and misled and failed to disclose material facts to the plaintiffs and the court.\nDr. Conrad Murray: Dr. Conrad Murray, the doctor of the deceased Michael Jackson, was convicted partially by digital evidence on his computer.  This evidence included medical documentation showing lethal amounts of propofol.\n\n== Forensic process ==\n\nComputer forensic investigations usually follow the standard digital forensic process or phases: acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting. Investigations are performed on static data (i.e. acquired images) rather than \"live\" systems. This is a change from early forensic practices where a lack of specialist tools led to investigators commonly working on live data.\n\n\n*** Computer forensics lab ***\nThe computer forensic lab is a safe and protected zone where electronic data can be managed, preserved, and accessed in a controlled environment. There, there is a very much reduced risk of damage or modification to the evidence. Computer forensic examiners have the resources needed to elicit meaningful data from the devices that they are examining.\n\n\n*** Techniques ***\nA number of techniques are used during computer forensics investigations, and these include the following:\n\nCross-drive analysis\nThis is a forensic technique that correlates information found on multiple hard drives, and has been used to identify social networks and perform anomaly detection. Live analysis\nThe examination of computers from within the operating system using custom forensics or existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. The practice is useful when dealing with Encrypting File Systems, for example, where the encryption keys may be collected and, in some instances, the logical hard drive volume may be imaged (known as a live acquisition) before the computer is shut down.Deleted files\nA common technique used in computer forensics is the recovery of deleted files. Modern forensic software have their own tools for recovering or carving out deleted data. Most operating systems and file systems do not always erase physical file data, allowing investigators to reconstruct it from the physical disk sectors. File carving involves searching for known file headers within the disk image and reconstructing deleted materials.Stochastic forensics\nA method which uses stochastic properties of the computer system to investigate activities lacking digital artifacts. Its chief use is to investigate data theft.Steganography\nOne of the techniques used to hide data is via steganography, the process of hiding data inside of a picture or digital image. An example would be to hide pornographic images of children or other information that a given criminal does not want to have discovered. Computer forensics professionals can fight this by looking at the hash of the file and comparing it to the original image (if available.) While the images appear identical upon visual inspection, the hash changes as the data changes.\n\n\n*** Mobile device forensics ***\nPhone Logs: Phone companies usually keep logs of calls received, which can be helpful when creating timelines and gathering the locations of persons when the crime occurred.Contacts: Contact lists help narrow down the suspect pool due to their connections with the victim or suspect.Text messages: Messages contain timestamps and remain in company servers indefinitely, even if deleted on the original device. Because of this, messages act as crucial records of communication that can be used to convict suspects.Photos: Photos can be critical in either supporting or disproving alibis by displaying a location or scene along with a timestamp of when the photo was taken.Audio Recordings: Some victims might have been able to record pivotal moments of the struggle, like the voice of their attacker or extensive context of the situation.\n\n\n*** Volatile data ***\nVolatile data is any data that is stored in memory, or exists in transit, that will be lost when the computer loses power or is turned off. Volatile data resides in registries, cache, and random access memory (RAM). The investigation of this volatile data is called \u201clive forensics\u201d.\nWhen seizing evidence, if the machine is still active, any information stored solely in RAM that is not recovered before powering down may be lost. One application of \"live analysis\" is to recover RAM data (for example, using Microsoft's COFEE tool, WinDD, WindowsSCOPE) prior to removing an exhibit. CaptureGUARD Gateway bypasses Windows login for locked computers, allowing for the analysis and acquisition of physical memory on a locked computer.RAM can be analyzed for prior content after power loss, because the electrical charge stored in the memory cells takes time to dissipate, an effect exploited by the cold boot attack. The length of time that data is recoverable is increased by low temperatures and higher cell voltages. Holding unpowered RAM below \u221260 \u00b0C helps preserve residual data by an order of magnitude, improving the chances of successful recovery. However, it can be impractical to do this during a field examination.Some of the tools needed to extract volatile data, however, require that a computer be in a forensic lab, both to maintain a legitimate chain of evidence, and to facilitate work on the machine. If necessary, law enforcement applies techniques to move a live, running desktop computer.  These include a mouse jiggler, which moves the mouse rapidly in small movements and prevents the computer from going to sleep accidentally.  Usually, an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) provides power during transit.\nHowever, one of the easiest ways to capture data is by actually saving the RAM data to disk.  Various file systems that have journaling features such as NTFS and ReiserFS keep a large portion of the RAM data on the main storage media during operation, and these page files can be reassembled to reconstruct what was in RAM at that time.\n\n\n*** Analysis tools ***\n\nA number of open source and commercial tools exist for computer forensics investigation. Typical forensic analysis includes a manual review of material on the media, reviewing the Windows registry for suspect information, discovering and cracking passwords, keyword searches for topics related to the crime, and extracting e-mail and pictures for review. Autopsy (software), Belkasoft Evidence Center, COFEE, EnCase are the some of tools used in Digital forensics.\n\n== Jobs in computer forensics ==\n\n\n*** Digital forensics analyst ***\nA digital forensics analyst is responsible for preserving digital evidence, cataloging collected evidence, analyzing evidence in a manner relevant to the ongoing case, responding to cyber breaches (usually in a corporate context), writing reports containing findings, and testifying in court. A digital forensic analyst may alternatively be referred to as a computer forensic analyst, digital forensic examiner, cyber forensic analyst, forensic technician, or other similarly named titles, although these roles perform the same duties.\n\n== Certifications ==\nThere are several computer forensics certifications available, such as the ISFCE Certified Computer Examiner, Digital Forensics Investigation Professional (DFIP) and IACRB Certified Computer Forensics Examiner.\nThe top vendor independent certification (especially within EU) is considered the CCFP - Certified Cyber Forensics Professional.Others, worth to mention for USA or APAC are:\nThe International Association of Computer Investigative Specialists offers the Certified Computer Examiner program.\nThe International Society of Forensic Computer Examiners offers the Certified Computer Examiner program.\nMany commercial based forensic software companies are now also offering proprietary certifications on their products. For example, Guidance Software offering the (EnCE) certification on their tool EnCase, AccessData offering (ACE) certification on their tool FTK, PassMark Software offering certification on their tool OSForensics, and X-Ways Software Technology offering (X-PERT) certification for their software, X-Ways Forensics.\n\n== Laws ==\n\n\n*** India ***\nIndian Laws Sections 65-77 relate to computer crimes. All the laws are enforced by evidence left digitally and remotely on the computer due to the permanent tracking of our actions on databases.Section 66: Law preventing the hacking of computers. The crime is punishable by three years in prison or a five lakhs rupee fine.Section 66F: Law focused on cyber-terrorism such as malware, phishing, unauthorized access, identity theft, etc. If caught, it usually leads to a life sentence.Section 67B: Law to prevent the spread and publishing of child porn. It could lead to up to 7 years in prison and a ten lakhs rupee fine.",

    "instruction": "Security-Enhanced Linux\n\n==Introduction==\nSecurity-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a Linux kernel security module that provides a mechanism for supporting access control security policies, including mandatory access controls (MAC).\nSELinux is a set of kernel modifications and user-space tools that have been added to various Linux distributions. Its architecture strives to separate enforcement of security decisions from the security policy, and streamlines the amount of software involved with security policy enforcement. The key concepts underlying SELinux can be traced to several earlier projects by the United States National Security Agency (NSA).\n\n== Overview ==\nThe NSA Security-enhanced Linux Team describes NSA SELinux as\na set of patches to the Linux kernel and utilities to provide a strong, flexible, mandatory access control (MAC) architecture into the major subsystems of the kernel. It provides an enhanced mechanism to enforce the separation of information based on confidentiality and integrity requirements, which allows threats of tampering, and bypassing of application security mechanisms, to be addressed and enables the confinement of damage that can be caused by malicious or flawed applications. It includes a set of sample security policy configuration files designed to meet common, general-purpose security goals.\nA Linux kernel integrating SELinux enforces mandatory access control policies that confine user programs and system services, as well as access to files and network resources. Limiting privilege to the minimum required to work reduces or eliminates the ability of these programs and daemons to cause harm if faulty or compromised (for example via buffer overflows or misconfigurations). This confinement mechanism operates independently of the traditional Linux (discretionary) access control mechanisms. It has no concept of a \"root\" superuser, and does not share the well-known shortcomings of the traditional Linux security mechanisms, such as a dependence on setuid/setgid binaries.\nThe security of an \"unmodified\" Linux system (a system without SELinux) depends on the correctness of the kernel, of all the privileged applications, and of each of their configurations. A fault in any one of these areas may allow the compromise of the entire system. In contrast, the security of a \"modified\" system (based on an SELinux kernel) depends primarily on the correctness of the kernel and its security-policy configuration. While problems with the correctness or configuration of applications may allow the limited compromise of individual user programs and system daemons, they do not necessarily pose a threat to the security of other user programs and system daemons or to the security of the system as a whole.\nFrom a purist perspective, SELinux provides a hybrid of concepts and capabilities drawn from mandatory access controls, mandatory integrity controls, role-based access control (RBAC), and type enforcement architecture. Third-party tools enable one to build a variety of security policies.\n\n== Users, policies and security contexts ==\nSELinux users and roles do not have to be related to the actual system users and roles. For every current user or process, SELinux assigns a three string context consisting of a username, role, and domain (or type). This system is more flexible than normally required: as a rule, most of the real users share the same SELinux username, and all access control is managed through the third tag, the domain. The circumstances under which a process is allowed into a certain domain must be configured in the policies. The command runcon allows for the launching of a process into an explicitly specified context (user, role, and domain), but SELinux may deny the transition if it is not approved by the policy.\nFiles, network ports, and other hardware also have an SELinux context, consisting of a name, role (seldom used), and type. In the case of file systems, mapping between files and the security contexts is called labeling. The labeling is defined in policy files but can also be manually adjusted without changing the policies. Hardware types are quite detailed, for instance, bin_t (all files in the folder /bin) or postgresql_port_t (PostgreSQL port, 5432). The SELinux context for a remote file system can be specified explicitly at mount time.\nSELinux adds the -Z switch to the shell commands ls, ps, and some others, allowing the security context of the files or process to be seen.\nTypical policy rules consist of explicit permissions, for example, which domains the user must possess to perform certain actions with the given target (read, execute, or, in case of network port, bind or connect), and so on. More complex mappings are also possible, involving roles and security levels.\nA typical policy consists of a mapping (labeling) file, a rule file, and an interface file, that define the domain transition. These three files must be compiled together with the SELinux tools to produce a single policy file. The resulting policy file can be loaded into the kernel to make it active. Loading and unloading policies does not require a reboot. The policy files are either hand written or can be generated from the more user friendly SELinux management tool. They are normally tested in permissive mode first, where violations are logged but allowed. The audit2allow tool can be used later to produce additional rules that extend the policy to allow all legitimate activities of the application being confined.\n\n== Features ==\nSELinux features include:\n\nClean separation of policy from enforcement\nWell-defined policy interfaces\nSupport for applications querying the policy and enforcing access control (for example, crond running jobs in the correct context)\nIndependence of specific policies and policy languages\nIndependence of specific security-label formats and contents\nIndividual labels and controls for kernel objects and services\nSupport for policy changes\nSeparate measures for protecting system integrity (domain-type) and data confidentiality (multilevel security)\nFlexible policy\nControls over process initialization and inheritance, and program execution\nControls over file systems, directories, files, and open file descriptors\nControls over sockets, messages, and network interfaces\nControls over the use of \"capabilities\"\nCached information on access-decisions via the Access Vector Cache (AVC)\nDefault-deny policy (anything not explicitly specified in the policy is disallowed)\n\n== Adoption ==\n\nSELinux has been implemented in Android since version 4.3.Among free community-supported Linux distributions, Fedora was one of the earliest adopters, including support for it by default since Fedora Core 2. Other distributions include support for it such as Debian as of version 9 Stretch release and Ubuntu as of 8.04 Hardy Heron. As of version 11.1, openSUSE contains SELinux \"basic enablement\". SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 features SELinux as a \"technology preview\".SELinux is popular in systems based on linux containers, such as CoreOS Container Linux and rkt. It is useful as an additional security control to help further enforce isolation between deployed containers and their host.\nSELinux is available since 2005 as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 4 and all future releases. This presence is also reflected in corresponding versions of CentOS and Scientific Linux. The supported policy in RHEL4 is targeted policy which aims for maximum ease of use and thus is not as restrictive as it might be. Future versions of RHEL are planned to have more targets in the targeted policy which will mean more restrictive policies.\n\n== Use scenarios ==\nSELinux can potentially control which activities a system allows each user, process, and daemon, with very precise specifications. It is used to confine daemons such as database engines or web servers that have clearly defined data access and activity rights. This limits potential harm from a confined daemon that becomes compromised.\nCommand-line utilities include:chcon,restorecon,restorecond,runcon,secon,fixfiles,setfiles,load_policy,booleans,getsebool,setsebool,toggleseboolsetenforce,\nsemodule,\npostfix-nochroot,\ncheck-selinux-installation,\nsemodule_package,\ncheckmodule,\nselinux-config-enforcing,selinuxenabled,\nand selinux-policy-upgrade\n\n\n*** Examples ***\nTo put SELinux into enforcing mode:\n\nsetenforce 1To query the SELinux status:\n\ngetenforce\n\n== Comparison with AppArmor ==\nSELinux represents one of several possible approaches to the problem of restricting the actions that installed software can take. Another popular alternative is called AppArmor and is available on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), openSUSE, and Debian-based platforms. AppArmor was developed as a component to the now-defunct Immunix Linux platform. Because AppArmor and SELinux differ radically from one another, they form distinct alternatives for software control. Whereas SELinux re-invents certain concepts to provide access to a more expressive set of policy choices, AppArmor was designed to be simple by extending the same administrative semantics used for DAC up to the mandatory access control level.\nThere are several key differences:\n\nOne important difference is that AppArmor identifies file system objects by path name instead of inode. This means that, for example, a file that is inaccessible may become accessible under AppArmor when a hard link is created to it, while SELinux would deny access through the newly created hard link.\nAs a result, AppArmor can be said not to be a type enforcement system, as files are not assigned a type; instead, they are merely referenced in a configuration file.\nSELinux and AppArmor also differ significantly in how they are administered and how they integrate into the system.\nSince it endeavors to recreate traditional DAC controls with MAC-level enforcement, AppArmor's set of operations is also considerably smaller than those available under most SELinux implementations. For example, AppArmor's set of operations consist of: read, write, append, execute, lock, and link. Most SELinux implementations will support numbers of operations orders of magnitude more than that. For example, SELinux will usually support those same permissions, but also includes controls for mknod, binding to network sockets, implicit use of POSIX capabilities, loading and unloading kernel modules, various means of accessing shared memory, etc.\nThere are no controls in AppArmor for categorically bounding POSIX capabilities. Since the current implementation of capabilities contains no notion of a subject for the operation (only the actor and the operation) it is usually the job of the MAC layer to prevent privileged operations on files outside the actor's enforced realm of control (i.e. \"Sandbox\"). AppArmor can prevent its own policy from being altered, and prevent file systems from being mounted/unmounted, but does nothing to prevent users from stepping outside their approved realms of control.\nFor example, it may be deemed beneficial for help desk employees to change ownership or permissions on certain files even if they don't own them (for example, on a departmental file share). The administrator does not want to give the user(s) root access on the box so they give them CAP_FOWNER or CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE. Under SELinux the administrator (or platform vendor) can configure SELinux to deny all capabilities to otherwise unconfined users, then create confined domains for the employee to be able to transition into after logging in, one that can exercise those capabilities, but only upon files of the appropriate type.\nThere is no notion of multilevel security with AppArmor, thus there is no hard BLP or Biba enforcement available..\nAppArmor configuration is done using solely regular flat files. SELinux (by default in most implementations) uses a combination of flat files (used by administrators and developers to write human readable policy before it's compiled) and extended attributes.\nSELinux supports the concept of a \"remote policy server\" (configurable via /etc/selinux/semanage.conf) as an alternative source for policy configuration. Central management of AppArmor is usually complicated considerably since administrators must decide between configuration deployment tools being run as root (to allow policy updates) or configured manually on each server.\n\n== Similar systems and enhancements ==\n\nIsolation of processes can also be accomplished by mechanisms such as virtualization; the OLPC project, for example, in its first implementation sandboxed individual applications in lightweight Vservers. Also, the NSA has adopted some of the SELinux concepts in Security-Enhanced Android.General Dynamics builds and distributes PitBull Trusted Operating System, a multilevel security (MLS) enhancement for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\nMulti-Category Security (MCS) is an enhancement to SELinux for Red Hat Enterprise Linux that allows users to label files with categories, in order to further restrict access through discretionary access control and type enforcement. Categories provide additional compartments within sensitivity levels used by multilevel security (MLS).\n\nUsing the text above, answer my questions:\n\n",

More complex mappings are also possible, involving roles and security levels.\nA typical policy consists of a mapping (labeling) file, a rule file, and an interface file, that define the domain transition. These three files must be compiled together with the SELinux tools to produce a single policy file. The resulting policy file can be loaded into the kernel to make it active. Loading and unloading policies does not require a reboot. The policy files are either hand written or can be generated from the more user friendly SELinux management tool. They are normally tested in permissive mode first, where violations are logged but allowed. The audit2allow tool can be used later to produce additional rules that extend the policy to allow all legitimate activities of the application being confined.\n\n== Features ==\nSELinux features include:\n\nClean separation of policy from enforcement\nWell-defined policy interfaces\nSupport for applications querying the policy and enforcing access control (for example, crond running jobs in the correct context)\nIndependence of specific policies and policy languages\nIndependence of specific security-label formats and contents\nIndividual labels and controls for kernel objects and services\nSupport for policy changes\nSeparate measures for protecting system integrity (domain-type) and data confidentiality (multilevel security)\nFlexible policy\nControls over process initialization and inheritance, and program execution\nControls over file systems, directories, files, and open file descriptors\nControls over sockets, messages, and network interfaces\nControls over the use of \"capabilities\"\nCached information on access-decisions via the Access Vector Cache (AVC)\nDefault-deny policy (anything not explicitly specified in the policy is disallowed)\n\n== Adoption ==\n\nSELinux has been implemented in Android since version 4.3.Among free community-supported Linux distributions, Fedora was one of the earliest adopters, including support for it by default since Fedora Core 2. Other distributions include support for it such as Debian as of version 9 Stretch release and Ubuntu as of 8.04 Hardy Heron. As of version 11.1, openSUSE contains SELinux \"basic enablement\". SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 features SELinux as a \"technology preview\".SELinux is popular in systems based on linux containers, such as CoreOS Container Linux and rkt. It is useful as an additional security control to help further enforce isolation between deployed containers and their host.\nSELinux is available since 2005 as part of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) version 4 and all future releases. This presence is also reflected in corresponding versions of CentOS and Scientific Linux. The supported policy in RHEL4 is targeted policy which aims for maximum ease of use and thus is not as restrictive as it might be. Future versions of RHEL are planned to have more targets in the targeted policy which will mean more restrictive policies.\n\n== Use scenarios ==\nSELinux can potentially control which activities a system allows each user, process, and daemon, with very precise specifications. It is used to confine daemons such as database engines or web servers that have clearly defined data access and activity rights. This limits potential harm from a confined daemon that becomes compromised.\nCommand-line utilities include:chcon,restorecon,restorecond,runcon,secon,fixfiles,setfiles,load_policy,booleans,getsebool,setsebool,toggleseboolsetenforce,\nsemodule,\npostfix-nochroot,\ncheck-selinux-installation,\nsemodule_package,\ncheckmodule,\nselinux-config-enforcing,selinuxenabled,\nand selinux-policy-upgrade\n\n\n*** Examples ***\nTo put SELinux into enforcing mode:\n\nsetenforce 1To query the SELinux status:\n\ngetenforce\n\n== Comparison with AppArmor ==\nSELinux represents one of several possible approaches to the problem of restricting the actions that installed software can take. Another popular alternative is called AppArmor and is available on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), openSUSE, and Debian-based platforms. AppArmor was developed as a component to the now-defunct Immunix Linux platform. Because AppArmor and SELinux differ radically from one another, they form distinct alternatives for software control. Whereas SELinux re-invents certain concepts to provide access to a more expressive set of policy choices, AppArmor was designed to be simple by extending the same administrative semantics used for DAC up to the mandatory access control level.\nThere are several key differences:\n\nOne important difference is that AppArmor identifies file system objects by path name instead of inode. This means that, for example, a file that is inaccessible may become accessible under AppArmor when a hard link is created to it, while SELinux would deny access through the newly created hard link.\nAs a result, AppArmor can be said not to be a type enforcement system, as files are not assigned a type; instead, they are merely referenced in a configuration file.\nSELinux and AppArmor also differ significantly in how they are administered and how they integrate into the system.\nSince it endeavors to recreate traditional DAC controls with MAC-level enforcement, AppArmor's set of operations is also considerably smaller than those available under most SELinux implementations. For example, AppArmor's set of operations consist of: read, write, append, execute, lock, and link. Most SELinux implementations will support numbers of operations orders of magnitude more than that. For example, SELinux will usually support those same permissions, but also includes controls for mknod, binding to network sockets, implicit use of POSIX capabilities, loading and unloading kernel modules, various means of accessing shared memory, etc.\nThere are no controls in AppArmor for categorically bounding POSIX capabilities. Since the current implementation of capabilities contains no notion of a subject for the operation (only the actor and the operation) it is usually the job of the MAC layer to prevent privileged operations on files outside the actor's enforced realm of control (i.e. \"Sandbox\"). AppArmor can prevent its own policy from being altered, and prevent file systems from being mounted/unmounted, but does nothing to prevent users from stepping outside their approved realms of control.\nFor example, it may be deemed beneficial for help desk employees to change ownership or permissions on certain files even if they don't own them (for example, on a departmental file share). The administrator does not want to give the user(s) root access on the box so they give them CAP_FOWNER or CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE. Under SELinux the administrator (or platform vendor) can configure SELinux to deny all capabilities to otherwise unconfined users, then create confined domains for the employee to be able to transition into after logging in, one that can exercise those capabilities, but only upon files of the appropriate type.\nThere is no notion of multilevel security with AppArmor, thus there is no hard BLP or Biba enforcement available..\nAppArmor configuration is done using solely regular flat files. SELinux (by default in most implementations) uses a combination of flat files (used by administrators and developers to write human readable policy before it's compiled) and extended attributes.\nSELinux supports the concept of a \"remote policy server\" (configurable via /etc/selinux/semanage.conf) as an alternative source for policy configuration. Central management of AppArmor is usually complicated considerably since administrators must decide between configuration deployment tools being run as root (to allow policy updates) or configured manually on each server.\n\n== Similar systems and enhancements ==\n\nIsolation of processes can also be accomplished by mechanisms such as virtualization; the OLPC project, for example, in its first implementation sandboxed individual applications in lightweight Vservers. Also, the NSA has adopted some of the SELinux concepts in Security-Enhanced Android.General Dynamics builds and distributes PitBull Trusted Operating System, a multilevel security (MLS) enhancement for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\nMulti-Category Security (MCS) is an enhancement to SELinux for Red Hat Enterprise Linux that allows users to label files with categories, in order to further restrict access through discretionary access control and type enforcement. Categories provide additional compartments within sensitivity levels used by multilevel security (MLS).",
      "qa_list": "Q1: What is the role of SELinux in enforcing mandatory access control policies in Linux kernel? A1: SELinux is a Linux kernel security module that provides a mechanism for supporting access control security policies, including mandatory access controls (MAC). It enforces these policies by confining user programs, system services, and access to files and network resources, thereby reducing or eliminating the ability of these programs and daemons to cause harm if faulty or compromised.\nQ2: How does SELinux enhance the security of a Linux system? A2: SELinux enhances the security of a Linux system by providing a strong, flexible, mandatory access control (MAC) architecture that addresses threats of tampering and bypassing of application security mechanisms. It enables the confinement of damage that can be caused by malicious or flawed applications and separates enforcement of security decisions from the security policy.\nQ3: What is the significance of the -Z switch in SELinux? A3: The -Z switch in SELinux is used to allow the security context of the files or process to be seen. It is available in shell commands such as ls, ps, and others.\nQ4: How does SELinux differ from traditional Linux security mechanisms? A4: SELinux differs from traditional Linux security mechanisms in that it does not share their well-known shortcomings, such as a dependence on setuid/setgid binaries and a concept of a \"root\" superuser.\nQ5: What are the components of a typical SELinux policy? A5: A typical SELinux policy consists of a mapping (labeling) file, a rule file, and an interface file that define the domain transition. These three files must be compiled together with the SELinux tools to produce a single policy file.\nQ6: What is the role of the policy files in SELinux? A6: The policy files in SELinux define the security policies and controls over various components of the system such as process initialization, inheritance, program execution, file systems, directories, files, open file descriptors, sockets, messages, network interfaces, and capabilities.\nQ7: How does SELinux handle policy changes? A7: SELinux supports policy changes, allowing for flexibility in the enforcement of security policies and controls.\nQ8: How does SELinux protect system integrity and data confidentiality? A8: SELinux protects system integrity and data confidentiality through separate measures for each, enabling hard BLP or Biba enforcement for data confidentiality.\nQ9: How does SELinux differ from AppArmor in terms of file system object identification? A9: SELinux identifies file system objects by inode, while AppArmor identifies them by path name. This means that, for example, a file that is inaccessible under SELinux would remain inaccessible under AppArmor when a hard link is created to it.\nQ10: How does SELinux handle POSIX capabilities compared to AppArmor? A10: SELinux supports controls for categorically bounding POSIX capabilities, while AppArmor does not and relies on the MAC layer to prevent privileged operations on files outside the actor's enforced realm of control.\nQ11: How does SELinux differ from traditional DAC controls in terms of access control? A11: SELinux extends traditional DAC controls up to the mandatory access control (MAC) level, enabling access to a more expressive set of policy choices.\nQ12: How does SELinux support multilevel security compared to AppArmor? A12: SELinux supports the concept of multilevel security, while AppArmor does not, allowing for hard BLP or Biba enforcement for data confidentiality.\nQ13: How does SELinux differ from AppArmor in terms of policy configuration? A13: SELinux (by default in most implementations) uses a combination of flat files and extended attributes for policy configuration, while AppArmor configuration is done using solely regular flat files.\nQ14: What is the role of the policy files in SELinux? A14: The policy files in SELinux define the security policies and controls over various components of the system such as process initialization, inheritance, program execution, file systems, directories, files, open file descriptors, sockets, messages, network interfaces, and capabilities.\nQ15: How does SELinux enhance the security of a Linux system compared to an unmodified system? A15: SELinux enhances the security of a Linux system compared to an unmodified system by reducing the dependence on the correctness of the kernel, privileged applications, and their configurations, and instead relying primarily on the correctness of the kernel and its security-policy configuration. This allows for the confinement of damage that can be caused by malicious or flawed applications and separates enforcement of security decisions from the security policy."

    "instruction": "context: Privacy engineering\n\n==Introduction==\nPrivacy engineering is an emerging field of engineering which aims to provide methodologies, tools, and techniques to ensure systems provide acceptable levels of privacy.\nIn the US, an acceptable level of privacy is defined in terms of compliance to the functional and non-functional requirements set out through a privacy policy, which is a contractual artifact displaying the data controlling entities compliance to legislation such as Fair Information Practices, health record security regulation and other privacy laws. In the EU, however, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets the requirements that need to be fulfilled. In the rest of the world, the requirements change depending on local implementations of privacy and data protection laws.\n\n== Definition and scope ==\nThe definition of privacy engineering given by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is:\n Focuses on providing guidance that can be used to decrease privacy risks, and enable organizations to make purposeful decisions about resource allocation and effective implementation of controls in information systems.\nWhile privacy has been developing as a legal domain, privacy engineering has only really come to the fore in recent years as the necessity of implementing said privacy laws in information systems has become a definite requirement to the deployment of such information systems. For example, IPEN outlines their position in this respect as:\n One reason for the lack of attention to privacy issues in development is the lack of appropriate tools and best practices. Developers have to deliver quickly in order to minimize time to market and effort, and often will re-use existing components, despite their privacy flaws. There are, unfortunately, few building blocks for privacy-friendly applications and services, and security can often be weak as well.\nPrivacy engineering involves aspects such as process management, security, ontology and software engineering. The actual application of these derives from necessary legal compliances, privacy policies and 'manifestos' such as Privacy-by-Design.\n\nTowards the more implementation levels, privacy engineering employs privacy enhancing technologies to enable anonymisation and de-identification of data. Privacy engineering requires suitable security engineering practices to be deployed, and some privacy aspects can be implemented using security techniques. A privacy impact assessment is another tool within this context and its use does not imply that privacy engineering is being practiced.\nOne area of concern is the proper definition and application of terms such as personal data, personally identifiable information, anonymisation and pseudo-anonymisation which lack sufficient and detailed enough meanings when applied to software, information systems and data sets.\nAnother facet of information system privacy has been the ethical use of such systems with particular concern on surveillance, big data collection, artificial intelligence etc. Some members of the privacy and privacy engineering community advocate for the idea of ethics engineering or reject the possibility of engineering privacy into systems intended for surveillance.\nSoftware engineers often encounter problems when interpreting legal norms into current technology. Legal requirements are by nature neutral to technology, and will in case of legal conflict be interpreted by a court in the context of the current status of both technology and privacy practice.\n\n== Core practices ==\nAs this particular field is still in its infancy and somewhat dominated by the legal aspects, the following list just outlines the primary areas on which privacy engineering is based:\n\nData flow modelling\nDevelopment of suitable terminologies/ontologies for expressing types, usages, purposes etc. of information\nPrivacy Impact Assessment (PIA)\nPrivacy management and processes\nRequirements engineering\nRisk assessment\nSemanticsDespite the lack of a cohesive development of the above areas, courses already exist for the training of privacy engineering. The International Workshop on Privacy Engineering co-located with IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy  provides a venue to address \"the gap between research and practice in systematizing and evaluating approaches to capture and address privacy issues while engineering information systems\".A number of approaches to privacy engineering exist. The LINDDUN methodology takes a risk-centric approach to privacy engineering where personal data flows at risk are identified and then secured with privacy controls. Guidance for interpretation of the GDPR has been provided in the GDPR recitals, which have been coded into a decision tool that maps GDPR into software engineering forces with the goal to identify suitable privacy design patterns. One further approach uses eight privacy design strategies - four technical and four administrative strategies - to protect data and to implement data subject rights.\n\n== Aspects of information ==\nPrivacy engineering is particularly concerned with the processing of information over the following aspects or ontologies and their relations to their implementation in software:\n\nData Processing Ontologies\nInformation Type Ontologies (as opposed to PII or machine types)\nNotions of controller and processor\nThe notions of authority and identity (ostensibly of the source(s) of data)\nProvenance of information, including the notion of data subject\nPurpose of information, viz: primary vs secondary collection\nSemantics of information and data sets (see also noise and anonymisation)\nUsage of informationFurther to this how the above then affect the security classification, risk classification and thus the levels of protection and flow within a system can then the metricised or calculated.\n\n== Definitions of privacy ==\nPrivacy is an area dominated by legal aspects but requires implementation using, ostensibly, engineering techniques, disciplines and skills. Privacy Engineering as an overall discipline takes its basis from considering privacy not just as a legal aspect or engineering aspect and their unification but also utilizing the following areas:\nPrivacy as a philosophical aspect\nPrivacy as an economic aspect, particularly game theory\nPrivacy as a sociological aspect\n\n== Legal basis ==\nThe impetus for technological progress in privacy engineering stems from general privacy laws and various particular legal acts:\n\nChildren's Online Privacy Protection Act\nDriver's Privacy Protection Act\nIntimate Privacy Protection Act\nOnline Privacy Protection Act\nPrivacy Act of 1974\nPrivacy Protection Act of 1980\nTelephone Records and Privacy Protection Act of 2006\nVideo Privacy Protection Act\n\n== Notes and references ==\nNow I will ask you some questions, and you will answer.\n\n",

      "context": "Privacy engineering\n\n==Introduction==\nPrivacy engineering is an emerging field of engineering which aims to provide methodologies, tools, and techniques to ensure systems provide acceptable levels of privacy.\nIn the US, an acceptable level of privacy is defined in terms of compliance to the functional and non-functional requirements set out through a privacy policy, which is a contractual artifact displaying the data controlling entities compliance to legislation such as Fair Information Practices, health record security regulation and other privacy laws. In the EU, however, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets the requirements that need to be fulfilled. In the rest of the world, the requirements change depending on local implementations of privacy and data protection laws.\n\n== Definition and scope ==\nThe definition of privacy engineering given by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is:\n Focuses on providing guidance that can be used to decrease privacy risks, and enable organizations to make purposeful decisions about resource allocation and effective implementation of controls in information systems.\nWhile privacy has been developing as a legal domain, privacy engineering has only really come to the fore in recent years as the necessity of implementing said privacy laws in information systems has become a definite requirement to the deployment of such information systems. For example, IPEN outlines their position in this respect as:\n One reason for the lack of attention to privacy issues in development is the lack of appropriate tools and best practices. Developers have to deliver quickly in order to minimize time to market and effort, and often will re-use existing components, despite their privacy flaws. There are, unfortunately, few building blocks for privacy-friendly applications and services, and security can often be weak as well.\nPrivacy engineering involves aspects such as process management, security, ontology and software engineering. The actual application of these derives from necessary legal compliances, privacy policies and 'manifestos' such as Privacy-by-Design.\n\nTowards the more implementation levels, privacy engineering employs privacy enhancing technologies to enable anonymisation and de-identification of data. Privacy engineering requires suitable security engineering practices to be deployed, and some privacy aspects can be implemented using security techniques. A privacy impact assessment is another tool within this context and its use does not imply that privacy engineering is being practiced.\nOne area of concern is the proper definition and application of terms such as personal data, personally identifiable information, anonymisation and pseudo-anonymisation which lack sufficient and detailed enough meanings when applied to software, information systems and data sets.\nAnother facet of information system privacy has been the ethical use of such systems with particular concern on surveillance, big data collection, artificial intelligence etc. Some members of the privacy and privacy engineering community advocate for the idea of ethics engineering or reject the possibility of engineering privacy into systems intended for surveillance.\nSoftware engineers often encounter problems when interpreting legal norms into current technology. Legal requirements are by nature neutral to technology, and will in case of legal conflict be interpreted by a court in the context of the current status of both technology and privacy practice.\n\n== Core practices ==\nAs this particular field is still in its infancy and somewhat dominated by the legal aspects, the following list just outlines the primary areas on which privacy engineering is based:\n\nData flow modelling\nDevelopment of suitable terminologies/ontologies for expressing types, usages, purposes etc. of information\nPrivacy Impact Assessment (PIA)\nPrivacy management and processes\nRequirements engineering\nRisk assessment\nSemanticsDespite the lack of a cohesive development of the above areas, courses already exist for the training of privacy engineering. The International Workshop on Privacy Engineering co-located with IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy  provides a venue to address \"the gap between research and practice in systematizing and evaluating approaches to capture and address privacy issues while engineering information systems\".A number of approaches to privacy engineering exist. The LINDDUN methodology takes a risk-centric approach to privacy engineering where personal data flows at risk are identified and then secured with privacy controls. Guidance for interpretation of the GDPR has been provided in the GDPR recitals, which have been coded into a decision tool that maps GDPR into software engineering forces with the goal to identify suitable privacy design patterns. One further approach uses eight privacy design strategies - four technical and four administrative strategies - to protect data and to implement data subject rights.\n\n== Aspects of information ==\nPrivacy engineering is particularly concerned with the processing of information over the following aspects or ontologies and their relations to their implementation in software:\n\nData Processing Ontologies\nInformation Type Ontologies (as opposed to PII or machine types)\nNotions of controller and processor\nThe notions of authority and identity (ostensibly of the source(s) of data)\nProvenance of information, including the notion of data subject\nPurpose of information, viz: primary vs secondary collection\nSemantics of information and data sets (see also noise and anonymisation)\nUsage of informationFurther to this how the above then affect the security classification, risk classification and thus the levels of protection and flow within a system can then the metricised or calculated.\n\n== Definitions of privacy ==\nPrivacy is an area dominated by legal aspects but requires implementation using, ostensibly, engineering techniques, disciplines and skills. Privacy Engineering as an overall discipline takes its basis from considering privacy not just as a legal aspect or engineering aspect and their unification but also utilizing the following areas:\nPrivacy as a philosophical aspect\nPrivacy as an economic aspect, particularly game theory\nPrivacy as a sociological aspect\n\n== Legal basis ==\nThe impetus for technological progress in privacy engineering stems from general privacy laws and various particular legal acts:\n\nChildren's Online Privacy Protection Act\nDriver's Privacy Protection Act\nIntimate Privacy Protection Act\nOnline Privacy Protection Act\nPrivacy Act of 1974\nPrivacy Protection Act of 1980\nTelephone Records and Privacy Protection Act of 2006\nVideo Privacy Protection Act\n\n== Notes and references ==",

    "instruction": "context: Key authentication\n\n==Introduction==\nKey/Config-authentication is used to solve the problem of authenticating the keys of the person (say \"person B\") to some other person (\"person A\") is talking to or trying to talk to. In other words, it is the process of assuring that the key of \"person A\" held by \"person B\" does in fact belong to \"person A\" and vice versa.\nThis is usually done after the keys have been shared among the two sides over some secure channel. However, some algorithms share the keys at the time of authentication. \nThe simplest solution for this kind of problem is for the two concerned users to communicate and exchange keys. However, for systems in which there are a large number of users or in which the users do not personally know each other (e.g., Internet shopping), this is not practical. There are various algorithms for both symmetric keys and asymmetric public key cryptography to solve this problem.\n\n\n\n== Authentication using Shared Keys ==\nFor key authentication using the traditional symmetric key cryptography, this is the problem of assuring that there is no man-in-the-middle attacker who is trying to read or spoof the communication. There are various algorithms used now-a-days to prevent such attacks. The most common among the algorithms are Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange, authentication using Key distribution center, kerberos and Needham\u2013Schroeder protocol. Other methods that can be used include Password-authenticated key agreement protocols etc.\n\n== Authentication using Public Key Cryptography ==\nCrypto systems using asymmetric key algorithms do not evade the problem either. That a public key can be known by all without compromising the security of an encryption algorithm (for some such algorithms, though not for all) is certainly useful, but does not prevent some kinds of attacks. For example, a spoofing attack in which public key A is claimed publicly to be that of user Alice, but is in fact a public key belonging to man-in-the-middle attacker Mallet, is easily possible. No public key is inherently bound to any particular user, and any user relying on a defective binding (including Alice herself when she sends herself protected messages) will have trouble.\nThe most common solution to this problem is the use of public key certificates and certificate authorities (CAs) for them in a public-key infrastructure (PKI) system. The certificate authority (CA) acts as a 'trusted third party' for the communicating users and, using cryptographic binding methods (e.g., digital signatures) represents to both parties involved that the public keys each holds which allegedly belong to the other, actually do so. A digital notary service, if you will. Such CAs can be private organizations providing such assurances, or government agencies, or some combination of the two. However, in a significant sense, this merely moves the key authentication problem back one level for any CA may make a good faith certification of some key but, through error or malice, be mistaken. Any reliance on a defective key certificate 'authenticating' a public key will cause problems.

    "output": "Question: How does key/config-authentication solve the problem of verifying the keys of one person to another? Answer: Key/config-authentication is a process that ensures the key of one person (Person A) held by another person (Person B) is indeed the correct key for Person A. This is typically done after the keys have been shared between the two parties through a secure channel. However, some algorithms share the keys at the time of authentication. The simplest solution for this problem is for the two concerned users to communicate and exchange keys, but this is not practical for systems with a large number of users or when the users do not personally know each other. Question: What is the problem with using shared keys in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks? Answer: The problem is that even though shared keys are used, a man-in-the-middle attacker can still attempt to read or spoof the communication. This is a common issue for symmetric key cryptography. Question: What is the most common algorithm used to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks with shared keys? Answer: The most common algorithms used to prevent such attacks include Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange, authentication using Key distribution center, kerberos, Needham\u2013Schroeder protocol, and password-authenticated key agreement protocols. Question: How does the use of public key cryptography address the issue of man-in-the-middle attacks? Answer: Public key cryptography allows for a public key to be known by all without compromising security, but it does not completely prevent all types of attacks. For example, a spoofing attack where a public key is claimed to belong to a user but in fact belongs to a malicious attacker is still possible. Question: How do public key certificates and certificate authorities (CAs) address the problem of spoofing in public key cryptography? Answer: Public key certificates and CAs in a public-key infrastructure (PKI) system can act as a trusted third party for communicating users and cryptographically bind public keys to their respective users. This helps to ensure that a user is using the correct public key. Question: Who can certificate authorities (CAs) be in a PKI system? Answer: CAs can be private organizations, government agencies, or a combination of the two. Question: What is the main issue with relying on certificate authorities (CAs) in a PKI system? Answer: The main issue is that any reliance on a defective key certificate that is supposed to authenticate a public key can cause problems. For example, a CA may make a good faith certification of a key, but it could be mistaken due to error or malice. Question: Why do many people find PKI designs unacceptably insecure? Answer: Many people find PKI designs unacceptably insecure because the key authentication problem is merely moved back one level. A CA may make a good faith certification of a key, but it could be mistaken due to error or malice. Question: What is being actively researched in the field of key authentication methods? Answer: Key authentication methods are being actively researched in order to address the issues with PKI designs. Question: What is the main goal of key/config-authentication? Answer: The main goal of key/config-authentication is to assure that the key of one person held by another person does in fact belong to the intended person. Question: How does the use of public key cryptography address the key authentication problem? Answer: The use of public key cryptography addresses the key authentication problem by allowing for a public key to be known by all without compromising security. However, it does not prevent all types of attacks. Question: How do certificate authorities (CAs) in a PKI system address the key authentication problem? Answer: Certificate authorities (CAs) in a PKI system act as a trusted third party and cryptographically bind public keys to their respective users.

Coach registration begins in the late spring to allow preparation over the summer. The qualification rounds of the competition are completed online at the teams\u2019 home locations from September to early January.\n\n== Competition guidelines ==\nThe competition is a tournament structure with three divisions:\n\nOpen High School Division:  Open to all public, private, parochial, magnet, charter, home schools, and special groups such as CampFire, Boys & Girls Club, Boy Scouts, Church Youth Groups, Girl Scouts, etc.\nAll-Service Division: Open to all JROTC Services, Civil Air Patrol squadrons, US Naval Sea Cadet Corps units. The registration fee is waived for teams competing in the All-Service Division\nMiddle School Division: Open to all middle schools and junior high schools which follow the same common organizations as mentioned above in the Open High School Division.The early rounds of the competition are done online during weekends via the Internet from teams\u2019 schools or other sponsoring organizations\u2019 facilities. Prior to the round, teams download virtual image representations of operating systems with known flaws, or cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each team is tasked to find the flaws while keeping specified computer functions (services such as email) working. Team progress is recorded by a central CyberPatriot scoring system.\nThe scores from Qualification Rounds 1 and 2 are totaled to determine which tier a team advances to:\n\nPlatinum: Top 30% of teams. Rounds include State (guaranteed), Semifinals, and National Finals\nGold: Middle 40% of teams. Rounds include State (guaranteed) and Semifinals.\nSilver: Bottom 30% of teams. Rounds include State (guaranteed) and Semifinals.In CyberPatriot XIII, there are only 3 rounds total and round 1 will be held later than in CyberPatriot XII due to COVID-19 in order to give coaches more time to recruit (according to AFA email announcements), Round 3 determining the National Finalists teams.\nTeams in the Platinum tier are the only teams eligible to qualify for National Finals.\nSee additional rules below:\n\nThe Qualification Competition begins as soon as this image is opened, and ends 6 consecutive hours later, after which the score will be logged. Attempting to continue after the time limit has reached will incur penalties. It is the coach's responsibility to ensure their team does not exceed the limit.\nOnly one instance of the image can be open at any given time. Opening multiple instance of a virtual image will result in a penalty.\nNo person may compete on a team with which they are not registered, and may only be registered with one team per competition.\nDuring the competition, no outside assistance may be given to or received from anyone.\nNo competitor may offer assistance to another after their round ends and the others begins.\nNo outside communication is allowed during the competition.

For CyberPatriot IV-VII, National Finals Competitions were held at the Gaylord National Hotel and Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland in March. From the CyberPatriot VIII season through the CyberPatriot XI season, the National Finals Competitions moved to the Hyatt Regency Baltimore Inner Harbor in Baltimore, Maryland, and were held in April of each year. Beginning in the CyberPatriot XII season, the National Finals Competition is planned to be held at the Bethesda North Marriott Hotel & Conference Center in Bethesda, Maryland outside of Washington, D.C., in March. However, the CyberPatriot XII In-Person National Finals Competition, which was the first planned year at the Bethesda North Marriott, was canceled due to the COVID-19 outbreak and a virtual, in-home competition was held online in May, about two months after the originally scheduled in-person competition event. The CP-XII Virtual National Finals was held on May 2, 2020, and marked the first-ever online virtual CyberPatriot National Finals Competition. Due to the widespread outbreak of COVID-19, the CyberPatriot XIII season has modifications to accommodate the delay in team administration as well as provisions for additional procedures for competing at home. Because the spread of COVID-19 in the US continued, some schools had restrictions on in-person activities, which was accounted for by arrangements for optionally staying home to compete as well as an organization type for registration.\nThe Challenges that teams may face include:\n\nNetwork Security Master Challenge, in which teams fix vulnerabilities in \"images\" of Operating Systems that have been purposely tampered with while protecting the \"images\" from \"Red Team\" which is a group of \"hackers\" that will exploit vulnerabilities on the competitor's machines.\nLeidos Digital Forensics Challenge, in which teams solve mysteries with computer programs.\nDigital Crime Scene Challenge, in which teams search a live \"crime scene\" for digital evidence.\nCisco Networking Challenge, in which teams show their knowledge about Wiring, Cisco's Packet Tracer, and in a Cisco quiz.Winning teams in the Open and All Service Division earn education grants to the school of their choice. First place teams earn $2,000 per competitor, second place teams earn $1,500 per competitor, and third place earns $1,000 per competitor. The scholarship money is provided by the Northrop Grumman Foundation. In CyberPatriot VII, for first, second, and third place, an additional $2,000, $1,500, and $1,000 were awarded to the teams, respectively, by the National Security Agency.\n\n== CyberPatriot Winners ==\n\n== External Links From 2013 ==\n\"CyberPatriot: The National High School Cyber Defense Competition\".

    "instruction": "2021 Epik data breach\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Epik data breach occurred in 2021 and targeted the American domain registrar and web hosting company Epik. The breach exposed a wide range of information including personal information of customers, domain history and purchase records, credit card information, internal company emails, and records from the company's WHOIS privacy service.  More than 15 million unique email addresses were exposed, belonging to customers and to non-customers whose information had been scraped. The attackers responsible for the breach identified themselves as members of the hacktivist collective Anonymous. The attackers released an initial 180 gigabyte dataset on September 13, 2021, though the data appeared to have been exfiltrated in late February of the same year. A second release, this time containing bootable disk images, was made on September 29. A third release on October 4 reportedly contained more bootable disk images and documents belonging to the Texas Republican Party, a customer of Epik's.Epik is known for providing services to websites that host far-right, neo-Nazi, and other extremist content. Past and present Epik customers include Gab, Parler, 8chan, the Oath Keepers, and the Proud Boys. The hack was described as \"a Rosetta Stone to the far-right\" because it has allowed researchers and journalists to discover links between far-right websites, groups, and individuals. Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets) co-founder Emma Best said researchers had been describing the breach as \"the Panama Papers of hate groups\".Epik was subsequently criticized for lax data security practices, in particular failing to properly encrypt sensitive customer data.\n\n== Background ==\nAnonymous is a decentralized international hacktivist collective that is widely known for its various cyber attacks against several governments and governmental institutions, corporations, and the Church of Scientology. Primarily active in the late 2000s and early 2010s, Anonymous' media profile diminished by 2018. The group re-emerged in 2020 to support the George Floyd protests and other causes.In September 2021, Anonymous asked people to support \"Operation Jane\", an effort by the group to oppose the Texas Heartbeat Act, a six-week abortion ban that went into effect on September 1. On September 4, Epik had begun providing services to a \"whistleblower\" website run by the anti-abortion Texas Right to Life organization, which allowed people to anonymously report suspected violators of the bill. The website, which moved to Epik after being denied services by GoDaddy, went offline after Epik told the group they had violated their terms of service by collecting private information about third parties. On September 11, Anonymous hacked the website of the Republican Party of Texas, which is hosted by Epik, to replace it with text about Operation Jane.\n\n== Data breach ==\n\nHackers identifying themselves as a part of Anonymous announced on September 13, 2021 that they had gained access to large quantities of Epik data, including domain purchase and transfer details, account credentials and logins, payment history, employee emails, and unidentified private keys. The hackers claimed they had obtained \"a decade's worth of data\", including all customer data and records for all domains ever hosted or registered through the company, and which included poorly encrypted passwords and other sensitive data stored in plaintext. The Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets) organization announced later that day that they were working to curate the leaked data for public download, and said that it consisted of \"180 gigabytes of user, registration, forwarding and other information\".Journalists and security researchers subsequently confirmed the veracity of the hack and the types of information that had been exposed. The data included in the leak appeared to have been exfiltrated in late February 2021. The leak was later confirmed to include approximately 15 million unique email addresses, which belonged both to customers and non-customers whose data had been scraped from WHOIS records. It also included 843,000 transactions from a period of over ten years, and almost one million invoices. An engineer performing an initial impact assessment for an Epik customer said that Epik's \"entire primary database\", which contained account usernames, passwords, SSH keys, and credit card numbers stored in plaintext, had also been compromised. Internal memos describing subpoenas and preservation requests were also found in the leaked data. Many of the data preservation requests appeared to be related to investigations following the January Capitol attack.A security researcher speaking to TechCrunch said he had identified a security vulnerability with Epik in January, which he had reported to Rob Monster, Epik CEO, but which had not been acknowledged. The vulnerability would have allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on Epik servers, and the researcher said he suspected the same vulnerability had been exploited by the Anonymous attackers. Monster told TechCrunch he had seen the report, but mistook it for spam.On September 29, Anonymous released another 300 gigabytes of data including bootable disk images. According to a cybersecurity expert speaking to The Daily Dot, \"Files are one thing, but a virtual machine disk image allows you to boot up the company's entire server on your own. We usually see breaches with database dumps, documents, configuration files, etc. In this case, we are talking about the entire server image, with all the programs and files required to host the application it is serving.\" The second leak included API keys and plaintext login credentials for Epik's systems, as well as for services including Coinbase, PayPal, and the company's Twitter account.A third release on October 4 reportedly contained more bootable disk images, as well as documents belonging to the Texas Republican Party.\n\n== Company response ==\nOn September 13, the day the hacked data was released, Epik said in statements to news outlets that they were \"not aware of any breach\". When the company did not acknowledge the breach, the attackers vandalized Epik's support website. On September 15, the company sent an email to customers notifying them of \"an alleged security incident\". Monster acknowledged the hack in a September 16 public video conference, which The Daily Dot described as \"chaotic and bizarre\" and which Le Monde characterized as \"possibly one of the strangest responses to a computer security incident in history\". The company publicly confirmed the breach on September 17, and began emailing customers to inform them on September 19. Data breach monitoring service Have I Been Pwned? also began sending emails to all addresses that had been exposed on September 19.Epik submitted a data-breach notice in the state of Maine, in which they reported that 110,000 people had been affected by the breach, and that financial account and credit card data had been exposed. In a statement to The Washington Post, an Epik spokesperson said that up to 38,000 credit card numbers had been leaked.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe hack was described as \"a Rosetta Stone to the far-right\", allowing researchers and journalists to connect links between various far-right websites, groups, and individuals who were using Epik's services. DDoSecrets co-founder Emma Best said researchers had been describing the breach as \"the Panama Papers of hate groups\", and said that researchers would be \"in for the long haul\" with the amount of data that had been exposed. The Columbia Journalism Review similarly compared the data breach to the Panama Papers leak, stating \"Like the Panama Papers, getting information out of the huge database and making sense of it is time-consuming, which may explain why coverage of the Epik hack lagged...\" Data from the hack was used to show that Ali Alexander, a far-right activist and key figure in the \"Stop the Steal\" conspiracy theory campaign, had worked to hide his connections to more than 100 websites after the 2021 United States Capitol attack.\n\n\n*** Reactions ***\nExtremism researcher and computer scientist Megan Squire said of the hack, \"It's massive. It may be the biggest domain-style leak I've seen and, as an extremism researcher, it's certainly the most interesting.\" Internet anthropologist Gabriella Coleman predicted the hack would force far-right groups to find security providers outside of the United States, and said that the hack had \"confirmed a lot of the details of the far-right ecosystem\". Cybersecurity analyst and online extremism researcher Emily Crose said that the breach would likely intensify existing paranoia among far-right groups, who already felt like they were being surveilled after the Capitol attack.An engineer performing an initial impact assessment for an Epik client told The Daily Dot that \"[Epik] are fully compromised end-to-end ... Maybe the worst I've ever seen in my 20-year career\". Following the hack, The Washington Post reported that \"Epik's security protocols have been the target of ridicule among researchers, who've marveled at the site's apparent failure to take basic security precautions\". Epik had been storing passwords using unsalted MD5, making them easy to crack. Other sensitive data, including credit card information, was being stored in plaintext.David Vladeck, a Georgetown law professor and the former head of the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) consumer protection bureau, said, \"Given Epik's boasts about security, and the scope of its web hosting, I would think it would be an FTC target, especially if the company was warned but failed to take protective action\".\n\n\n*** Other breaches ***\nTwo weeks after the initial release of data, hackers released data taken from the American far-right Oath Keepers militia. The hackers responsible for the Oath Keepers leak did not claim any connection to Anonymous or draw any connection to the Epik breach, though some journalists have speculated that the leak may have been related or made possible by information from the Epik data. The Oath Keepers data consists of about 3.8 gigabytes of email archives, chat logs, and a membership list. The data is also being disseminated by DDoSecrets, though the group restricted the list of members and files containing donor and finance information to journalists. The Oath Keepers had been a customer of Epik's since January 2021, when their website was taken offline after their hosting provider terminated service in the wake of the Capitol attack.\n\nUsing the text above, answer my questions:\n\n",

Data in use, or memory, can contain sensitive data including digital certificates, encryption keys, intellectual property (software algorithms, design data), and personally identifiable information.  Compromising data in use enables access to encrypted data at rest and data in motion.  For example, someone with access to random access memory can parse that memory to locate the encryption key for data at rest.

In that work, an ARM Cortex-A8 processor is used as the substrate on which a full memory encryption solution is built.  Process segments (for example, stack, code or heap) can be encrypted individually or in composition.  This work marks the first full memory encryption implementation on a mobile general-purpose commodity processor.  The system provides both confidentiality and integrity protections of code and data which are encrypted everywhere outside the CPU boundary.\nFor x86 systems, AMD has a Secure Memory Encryption (SME) feature introduced in 2017 with Epyc.

    "output": "Q1: How does the concept of data in use differ from data at rest and data in transit? A1: Data in use refers to active data that is stored in a non-persistent digital state, typically in computer random-access memory (RAM), CPU caches, or CPU registers. In contrast, data at rest refers to data that is not currently in use and is stored in a persistent state, such as on a hard drive or solid-state drive. Data in transit refers to data that is being transferred from one location to another, such as over a network. Q2: What are some concerns related to data in use? A2: Data in use can contain sensitive information, such as digital certificates, encryption keys, intellectual property, and personally identifiable information. If compromised, it can provide access to encrypted data at rest and data in motion. Threats to data in use can come in the form of cold boot attacks, malicious hardware devices, rootkits, and bootkits. Q3: How does full memory encryption protect data in use? A3: Full memory encryption encrypts all data stored in memory, preventing visibility in the event of unauthorized access or theft. This approach is becoming increasingly recognized as an optimal method for protecting data in use. Q4: What is CPU-based key storage and how does it protect against cold boot attacks? A4: CPU-based key storage involves modifying the operating system to use CPU registers to store encryption keys, avoiding the need to hold them in RAM. This approach protects against cold boot attacks, as encryption keys are held inside the CPU rather than in RAM, where they might be compromised. Q5: What are enclaves and how do they secure data in use? A5: Enclaves are a concept introduced by Intel Corporation as part of its Software Guard Extensions. They enable data to be secured with encryption in RAM, so that it is encrypted while in RAM but available as clear text inside the CPU and CPU cache. Q6: What cryptographic tools allow for the private computation of data on untrusted systems? A6: Several cryptographic tools, including secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, and format-preserving encryption, allow for the private computation of data on untrusted systems. These tools enable data in use to be operated upon while encrypted and never exposed to the system doing the processing. Q7: How does blinding enable an agent to provide a service to a client in an encoded form without knowing the real input or output? A7: Blinding is a cryptography technique that allows an agent to provide a service to a client in an encoded form without knowing the real input or output. This is achieved by encoding the input and output, so that the agent can perform the necessary operations without having access to the actual values. Q8: What are some examples of privacy-enhancing technologies? A8: Some examples of privacy-enhancing technologies include secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, format-preserving encryption, and blinding. Q9: Who proposed the concept of data in use in 1996? A9: Daniel Allen, a data scientist from Scranton, PA, proposed the concept of data in use in 1996. Q10: In what ways can data in use be encrypted? A10: Data in use can be encrypted using full memory encryption, where all data stored in memory is encrypted, or using CPU-based key storage, where encryption keys are stored in CPU registers rather than RAM. Additionally, enclaves can be used to secure data in use with encryption in RAM. Q11: What are some real-world examples of full memory encryption? A11: Real-world examples of full memory encryption include Microsoft Xbox systems, which provide memory encryption, and PrivateCore's vCage, a commercial software product that provides attestation along with full memory encryption for x86 servers. Q12: How do CPU-based key storage techniques protect against attacks that might compromise encryption keys in memory? A12: CPU-based key storage techniques protect against attacks that might compromise encryption keys in memory by holding encryption keys inside the CPU rather than in RAM. Q13: What is the purpose of Intel's Software Guard Extensions? A13: Intel's Software Guard Extensions introduce the concept of enclaves, which enable data to be secured with encryption in RAM so that it is encrypted while in RAM but available as clear text inside the CPU and CPU cache. Q14: What are some cryptographic tools that allow for the private computation of data on untrusted systems? A14: Some cryptographic tools that allow for the private computation of data on untrusted systems include secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, and format-preserving encryption. Q15: What is blinding and how does it enhance privacy? A15: Blinding is a cryptography technique that enables an agent to provide a service to a client in an encoded form without knowing the real input or output. This enhances privacy by ensuring that the agent cannot access the actual values of the input and output.",

Q5: What are enclaves and how do they secure data in use? A5: Enclaves are a concept introduced by Intel Corporation as part of its Software Guard Extensions. They enable data to be secured with encryption in RAM, so that it is encrypted while in RAM but available as clear text inside the CPU and CPU cache. Q6: What cryptographic tools allow for the private computation of data on untrusted systems? A6: Several cryptographic tools, including secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, and format-preserving encryption, allow for the private computation of data on untrusted systems. These tools enable data in use to be operated upon while encrypted and never exposed to the system doing the processing. Q7: How does blinding enable an agent to provide a service to a client in an encoded form without knowing the real input or output? A7: Blinding is a cryptography technique that allows an agent to provide a service to a client in an encoded form without knowing the real input or output. This is achieved by encoding the input and output, so that the agent can perform the necessary operations without having access to the actual values. Q8: What are some examples of privacy-enhancing technologies? A8: Some examples of privacy-enhancing technologies include secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, format-preserving encryption, and blinding. Q9: Who proposed the concept of data in use in 1996? A9: Daniel Allen, a data scientist from Scranton, PA, proposed the concept of data in use in 1996. Q10: In what ways can data in use be encrypted? A10: Data in use can be encrypted using full memory encryption, where all data stored in memory is encrypted, or using CPU-based key storage, where encryption keys are stored in CPU registers rather than RAM. Additionally, enclaves can be used to secure data in use with encryption in RAM. Q11: What are some real-world examples of full memory encryption? A11: Real-world examples of full memory encryption include Microsoft Xbox systems, which provide memory encryption, and PrivateCore's vCage, a commercial software product that provides attestation along with full memory encryption for x86 servers. Q12: How do CPU-based key storage techniques protect against attacks that might compromise encryption keys in memory? A12: CPU-based key storage techniques protect against attacks that might compromise encryption keys in memory by holding encryption keys inside the CPU rather than in RAM. Q13: What is the purpose of Intel's Software Guard Extensions? A13: Intel's Software Guard Extensions introduce the concept of enclaves, which enable data to be secured with encryption in RAM so that it is encrypted while in RAM but available as clear text inside the CPU and CPU cache. Q14: What are some cryptographic tools that allow for the private computation of data on untrusted systems? A14: Some cryptographic tools that allow for the private computation of data on untrusted systems include secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, and format-preserving encryption. Q15: What is blinding and how does it enhance privacy? A15: Blinding is a cryptography technique that enables an agent to provide a service to a client in an encoded form without knowing the real input or output. This enhances privacy by ensuring that the agent cannot access the actual values of the input and output."

    "instruction": "Secure transmission\n\n==Introduction==\nIn computer science, secure transmission refers to the transfer of data such as confidential or proprietary information over a secure channel. Many secure transmission methods require a type of encryption. The most common email encryption is called PKI. In order to open the encrypted file, an exchange of key is done.\nMany infrastructures such as banks rely on secure transmission protocols to prevent a catastrophic breach of security. Secure transmissions are put in place to prevent attacks such as ARP spoofing and general data loss. Software and hardware implementations which attempt to detect and prevent the unauthorized transmission of information from the computer systems to an organization on the outside may be referred to as Information Leak Detection and Prevention (ILDP), Information Leak Prevention (ILP), Content Monitoring and Filtering (CMF) or Extrusion Prevention systems and are used in connection with other methods to ensure secure transmission of data.\n\n\n\n== Secure transmission over wireless infrastructure ==\n\nWEP is a deprecated algorithm to secure IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. Wireless networks broadcast messages using radio, so are more susceptible to eavesdropping than wired networks. When introduced in 1999, WEP was intended to provide confidentiality comparable to that of a traditional wired network. A later system, called Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) has since been developed to provide stronger security.\n\n== Web-based secure transmission ==\n\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols that provide secure communications on the Internet for such things as web browsing, e-mail, Internet faxing, instant messaging and other data transfers. There are slight differences between SSL and TLS, but they are substantially the same.\n\nUsing the text above, answer my questions:\n\n",

Peerio was available as an application for iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux. Peerio (Legacy) was originally released on 14 January 2015, and was replaced by Peerio 2 on 15 June 2017. The app is discontinued.Messages and user files stored on the Peerio cloud were protected by end-to-end encryption, meaning the data was encrypted in a way that could not be read by third parties, such as Peerio itself or its service providers. Security was provided by a single permanent key-password, which in Peerio was called an \"Account Key\".The company, Peerio Technologies Inc., was founded in 2014 by Vincent Drouin. The intent behind Peerio was to provide a security program that is easier to use than the PGP standard.Peerio was acquired by WorkJam, a digital workplace solutions provide, on January 13, 2019.\n\n== Features ==\nPeerio allowed users to share encrypted messages and files in direct messages or groups that Peerio called \"rooms\".Peerio \"rooms\" were offered as a team-oriented group chat, allowing administrative functionality to add and remove other users from the group chat.Peerio allowed users to store encrypted files online, offering limited cloud storage for free with optional paid upgrades.Peerio messages and files persist between logins and hardware, differing from ephemeral encrypted messaging apps which do not retain message or file history between logins or different devices.\nPeerio supported application based multi-factor authentication.Peerio allowed users to share animated GIFs.\n\n== Security ==\n\n\n*** End-to-End Encryption ***\nPeerio utilized end-to-end encryption and it was applied by default to all message and file data. End-to-end encryption is intended to encrypt data in a way that only the sender and intended recipients are able to decrypt, and thus read, the data.\nTaken from Peerio's privacy policy:\n\"Peerio utilizes the NaCl (pronounced \"salt\") cryptographic framework, which itself uses the following cryptographic primitives:\n\nX25519 for public key agreement over elliptic curves.\ned25519 for public key signatures.\nXSalsa20 for encryption and confidentiality.\nPoly1305 for ensuring the integrity of encrypted data.Additionally, Peerio uses scrypt for memory-hard key derivation and BLAKE2s is used for various hashing operations.\nFor in-transit encryption, Peerio Services used Transport Layer Security (TLS) with best-practice cipher suite configuration, including support for perfect forward secrecy (PFS). You can view a detailed and up-to-date independent review of Peerio's TLS configuration on SSL Labs.\"\n\n\n*** Code Audits ***\nPrior to Peerio's initial release, the software was audited by the German security firm Cure53, which found only non-security related bugs, all of which were fixed prior to the applications release.According to Peerio's website, the application was also audited in March 2017 by Cure53.\n\n\n*** Open Source ***\nPeerio was partly open source and published code publicly on GitHub\n\n\n*** Bug Bounty ***\nPeerio offered a bug bounty, offering cash rewards for anyone who reports security vulnerabilities.\n\n== Peerio (Legacy) ==\nThe first iteration of Peerio, Peerio (Legacy), was developed by Nadim Kobeissi and Florencia Herra-Vega and was released on 14 January 2015 and was closed on 8 January 2018.Peerio (Legacy) was a free application, available for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, and as a Google Chrome extension.  It offered end-to-end encryption, which is enabled by default.  The encryption used the miniLock open-source security standard, which was also developed by Kobeissi.On 15 June 2017, Peerio 2 was launched as the successor to Peerio (Legacy). According to the company's blog, Peerio 2 is purported to be a \"radical overhaul\" of the original application's core technology. Claimed benefits in comparison to Peerio (Legacy) include increased speed, support for larger file transfers (up to 7000GB), and a re-designed user interface. Peerio also stated an added focus towards businesses looking for encrypted team collaboration software.",

    "instruction": "context: Attack Surface Analyzer\n\n==Introduction==\nAttack Surface Analyzer is a tool created for the analysis of changes made to the attack surface of the operating systems since Windows Vista and beyond. It is a tool recommended by Microsoft in its SDL guidelines in the verification stage of the development.\n\n\n\n== Features ==\n\n\n*** Analysis of Different Threat Categories ***\nAttack Surface Analyzer is all in one tool for analysis of changes made to the various parts of the attack surface of Windows 6 series Operating System (includes Windows Vista and Windows 7). Using this one tool, you can analyze the changes made to the Registry, File permissions, Windows IIS Server, GAC assemblies and a lot more can be done. According to Microsoft, it is the same tool in use by the engineers of the security team at Microsoft to analyze the effects of software installation on the Windows Operating System.\nIt would not have been possible when there was no all in one tool. You would have had to use different software for all the different parts of Windows and then combine the effects logically by yourself. The tool enlists the various elements it enumerates while running a system scan. The elements are:\n\nfiles\nregistry keys\nmemory information\nwindows\nWindows firewall\nGAC Assemblies\nnetwork shares\nLogon sessions\nports\nnamed pipes\nautorun tasks\nRPC endpoints\nprocesses\nthreads\ndesktops\nhandles\nMicrosoft Internet Information Services ServerThe above list is a comprehensive set of elements that are both possible as well as important elements that can be changed when new software is installed on the system. While some software might change only a few elements in the list, some other can change a few more and different elements on the system. Attack Surface Analyzer combines all of them so that it is easier to analyze all parts.\n\n\n*** Enlisting Threats ***\nWhile Attack Surface Analyzer can tell you the changes for sure, in some cases, it will also be able to tell you that a particular change in the configuration is causing a threat. As of now, the tool does not enlist the threats in all the categories (or parts of the Operating System) it scans but only a few, the most noticeable of which are the issues in services configurations, File system ACLs and issues related to the processes running on the system.\n\n\n*** Determining Threat Severity ***\nGetting the list of threats to the system is a great thing when you have it from software released by Microsoft itself. After all, no one knows Windows better than Microsoft. With the improved concerns over security shown by Microsoft, it is important that the severity of a threat is also known to the IT team of an enterprise. The Attack Surface Analyzer also shows the severity of the threats that it finds. However, it seems not to report the severity of each and every threat. Instead it shows the severity of the threat by its category. For example, the severity of threat caused by \u201cExecutables With Weak ACLs\u201d (threat severity of level 1) is less than that caused by \u201cProcesses With Impersonation Tokens\u201d (threat severity of level 2). It is surely a desirable feature to enlist the level of severity caused by each threat rather by the category to which it belongs. There however, is no news about when that might be available.\n\n\n*** Built in Help ***\nEvery organization has its experts on various domains of security. There may be a case when a network security expert in an organization is not aware of the details and terminology of some other domain (say Windows Services). However, the two issues may be connected to each other. While it is not possible (and in some case not important) for the experts of two security expert teams to know everything about the terms in use by each other, it might be required in a few cases. A brief description (along with a link to technet library describing the term in detail) of all threats and changes to the attack surface are enlisted in the report generated by the Attack Surface Analyzer. While the brief description is usually enough for the experts, it might be needed in other cases. Microsoft has made it easy to find the right resource for the term rather than relying upon the web search engines.\n\n\n*** Organization of Changes made to the Attack Surface ***\nAttack Surface of Windows Operating System concerns various parts of the Operating System. It would have been difficult for anyone to understand the report if all of the changes were listed in serial order. Attack Surface Analyzer makes it easy for the user to browse through the report by listing the threats in categories and providing a Table of contents in an HTML page.\n\n\n*** Report Generation ***\nAttack Surface Analyzer can compare two scan data (generated by itself on two different scans) and generate a report, which can then be viewed in the HTML format. It is also possible to run the scans on one system and then generate on another system using the same tool. This is good for Windows Vista Clients because it is not possible to generate report using the current version of Attack Surface Analyzer on Windows Vista. In such a case, Attack Surface Analyzer can be used to run scans on the Windows Vista Client, transfer the scan result files to a computer running Windows 7 and then generate and browse the report on the Windows 7 based computer.\n\n== System Requirements ==\nAttack Surface Analyzer works on the Windows 6.X series of Operating Systems but report generation can only be done on 6.1 version Operating Systems. Following are the system requirements of Attack Surface Analyzer (from the official download page):\nInstallable on: Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2\nCollection of Attack Surface Data: Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2\nAnalysis of Attack Surface data and report generation: Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 with Microsoft .Net 3.5 SP1\nMicrosoft has not enlisted any hardware requirements separately. The tool should be able to perform its job on any machine meeting the hardware requirements of the installed Operating System. Note, however, that the running time for generation of scan data and report depends on the hardware capabilities (better hardware would get the work done faster).\n\n== Scans ==\nAttack Surface Analyzer list two types of scans namely baseline scan and product scan. In strict technical terms both the scans are same. The difference between them is logical, not technical.\n\n\n*** Baseline Scan ***\nThis is the scan run that the user will run to generate the data on the initial system. This data is then compared with the product scan. After running the baseline scan, the product whose effect on the attack surface of the Operating System is to be checked is installed. The installation changes the system configuration (possibly) by installing services, changing firewall rules, installing new .NET assemblies and so on. Baseline scan is a logical scan run by the user using Attack Surface Analyzer that generates the file containing the configuration of the system before this software is installed.\n\n\n*** Product Scan ***\nProduct scan signifies the state of the system after the \u2018product\u2019 was installed. In this context, the product is the software whose effects on the system upon installation are to be checked. To generate a report, two scans are required in minimum. The product scan would capture the changes made to the system by the installation of the software product under testing. The scan data generated in this scan is compared with the baseline scan data to find the changes made to the system configurations on different points. It is worth a note that more than one system state can be captured using Attack Surface Analyzer and any combination of them can be used for the report generation. However the \u2018Baseline Scan\u2019 should be the one that was taken before the other. The other can automatically be called as the product scan.\nNow I will ask you some questions, and you will answer.\n\n",

    "instruction": "Implicit certificate\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, implicit certificates are a variant of public key certificate. A subject's public key is reconstructed from the data in an implicit certificate, and is then said to be \"implicitly\" verified. Tampering with the certificate will result in the reconstructed public key being invalid, in the sense that it is infeasible to find the matching private key value, as would be required to make use of the tampered certificate.\nBy comparison, traditional public-key certificates include a copy of the subject's public key, and a digital signature made by the issuing certificate authority (CA).  The public key must be explicitly validated, by verifying the signature using the CA's public key. For the purposes of this article, such certificates will be called \"explicit\" certificates.\nElliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone (ECQV) is one kind of implicit certificate scheme. It is described in the document Standards for Efficient Cryptography 4 (SEC4).This article will use ECQV as a concrete example to illustrate implicit certificates.\n\n== Comparison of ECQV with explicit certificates ==\nConventional explicit certificates are made up of three parts: subject identification data, a public key and a digital signature which binds the public key to the user's identification data (ID).  These are distinct data elements within the certificate, and contribute to the size of the certificate: for example, a standard X.509 certificate is on the order of 1KB in size (~8000 bits).\nAn ECQV implicit certificate consists of identification data, and a single cryptographic value. This value, an elliptic curve point, combines the function of public key data and CA signature. ECQV implicit certificates can therefore be considerably smaller than explicit certificates, and so are useful in highly constrained environments such as Radio-frequency Identification RFID tags, where not a lot of memory or bandwidth is available.\nECQV certificates are useful for any ECC scheme where the private and public keys are of the form ( d, dG ). This includes key agreement protocols such as ECDH and ECMQV, or signing algorithms such as ECDSA. The operation will fail if the certificate has been altered, as the reconstructed public key will be invalid. Reconstructing the public key is fast (a single point multiplication operation) compared to ECDSA signature verification.\n\n== Comparison with ID-based cryptography ==\nImplicit certificates are not to be confused with identity-based cryptography. In ID-based schemes, the subject's identity itself is used to derive their public key; there is no 'certificate' as such. The corresponding private key is calculated and issued to the subject by a trusted third party.\nIn an implicit certificate scheme, the subject has a private key which is not revealed to the CA during the certificate-issuing process. The CA is trusted to issue certificates correctly, but not to hold individual user's private keys. Wrongly issued certificates can be revoked, whereas there is no comparable mechanism for misuse of private keys in an identity-based scheme.\n\n== Description of the ECQV scheme ==\nInitially the scheme parameters must be agreed upon.

    "output": "Q1: How do implicit certificates differ from traditional public-key certificates in terms of verifying the public key? A1: Implicit certificates reconstruct the subject's public key from the certificate data, while traditional public-key certificates, or \"explicit\" certificates, include a copy of the subject's public key and a digital signature made by the issuing certificate authority (CA). In implicit certificates, tampering with the certificate results in an invalid public key, making it infeasible to find the corresponding private key. In contrast, explicit certificates require explicit validation of the public key by verifying the signature using the CA's public key.\nQ2: What is one advantage of Elliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone (ECQV) implicit certificates over conventional explicit certificates? A2: ECQV implicit certificates consist of identification data and a single cryptographic value, an elliptic curve point, which combines the function of public key data and CA signature. This design allows ECQV certificates to be considerably smaller than explicit certificates, making them more suitable for highly constrained environments such as RFID tags, where memory and bandwidth are limited.\nQ3: In what scenarios are ECQV certificates useful, and what happens if the certificate is altered? A3: ECQV certificates are useful for any ECC scheme where the private and public keys are of the form (d, dG), such as key agreement protocols like ECDH and ECMQV, or signing algorithms like ECDSA. If the certificate is altered, the reconstructed public key will be invalid, causing the operation to fail.\nQ4: How do implicit certificates differ from identity-based cryptography schemes? A4: In implicit certificate schemes, the subject has a private key that is not revealed to the CA during the certificate-issuing process, while in identity-based cryptography, the subject's identity is used to derive their public key, and there is no certificate as such. Additionally, wrongly issued certificates can be revoked in implicit certificate schemes, but there is no comparable mechanism for misuse of private keys in identity-based schemes.\nQ5: What are the parameters that must be agreed upon before using the ECQV scheme? A5: The parameters that must be agreed upon before using the ECQV scheme include elliptic curve parameters (such as a generating point G of order n), an encoding function Encode(ID, \u03b3) that encodes its arguments as a byte-block, a corresponding Decode\u03b3(\u22c5) that extracts the \u03b3 value from an encoding, and a hash function Hn(\u22c5) that accepts a byte-block and yields a hash value as an integer in the range [0, n-1].\nQ6: In the ECQV scheme, what are the roles of the private key and public key held by the certificate authority (CA)? A6: In the ECQV scheme, the certificate authority (CA) has a private key c and a public key QCA. The private key is used for issuing certificates, while the public key is used for verification purposes.\nQ7: What is the primary goal of the security proof for ECQV published by Brown et al.? A7: The primary goal of the security proof for ECQV published by Brown et al. is to demonstrate the security properties and assurances of the ECQV scheme, providing confidence in its ability to protect against potential threats and attacks.\nQ8: How does the ECQV scheme handle the public key data compared to explicit certificate schemes? A8: In the ECQV scheme, the public key data is implicitly reconstructed from the certificate data, while in explicit certificate schemes, the public key data is explicitly included in the certificate.\nQ9: How do ECQV implicit certificates contribute to reducing the certificate size compared to conventional explicit certificates? A9: ECQV implicit certificates use a single cryptographic value, an elliptic curve point, to combine the function of public key data and CA signature. This design results in smaller certificate sizes compared to conventional explicit certificates, which store these data elements separately.\nQ10: What is the main difference between private key handling in implicit certificate schemes and identity-based cryptography? A10: In implicit certificate schemes, the subject's private key is not revealed to the CA during the certificate-issuing process, while in identity-based cryptography, the private key is calculated and issued to the subject by a trusted third party.\nQ11: How does the ECQV scheme ensure the integrity of the public key data? A11: The ECQV scheme ensures the integrity of the public key data by reconstructing the public key from the certificate data. Tampering with the certificate results in an invalid public key, making it infeasible to find the corresponding private key.\nQ12: How does the size of ECQV implicit certificates compare to standard X.509 certificates? A12: ECQV implicit certificates are considerably smaller than standard X.509 certificates, which are on the order of 1KB in size (~8000 bits).\nQ13: What is the role of the hash function Hn(\u22c5) in the ECQV scheme? A13: The hash function Hn(\u22c5) in the ECQV scheme is used to accept a byte-block and yield a hash value as an integer in the range [0, n-1], providing a secure and efficient method for processing and encoding data.\nQ14: How does the ECQV scheme provide security assurances in constrained environments like RFID tags? A14: The ECQV scheme provides security assurances in constrained environments like RFID tags by using compact certificate sizes and efficient public key reconstruction, ensuring adequate security while minimizing resource usage.\nQ15: How does the ECQV scheme address the issue of private key misuse compared to identity-based cryptography? A15: The ECQV scheme addresses the issue of private key misuse compared to identity-based cryptography by providing a revocation mechanism for wrongly issued certificates. In contrast, identity-based cryptography does not have a comparable mechanism for misuse of private keys.",

      "qa_list": "Q1: How do implicit certificates differ from traditional public-key certificates in terms of verifying the public key? A1: Implicit certificates reconstruct the subject's public key from the certificate data, while traditional public-key certificates, or \"explicit\" certificates, include a copy of the subject's public key and a digital signature made by the issuing certificate authority (CA). In implicit certificates, tampering with the certificate results in an invalid public key, making it infeasible to find the corresponding private key. In contrast, explicit certificates require explicit validation of the public key by verifying the signature using the CA's public key.\nQ2: What is one advantage of Elliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone (ECQV) implicit certificates over conventional explicit certificates? A2: ECQV implicit certificates consist of identification data and a single cryptographic value, an elliptic curve point, which combines the function of public key data and CA signature. This design allows ECQV certificates to be considerably smaller than explicit certificates, making them more suitable for highly constrained environments such as RFID tags, where memory and bandwidth are limited.\nQ3: In what scenarios are ECQV certificates useful, and what happens if the certificate is altered? A3: ECQV certificates are useful for any ECC scheme where the private and public keys are of the form (d, dG), such as key agreement protocols like ECDH and ECMQV, or signing algorithms like ECDSA. If the certificate is altered, the reconstructed public key will be invalid, causing the operation to fail.\nQ4: How do implicit certificates differ from identity-based cryptography schemes? A4: In implicit certificate schemes, the subject has a private key that is not revealed to the CA during the certificate-issuing process, while in identity-based cryptography, the subject's identity is used to derive their public key, and there is no certificate as such. Additionally, wrongly issued certificates can be revoked in implicit certificate schemes, but there is no comparable mechanism for misuse of private keys in identity-based schemes.\nQ5: What are the parameters that must be agreed upon before using the ECQV scheme? A5: The parameters that must be agreed upon before using the ECQV scheme include elliptic curve parameters (such as a generating point G of order n), an encoding function Encode(ID, \u03b3) that encodes its arguments as a byte-block, a corresponding Decode\u03b3(\u22c5) that extracts the \u03b3 value from an encoding, and a hash function Hn(\u22c5) that accepts a byte-block and yields a hash value as an integer in the range [0, n-1].\nQ6: In the ECQV scheme, what are the roles of the private key and public key held by the certificate authority (CA)? A6: In the ECQV scheme, the certificate authority (CA) has a private key c and a public key QCA. The private key is used for issuing certificates, while the public key is used for verification purposes.\nQ7: What is the primary goal of the security proof for ECQV published by Brown et al.? A7: The primary goal of the security proof for ECQV published by Brown et al. is to demonstrate the security properties and assurances of the ECQV scheme, providing confidence in its ability to protect against potential threats and attacks.\nQ8: How does the ECQV scheme handle the public key data compared to explicit certificate schemes? A8: In the ECQV scheme, the public key data is implicitly reconstructed from the certificate data, while in explicit certificate schemes, the public key data is explicitly included in the certificate.\nQ9: How do ECQV implicit certificates contribute to reducing the certificate size compared to conventional explicit certificates? A9: ECQV implicit certificates use a single cryptographic value, an elliptic curve point, to combine the function of public key data and CA signature. This design results in smaller certificate sizes compared to conventional explicit certificates, which store these data elements separately.\nQ10: What is the main difference between private key handling in implicit certificate schemes and identity-based cryptography? A10: In implicit certificate schemes, the subject's private key is not revealed to the CA during the certificate-issuing process, while in identity-based cryptography, the private key is calculated and issued to the subject by a trusted third party.\nQ11: How does the ECQV scheme ensure the integrity of the public key data? A11: The ECQV scheme ensures the integrity of the public key data by reconstructing the public key from the certificate data. Tampering with the certificate results in an invalid public key, making it infeasible to find the corresponding private key.\nQ12: How does the size of ECQV implicit certificates compare to standard X.509 certificates? A12: ECQV implicit certificates are considerably smaller than standard X.509 certificates, which are on the order of 1KB in size (~8000 bits).\nQ13: What is the role of the hash function Hn(\u22c5) in the ECQV scheme? A13: The hash function Hn(\u22c5) in the ECQV scheme is used to accept a byte-block and yield a hash value as an integer in the range [0, n-1], providing a secure and efficient method for processing and encoding data.\nQ14: How does the ECQV scheme provide security assurances in constrained environments like RFID tags? A14: The ECQV scheme provides security assurances in constrained environments like RFID tags by using compact certificate sizes and efficient public key reconstruction, ensuring adequate security while minimizing resource usage.\nQ15: How does the ECQV scheme address the issue of private key misuse compared to identity-based cryptography? A15: The ECQV scheme addresses the issue of private key misuse compared to identity-based cryptography by providing a revocation mechanism for wrongly issued certificates. In contrast, identity-based cryptography does not have a comparable mechanism for misuse of private keys."

    "instruction": "Network-centric warfare\n\n==Introduction==\nNetwork-centric warfare, also called network-centric operations or net-centric warfare, is a military doctrine or theory of war that aims to translate an information advantage, enabled partly by information technology, into a competitive advantage through the computer networking of dispersed forces. It was pioneered by the United States Department of Defense in the 1990s.\n\n\n\n== Background and history ==\nIn 1996, Admiral William Owens introduced the concept of a 'system of systems' in a paper published by the Institute for National Security Studies in the United States. He described a system of intelligence sensors, command and control systems, and precision weapons that provided situational awareness, rapid target assessment, and distributed weapon assignment.\nAlso in 1996, the United States' Joint Chiefs of Staff released Joint Vision 2010, which introduced the military concept of full-spectrum dominance. Full Spectrum Dominance described the ability of the US military to dominate the battlespace from peace operations through to the outright application of military power that stemmed from the advantages of information superiority.\n\n\n*** Network Centric Warfare ***\nThe term \"network-centric warfare\" and associated concepts first appeared in the United States Department of Navy's publication, \"Copernicus: C4ISR for the 21st Century.\" The ideas of networking sensors, commanders, and shooters to flatten the hierarchy, reduce the operational pause, enhance precision, and increase speed of command were captured in this document. As a distinct concept, however, network-centric warfare first appeared publicly in a 1998 US Naval Institute Proceedings article by Vice Admiral Arthur K. Cebrowski and John Garstka. However, the first complete articulation of the idea was contained in the book Network Centric Warfare : Developing and Leveraging Information Superiority by David S. Alberts, John Garstka and Frederick Stein, published by the Command and Control Research Program (CCRP). This book derived a new theory of warfare from a series of case studies on how business was using information and communication technologies to improve situation analysis, accurately control inventory and production, as well as monitor customer relations.\n\n\n*** Understanding Information Age Warfare ***\nNetwork-centric warfare was followed in 2001 by Understanding Information Age Warfare (UIAW), jointly authored by Alberts, Garstka, Richard Hayes of Evidence Based Research and David A. Signori of RAND. UIAW pushed the implications of the shifts identified by network-centric warfare in order to derive an operational theory of warfare.\nStarting with a series of premises on how the environment is sensed, UIAW describes three domains. The first is a physical domain, where events take place and are perceived by sensors and people. Data emerging from the physical domain is transmitted through an information domain. It is processed in a cognitive domain before being acted upon.\nThe process is similar to a \"observe, orient, decide, act\" loop described by Col. John Boyd of the USAF.\n\n\n*** Power to the Edge ***\nThe last publication dealing with the developing theory of network centric warfare appeared in 2003 with Power to the Edge, also published by the CCRP.

Although multi-level security systems provide part of the solution, human intervention and decision-making is still needed to determine what specific data can and cannot be transferred.\nAccurate locational awareness is limited when maneuvering in areas where Global Positioning System (GPS) coverage is weak or non-existent.  These areas include the inside of buildings, caves, etc. as well as built-up areas and urban canyons, which are also settings for many modern military operations.  Much work on reliable fusion of positional data from multiple sensors remains to be done.\nProviding secure communications in network-centric warfare/network-centric operations is difficult, since successful key management for encryption is typically the most difficult aspect of cryptography, especially with mobile systems.  The problem is exacerbated with the need for speedy deployment and nimble reconfiguration of military teams, to respond to rapidly changing conditions in the modern battlespace.\n\n== International activities ==\nThere is significant need to harmonize the technical and operational aspects of net-centric warfare and net-centric operations among multiple nations, in order to support coalition activities, joint operations, etc.\nThe NATO Command Structure and many NATO and non-NATO nations have joined the Federated Mission Networking (FMN) initiative and work together under the FMN Framework Process to coordinate the design, development and delivery of operational and technical capabilities required to conduct net-centric operations.

      "context": "Network-centric warfare\n\n==Introduction==\nNetwork-centric warfare, also called network-centric operations or net-centric warfare, is a military doctrine or theory of war that aims to translate an information advantage, enabled partly by information technology, into a competitive advantage through the computer networking of dispersed forces. It was pioneered by the United States Department of Defense in the 1990s.\n\n\n\n== Background and history ==\nIn 1996, Admiral William Owens introduced the concept of a 'system of systems' in a paper published by the Institute for National Security Studies in the United States. He described a system of intelligence sensors, command and control systems, and precision weapons that provided situational awareness, rapid target assessment, and distributed weapon assignment.\nAlso in 1996, the United States' Joint Chiefs of Staff released Joint Vision 2010, which introduced the military concept of full-spectrum dominance. Full Spectrum Dominance described the ability of the US military to dominate the battlespace from peace operations through to the outright application of military power that stemmed from the advantages of information superiority.\n\n\n*** Network Centric Warfare ***\nThe term \"network-centric warfare\" and associated concepts first appeared in the United States Department of Navy's publication, \"Copernicus: C4ISR for the 21st Century.\" The ideas of networking sensors, commanders, and shooters to flatten the hierarchy, reduce the operational pause, enhance precision, and increase speed of command were captured in this document. As a distinct concept, however, network-centric warfare first appeared publicly in a 1998 US Naval Institute Proceedings article by Vice Admiral Arthur K. Cebrowski and John Garstka. However, the first complete articulation of the idea was contained in the book Network Centric Warfare : Developing and Leveraging Information Superiority by David S. Alberts, John Garstka and Frederick Stein, published by the Command and Control Research Program (CCRP). This book derived a new theory of warfare from a series of case studies on how business was using information and communication technologies to improve situation analysis, accurately control inventory and production, as well as monitor customer relations.\n\n\n*** Understanding Information Age Warfare ***\nNetwork-centric warfare was followed in 2001 by Understanding Information Age Warfare (UIAW), jointly authored by Alberts, Garstka, Richard Hayes of Evidence Based Research and David A. Signori of RAND. UIAW pushed the implications of the shifts identified by network-centric warfare in order to derive an operational theory of warfare.\nStarting with a series of premises on how the environment is sensed, UIAW describes three domains. The first is a physical domain, where events take place and are perceived by sensors and people. Data emerging from the physical domain is transmitted through an information domain. It is processed in a cognitive domain before being acted upon.\nThe process is similar to a \"observe, orient, decide, act\" loop described by Col. John Boyd of the USAF.\n\n\n*** Power to the Edge ***\nThe last publication dealing with the developing theory of network centric warfare appeared in 2003 with Power to the Edge, also published by the CCRP. Power to the Edge is a speculative work suggesting that modern military environments are far too complex to be understood by any one individual, organisation, or even military service.\nModern information technology permits the rapid and effective sharing of information to such a degree that \"edge entities\" or those that are essentially conducting military missions themselves, should be able to \"pull\" information from ubiquitous repositories, rather than having centralised agencies attempt to anticipate their information needs and \"push\" it to them. This would imply a major flattening of traditional military hierarchies, however.\nPower To The Edge's radical ideas had been under investigation by the Pentagon since at least 2001. In UIAW, the concept of peer-to-peer activity combined with more traditional hierarchical flow of data in the network had been introduced.\nShortly thereafter, the Pentagon began investing in peer-to-peer research, telling software engineers at a November 2001 peer-to-peer conference that there were advantages to be gained in the redundancy and robustness of a peer-to-peer network topology on the battlefield.\nNetwork-centric warfare/operations is a cornerstone of the ongoing transformation effort at the Department of Defense initiated by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. It is also one of the five goals of the Office of Force Transformation, Office of the Secretary of Defense.\nSee Revolution in Military Affairs for further information on what is now known as \"defense transformation\" or \"transformation\".\n\n== Related technologies and programs ==\n\nThe US DOD has mandated that the Global Information Grid (GIG) will be the primary technical framework to support US network-centric warfare/network-centric operations.
