The following \u201cshort forms\u201d of the SCAS instruction specify the operand length: SCASB (scan byte string), SCASW (scan word string), and SCASD (scan doubleword string).\n\nSo, basically, this instruction scan a string and look for the same character than the one stored in EAX. It won't touch any registers other than ECX (counter) and EDI (address) but the status flags according to the results."

While the security companies are smart so are the spammers, so no matter how good filters are some spam is going to get through. 130 Billion spam emails are sent every day using hundreds of different ways to fool filters and even with the best technology from some of the finest minds in the industry some will make it through."

You just ban users, but there will appear new again and again. \nWhat I can suggest:\n\nconfigure server software so it handles connections in a more lightweight manner - deny long and heavy requests (e.g. MaxKeepAliveRequests in Apache);\nconfigure your OS - IP stack tuning (e.g. sysctl in FreeBSD);\nclose unused ports, remove unused services;\nmod_evasive - Apache module against attacks;\nset up a lightweight server as front-end - Nginx, for example.\n\nThis is a long topic to discuss, I would recommend not to stop within these recommendations but google on them for more precise information."

As I understand it, even though the traffic is encrypted, it is possible for a third party attacker to intercept the data packets and observe their basic properties.

So my questions are:\n\nIs it technically feasible and practical to obfuscate packets sent over a network when you control both ends of the transmission? For example, can one pad the packets to a uniform size and frequency (or randomize their size, etc.) without significantly degrading the performance of the network and without being able to modify the applications themselves? \nIf yes, are there \"off the shelf\" solutions for implementing such obfuscation in a simple \"one router, several desktops\" kind of environment?",

Then I start thinking, and here is what I did. \nI created streaming server that will:\nCreate separate key for EVERY chunk in EVERY session, that means that key never repeats. chunks are relatively small 1chunk per 3 seconds. then I encoded key by base64 and got 24 bytes that were exactly 192 bits which is same length as AES-192, After that I shifted every byte for specific number of spaces, for each character different shift and replaced padding of 64 with some random chars.

      "question": "DRM Video encryption\nI had some work where I needed to secure streaming. So I looked over all DRM protections that are currently available, and then I found out that I had 3 opinions, first to use very expensive DRM (Adobe) that would cost fortune, second one was to use some cheap one which require installation of some bad quality plugins and doesn't have support for all browsers and third one was to use AES-128 encription which is not really DRM, but can handle some things. Then I start thinking, and here is what I did. \nI created streaming server that will:\nCreate separate key for EVERY chunk in EVERY session, that means that key never repeats. chunks are relatively small 1chunk per 3 seconds. then I encoded key by base64 and got 24 bytes that were exactly 192 bits which is same length as AES-192, After that I shifted every byte for specific number of spaces, for each character different shift and replaced padding of 64 with some random chars. As a result I got unrecognizable base64 which looks like random key. Then after that I did reverse in the flash player. and as a result I got player working pretty good.

Furthermore, the level of access authorization is also controlled via OAuth (for example, some applications/websites can request for access to your Twitter Direct Messages, while others only request access to Post tweets on your behalf).\nSince majority of Mobile device access situations are about accessing data or posting data to a service, you would find OAuth being mentioned appropriately in the context. If you find a situation where the application only requires a login (proving your identity), but does not require access to your account's data, then OpenID is equally applicable.\nFor further reading, I would recommend this blog post: OAuth-OpenID: You\u2019re Barking Up the Wrong Tree if you Think They\u2019re the Same Thing",

      "question": "Why is OAuth 2.0 being used for mobile devices, and not OpenID?\nMicrosoft Azure Mobile services exclusively uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication, and many other providers mention the use of OAuth 2.0 specifically when referring to mobile devices.\nQuestion\n\nWhat makes OAuth 2.0 more appealing than OpenID specifically for mobile devices?\nIs there a reason to use OAuth 2.0 that isn't exclusive to usage on mobile devices? (smaller payload, better home realm discovery)?",
      "answer": "OAuth and OpenID have different purposes. OpenID revolves around the concept of proving \"who you are\" and hence is useful in the scenarios where you use one login to log in to multiple sites.

      "question": "Determine if private key belongs to certificate?\nGiven a certificate\u00b9 and a private key file\u00b2, how can I determine if the public key on the certificate matches the private key?\nMy initial thought was to simply encrypt some text with the public key on the cert, and attempt to decrypt it with the private key. If it roundtrips, we've got a winner. I just can't figure out how to do this with OpenSSL.\nAlternatively, if I could generate the public key from the private key, I could just compare their fingerprints. SSH seems to have a command for this:\nssh-keygen -y -f my_key > my_key.pub\n\nBut the hashes don't match. (I'm nearly certain I have the key corresponding to the cert, as the webserver is serving with it, but I'd like an easier way that spinning up a server to check.)\n\u00b9 a .crt file, in x509 format, I think. OpenSSL can read it with:\nopenssl x509 -text -in that_cert.crt\n\n\u00b2 An RSA private key.",
      "answer": "The accepted answer is correct, but it only works for RSA keys.\nAt least since openssl 1.1.1 it is possible to test validity of all types of private keys and here's a one-liner that works for all sorts of keys that openssl supports\n cmp <(openssl x509 -pubkey -in certificate.pem -noout) <(openssl pkey -check -pubout -in private-key.pem -outform PEM)\n\nIt will return 'true' if and only if the private key matches the public key in the certificate."

To do that I need to generate the key for the ed25519 public-key scheme. Once generated, both the public key and the private key are stored in .ssh.\nTherefore, if someone can hack into my computer and get access to the .ssh folder then basically the security offered by this ssh+public-key is hacked. My last defence is the fact that I have encrypted my private key using a passphrase.\nIs my understanding correct?\n\n",
    "context": "",
    "output": "Public key cryptography in conjunction with SSH provides  a way better identity checking  than password authentication. An entity must possess both the private key and the correct passphrase to authenticate itself to another entity. You don't have to store you private key on the server. For example, when you create a pub/priv key pair with for example PuTTgen you keep the private key private and upload only the public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. So if someone gets in the possession of you private key, then yes, nothing can stop him/her to access your server.

      "question": "Is ssh and public key scheme like ed25519 as safe as the hackability of your computer?\nI am just learning Linux and I have setup ssh to connect to a server. To do that I need to generate the key for the ed25519 public-key scheme. Once generated, both the public key and the private key are stored in .ssh.\nTherefore, if someone can hack into my computer and get access to the .ssh folder then basically the security offered by this ssh+public-key is hacked. My last defence is the fact that I have encrypted my private key using a passphrase.\nIs my understanding correct?",
      "answer": "Public key cryptography in conjunction with SSH provides  a way better identity checking  than password authentication. An entity must possess both the private key and the correct passphrase to authenticate itself to another entity. You don't have to store you private key on the server. For example, when you create a pub/priv key pair with for example PuTTgen you keep the private key private and upload only the public key to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. So if someone gets in the possession of you private key, then yes, nothing can stop him/her to access your server. However if you set a passphrase on your private key then the private key is further encrypted using a symmetric encryption key derived from  that passphrase. Oh and when someone can hack your computer then you have much bigger problems than worrying about him/her gainging access to your .ssh directory.

Executing this openssl command shows that the root certificate is not sent by the remote server:\nopenssl s_client -showcerts -connect www.stackoverflow.com:443\n\nIt is then the responsibility of the client to check that the leaf certificate was indeed signed by the first intermediate certificate, that the first intermediate was signed by the second and so on.  Ultimately, the signature on the last certificate provided by the remote system is checked to verify that it was signed by a root certificate that was already trusted - i.e., already in the 'trust store'.\nSo here's the question: why would you, as the client, ever want to store an intermediate certificate?  The Windows certificate store has an area designated for storing \"Intermediate Certification Authorities\".  What is it for?  Is there ever a case where storing intermediate certificates is needed?",

For example, when analyzing a certificate with the Crypto Shell Extensions program, there's a \"Certification Path\" tab which tries to show the full chain (not ALWAYS accurate IMHO). \n3) It allows the workstation to perform server-based SSL roles if needed (for example if you were to install some local software that had a web interface).  \n4) It potentially allows Windows, IE, or anything else leveraging the cert store to have a trusted reference point for cert pinning.

Keys themselves don't have expiration dates, you want to extract the certificate from the p12 and look at the notAfter or validTo field.\nMy understanding is that if you created the p12 with a password, then the entire contents are encrypted as one blob. ie there is no way to access the only the certificates without knowing the password.\nI'm not an openssl expert, but this seems consistent with this openssl command-line guide, which acts on the p12 certificate and private key together:\n# Check a PKCS#12 file (.pfx or .p12)\nopenssl pkcs12 -info -in keyStore.p12\n\n# Convert a PKCS#12 file (.pfx .p12) containing a private key and certificates to PEM\nopenssl pkcs12 -in keyStore.pfx -out keyStore.pem -nodes"

It's a list of servers you've previously connected to and fingerprints of their SSH keys to help verify the connection to the server is not being man-in-the-middled.\nauthorized_keys is a file stored on the server containing the SSH public keys of users authorized to log in to the server.\nid_rsa is the private key.  id_rsa.pub is the public key.  The public key is encoded according to the format in RFC 4253, but basically it's a PEM-encoded blob that contains the key type, length, and the values n and e.\nPublic key authentication does not involve passwords at all.

I was hoping someone could fix my confusion.\nWhen you generate an ssh key pair, you create four files.\nauthorized_keys, id_rsa, id_rsa.pub and known_hosts\n\nMy confusion comes from that fact that RSA is an encryption tool, you release a public key pair (n,e) but in the id_rsa.pub file, there is no pair, it's just one gigantic string, where does it split?\nFurthermore, how does SSH create a server side password check, RSA is used for encrypting messages, how does them having my public key, combining with my private key create some sort of password confirmation, RSA is used for encrypting messages not password authentication?",
      "answer": "known_hosts has nothing to do with public key authentication.  It's a list of servers you've previously connected to and fingerprints of their SSH keys to help verify the connection to the server is not being man-in-the-middled.\nauthorized_keys is a file stored on the server containing the SSH public keys of users authorized to log in to the server.\nid_rsa is the private key.  id_rsa.pub is the public key.  The public key is encoded according to the format in RFC 4253, but basically it's a PEM-encoded blob that contains the key type, length, and the values n and e.\nPublic key authentication does not involve passwords at all.  There's no \"password confirmation\" step at all.  When the client connect, it offers the keys it has to server.

      "question": "Social Engineering or Broken Authentication\nIf I go to a cybercafe and use one of the shared computers, and use a social media application, which deletes session IDs when the browser is closed.\nA clever person comes, who knows about the application's behaviour (that this application deletes session IDs when someone closes their browser), he asks me to move quickly and says, \"Please don't close the browser, I have some urgent stuff to do.\" So, in a hurry I close the tab I'm using and think that I'm logged out (it is stupid, but I have seen people do that). The moment I leave, the other person starts accessing my UserID.\nRegardless of my stupidity, if we see this scenario from the technical point of view, is this an example of broken authentication or social engineering or both?",

      "answer": "The nextUpdate field (i.e. what you treat as expiration date) is a timestamp. There is no way to specify an infinite time but you can specify a time far far away. But note that if you set nextUpdate too far in the future you have to somehow guarantee that anybody checking the CRL is still using the latest one and not some old (but still valid) version which does not contain critical revocations."

Most people seem to recommend bcrypt, but I wonder if that's just because it's old (read: well-known). scrypt seems better (variable amount of memory usage).

As recently as February 2016 (after the end of the contest) Argon2 had a small change made to it (version 1.3) in order to harden it against a minor weakness.
