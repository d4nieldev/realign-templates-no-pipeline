They completely fail at addressing most other malware than keyloggers as well as most social engineering attacks."

When it starts (or upon every new connection), the server creates a new DH key pair which it keeps in RAM only. The server sends the DH public key as part of the TLS handshake, and it signs that public key with its DSA or RSA key (the one which it stores in a file).

That is not how the web works. I can't go into that much detail in an SE answer, but your computer generally uses (the distributed) DNS to turn a human-readable hostname into an IP address, and then that gets routed across physical wires based on (again, distributed) routing protocols and data until it gets to the server it's supposed to get to.\nThe so-called dark web is structured similarly - different people run different web servers, and traffic has to go to the right places. The difference is in how you get there.\nThere's an anonymizing technology called Tor. When used to connect to the public web, a tor user's traffic goes through three different intermediate servers before trying to get to the requested website. The first node knows who the user is, but not what they were requesting (it's encrypted). The third node knows what's being requested, but not who requested it. And the middle node knows essentially nothing. This process prevents the website and other MitM snoopers like the NSA from knowing who is requesting that website.\n(Insert a bunch of caveats here around anonymity with tor, attacks on the protocol, safe browsing, and general advice to please go look up more than this comment before relying on it.)\nTor also provides a feature known as hidden services, where the website operator also sets up a circuit of three nodes to connect to. A tor user's circuit meets up with the website's circuit, and traffic flows through all six of the nodes without anyone knowing who the other parties are. This is how the deep web works.\nThe only question then is how the two meet up in the first place, and that uses yet another distributed piece of technology, a distributed hash table built into tor. So there's no centralized server to shut down here, either.\nThe weak point here is that the website operator needs to not leak their identity or the server's location on accident, which can happen through all sorts of misconfiguration or human error. But even if they do, that is only that one site that gets shut down, not some giant shutdown of the network. Also, anonymity is not illegal, so there is no legal reason for the feds to shut down tor overall, even if they could.

This process prevents the website and other MitM snoopers like the NSA from knowing who is requesting that website.\n(Insert a bunch of caveats here around anonymity with tor, attacks on the protocol, safe browsing, and general advice to please go look up more than this comment before relying on it.)\nTor also provides a feature known as hidden services, where the website operator also sets up a circuit of three nodes to connect to. A tor user's circuit meets up with the website's circuit, and traffic flows through all six of the nodes without anyone knowing who the other parties are. This is how the deep web works.\nThe only question then is how the two meet up in the first place, and that uses yet another distributed piece of technology, a distributed hash table built into tor. So there's no centralized server to shut down here, either.\nThe weak point here is that the website operator needs to not leak their identity or the server's location on accident, which can happen through all sorts of misconfiguration or human error. But even if they do, that is only that one site that gets shut down, not some giant shutdown of the network. Also, anonymity is not illegal, so there is no legal reason for the feds to shut down tor overall, even if they could. It in fact started as a US government project to assist people in oppressive regimes."

The OS does not have any execution powers inside the processing chip on the USB device, and SecureBoot task ends when the control is passed to the OS.\nIf you are confusing \"firmware\" and \"driver\", SecureBoot can't do anything at all (see above), and the OS is the one that can have mechanisms to protect itself from the installation of rogue firmware."

I'm not claiming these definitions are correct for all systems.\nOperating system programming interfaces\nI assume you are referring to OS API libraries as API. OS API is consists of different interfaces that user-mode applications can use to access the operating system. Using OS API, user-mode applications can abstract system call interfaces with more portable ones. There are many other benefits of OS API libraries like diversifying basic system call operations with high-level operations and making system call interface independent from user mode application interface. Some known OS API implementations are WinAPI and Glibc.\nHow can obtain shared library (DLL files in Microsoft Windows systems) information from an executable file?\nMost of the time shared library information is given in the PE header. And static analysis tools extract that information from that. I'm sure disassemblers like IDA has advanced features and extensions for detecting dynamic library loading.\nHow can we get dynamically loaded library information?\nSome software like computer viruses and commercial products want to hide their operations from inspection to hide their activities or protect their intellectual property. They use dynamic loading to mask their OS and other API usages. They use LoadLibrary like API functions (and lots of different variations) for loading shared libraries. A sandbox or debugger can access this information hooking these functions. But, it is not sure that they can find all instances of dynamic loading.\nCan static and dynamic shared library information differ?\nI don't know how Cuckoo and IDA access shared library information, but static and dynamic analysis can show different shared libraries.

I'm not claiming these definitions are correct for all systems.\nOperating system programming interfaces\nI assume you are referring to OS API libraries as API. OS API is consists of different interfaces that user-mode applications can use to access the operating system. Using OS API, user-mode applications can abstract system call interfaces with more portable ones. There are many other benefits of OS API libraries like diversifying basic system call operations with high-level operations and making system call interface independent from user mode application interface. Some known OS API implementations are WinAPI and Glibc.\nHow can obtain shared library (DLL files in Microsoft Windows systems) information from an executable file?\nMost of the time shared library information is given in the PE header. And static analysis tools extract that information from that. I'm sure disassemblers like IDA has advanced features and extensions for detecting dynamic library loading.\nHow can we get dynamically loaded library information?\nSome software like computer viruses and commercial products want to hide their operations from inspection to hide their activities or protect their intellectual property. They use dynamic loading to mask their OS and other API usages. They use LoadLibrary like API functions (and lots of different variations) for loading shared libraries. A sandbox or debugger can access this information hooking these functions. But, it is not sure that they can find all instances of dynamic loading.\nCan static and dynamic shared library information differ?\nI don't know how Cuckoo and IDA access shared library information, but static and dynamic analysis can show different shared libraries. Theoretically, some static analysis methods could find all dynamically loaded libraries. Which does not mean they mostly do."

        "answer": "Data in TLS is sent in TLS records, which can carry between 0 to 16KB of payload.\nIf you stop processing the received data at a TLS record boundary, there is no security problem I can see. The processed data was securely transmitted.\nIf you wish to stop processing data in the middle of a TLS record, you have a problem. You must verify the MAC for the whole record (and in CBC cipher suites also the padding), so you have to process the entire record. But if you don't verify the MAC, yes, you can decrypt a partial TLS record. Of course, because encryption is malleable, this is extremely insecure. The data in that record could have been easily changed by an attacker."

        "answer": "The best blog post that I have read about this states, in summary, that though TLS effectively replaced SSL nearly 19 years ago, TLS is still being referred to as SSL because SSL has been known to \"convey meaning better\" than TLS. \nThis is further supported by well-known companies still using the SSL naming convention in their products and services (e.g. OpenSSL, Mozilla SSL Config generator, SSL Labs SSL test).\nAlso, it seems this question may have already been resolved here and was closed due to it being primarily opinion based."

The widely suggested method is to use mmap, convert it into virtual address and then read the value.\nNow I would like to know if it a man in the midde attack is possible by replacing the standard mmap library with a spurious mmap library? That is, can a hacker prevent me from reading the intended value from the underlying hardware? Is there a secure way to read the physical address?\nIn other words I am looking to read a physical address and I would like to know the value that I read is from the actual hardware and not a spoofed value.",

You can use RC4, Xor or any other encryption algorithm for hide the strings, but bear in mind that somebody with experience will find the way to decode the string\nprintf(\"My message is %s\\n\", decode64(msg));"

They help to protect your cookies against being compromised in some attack scenarios.\nTo recap:\n\nA cookie flagged Secure is only sent to the server if the connection is secure (i.e. HTTPS). That is, a man-in-the-middle attacker can't capture them by intercepting a plain HTTP connection to your site.\nA cookie flagged HttpOnly is not accessible to scripts. That is, an XSS vulnerability on your site wouldn't allow an attacker to directly exfiltrate a HttpOnly cookie via Javascript's document.cookie.\n\nIf all your cookies are non-sensitive (e.g. a language setting) then you wouldn't absolutely have to harden access with these flags. But if you never use Javascript to access cookies and your entire domain is only available over HTTPS anyway, it's good practice to add them."

This is a common construction in full-disk encryption (FDE) schemes. If the BitLocker volume header has been erased from the disk, the key used to encrypt/decrypt the bulk data has been destroyed, so the data is completely unrecoverable.\nWhether or not the volume header was wiped from the disk depends on the type of disk and what type of format you did.\nIf the disk is a modern SSD (i.e. not one of the first generations from the early 2000s) it will support Secure Erase and TRIM, which Windows will have used. You can usually tell because the format operation takes only a few seconds instead of tens of minutes or a few hours. The data written to the flash on the SSD is transparently encrypted during normal operation. The erase command simply throws away the key and mapping table, then generates a new key. Since the old key is gone, the data on the disk is rendered unreadable. This is helpful since SSDs are prone to write wear, so overwriting all the flash cells reduces their operating lifetime. In addition, SSDs use overprovisioning (i.e. more flash cells than the advertised capacity) to help aid with wear-levelling, so if the OS tries to just overwrite the logical blocks it can see, it won't actually clear the data on those extra cells. In short: if it's an SSD, the format will have wiped the volume header.\nIf the disk is a mechanical hard disk, a quick format may not have removed the volume header. A quick format on a hard disk works by just writing a new filesystem header and table to the start of the disk, without actually erasing any data. The first sector(s) of the disk will likely have been overwritten by the new filesystem, but (if I recall correctly) the BitLocker volume header is also backup up in another sector later in the disk, in case the primary header becomes corrupted. As such, a quick format might not do it. In this case you'd want to have performed a \"normal\" format, which writes zeroes to the disk. This is sufficient - you don't need any fancy multi-pass stuff. That said, if you enabled BitLocker again after re-installing, it almost certainly overwrote the original volume headers.\nSomething you may wish to do is clear the TPM.

Now , it is well known that routing your traffic through a web proxy yields the same result. But, here this site uses DNS server to unblock you. I do not understand how that is possible. How can having a different DNS server exhibit the same behavior of that of a proxy IP ?",
        "answer": "Some very short sighted content-filtering systems rely upon DNS.   The advantage is that its very cheap to build such a content-filtering service,  and consumers are ignorant to the benefit of such a system. \nClearly this is easy to bypass,  8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 are both DNS servers that will provide a uncensored resolution."

As far as I know this is how Microsoft planned to prevent malware, by adding a digital certificate to the BIOS, or to any of the programs that get loaded on a Windows machine.\nAs far as I know, the malware is smart enough to delete all of the browser history on the day the system is attacked; which makes it impossible (from the desktop at least, maybe not from the router) to figure out what IP it came from.  \nBut a digital certificate is only as good as the company that issues them; if there's human-corruption within that company then our data is all doomed.  \nWho signed Cryptowall 2.0?",
        "answer": "It was signed by a certificate of the famous and trusted Comodo company.\n\nOne of the interesting aspects is that the variant of the malware\n  discovered by security researchers is apparently signed a few hours\n  before the campaign was launched, with a valid digital certificate\n  from Comodo, which makes it more difficult to detect on the affected\n  system.\n\n(Note that on the start of this October there has been a new release of it)"

That's a lot of info to hand an attacker.\nThe more specifics an attacker has, the more the attacker can custom-tailor their attacks. Best practise is to hide this information, but not to rely on secrecy as a means to protect yourself (security by obscurity). But blinding your attacker is better then handing him the blueprints to your server.\nThe standard \"fix\" for info disclosure in error messages is to create custom, generic error messages that do not include all this data."
