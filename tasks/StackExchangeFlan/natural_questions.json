DES is an encryption function, but here we are talking about a hashing construction that happens to internally use the DES block cipher; if you look at it closely, then you may notice that the \"key\" used for that internal DES block cipher is the password itself; and the internal block cipher is invoked 25 times."

It pushes to values on the stack, (arg_4 and num). However, As you can see in the disassembly of sub_80484B4, it only shows one argument, arg_4.\nWhat happened to num?

As you drive down the street collecting ESSID information- you are wardriving. This is recon, in a pentest methodology.

Then the API requests are served with this authToken. Is this flow inherently flawed?\nI thought of using an extra HTTP request after page loading to get the API authToken and thus avoid putting it inside the HTML body but that means more slowness since the page contents is usually dependent on the API requests which need an extra HTTP request after the page load to get the API authToken.\nI assume the connection is already over HTTPS of course.",

But, if I'm not wrong, PSKs are used to form premaster secret, which is then used with random numbers to create master secret.

This article about the NScan says\n\nNScan itself is a port scanner, which uses connect() method to find\n  the list of the host's open ports.\n\nSo, \nWhat is this connect() method? Is this method used only in NScan or is it in other port scanners too?",
    "context": "",
    "output": "answer: A connect() scan generally refers to a network scan that performs a full TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK) in order to determine whether a port is open or not.  Once those three packets have been transmitted by the respective hosts there is a connection open and ready to pass traffic.  The scanner will then either close the connection with a RST or FIN, or they could conceivably just stop using it and eventually the server will time it out and recover the resources.\nThere are many alternatives, the most common being a SYN scan - the scanner sends a SYN and waits for a SYN/ACK.  If it sees it, it concludes the port is open, even though it hasn't fully opened a connection.  The scanner does not send an ACK to complete the connection, and the server's TCP stack will close out the nascent connection in response to a RST or after (far shorter) timeouts (than are used for open connections).\nconnect() scans are generally easier to detect, because applications often log fully opened and closed connections, especially connections that close at the TCP instead of at the application layer (e.g., they'll complain that \"IP a.b.c.d DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE\").  This makes a connect() scan easier to detect.  Also, because OS resources are dedicated for fully opened connections, it is possible to tax resources on a host by nailing up a bunch of connections and then not using them - e.g., the \"timeout\" method is particularly rude.\nThe reason one might use a connect() scan (-sT in nmap) is that it's more reliable.  Nothing says \"a host will talk on this port\" like getting the host fully ready and willing to talk on that port.  Some other scan modes may have false positives.  There have been times I re-scanned individual ports that appeared open to SYN scans and was unable to verify the port was open with connect() mode scans.\n(N.B. ALL scan modes can have false positives.  As my therapist likes to say, \"Don't believe everything you think.\")",

The scanner will then either close the connection with a RST or FIN, or they could conceivably just stop using it and eventually the server will time it out and recover the resources.\nThere are many alternatives, the most common being a SYN scan - the scanner sends a SYN and waits for a SYN/ACK.  If it sees it, it concludes the port is open, even though it hasn't fully opened a connection.  The scanner does not send an ACK to complete the connection, and the server's TCP stack will close out the nascent connection in response to a RST or after (far shorter) timeouts (than are used for open connections).\nconnect() scans are generally easier to detect, because applications often log fully opened and closed connections, especially connections that close at the TCP instead of at the application layer (e.g., they'll complain that \"IP a.b.c.d DIDN'T SAY GOODBYE\").  This makes a connect() scan easier to detect.  Also, because OS resources are dedicated for fully opened connections, it is possible to tax resources on a host by nailing up a bunch of connections and then not using them - e.g., the \"timeout\" method is particularly rude.\nThe reason one might use a connect() scan (-sT in nmap) is that it's more reliable.  Nothing says \"a host will talk on this port\" like getting the host fully ready and willing to talk on that port.  Some other scan modes may have false positives.  There have been times I re-scanned individual ports that appeared open to SYN scans and was unable to verify the port was open with connect() mode scans.\n(N.B. ALL scan modes can have false positives.  As my therapist likes to say, \"Don't believe everything you think.\")"

Have the server's public key in the application to authenticate the server. To authenticate the clients, you can derive a key from the user's password.\nSecond, and that's the most important, transmit this encrypted data in a TLS 1.3 tunnel, over HTTPS. This way, you can tell your management that you are resilient in case TLS is broken, but you still benefit of all the security provided by TLS that you cannot achieve with your custom implementation.\nYou can try to do something similar for your web application using a JavaScript cryptography library. However, please keep in mind that is is only to ease the management requirements. In practice, this adds zero security against an active eavesdropper. JavaScript cryptography is only useful when the user trusts the server and the connection, the later needing TLS.\nAlso, instead of naming your protocol TLS, you can name it by the full name of the cipher suite used by TLS, like \"ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_GCM_SHA256\" for example (it's the current suite for security.stackexchange.com).",

The type of clients are mobile apps and web browsers.\nNow there is a concern about bypassing TLS in any way trough MITM attacks and disclosure of the server's private key.\nIs there any solution independent of TLS for data-in-transit protection so that developers use it at the application layer in parallel with TLS?\nupdated section: according to owasp recommendation : If possible, apply a separate layer of encryption to any sensitive data before it is given to the SSL channel. In the event that future vulnerabilities are discovered in the SSL implementation, the encrypted data will provide a secondary defense against confidentiality violation",
      "answer": "For web clients, you are out of luck, the only two protocols supported by browsers are HTTP (without any security) and HTTPS (with TLS).\nFor mobile applications, if you really must use another protocol than TLS 1.3, here is my recommendation:\nFirst, you can use a library like libsodium to encrypt data and handle any cryptographic function. Have the server's public key in the application to authenticate the server. To authenticate the clients, you can derive a key from the user's password.\nSecond, and that's the most important, transmit this encrypted data in a TLS 1.3 tunnel, over HTTPS. This way, you can tell your management that you are resilient in case TLS is broken, but you still benefit of all the security provided by TLS that you cannot achieve with your custom implementation.\nYou can try to do something similar for your web application using a JavaScript cryptography library. However, please keep in mind that is is only to ease the management requirements. In practice, this adds zero security against an active eavesdropper. JavaScript cryptography is only useful when the user trusts the server and the connection, the later needing TLS.\nAlso, instead of naming your protocol TLS, you can name it by the full name of the cipher suite used by TLS, like \"ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_GCM_SHA256\" for example (it's the current suite for security.stackexchange.com)."

      "answer": "You should look into TOR browser if you're looking to browse the web for the most part anonymously. It's a little more beginner friendly than tails.\nTo answer your question directly, yes, the easiest way to verify you are accessing the web via a TOR exit node is to go to google or DuckDuckGo and type 'whats is my IP' before then after you connect through TOR or Tails and confirm the IP has changed."

      "question": "Is L and P the same for OAEP in CMS\nIn RFC 4055 Additional Algorithms the application of PKCS#1 2.1 RSAES-OAEP (RFC 3446) for key transport is described.\nThe (key transport) parameters of RSAES-OAEP in this RFC define a hash function, a parameterized mask generation function as well as the p source function.\nHowever I cannot find a definite definition of this P parameter. Its characteristics (by default an empty string, alternate values for each encryption, input to RSAES-OEAP) suggest that this is the same parameter as called L in RFC 3447. This is also enforced by the security reflection, which defines the hash beeing applied to encoding parameter P (which is done to the L label).\nSo my question, why does RFC 4055 not use the cleaner L parameter name (less conflicts with RSA's p) and is there any formal link of the both I have missed? (RFC5652 CMS does not seem to talk about the details of key transport encryption).",

      "question": "If I write an nmap job into crontab from PHP code to run background, how can I get the status of the nmap cronjob?\nI am trying to write a php code test to write an nmap scan (with parameters) scheduled into crontab file.\nWhile the nmap is running I would like to get the status of that specific nmap scan. For example: how many IP addresses scanned, is the scan still running, or is it finished?\nIs is possible to get the status of any running nmap scan?",
      "answer": "I'm not sure if there is an easy way to do that, but if you output the nmap results to a text file, and you use the nmap -v parameter for more verbose output, you could search the output text file for the information you need.\nFore example, the first time the phrase \"Scanning x hosts\" appears, refers to the total number of hosts you are trying to scan. The second time \"Scanning x hosts\" appears refers to the total number of hosts that are up (if nmap is doing the default ARP ping scan). Then you could look for lines that start with \"Completed SYN Stealth Scan against\" (if you are doing a scan with default parameters) to see which and how many hosts were scanned. You could look for the line that starts with \"Nmap done\" in order to see if the scan has finished. The precondition to all this is that you always rewrite the output file when you do a new scan."

TSS.MST provides a binary simulating the TPM2.0 device and the app is connecting over TCP.\nHere it is said you're not supposed to preserve keys but to regenerate them. On the contrary, here they store the key handle into NVm.\nThis has me a little bit perplexed.\nIf I want to keep the key in the NVm, should I serialize it as a byte array? (I had some bad luck with that since Context class does not have serialize property)\nHow am I supposed to regenerate the keys?\nI would really appreciate any help.\nThank you",
      "answer": "So I have decided to export only the key handle. Making the key persistent and then storing the ID of the handle (handle.handle member variable) and upon application rerun assigning the handle id to a new handle.\nMore detailed implementation here"

Is this normal? ARM already has so many registers at its disposal this seems like a strange optimization. Are the instructions shorter in this case, or what's the purpose of it?",
    "context": "",
    "output": " A: This is not really an RE question but anyway...\nOn x86, the advantage of using dedicated EBP was that the instructions using it are smaller than those using ESP. It also makes it easier for a compiler (or a human when writing assembly) to track accesses to the stack frame - when using ESP you always need to compensate for every stack pointer adjustment. \nWith recent advances in compiler development many of those reasons do not really apply so there\u2019s less need for a dedicated frame pointer register, especially on platforms like ARM where there\u2019s no real advantage of using it over SP. That said, the frame pointer (X29) is still used. You can usually see it being saved and copied from SP in function prologs, even if it\u2019s not actually referenced in the function\u2019s body. This is done so that there\u2019s a proper chain of stack frames linked by the frame pointers in every function. This eases debugging and stack unwinding in case of exceptions. \nAnd sometimes it is used explicitly inside the function, for example when there is a variable adjustment of the stack pointer due to an alloca or a variable length array. In such situation the compiler has to use FP or another register to address the variables in the fixed part of the frame since SP offset is not known anymore.",
