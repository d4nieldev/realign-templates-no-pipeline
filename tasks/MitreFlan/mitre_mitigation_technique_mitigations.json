Note that in some cases binaries may be catalog-signed, which may cause the file to appear unsigned when viewing file properties.\n\nMitigation ID: M1032 \n Mitigation name: Hybrid Identity\n Mitigation description: Integrating multi-factor authentication (MFA) as part of organizational policy can greatly reduce the risk of an adversary gaining control of valid credentials that may be used for additional tactics such as initial access, lateral movement, and collecting information. MFA can also be used to restrict access to cloud resources and APIs.\n\nMitigation ID: M1026 \n Mitigation name: Hybrid Identity\n Mitigation description: Limit on-premises accounts with access to the hybrid identity solution in place.
