They record all the links, the forms, the resources accessed and all other potential entry-points for the web application, looking for URLs which use parameters.\nPossible techniques to use: Use a spidering tool to follow and record all links and analyze the web pages to find entry points. Make note of any links that include parameters in the URL., Use a proxy tool to record all links visited during a manual traversal of the web application., Use a browser to manually explore the website and analyze how it is constructed. Many browsers' plugins are available to facilitate the analysis or automate the discovery.\n\n\n- 2)Attack phase: Experiment.\nStep overview: Cause application to return error page The adversary uses the URLs gathered in the \"Explore\" phase as a target list and injects various common script payloads and special characters into the parameters to see if an error page occurs, and if the injected payload is executed by the error page.\nPossible techniques to use: Use a list of XSS probe strings to inject script in parameters of known URLs. If possible, the probe strings contain a unique identifier., Use a proxy tool to record results of manual input of XSS probes in known URLs., Use a list of HTML special characters to inject into parameters of known URLs and check if they caused errors\n\n\n- 3)Attack phase: Experiment.\nStep overview: Craft malicious XSS URL Once the adversary has determined which parameters are vulnerable to XSS through an error page, they will craft a malicious URL containing the XSS exploit. The adversary can have many goals, from stealing session IDs, cookies, credentials, and page content from the victim.\nPossible techniques to use: Change a URL parameter to include a malicious script tag., Send information gathered from the malicious script to a remote endpoint.\n\n\n- 4)Attack phase: Exploit.\nStep overview: Get victim to click URL In order for the attack to be successful, the victim needs to access the malicious URL.\nPossible techniques to use: Send a phishing email to the victim containing the malicious URL.

        "Description": "An adversary engages in UDP scanning to gather information about UDP port status on the target system. UDP scanning methods involve sending a UDP datagram to the target port and looking for evidence that the port is closed. Open UDP ports usually do not respond to UDP datagrams as there is no stateful mechanism within the protocol that requires building or establishing a session. Responses to UDP datagrams are therefore application specific and cannot be relied upon as a method of detecting an open port. UDP scanning relies heavily upon ICMP diagnostic messages in order to determine the status of a remote port.",
        "Extended_Description": {
          "xhtml:p": "During a UDP scan, a datagram is sent to a target port. If an 'ICMP Type 3 Port unreachable' error message is returned then the port is considered closed. Different types of ICMP messages can indicate a filtered port. UDP scanning is slower than TCP scanning. The protocol characteristics of UDP make port scanning inherently more difficult than with TCP, as well as dependent upon ICMP for accurate scanning. Due to ambiguities that can arise between open ports and filtered ports, UDP scanning results often require a high degree of interpretation and further testing to refine. In general, UDP scanning results are less reliable or accurate than TCP-based scanning."
