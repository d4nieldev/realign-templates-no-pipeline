In the case of compromised Exchange servers, a webshell was installed, which was in turn used to install Black Kingdom. Before encrypting files, PowerShell is used to terminate processes that have \"sql\" in their name. During the encryption process, Black Kingdom disables the system's mouse and keyboard. Due to amateurish mistakes, in cases where a hard-coded encryption key is used, the files may be recoverable. As Black Kingdom does not check if files are encrypted prior to running its encryption process, it is possible that files may be encrypted multiple times, potentially making them unrecoverable. The same Bitcoin address is used in all Black Kingdom ransom notes. Kaspersky notes that at the time of writing its report, only two transactions were showing on the account."

Code can be presented in myriad ways - it can even appear to be nearly identical to other skimmers with only minor changes to code. Detection of the skimmers is usually accomplished via IDS/IPS in the form of patterns generated by skimmers. Once a pattern can be identified, the signature of the skimmer can be written and implemented into the IDS/IPS. This method of detection is not without its flaws.

Code can be presented in myriad ways - it can even appear to be nearly identical to other skimmers with only minor changes to code. Detection of the skimmers is usually accomplished via IDS/IPS in the form of patterns generated by skimmers. Once a pattern can be identified, the signature of the skimmer can be written and implemented into the IDS/IPS. This method of detection is not without its flaws. Obfuscation of code and changes in code can make this process much more difficult for the security professional. Constantly changing IPs and C2 servers makes logging and blocking of these nearly impossible."

Its wide availability means that multiple threat actors can implement the tool, so it is not tied to a single threat actor, and as such delivery methods differ. The first delivery method highlighted by Cyberint is a shipping-themed malspam campaign observed in October 2020. A ZIP attachments delivers a VBE payload that, in turn, downloads and executes the njRAT payload. In this case, persistence was established via the Startup directory. A second method of distribution was via legitimate installers that had the njRAT downloader bundled. The legitimate installer runs and installs the intended application, but in the background the njRAT is also installed using Visual Basic and PowerShell scripts or an executable. The njRAT payload itself is downloaded as an image file hosted on a legitimate file-sharing website, such as Dropbox or OneDrive. It is then decoded, decrypted, and injected into a legitimate process. Once on the system, njRAT checks into its C2 server and provides the attacker with control over the victim host, with features such as remote shell, file operations, keylogging, and more. Most recently, Dynamic DNS (DDNS) hostnames have been the most popular types of domains used for the C2 address. The researchers also note that njRAT provides a builder application that makes generating the payloads simple for less sophisticated actors, among which this RAT has been popular.",

    "instruction": "Describe the following: Social Security Scam ",
    "context": "",
    "output": "Those of us that have been in the computing world for a number of years are aware of the \"Microsoft Tech Support\" and \"Social Security\" scams. But there are those who, either from lack of participation on Social Media or age, may not be aware of the evil people do to make money. If a potential victim is taken in by the social engineering techniques, the intimidation and threats from these scams, they can potentially lose a good portion, if not all, of their life savings they have set aside for their retirement years. The following is the result of an interview with such a victim.\n\nShe and her husband had moved back to their home town area into an assisted living facility, to be near their sons. The husband was a victim of dementia and died from the disease about a year later. The two of them were, by no means, \"wealthy\", but she still retained enough income to live on and to purchase the occasional birthday and Christmas gifts. There was even enough money for a bowl of chili from Wendy's when her sons weren't around to pay for it.\n\nThen there was that faithful day, when the telephone rang with a number that appeared to be from Washington DC. The caller informed the lady that there had been an attempt by someone to take money out of her Social Security account and that her account had been frozen. Since the lady did not immediately hang up, the criminal on the line thought he may have just found a new victim. Using social engineering techniques, he was able to convince the lady that not only were there arrest warrants made out for her (after all, cocaine had been found in the trunk of her car), but that he might be able to assist her with getting the charges dropped if she paid the fine. He assured her that he would be right there to help her gather and transfer the money himself. The best way to transfer the money would be through gift cards that she would purchase in $200 increments. He warned her, not to tell anyone what was going on, because, after all, this was a federal investigation.\n\nThe next day, the caller once again contacted the lady and guided her through the steps she would be taking that day. First, she would go to the bank and withdraw $3,000 in cash, which would be used to purchase the gift cards. Then she would go to Kroger (a local grocery chain) for the first card purchases. Again she was warned not to tell anyone what she was doing or why. The staff at the assisted living facility, her family, her friends, no one was to be told of her secretive mission. And she must stay on the line with the criminal at all times so that he could walk her through what needed to be done.\n\nShe arrived at the bank just before noon and withdrew $3,000 from her account, money that otherwise would have been spent on her assisted living costs. Next she was to go to Kroger where she would purchase some E-Bay gift cards valued at $200 each. While keeping her line open at all times, she was to return to her car and scratch off the covering to the redemption code. For each card, she was to read off the thirteen digits found underneath to the criminal on the line. Next, she was to go to Walgreens for more purchases. This time the gift cards would be for Google Play, again for the same amount.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the assisted facility, those in charge were becoming worried about the lady. She was only supposed to be going to the bank and should have returned a while ago. So they called the point of contact to inform him of the missing lady. He, in turn, called his brother and they both began calling the lady, trying to get her to answer. At the time, she was not answering any calls other than from the criminal, what few times she wasn't already on the line with him. The two brothers, not knowing about the calls, were fearful something had happened to her. They even had contacted the police regarding a possible traffic accident involving her, since they were unaware of the scam taking place.\n\nJust as the brothers were about to reach the city limits, she finally called and told them she was at Walgreens and wanted to know if they were coming for a visit. Relieved that she appeared to be okay, they indicated that while the visit was not a planned one, yes, they were coming. She indicated she would be back at the facility shortly, then, for their visit. The brothers arrived first and waited. For thirty minutes. Since they had just passed Walgreens on the way to the facility and it was less than five minutes away, they returned to see what was wrong. The lady was acting strangely and was just getting into her car while trying to talk on the phone. They all drove back to the facility for a visit.\n\nWhile the brothers were explaining how concerned they were about her being gone for so long and not answering her phone, her phone rang and she promptly answered it. Her side of the conversation sounded strange, subdued, almost secretive. The older brother picked up the phone and asked who was on the other end. Upon hearing a foreign accent, he became concerned and asked what this call was in regards to. Upon hearing the words \"Social Security\", combined the secretive actions of the lady, he immediately arrived at the correct conclusion that the lady was being scammed and may have said a few things that would have required soap to wash out of his mouth in his youth.\n\nThe facts and events of the previous twenty-four hours were slowly drawn out of the lady. Her reluctance to hand over the cards, so their balances could be checked, shed some light on the brain washing and social engineering techniques used on her. They assured they lady that her Social Security account was not frozen, that there were not warrants out for her arrest, and that cocaine had not been discovered in her car.\n\nWhile this vile criminal may have gotten some money out of the lady's account, her inexperience in dealing with gift cards and her lack of knowledge of places of purchase the criminal was trying to lead her to at least allowed her to retain some of her purchased cards that day. An expensive lesson, but one hopefully her declining years will allow her to retain against another incident.\n\nTales such as these appear all the time on Social Media and often they are written off as slight exaggerations.

In 2020, they instead used a PPT attachment to drop a .dotm file. In this case, the .dotm file runs a secondary payload that downloads and decrypts a PNG file. The PNG file is responsible for running PowerShell commands that interact with the Microsoft Graph API for further actions.

The backdoor uses DNS queries to a DNS server under the control of the attackers and the server's responses provide commands for the backdoor to carry out. In the campaign observed by Zscaler, the backdoor is delivered via a malicious Word document that uses the AutoOpen() and AutoClose() functions to drop the embedded backdoor onto the system. The backdoor, named \"DnsSystem\" is also copied to the system's startup folder to achieve persistence."

According to Zimperium zLabs, PhoneSpy is disguised as various Korean language apps, some 23 of the fake apps have been observed by zLabs. Only a few of the simpler apps actually provided any of the apps advertised functionality with most simply being a facade. Unusually, the Trojanized apps have not been observed in the Play store, or in third-party app stores. This suggests the actors behind the campaign rely on techniques such as social engineering or web traffic redirection to infect their victims. Once one of the malicious apps has been installed it will request significant permissions and then open a fake login page for a well-known South Korean messaging app named Kakao Talk. Through single sign-on, Kakao credentials can be used to log into other South Korean services. The app can also deliver fake login pages for Facebook, Google, and Instagram. Aside from the aforementioned phishing, PhoneSpy can also list the apps installed on the device, steal documents, images, contacts, call logs, and SMS messages. It can also take photos and record real-time video and audio using the device's camera, and provide the PhoneSpy operators with the device's GPS location, and remote control of the device.",

The researchers also noted that the new variant uses an official ESET executable to hide ArguePatch and further evade detection."

The attack uses S4U2self and S4U2proxy, which are added as AD Kerberos protocol extensions. This allows the attack to gain access to the service ticket of the target. The forwardable flag in the ticket is set to 1. The ticket is used in the S4U2proxy to obtain the service ticket for the targeted user to the targeted service. With the ticket obtained, impersonation can be used, requests can be sent to the service, and requests processed by the user's authority. This exploit bypasses Kerberos delegation, thus allowing the attacker to escalate privilege. This, then, allows the requests to proceed under the escalated authority. Microsoft is releasing a two-stage rollout. The first was released on December 8, 2020. The second is a forced enforcement on February 9, 2020.

The attack uses S4U2self and S4U2proxy, which are added as AD Kerberos protocol extensions. This allows the attack to gain access to the service ticket of the target. The forwardable flag in the ticket is set to 1. The ticket is used in the S4U2proxy to obtain the service ticket for the targeted user to the targeted service. With the ticket obtained, impersonation can be used, requests can be sent to the service, and requests processed by the user's authority. This exploit bypasses Kerberos delegation, thus allowing the attacker to escalate privilege. This, then, allows the requests to proceed under the escalated authority. Microsoft is releasing a two-stage rollout. The first was released on December 8, 2020. The second is a forced enforcement on February 9, 2020. Microsoft did release an out-of-band update to fix Kerberos authentication issues. Mitigation suggestions were released the week after CVE-2020-17049 was released. We and Microsoft recommend immediately patch all systems affected by this vulnerability."

Countries affected include India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. StealthVector is a shellcode loader designed to be configurable for the threat actor's needs including disabling Event Tracing for Windows allowing for stealth mode execution. StealthMutant uses AES-256-ECB for decryption, whereas an earlier version uses XOR. This allows StealthMutant to perform process hollowing for execution remotely. ScrambleCross is a newly discovered backdoor. Instructions are received from a C2 server that allows it to receive and change plug-ins. The researchers have yet to obtain a plug-in to study.

      "overview": "FireEye has discovered a new sophisticated second-stage backdoor that is possibly connected to UNC2452, the same group believed to be behind the attacks against SolarWinds. Microsoft refers to the group as NOBELIUM. One notable feature available in this malware is the option to use decoy network traffic by mixing legitimate traffic with C2 queries. The initial vector used to deploy this backdoor has not yet been determined, but it's suspected to be a second-stage backdoor dropped after an initial compromise. FireEye has named the malware as SUNSHUTTLE, Microsoft named it GoldMax. The backdoor is capable of remotely updating its configuration, file upload/download, and arbitrary command execution."

    "instruction": "Given the description:\nA new RAT has been observed by Cybereason's Nocturnus team. The RAT, PyVil RAT is being distributed by the cyber group, Evilnum. The group has been active for at least the past two years using a variety of tools. The group has historically targeted the Financial Technology industry and uses the Know Your Customer procedure to begin infection. Included in the new malware are deviations from the infection chain, persistence, infrastructure, and tools observed including modified, legitimate executables, a multi-process delivery of the payload, and the PyVil RAT. The new infection chain begins with spearphishing emails with attached ZIP archives containing LNK files, which drop a JavaScript Trojan. The attached files masquerade as utility bills, credit card photos, and driver license photos. Upon execution, a JavaScript file is written and executed which, in turn, replaces the LNK file with a PDF. This JavaScript is merely a dropper and has no C2 communication capabilities. This is but the first step in the new infection chain that culminates with the delivery of the PyVil RAT. After the PDF is placed, the JS file is copied which leads to the execution of ddpp.exe embedded in the LNK file. A registry key is entered for persistence and a scheduled task is created. The scheduled task is responsible for retrieving payloads. The executable ddpp.exe is a Java Web Start Launcher that has been trojanized to execute malicious code. The functionality of ddpp.exe is that of a downloader for next stage infection. From this point, shellcode is unpacked and connects to a C2 using a GET request. The malware downloads another encrypted executable, saved as fplayer.exe, which is then executed with a new scheduled task. This downloaded executable acts as an additional downloader. The payload is loaded into memory and is a fileless RAT. Again, at this point, the file is executed with a scheduled task named \"Adobe Update Task.\" Several arguments are executed with this EXE file. This particular file appears to be a trojanized version of \"Stereoscopic 3D driver Installer.\" When this file is executed, further shellcode is unpacked and connects to the C2 via a GET request. A final payload is received, which is the PyVil RAT. This RAT is heavily obfuscated to prevent decompiling the payload. The RAT has several functions such as: keylogger, running cmd commands, taking screenshots, obtaining more Python scripts, dropping and unloading executables among others. C2 communications are accomplished by POST HTTP requests and are RC4 encrypted with hardcoded keys. The C2 domain changes frequently but appears to resolve to the same three IP addresses.\n\nTo which threat report this description is related to?",

Operating continuously since 2007, Gozi has infected millions of machines and done untold damage to all types of industries and users. At its core, Gozi variants carry similar traits across the board. Some of the similarities between versions are strings contained within the binary's .bss section, man-in-the-browser attack, specific C2 check-in format, obfuscation of the C2 check-in, keylogging, email, FTP, IM accounts data and certificate grabbing, among others. Some of the specific strains carry differences that could easily be overlooked as most of the functionality of the RAT remains the same across the board. Goziat, an older variant, makes use of built-in Windows utilities and uses a different resource directory instead of the standard \"images\" directory. This can be configured during the build phase. Additionally, this variant typically targets .at top-level domains. Another variant, Gozi2RM3 or Gozi IAP2.0, has changes to the C2 structure. Communication is set in two stages. Stage 1 contains a hardcoded C2 in the initial infection binary. An ISP/geolocation deny list is also employed to pre-filter connections that could be researchers. Once the first stage is passed, the second stage pushes the main payload and true configuration. There appears to be a connection between Goziat and Gozi2RM3. Both variants use additional encryption steps by adding a serpent key in addition to the server's RSA key. Goziv3 RM3 targets mostly Australia, Italy, and the U.S. Some significant differences between this version include the use of a PX format, WD structure as opposed to Joined Resources (JJ), a word list is kept in one of the WD structs for generation of registry key names, the use of forfiles.exe for APC injection, and the communications method uses the request body instead of the URI for check-in. As with Gozi2RM3, a geofencing solution is in place. This particular variant has been bundled with a loader used by Emotet and Dridex. There are several variants of Gozi which have become unused. These include Dreambot, Saigon, and ISFB3/Ursnif-A. It's easy to mistake one strain of Gozi for another; however, with the differences pointed out, triage and analysis should help to identify which strain of malware is presented.",

Stage 1 contains a hardcoded C2 in the initial infection binary. An ISP/geolocation deny list is also employed to pre-filter connections that could be researchers. Once the first stage is passed, the second stage pushes the main payload and true configuration. There appears to be a connection between Goziat and Gozi2RM3. Both variants use additional encryption steps by adding a serpent key in addition to the server's RSA key. Goziv3 RM3 targets mostly Australia, Italy, and the U.S. Some significant differences between this version include the use of a PX format, WD structure as opposed to Joined Resources (JJ), a word list is kept in one of the WD structs for generation of registry key names, the use of forfiles.exe for APC injection, and the communications method uses the request body instead of the URI for check-in. As with Gozi2RM3, a geofencing solution is in place. This particular variant has been bundled with a loader used by Emotet and Dridex. There are several variants of Gozi which have become unused. These include Dreambot, Saigon, and ISFB3/Ursnif-A. It's easy to mistake one strain of Gozi for another; however, with the differences pointed out, triage and analysis should help to identify which strain of malware is presented."

A number of apps that used various versions of the Tencent Legu packer to hide their malicious code were discovered on the Play store by the White Ops Satori Threat Intelligence and Research Team. The number of apps discovered exceeded 240 and collectively the apps were downloaded some 14 million times and at peak, the apps generated some 15 million ad impressions, per day. The apps were mainly based on Nintendo (NES) emulators which the authors of the malicious apps obtained from legitimate sources. The ads delivered to the users were made to appear to come from applications and social media platforms such as Youtube and Chrome. The apps tracked the device's screen on and off times in an effort to deliver ads when the user was more likely to see them. Once an app had contacted its C&C server, an ad would be displayed around every 10 minutes. The C&C server located by the White Ops team was running on what appears to be a legitimate, but compromised server. The malicious apps discovered by White Ops have been removed from the Play store."

This allows them to track who is detonating the malicious code, and see which social engineering techniques are more effective."

However, infrastructure and TTP overlaps allow for attribution to the APT. These targets received COVID-19 themed phishing emails with weaponsized RTF documents. An RTF exploit is used to drop a WMF file, which, in turn, drops and installs the Sepulcher malware. The WMF file is also responsible for setting up persistence via a scheduled task. The second campaign was aimed towards the group's more common target, the Tibetan community. Once again, infrastructure and TTPs from older TA413 campaigns were leveraged in this campaign. The initial attachment, however, was a malicious PPTX attachment that downloads the Sepulcher malware from a remote server and executes it. Upon execution, the Sepulcher malware reaches out to its C2 server, which is defined in a configuration saved to the Registry. After initial communication is established, Sepulcher provides basic RAT functionality to the operator. This includes capabilities such as file operations, reconnaissance, spawning a shell, and interacting with services and processes."

The bundle drops three files: the legitimate VPN installer, a malicious downloader, and a VBS script. The VBS script is responsible for executing both the legitimate installer and the downloader. While the installer is distracting the user from any malicious activity, the downloader obtains the backdoor payload from a remote website. The downloaded file is an encrypted JPG file. After decryption, a backdoor executable is revealed. This backdoor contains basic functionality including downloading, executing, and updating files, taking screenshots, and gathering system information."

It was found that the initial phishing email was targeted at a single individual in the business with an interview request. There was some back-and-forth with the threat group to gain trust before being sent the malicious payload."

By sending the lure as a shared document via DocuSign, security controls will recognize the sender and link within the body as legitimate. The messaging used alongside the share link spoofs a legitimate person and company and references a proposed document. Visiting the link leads to a DocuSign file with an embedded link to supposedly view the document via Adobe Document Cloud. The link uses a shortened URL to redirect users to the final landing page. From here, email credentials are requested and any entered data is exfiltrated to the attacker."

In this case certutil was used to decode a file named Roccia.xltm to Fu.mp4, which is, in reality, an SFX CAB archive that contains four other files. A setup routine was executed that checks for various conditions that, if met, will exit. Eventually, the routine leads to the spawning of a process-hollowed copy of nslookup.exe, which is what triggered the researchers interest. The hollowed nslookup.exe is used to obtain the payload, which was determined to be an information stealer that compresses and uploads any information obtained to the malware's C&C server. It was discovered that the whole process had commenced when a user executed a file named setup_x86_x64_install.exe."

Since being published, the vulnerability has been upgraded to critical, as it has become clear that authentication is not required to exploit it. There have since been multiple exploits for CVE-2021-22205 published, and it is being actively exploited in the wild. Patches for the GitLab vulnerability have been available for over six months. However, an examination of GitLab instances that are accessible via the internet indicates that a significant proportion are still susceptible. GitLab users should update to the most recent version as soon as possible. Furthermore, GitLab should ideally not be an internet-facing service. Consider putting your GitLab behind a VPN if you need to access it from the internet."

This ransomware family often spreads via email attachments sent to victims enticing them to open the file in order to initiate the infection. The researchers' analysis begins with the JavaScript loader employed by the threat actors. Inside the script is a hex-obfuscated payload that is dropped into the user's %TEMP% folder and subsequently executed. The payload is packed using a .NET packers and employs anti-debugging checks before performing its primary malicious activities. If anti-debugging checks pass, a configuration file is decrypted for use by the malware. Persistence is then established via a JavaScript file in the Startup folder that simply launches the ransomware executable. Plaintext SMTP is used in order to send the decryption key to be used to the attacker's C2 server. This means that if an organization is capturing the contents of outbound emails, the decryption key could be obtained and used without paying the ransom. Finally, Triple DES encryption is performed and a ransom note requesting the victim email the attacker's to pay the ransomware is dropped on the system.",

The first BAT script disables Windows security software, the second decrypts and extracts a binary payload, and the final script performs clean up of all components created during the installation. Analysis of the .NET binary dropped by the second BAT script reveals multiple layers of obfuscation that eventually lead to the final payload, the Raccoon stealer. Hundreds of samples using this methodology for distribution were discovered, with multimedia and security software applications also being spoofed. Alternate final payloads are possibly being distributed by these additional samples."

The family has undergone many versions with its original name being xRAT and now renamed to Quasar. Currently, Quasar is in version 1.4.0.0, released in June 2020, though earlier versions are still in use. The RAT utilizes a custom protocol employing AES and QuickLZ. In the latest version, Protocol Buffer is used instead. Communications are encrypted with TLS 1.2. Version 1.3 contained authentication performed after the client connected to a server. In version 1.4, a TLS handshake is now the authentication method of choice. The configuration of Quasar is hardcoded into the malware and is AES and base64 encrypted. Its decryption key is also hardcoded and executed when needed. APT10 uses Quasar in an updated and custom capacity. DOWNLOAD_URL and PROXY are two values added by the group which allow for customization of proxy servers and other functionality. This version of Quasar uses CFB as its mode during AES encryption. New commands have also been added to this customized variant. DoPlugin and DoPluginResponse are added while the keylogger, seen in non-custom versions, has been removed. New modules are easily added using the DoPlugin command, just as they can be deleted using the DoPluginResponse command. This allows Quasar to become extremely focused in its intent while maintaining its simplicity of use. By utilizing these methods, the attackers are attempting to avoid anti-virus software. Error logs can also be created with this custom variant. Communication to C2 servers is accomplished via XO encoding as opposed to AES and QuickLZ.

The vulnerability in the File Manager plugin has been used by attackers to install webshells. These webshells have been used to then install Kinsing. Kinsing is a malware that runs a cryptominer from H2miner. The vulnerability, CVE-2020-25213, is a file upload vulnerability that allows an attacker to rename a library from a .dist extension to a .php extension. This change allows for direct access to the library. This access can be done through browsing the web server. The flaw allows for the upload of files, which attackers have made use of recently. The attacker uses an HTTP POST request to upload a webshell, named k.php and a command to execute was included in the POST request. The webshell is in plain text and unobfuscated. The curl command was used to download a file named wpf.sh. The shell script was obtained from the C2 server, which was included in the WGET request."

Facebook researchers were able to tie this activity to Don\u2019s Team (also known as Defense of Nation) and the Crime Research and Analysis Foundation (CRAF), two non-profit organizations in the region. In collaboration, they would report target pages and accounts to Facebook in an attempt to have Facebook block them. In other cases, hacked accounts were used to spread content related to their operational purposes. Finally, one occasion involved hacking a page admin's account, removing the rest of the admins, and disabling the page. The researchers believe that the hacking of the accounts took place through email/device compromise or abuse of account recovery processes. Facebook took action by disabling all accounts and pages found to be behind this activity. The second threat group reported on in this blog post is APT32, a Vietnamese APT.

Emotet abuses WMI's indirect command execution process to invoke PowerShell to run its scripts instead of directly invoking PowerShell. This action may be less suspicious and more apt to be overlooked during inspection of the system. sLoad, a PowerShell downloader, hooks into WMI's system information discovery procedures for reconnaissance purposes to uncover system information and possible shares. Additional examples of WMI's abuse are provided in this informative, technical whitepaper."

Most recently, the groups have moved to almost exclusively targeting the U.S. The two groups, Nephos7 and eGobbler, have used similar TTPs in the campaigns such as the use of commercial ad servers to hide code, reverse proxies, JavaScript APIs, and WebGL-based fingerprinting. By the end of 2019, both groups had aligned patterns with large attacks in late-December 2019. In June 2020, both groups had switched focus to the U.S. The malvertising pages for both groups are very much similar in appearance. Beyond these similarities, there is no infrastructure overlap. Both groups use an .msi file with a signed installer dubbed Holcus Installer. Features of the installer include C2 server communications over HTTPS, RC4-type algorithms, PUA detection within Windows Defender, downloading and executing payloads, and communications with known C2 servers. Nephos7 was the largest digital marketer in Europe on May 24, 2020. Each group targets Windows-based machines and excludes Mac OS X.

The code in the landing page is obfuscated, uses geolocation to reject IP addresses that are not in the targeted region and delivers them a fake 404 error page, and uses user-agent checks to differentiate between iOS and Android devices. Significant updates have been made to the loader used to deliver Wroba. It has been rewritten from Java to use the Kotlin language and uses multiple stages to deliver the payload. Additions to the Wroba payload include the ability to display phishing pages to victims in French or German and additional backdoor commands."

Cetus then disguises the cryptominer with what looks like a legitimate name but is not a genuine binary. Using Masscan, Cetus scans subnets for Docker daemons. Upon discovery of an unsecured daemon, the worm spreads by sending requests to REST API. It accomplishes this by using Docker's CLI. The worm updates its repositories, restarts the container, and runs Cetus again. There are no anti-debugging or obfuscation techniques employed making the worm easy to reverse engineer. There are only two main functions of Cetus, miner_start and scan_start. From there, XMRig is run and utilizes the machine's CPU to mine Monero. One interesting note is that Cetus picks a random name from a list and assigns a corresponding name from another list. The names are applied to the container and Cetus runs the miner using the new name as an argument.

Specifically, cmd.exe is invoked to run mshta.exe, which in turn executes a remotely hosted HTA code. Ultimately Emotet is installed with the purpose of infecting a host with a secondary payload, such as Cobalt Strike or Trickbot."

Lemon Duck Miner, first identified in 2019, is written in Python and utilizes code from various open-source projects. It showed an increase in infections in 2020. The malware spreads rapidly and uses the resources of infected machines to mine cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency miners are different from ransomware in that the infected machines are used for their resources to mine cryptocurrency which can cause slow running systems, crashes, and productivity issues."

Also analyzed is the binary used to carry out denial of service attacks against remote targets. Another script is used to check if the attacker has root privileges and if so, runs the ulimit command to increase resources such as the maximum number of processes available to the attacker.",
