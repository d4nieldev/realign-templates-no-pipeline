      "answer": "Cisco devices use IOS, and they have the ability to accept ssh connections. Nessus is an ssh client and can perform scans externally as well as by logging in, if the credentials are supplied. It makes no difference if there is an ssh client installed on the server it is being run from."

      "question": "\"Incompatible saved desktop has been ignored\" in IDA\nWhen I launch IDA for the first time, I move my windows to reflect my perfect window setup. Then I save the desktop and set it as default, plus I additionally save a named backup.\nAfter this, I close IDA, launch it again, and everything works.\nHowever, after some time (days-weeks) I get message: \"incompatible saved desktop has been ignored\" and my desktop is completely reset to default. Restoring the desktop from the backup results in the same message. This has already happened a couple of times and each time it was very annoying. What is the reason for this behavior and how can I keep my desktop?",
      "answer": "This message is shown if a user changes screen resolution between IDA restarts, which happens particularly often when using IDA inside a virtual machine (which gets arbitrary resolution unless it's launched fullscreen). So to keep the desktop, make sure to maintain the same screen resolution when launching IDA.\nI haven't tested if the default desktop is overwritten as soon as IDA starts with different resolution than previous session. Having a named backup for this scenario certainly won't hurt."

Although they are not supposed to, they will bring their laptops and phones in and use the network. One of them will get the password, and it travels like wildfire throughout the school. It is sometimes as simple as writing it on a wall where the rest of the students can get the updated password.\nWhat can we do to keep them out of the network? I'm considering entering MAC addresses, but that's very labourious, and still not a guarantee of success if they spoof the address.\nDo any of you have any suggestions?\nSome background:\nThere are four routers in a 50-year-old building (plenty of concrete walls). One router downstairs, and three upstairs. They are different brands and models (Netgear, Asus, Acer, D-Link) so no central administration.\nThe school has about 30 Chromebooks and a similar number of iPads. Teachers will use their own laptops (a mix of Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8 as well as a number of Mac OS X).\nSome of the teachers are not at all comfortable with technology and will leave the room with their machines accessible to the students. The teachers will often leave their password off or even give it to the students when they need help. They will ask for help from the students when setting up a projector for example and leave them to it, there goes the security once again.

      "question": "Trying to keep high school students out of the Wi-Fi network\nI'm a teacher and IT person at a small K-12 school.\nThe students are not supposed to have phones, laptops or access to the network. However, students being students they will try to find a way around the rules.\nThe students manage to acquire the Wi-Fi passwords pretty much as soon as we change them. It becomes a game to them. Although they are not supposed to, they will bring their laptops and phones in and use the network. One of them will get the password, and it travels like wildfire throughout the school. It is sometimes as simple as writing it on a wall where the rest of the students can get the updated password.\nWhat can we do to keep them out of the network? I'm considering entering MAC addresses, but that's very labourious, and still not a guarantee of success if they spoof the address.\nDo any of you have any suggestions?\nSome background:\nThere are four routers in a 50-year-old building (plenty of concrete walls). One router downstairs, and three upstairs. They are different brands and models (Netgear, Asus, Acer, D-Link) so no central administration.\nThe school has about 30 Chromebooks and a similar number of iPads. Teachers will use their own laptops (a mix of Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8 as well as a number of Mac OS X).\nSome of the teachers are not at all comfortable with technology and will leave the room with their machines accessible to the students. The teachers will often leave their password off or even give it to the students when they need help. They will ask for help from the students when setting up a projector for example and leave them to it, there goes the security once again. No sooner that the teacher is out of the room than they'll go to the taskbar and look at the properties of the Wi-Fi router to get the password.",

    "context": "",
    "output": " A: This is where an understanding of the OSI model is useful: the different types of encryptions happen at different layers of communication.\nWiFi encryption protects all communication from your device from the local network (i.e. your coffee shop's network), but not anything past the local network (i.e. the rest of the Internet). WiFi encryption is 'optional', but set up by the WiFi network (not optional as a user).\nSSL encryption protects the individual connections you make with the individual destinations (i.e. connections to websites). This also protects specific communication from your device from the local network, but it also protects it all the way to the destination (some exceptions apply). \nHere's the problem: you do not always have control over what connections are being sent out by your device. Without the local network protections (i.e. WiFi encryption) you expose all of that to anyone listening. \nSo, the best idea is to use both the network encryption (Wifi) and SSL encryption wherever possible. You do not have as many options as you think, and you do not have as much control over what is sent out by your device than you think.",

The technologies used are wep, wpa, wpa2.\nThe second encryption, SSL, has nothing to do with wifi.\n\nTo my understanding, both encryptions are optional. So my questions are:\n\nWhat is the difference between these two data encryptions?\nDo I need to have both? \nWhy can't I just use SSL encryption for securing the wifi connection?",
      "answer": "This is where an understanding of the OSI model is useful: the different types of encryptions happen at different layers of communication.\nWiFi encryption protects all communication from your device from the local network (i.e. your coffee shop's network), but not anything past the local network (i.e. the rest of the Internet). WiFi encryption is 'optional', but set up by the WiFi network (not optional as a user).\nSSL encryption protects the individual connections you make with the individual destinations (i.e. connections to websites). This also protects specific communication from your device from the local network, but it also protects it all the way to the destination (some exceptions apply). \nHere's the problem: you do not always have control over what connections are being sent out by your device. Without the local network protections (i.e. WiFi encryption) you expose all of that to anyone listening. \nSo, the best idea is to use both the network encryption (Wifi) and SSL encryption wherever possible. You do not have as many options as you think, and you do not have as much control over what is sent out by your device than you think."

The short one goes something like this:\nMost of the exposures (of usernames and passwords) we see are not targeted attacks against an individual, but they can result in an individual's credentials being exposed. A password manager helps to limit the impact on a single user by allowing them to use different passwords across all websites they access, while minimising the risk that they will forget them.\nFrom my experience, people who oppose the use of a password manager are afraid of a targeted attack against themselves, rather than the opportunistic attacks I described - but they are correct: if someone gets access to their password repository, it's game over.\nNow, there's a \"right\" and a \"wrong\" way to use password managers. Here are some tips:\n\nMake sure you do your research before choosing which password manager you want to use: you want to ensure that you know where your data is being stored and how it is being encrypted. You also want to make sure you're using a reputable product.\nMake sure your master password is sufficently complex. Whether you choose to use a secure passphrase or a complex password, you want to make sure it is strong enough to protect your database. If somebody guesses your password (or manages to crack it), all of your passwords are exposed.\nNever access your password database from a public computer. And, if you have to, change your master password (from a private computer) afterwards. Public computers may have keyloggers, and all kinds of other fun things which may expose your master password. Even worse, if your database is an offline database (e.g. KeePass) you're not actually deleting it from the disk when you send it to the recycle bin.\nMake sure that your private computer has adequate anti-virus/malware protection. Same logic as number three: you don't want to give people access to your master password under any circumstances.\nUse multi-step authentication whenever possible. Most popular email providers offer this now, and it's a great way to minimise the likelihood of your account being accessed, even if someone does discover your 128 character password.\n\nLastly, my personal preference is to avoid any \"public\" online password managers (e.g. LastPass). I don't mind password databases being online (e.g. putting your KeePass database in Dropbox - not that I do this), because this would take a targeted attack for somebody to find your passwords. But, I'm sure attackers would love to get their hands on the database of one of these service providers - for no other reason than to say that they did.

It will not hinder any attacker specifically targeting the website not even a bit, although it will force him to take actions that will possibly hit some IDS.

      "question": "How do I remove my website from the malware database?\nI have a website which is basically a service platform. As far as I know there is no malware in my website (at least not found according to these free scanners). However, Check Point malware database definition is blocking requests to my website because it is somehow detecting a malware, whose details is something like this: \n\nConnection to IP associated by DNS trap with malicious domain. See\n  sk74060 for more information.\n\nScreenshot:\n\nAs far as I understand, my website is being detected falsely (a false positive). How do I circumvent this?",
      "answer": "Your website www.sheba.xyz is hosted on a shared system together with lots of others. This means that all use the same IP address, 166.62.28.88. Unfortunately, not all of the sites on this IP address play nice, which means that this IP address got reported as a cause of trouble. \nUnfortunately it is not only Checkpoint which reports this site as bad, but several others too; see report from cymon. There in the timeline you can also see why the IP address got put on the blacklists; namely because it was used as a target of phishing and a distribution point for malware on several domains hosted at this IP address.\nWhich means that the best way to deal with the problem is to talk to your hosting provider so that the bad sites get removed. If this does not help, change your hosting provider to one which cares more (and maybe costs more)."

      "question": "How can an administrator secure against a 0day before patches are available?\nI'm working on a thesis about the security hacker community.\nWhen a 0day is published, how can an administrator secure his application/website between the time the 0day is published and the patch is developed ?\nMoreover, most of the time, this same 0day is used for months by blackhats, so are the blackhats ahead of whitehats ?",
      "answer": "The person who discovers a security issue often reports it to the software vendor or developer first. This gives the software vendor time to fix the issue before publication. Then, after it is fixed, the bug is publicly disclosed. This process is called responsible disclosure.\nSometimes, someone doesn't disclose the zero-day to the software vendor but uses it to hack other systems. Doing this can tip off security companies and disclose the bug, burning the zero-day.\nI don't think your statement \"most of the time, this same 0day is used for months by black hats\" is true. This is true for some security issues, but a lot of zero-day bugs are found for the first time by white-hat hackers. I wouldn't say black hat hackers are ahead of white hat hackers. They both find security issues and some of these overlap.

These ports have very rare services running therefore OpenVAS did not ask questions for those specific and not usual protocols.

      "question": "Why OpenVAS does not find all open ports compared to Nmap?\nI recently launched a system discovery scan with OpenVAS to an IP from my net to compare its results to Nmap. As you can see in the image OpenVAS does not find all the ports Nmap does.\n\nBoth scans were all TCP ports scans. Also, both tools are installed in the same Ubuntu machine inside the same net as the scanned IP.\nWhy does this happen?",
      "answer": "After studying and analyzing data from packet captures of both scans I discovered the answer. Apparently, OpenVAS works this way:\n1) TCP 3way handshake on port\n2) OpenVAS asks different famous protocol questions (HTTP, telnet, etc.) to get an answer with data (banners). \n3) If it does get answers, it will create a report with all that data and say its open.\n3)If it does not get an answer for them, OpenVAS will say its closed as he cannot give further data about the service the port is running.\nSo, what happened with ports 27000, 49154, 50095? These ports have very rare services running therefore OpenVAS did not ask questions for those specific and not usual protocols. As a result OpenVAS did not get answers and gave those ports as closed. \nOn the other hand Nmap just needs a succesful 3way handshake to give a port as open and like OpenVAS, Nmap did get 3way handshake for all those ports and did not try to get further data.\nI hope I explained myself well enough. Thank you all for your help and advice."

Usually, the script embedded in this way only contains a callback and in this way transfers the JSON payload that I'm interested in. However, AFAIK the called JSON-P service could also deliver arbitrary JavaScript and in this way hijack my webpage.\nI'm wondering if I really have to trust the JSON-P service provider not to do this? Or do JavaScript libraries and/or browsers sanitize the JSON-P responses and in this way prevent these kind of attacks?\nFor example for the JQuery ajax function, the use of JSON-P is enabled by setting the rather harmlessly looking attribute dataType: 'jsonp' - so maybe these kind of calls are not as bad as I think they are?",

Usually, the script embedded in this way only contains a callback and in this way transfers the JSON payload that I'm interested in. However, AFAIK the called JSON-P service could also deliver arbitrary JavaScript and in this way hijack my webpage.\nI'm wondering if I really have to trust the JSON-P service provider not to do this? Or do JavaScript libraries and/or browsers sanitize the JSON-P responses and in this way prevent these kind of attacks?\nFor example for the JQuery ajax function, the use of JSON-P is enabled by setting the rather harmlessly looking attribute dataType: 'jsonp' - so maybe these kind of calls are not as bad as I think they are?",
      "answer": "No it is not safe. You are correct that the JSONP service could deliver arbitrary JavaScript, which is then executed as part of your site.\nBecause JSONP is essentially a hack to get around the same origin policy, it is not possible for a JavaScript framework to perform sanitisation.\nThese days, CORS is the preferred way to call external sites. An alternative approach is to have a server-side script on your site that proxies calls to external sites."

      "answer": "HTTPS Everywhere is client-side, and HSTS is server-side. \nSo the answer is that HTTPS Everywhere is to defend in cases where the server does not set an HSTS header."

I mean, if Gmail is not secure enough, then what's the point of sending an email to Gmail from ProtonMail instead of just keep using Gmail (given that it has extra features)?\n\nYeah, once you send the message outside of the protonmail ecosystem it's only as secure as the least secure link. It's likley that protonmail uses TLS to communicate with gmail, and again, gmail's pretty darn safe.\nHowever, if you had sent the messages to yahoo in the past, then the NSA had a tap on yahoo's network, and that would not have been very safe, unless you don\u2019t care if the NSA reads your mail.\nIf you sent the message to Hillary Clinton's basement email server, then the cleaning lady could have taken the hard drive. That's not very safe.\nThen again, if you sync your email to your personal device, or your computer is compromised, then your proton mail is also compromised.\nMaybe use signal on your phone for really really sensitive messages, and gmail with two factor for the rest."
