Typically, reserved bits are used for future capabilities and should not support any functional logic in the design. However, designers might covertly use these bits to debug or further develop new capabilities in production hardware. Adversaries with access to these bits will write to them in hopes of compromising hardware state.\n\nWeakness name: Improper Restriction of Security Token Assignment\nWeakness description: The System-On-A-Chip (SoC) implements a Security Token mechanism to differentiate what actions are allowed or disallowed when a transaction originates from an entity. However, the Security Tokens are improperly protected.\n\nWeakness name: Policy Uses Obsolete Encoding\nWeakness description: The product uses an obsolete encoding mechanism to implement access controls.\n\nWeakness name: Generation of Incorrect Security Tokens\nWeakness description: The product implements a Security Token mechanism to differentiate what actions are allowed or disallowed when a transaction originates from an entity.

A transaction is sent without a security identifier.\n\nWeakness name: Hardware Allows Activation of Test or Debug Logic at Runtime\nWeakness description: During runtime, the hardware allows for test or debug logic (feature) to be activated, which allows for changing the state of the hardware. This feature can alter the intended behavior of the system and allow for alteration and leakage of sensitive data by an adversary.\n\n",
