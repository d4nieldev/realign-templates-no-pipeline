      "answer": "In order to detect attempts where the Rubeus tool might be trying to get a handle to the Local Security Authority (LSA) system process which is a potential indicator of credential theft or Kerberos ticket manipulation, you should: Monitor Windows Security logs for event ID 4673 with a service name indicating a call to 'LsaRegisterLogonProcess()' and specifically look for events marked with failure keywords '0x8010000000000000'. This activity is critical to track as it signifies an application's attempt to verify itself as a logon process, a privilege that should be closely guarded. Such occurrences could potentially be misuse attempts by tools like Rubeus to manipulate authentication processes. It is important to note that the actual intentions behind triggering this event might not always be malicious, and thus, observed incidents could occasionally lead to false positives with unspecified origins. The detection of this behavior is highly relevant for security teams and falls under tactics and techniques associated with credential access and manipulation."

      "answer": "In order to detect suspicious parent processes of well-known Windows processes, you should monitor the creation of processes on Windows systems, specifically focusing on the inception of critical system processes like svchost.exe, taskhost.exe, lsm.exe, lsass.exe, services.exe, lsaiso.exe, csrss.exe, wininit.exe, and winlogon.exe. It's crucial to examine the parent process of these system processes. If the parent process does not originate from expected system directories like System32 or SysWOW64, or from known security products' executables such as Windows Defender (MsMpEng.exe), Sophos Anti-Virus Service (SavService.exe), or NGen (ngen.exe), the activity may be considered suspicious. This approach aims to identify anomalies in the execution path of Windows critical processes, which could indicate a potential security breach or malicious activity by imitating system processes to remain undetected in the system. Be aware that some legitimate security products might also spawn these processes, which could result in false positives and therefore such occurrences should be carefully investigated to ascertain their legitimacy. This detection strategy is associated with tactics and techniques such as Privilege Escalation and Persistence by exploiting system processes."

      "answer": "In order to detect the use of WinAPI functions in PowerShell scripts, you should focus on monitoring Windows script activity, specifically PowerShell scripts. The detection approach requires Script Block Logging to be enabled. Look for PowerShell script contents that contain any of the following suspicious function calls: 'AddSecurityPackage', 'AdjustTokenPrivileges', 'CloseHandle', 'CreateProcessWithToken', 'CreateRemoteThread', 'CreateThread', 'CreateUserThread', 'DangerousGetHandle', 'DuplicateTokenEx', 'EnumerateSecurityPackages', 'FreeLibrary', 'GetDelegateForFunctionPointer', 'GetLogonSessionData', 'GetModuleHandle', 'GetProcAddress', 'GetProcessHandle', 'GetTokenInformation', 'ImpersonateLoggedOnUser', 'kernel32', 'LoadLibrary', 'memcpy', 'MiniDumpWriteDump', 'msvcrt', 'ntdll', 'OpenDesktop', 'OpenProcess', 'OpenProcessToken', 'OpenThreadToken', 'OpenWindowStation', 'QueueUserApc', 'ReadProcessMemory', 'RevertToSelf', 'RtlCreateUserThread', 'secur32', 'SetThreadToken', 'VirtualAlloc', 'VirtualFree', 'VirtualProtect', 'WaitForSingleObject', 'WriteInt32', 'WriteProcessMemory', and 'ZeroFreeGlobalAllocUnicode'. Note that scripts starting with a specific copyright line related to Amazon.com, Inc., or those that include certain function imports from 'KernelBase.dll' related to Amazon AWS scripts, should be considered as potential legitimate uses and therefore may be excluded from alerts to reduce false positives. Additionally, be aware of other known benign uses, such as the Carbon PowerShell Module, which might also contribute to false positives. This monitoring is crucial as the aforementioned function calls in PowerShell scripts could indicate attempts to abuse Windows APIs for malicious purposes such as privilege escalation, executing code, and other unauthorized actions on the system."

This feature's activation is essential as it allows for the reception of detailed logs about various activities within GitHub that pertain to self-hosted runners.

These actions include the removal of self-hosted runners from the organization, creation, removal, update of runner groups, addition or removal of runners to/from a runner group, updates to the runners in a runner group, registration or removal of self-hosted runners at the repository level.\n\nWhen monitoring for these specific actions, it's critical to collect several pieces of information for a comprehensive understanding of each event. This information includes the action taken, the actor (or user) who performed the action, the organization involved, the country code of the actor's location, the transport protocol used, the repository name, its public status, and the timestamp of the activity. \n\nDespite the system's sensitivity to these actions, it is necessary to consider scenarios that could trigger false positive alerts.

      "answer": "In order to detect changes to self-hosted runners configurations in the environment, you should: Focus on GitHub's audit log data, particularly the logs that can only be obtained if the audit log streaming feature is enabled. This feature's activation is essential as it allows for the reception of detailed logs about various activities within GitHub that pertain to self-hosted runners. Within the scope of GitHub's audit services, attention should be directed towards specific actions that indicate modifications to the self-hosted runners. These actions include the removal of self-hosted runners from the organization, creation, removal, update of runner groups, addition or removal of runners to/from a runner group, updates to the runners in a runner group, registration or removal of self-hosted runners at the repository level.\n\nWhen monitoring for these specific actions, it's critical to collect several pieces of information for a comprehensive understanding of each event. This information includes the action taken, the actor (or user) who performed the action, the organization involved, the country code of the actor's location, the transport protocol used, the repository name, its public status, and the timestamp of the activity. \n\nDespite the system's sensitivity to these actions, it is necessary to consider scenarios that could trigger false positive alerts. These include legitimate changes allowed in the self-hosted runners' configurations, cases where a self-hosted runner is automatically removed by GitHub due to inactivity beyond GitHub Actions' connection threshold of 14 days, or an ephemeral self-hosted runner removed after not connecting to GitHub Actions for more than 1 day.\n\nAs these configuration changes might not provide complete context through log entries alone, further validation from the GitHub UI is advised. This ensures that any detected changes are accurately interpreted in the real-world context of your environment's operations and security policies."

      "answer": "In order to detect execution of the \"mofcomp\" utility as a child of a suspicious shell or script running utility or by having a suspicious path in the command line, you should monitor process creation logs within the Windows operating system. Look for instances where the \"mofcomp.exe\" utility is executed. This can be identified either by the image name ending with '\\mofcomp.exe' or the original filename being exactly 'mofcomp.exe'. Be especially vigilant if this utility is launched by parent processes known to be used by attackers for command execution, such as 'cmd.exe', 'powershell.exe', 'pwsh.exe', 'wsl.exe', 'wscript.exe', or 'cscript.exe'. Additionally, pay attention to command lines that include suspicious paths like '\\AppData\\Local\\Temp', '\\Users\\Public\\', '\\WINDOWS\\Temp\\', '%temp%', '%tmp%', and '%appdata%'. \n\nHowever, it is essential to exclude legitimate use cases where 'mofcomp' is run as a child of 'WmiPrvSE.exe' with command line paths pointing to 'C:\\Windows\\TEMP\\' and ending in '.mof', as well as instances where parent information is unavailable but the command line criteria match, to minimize false positives.\n\nBy following these guidelines, organizations can more effectively spot malicious attempts to abuse 'mofcomp' for installing harmful MOF scripts, a technique often used in malware deployment and persistence mechanisms."

      "answer": "In order to detect the load of the vulnerable Dell BIOS update driver as reported in CVE-2021-21551, you should focus on monitoring Windows driver load events for specific indicators of compromise. These indicators include the loading of a driver file named '\\DBUtil_2_3.Sys' or the presence of driver files with specific cryptographic hashes. The hashes to watch for are in SHA256, SHA1, and MD5 formats and are explicitly listed due to their association with the vulnerable driver in question. This detection effort is important for identifying potential exploitation of the CVE-2021-21551 vulnerability. It is pivotal to pay attention to false positives which might arise from legitimate BIOS driver updates, though such occurrences should be rare. This vigilance is categorized under a high level of importance due to the security implications of loading a vulnerable driver."

The goal of the Sigma rule above is to detect process command line patterns and locations used by REvil group in Kaseya incident (can also match on other malware)\n\nHere is how  the given sigma rule operates: In order to detect process command line patterns and locations used by the REvil group in the Kaseya incident (which can also match on other malware), you should monitor for specific executable and command line activity within the Windows environment. This involves watching for the creation or invocation of processes that match certain criteria indicative of malicious activity. Particularly, be on the lookout for processes executed from or command lines containing paths and arguments like 'C:\\Windows\\cert.exe', deletion commands targeting 'c:\\kworking\\agent.crt', references to \"Kaseya VSA Agent Hot-fix\", suspicious usage of 'MsMpEng.exe' in the Temp directory, commands aimed at deleting log files within the 'inetpub\\logs' directory or any '*.log' files on the system drive, and processes linked to 'c:\\kworking1\\', such as 'agent.exe' or 'agent.crt'. Additionally, specific combinations of deletion commands and target paths, like those aiming at 'WebPages\\Errors\\webErrorLog.txt', should raise alerts. \n\nMonitoring should cover both the command lines that initiate these processes and the images (executables) themselves. Any match on these patterns should be treated with high suspicion, as they're critical indicators of potential compromise or attack similar to those conducted by the REvil group in past incidents. This vigilance is necessary across all process creation events on Windows systems, especially within enterprise environments where the impact of such malware can be significant. While there is a possibility of false positives, given the critical nature of these indicators, each alert warrants thorough investigation to rule out or confirm malicious activity.",

      "question": "process command line patterns and locations used by REvil group in Kaseya incident (can also match on other malware)",
      "answer": "In order to detect process command line patterns and locations used by the REvil group in the Kaseya incident (which can also match on other malware), you should monitor for specific executable and command line activity within the Windows environment. This involves watching for the creation or invocation of processes that match certain criteria indicative of malicious activity. Particularly, be on the lookout for processes executed from or command lines containing paths and arguments like 'C:\\Windows\\cert.exe', deletion commands targeting 'c:\\kworking\\agent.crt', references to \"Kaseya VSA Agent Hot-fix\", suspicious usage of 'MsMpEng.exe' in the Temp directory, commands aimed at deleting log files within the 'inetpub\\logs' directory or any '*.log' files on the system drive, and processes linked to 'c:\\kworking1\\', such as 'agent.exe' or 'agent.crt'. Additionally, specific combinations of deletion commands and target paths, like those aiming at 'WebPages\\Errors\\webErrorLog.txt', should raise alerts. \n\nMonitoring should cover both the command lines that initiate these processes and the images (executables) themselves. Any match on these patterns should be treated with high suspicion, as they're critical indicators of potential compromise or attack similar to those conducted by the REvil group in past incidents. This vigilance is necessary across all process creation events on Windows systems, especially within enterprise environments where the impact of such malware can be significant. While there is a possibility of false positives, given the critical nature of these indicators, each alert warrants thorough investigation to rule out or confirm malicious activity."

The focus is on command lines containing sequences that either directly call into DLLs with known functionalities for executing code or scripts in a way that might be utilized by attackers to execute malware or scripts without directly invoking an executable file known to security software. Specifically, watch for command lines that include: \n\n- Use of 'javascript:' in conjunction with '.RegisterXLL' suggesting an attempt to register an XLL through JavaScript, potentially for executing arbitrary code.\n- Patterns that involve 'url.dll' with either 'OpenURL', 'OpenURLA', or 'FileProtocolHandler', which might be attempts to open URLs or files in a way that bypasses usual safeguards.\n- Invocation of 'zipfldr.dll' with 'RouteTheCall' which could be an attempt to manipulate ZIP files in a manner not typical for normal user operations.\n- Utilization of 'shell32.dll' with 'Control_RunDLL' or 'ShellExec_RunDLL', indicating an attempt to execute control panel items or shell commands in a potentially malicious context.\n- Calls to 'mshtml.dll' with 'PrintHTML', 'advpack.dll' with 'LaunchINFSection' or 'RegisterOCX', 'ieadvpack.dll' with 'LaunchINFSection' or 'RegisterOCX', 'ieframe.dll' with 'OpenURL', 'shdocvw.dll' with 'OpenURL', all of which can be indicators of attempting to execute or register scripts, ActiveX controls or HTML files in ways that could be leveraged for attack purposes.\n- 'setupapi.dll' with 'InstallHinfSection', 'syssetup.dll' with 'SetupInfObjectInstallAction', among others, are signs of attempting Windows setup actions or installations that may be misused for malicious installations.\n- Also look for execution attempts involving 'dfshim.dll' or 'scrobj.dll' related to application shortcuts, scripting, or HTTP communications that could indicate attempts at remote code execution or downloading and executing malicious scripts.\n\nExclude command lines that are related to legitimate settings adjustments or screensaver configurations, specifically those involving 'shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL desk.cpl,screensaver,@screensaver', or ones starting or ending with paths to control panel settings ('.cpl' files) initiated from 'control.exe'.\n\nThis detection strategy hinges on recognizing patterns in command-line executions that deviate from normal user or system activity, potentially indicating misuse of system tools for malicious purposes.

      "question": "suspicious execution of rundll32, with specific calls to some DLLs with known LOLBIN functionalities",
      "answer": "In order to detect suspicious execution of rundll32, with specific calls to some DLLs with known LOLBIN functionalities, you should monitor the creation of processes on Windows systems for command lines that include specific patterns indicative of leveraging living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBINs). The focus is on command lines containing sequences that either directly call into DLLs with known functionalities for executing code or scripts in a way that might be utilized by attackers to execute malware or scripts without directly invoking an executable file known to security software. Specifically, watch for command lines that include: \n\n- Use of 'javascript:' in conjunction with '.RegisterXLL' suggesting an attempt to register an XLL through JavaScript, potentially for executing arbitrary code.\n- Patterns that involve 'url.dll' with either 'OpenURL', 'OpenURLA', or 'FileProtocolHandler', which might be attempts to open URLs or files in a way that bypasses usual safeguards.\n- Invocation of 'zipfldr.dll' with 'RouteTheCall' which could be an attempt to manipulate ZIP files in a manner not typical for normal user operations.\n- Utilization of 'shell32.dll' with 'Control_RunDLL' or 'ShellExec_RunDLL', indicating an attempt to execute control panel items or shell commands in a potentially malicious context.\n- Calls to 'mshtml.dll' with 'PrintHTML', 'advpack.dll' with 'LaunchINFSection' or 'RegisterOCX', 'ieadvpack.dll' with 'LaunchINFSection' or 'RegisterOCX', 'ieframe.dll' with 'OpenURL', 'shdocvw.dll' with 'OpenURL', all of which can be indicators of attempting to execute or register scripts, ActiveX controls or HTML files in ways that could be leveraged for attack purposes.\n- 'setupapi.dll' with 'InstallHinfSection', 'syssetup.dll' with 'SetupInfObjectInstallAction', among others, are signs of attempting Windows setup actions or installations that may be misused for malicious installations.\n- Also look for execution attempts involving 'dfshim.dll' or 'scrobj.dll' related to application shortcuts, scripting, or HTTP communications that could indicate attempts at remote code execution or downloading and executing malicious scripts.\n\nExclude command lines that are related to legitimate settings adjustments or screensaver configurations, specifically those involving 'shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL desk.cpl,screensaver,@screensaver', or ones starting or ending with paths to control panel settings ('.cpl' files) initiated from 'control.exe'.\n\nThis detection strategy hinges on recognizing patterns in command-line executions that deviate from normal user or system activity, potentially indicating misuse of system tools for malicious purposes. Be aware that false positives can occur, especially in environments where scripts and administrative tools are used in complex ways that mimic these command patterns. The risk level associated with these detections is considered medium, underscoring the need for context and additional investigation when alerts are triggered."

      "question": "when Events are deleted in Azure Kubernetes. An adversary may delete events in Azure Kubernetes in an attempt to evade detection.",
      "answer": "In order to detect when Events are deleted in Azure Kubernetes, an adversary may delete events in Azure Kubernetes in an attempt to evade detection, you should: Monitor Azure activity logs specifically for operations related to the deletion of events within the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Focus on the activity log entries that indicate the operation name `MICROSOFT.KUBERNETES/CONNECTEDCLUSTERS/EVENTS.K8S.IO/EVENTS/DELETE`, as this operation signifies that an event has been deleted from the Kubernetes cluster. It is crucial to investigate such deletions to determine whether they are legitimate administrative actions or potential indicators of malicious behavior aiming to evade detection. Consider that event deletions could be normal activities performed by system or network administrators; therefore, verify the context such as the username, hostname, and the resource name involved in the deletions to ensure they align with expected behaviors in your environment. Suspicious activity would include deletions from unfamiliar users or hosts. In instances where known behaviors are identified as causing false positives, such actions can be filtered out to refine the monitoring process. This approach sets a medium-level importance on tracking and analyzing event deletion activities within Azure Kubernetes environments as part of a broader cybersecurity strategy to detect and mitigate attempts by adversaries to hide their tracks."

However, bear in mind that there may be situations where such activity is flagged without a known justification, classified under 'unknown' false positives. This monitoring is considered to have a medium level of importance in the context of cybersecurity vigilance."

    "output": "Sure! The goal of the Sigma rule above is to detect Commandlet names from well-known PowerShell exploitation frameworks\n\nHere is how  the given sigma rule operates: In order to detect Commandlet names from well-known PowerShell exploitation frameworks, you should focus on monitoring PowerShell module activities within Windows environments. Specifically, look for the execution of payloads known to be associated with various tactics and techniques of cyber attacks, including but not limited to gaining persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, lateral movement, collection, command and control, exfiltration, and impact.\n\nKey detection measures include identifying any usage of specific PowerShell commandlets indicative of suspicious activities. These include, but are not limited to:\n- Adding or modifying backdoors and persistence mechanisms (e.g., `Add-Exfiltration`, `Add-Persistence`, `Add-RegBackdoor`).\n- Disabling or enabling system features or accounts to evade detection or maintain access (e.g., `Disable-ADIDNSNode`, `Enable-MachineAccount`).\n- Executing reconnaissance activities to gather system, network, or user information (e.g., `Check-VM`, `Get-ADIDNS`, `Find-GPOLocation`).\n- Employing encryption and decryption techniques to hide or reveal data (e.g., `ConvertTo-Rc4ByteStream`, `Decrypt-Hash`).\n- Engaging in exfiltration activities to transfer data outside the targeted environment (e.g., `Do-Exfiltration`).\n- Utilizing known exploitation tools and frameworks such as Mimikatz, PowerView, or Invoke-Mimikatz for various malicious purposes like credential theft, lateral movement, or privilege escalation.\n\nMitigation strategies and response measures should be focused on closely monitoring the PowerShell activity logs for occurrences of these highly specific commandlets. It's also crucial to understand the context in which these commandlets are executed, as legitimate use by system administrators may occasionally trigger false positives.\n\nGiven the high level of threat associated with these activities, it is advised to treat any detections with a high level of scrutiny. Investigate the source, purpose, and outcome of the detected commandlet executions to ensure that any malicious activities are promptly identified, isolated, and remediated to maintain the security and integrity of the environment.",

    "output": "Sure! The goal of the Sigma rule above is to detect DLL sideloading of DLLs usually located in system locations (System32, SysWOW64, etc.)\n\nHere is how  the given sigma rule operates: In order to detect DLL sideloading of DLLs usually located in system locations (System32, SysWOW64, etc.), you should monitor Windows image load events for the loading of specific DLL files that typically reside in trusted system directories but are being loaded from unexpected locations. This process involves tracking the loading of a comprehensive list of DLLs, including but not limited to 'shfolder.dll', 'activeds.dll', 'adsldpc.dll', and many others, which are commonly associated with system functions and processes. It is important to apply filters to exclude legitimate loading events from common system directories such as 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\', 'C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\', and others, to minimize false positives. Additionally, pay attention to filters excluding legitimate uses of some DLLs by specific applications, like Office ClickToRun or Dell SupportAssist, as well as certain operations within Azure environments or software from vendors like CheckPoint. This approach aims to spotlight instances where these DLL files might be loaded from irregular locations, a technique often employed by adversaries to execute malicious code by leveraging the trust associated with these system DLLs. Monitoring for such activity with a high level of scrutiny allows for the identification of potential sideloading attempts, which could indicate a breach or an ongoing attack without raising an excessive number of false alarms.",

      "answer": "In order to detect DLL sideloading of DLLs usually located in system locations (System32, SysWOW64, etc.), you should monitor Windows image load events for the loading of specific DLL files that typically reside in trusted system directories but are being loaded from unexpected locations. This process involves tracking the loading of a comprehensive list of DLLs, including but not limited to 'shfolder.dll', 'activeds.dll', 'adsldpc.dll', and many others, which are commonly associated with system functions and processes. It is important to apply filters to exclude legitimate loading events from common system directories such as 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\', 'C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\', and others, to minimize false positives. Additionally, pay attention to filters excluding legitimate uses of some DLLs by specific applications, like Office ClickToRun or Dell SupportAssist, as well as certain operations within Azure environments or software from vendors like CheckPoint. This approach aims to spotlight instances where these DLL files might be loaded from irregular locations, a technique often employed by adversaries to execute malicious code by leveraging the trust associated with these system DLLs. Monitoring for such activity with a high level of scrutiny allows for the identification of potential sideloading attempts, which could indicate a breach or an ongoing attack without raising an excessive number of false alarms."

    "output": "Sure! The goal of the Sigma rule above is to detect Mimikatz DC sync security events\n\nHere is how  the given sigma rule operates: In order to detect Mimikatz DC sync security events, you should monitor for specific activities within the Windows Security event logs. Here's a detailed guide on what to look for:\n\nStart with focusing on events with the ID 4662, which are indicative of attempts to access certain permissions or carry out operations relating to directory services. These entries become especially concerning when they include references to permissions like 'Replicating Directory Changes All' or unique identifiers such as '1131f6ad-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2', '1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2', '9923a32a-3607-11d2-b9be-0000f87a36b2', and '89e95b76-444d-4c62-991a-0facbeda640c'. Additionally, an AccessMask value of '0x100' points towards attempts to query or replicate directory changes, which is a common tactic used in Mimikatz DC sync attacks to harvest credentials and sensitive information.\n\nHowever, not every instance of these event codes and properties necessarily indicates a malicious activity. You must apply certain filters to reduce false positives:\n- Exclude any events generated under the 'Window Manager' domain name, as these are typically benign system activities.\n- Ignore activities initiated by usernames starting with 'NT AUT' or 'MSOL_', as these often represent automated tasks or services.\n- Activities from usernames ending with '$' should also be discounted since these usually signify machine or service accounts performing legitimate operations.\n\nWhile these filters help refine detection, be aware of potential false positives. Legitimate domain controller synchronization activities not covered by the filters or the usage of local domain admin accounts for Azure AD Connect might sometimes trigger an alert.\n\nThe severity level for these detections is high, indicating that each alert warrants a prompt investigation to determine its nature and whether further action is needed to protect against potential credential theft or unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\nThis detection strategy aligns with MITRE ATT&CK tactics related to Credential Access and specifically the technique of Domain Controller replication, highlighting the importance of these logs for identifying sophisticated attack methods aimed at compromising entire domains.",

These entries become especially concerning when they include references to permissions like 'Replicating Directory Changes All' or unique identifiers such as '1131f6ad-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2', '1131f6aa-9c07-11d1-f79f-00c04fc2dcd2', '9923a32a-3607-11d2-b9be-0000f87a36b2', and '89e95b76-444d-4c62-991a-0facbeda640c'. Additionally, an AccessMask value of '0x100' points towards attempts to query or replicate directory changes, which is a common tactic used in Mimikatz DC sync attacks to harvest credentials and sensitive information.\n\nHowever, not every instance of these event codes and properties necessarily indicates a malicious activity. You must apply certain filters to reduce false positives:\n- Exclude any events generated under the 'Window Manager' domain name, as these are typically benign system activities.\n- Ignore activities initiated by usernames starting with 'NT AUT' or 'MSOL_', as these often represent automated tasks or services.\n- Activities from usernames ending with '$' should also be discounted since these usually signify machine or service accounts performing legitimate operations.\n\nWhile these filters help refine detection, be aware of potential false positives. Legitimate domain controller synchronization activities not covered by the filters or the usage of local domain admin accounts for Azure AD Connect might sometimes trigger an alert.\n\nThe severity level for these detections is high, indicating that each alert warrants a prompt investigation to determine its nature and whether further action is needed to protect against potential credential theft or unauthorized access to sensitive data.\n\nThis detection strategy aligns with MITRE ATT&CK tactics related to Credential Access and specifically the technique of Domain Controller replication, highlighting the importance of these logs for identifying sophisticated attack methods aimed at compromising entire domains."

The rule applies to Windows environments, focusing on capturing the initiation of processes that could indicate an attempt to query local system groups. Keep in mind, the detection confidence is considered low, indicating there might be cases where legitimate use of these commands triggers an alert."

The goal of the Sigma rule above is to detect Detect malicious GPO modifications can be used to implement many other malicious behaviors.\n\nHere is how  the given sigma rule operates: In order to detect malicious GPO modifications that can be used to implement many other malicious behaviors, you should focus on monitoring certain activities on Windows operating systems, specifically looking for process creation events. Here\u2019s how attackers might try to carry out this type of attack and what you should look for to detect such behavior:\n\n1. **Monitor for Registry Editing Tools**: Look for the execution of the registry editing tool `reg.exe` by observing if any process creation events end with the path `\\reg.exe` or have the original filename `reg.exe`. This tool is commonly used for direct manipulation of the registry, which can be a tactic to alter Group Policy Objects (GPOs).\n\n2. **Watch for Specific Command-Line Use**: Pay close attention to the command-line arguments used with `reg.exe`. Malicious changes might involve command lines that contain paths pointing to `\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System`. Such paths are significant because they directly relate to Windows system policies which could be manipulated by attackers to enforce malicious policies.\n\n3. **Identify Suspicious GPO Key Modifications**: Be alert to specific registry keys being targeted for modification through command-line arguments. These include keys related to the group policy refresh rates (`GroupPolicyRefreshTimeDC`, `GroupPolicyRefreshTimeOffsetDC`, `GroupPolicyRefreshTime`, `GroupPolicyRefreshTimeOffset`) and keys related to the configuration of Windows Defender SmartScreen (`EnableSmartScreen`, `ShellSmartScreenLevel`). Manipulation of these could indicate attempts to weaken system defenses or alter how policies are refreshed, potentially giving attackers more control or stealth.\n\nThis detection process focuses on spotting alterations that may be legitimate under certain circumstances but could also signify abuse if done with malicious intent. Because of this, it is important to consider the context in which these modifications occur. Activities such as program installations or system updates by administrators could trigger similar patterns but are legitimate. Therefore, any detection should be carefully analyzed to rule out false positives. This approach falls under medium-level vigilance due to the balance between potential malicious activity detection and the likelihood of legitimate use. \n\nIn monitoring these specific aspects related to process creation events and command-line parameters, the goal is to protect against attackers who attempt to misuse GPO modifications, an approach that aligns with understanding tactics and techniques associated with such threats.",

The goal of the Sigma rule above is to detect remote execution via scheduled task creation or update on the destination host\n\nHere is how  the given sigma rule operates: In order to detect remote execution via scheduled task creation or update on the destination host, you should monitor Windows security logs for specific event IDs that indicate a successful account logon event (Event ID 4624) with Logon Type 3 (network logon), as well as the creation or update of scheduled tasks (Event IDs 4698 and 4702). It\u2019s crucial to filter out any events that originate from the loopback address (::1 or 127.0.0.1) to reduce noise and avoid false positives from local system activities. Additionally, any logon events without a source network address should also be filtered out to focus the detection on remote activities.\n\nThis detection technique operates on a 30-day timeframe, looking for correlation between the remote logon events and subsequent scheduled task creation or modification from the same host. Specifically, if a logon through the network (indicated by Logon Type 3) is followed by a creation or update of a scheduled task within this period\u2014and these actions cannot be attributed to local system activities\u2014you might be observing an attack where adversaries use remote execution methods to establish persistence or execute malicious tasks on the destination host.\n\nTags indicating the relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques would include Execution, Persistence, and Scheduled Task/Job for such detection logic.

      "answer": "In order to detect remote execution via scheduled task creation or update on the destination host, you should monitor Windows security logs for specific event IDs that indicate a successful account logon event (Event ID 4624) with Logon Type 3 (network logon), as well as the creation or update of scheduled tasks (Event IDs 4698 and 4702). It\u2019s crucial to filter out any events that originate from the loopback address (::1 or 127.0.0.1) to reduce noise and avoid false positives from local system activities. Additionally, any logon events without a source network address should also be filtered out to focus the detection on remote activities.\n\nThis detection technique operates on a 30-day timeframe, looking for correlation between the remote logon events and subsequent scheduled task creation or modification from the same host. Specifically, if a logon through the network (indicated by Logon Type 3) is followed by a creation or update of a scheduled task within this period\u2014and these actions cannot be attributed to local system activities\u2014you might be observing an attack where adversaries use remote execution methods to establish persistence or execute malicious tasks on the destination host.\n\nTags indicating the relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques would include Execution, Persistence, and Scheduled Task/Job for such detection logic. These tags help in classifying the detection strategy according to a widely recognized framework for understanding and discussing cybersecurity threats.\n"

The goal of the Sigma rule above is to detect suspicious parent process for cmd.exe\n\nHere is how  the given sigma rule operates: In order to detect suspicious parent processes for cmd.exe, you should monitor for instances where cmd.exe is launched by specific parent processes on Windows systems. Such scrutiny is essential as cmd.exe, a command-line interpreter, can be legitimately used for various system tasks. However, its misuse by attackers for malicious purposes, such as executing scripts or commands for reconnaissance, lateral movement, or persistence, necessitates vigilant monitoring. The detection focuses on cmd.exe processes spawned from a list of parent processes which are not commonly associated with its legitimate execution. These parent processes include system and application processes like csrss.exe, ctfmon.exe, dllhost.exe, and several others which, under normal circumstances, would not typically launch cmd.exe. This detection is crucial for identifying potentially unauthorized or malicious activity, often indicative of an attacker's presence on the system, attempting to exploit legitimate functionalities for harmful objectives. The emphasis is on process creation within Windows, aiming to pinpoint unusual relationships that could signal compromise or an attack in progress, with a medium level of confidence. Identifying such anomalies is paramount in swiftly addressing potential security breaches, thereby reinforcing the system's defenses against sophisticated attack techniques.",

      "question": "suspicious parent process for cmd.exe",
      "answer": "In order to detect suspicious parent processes for cmd.exe, you should monitor for instances where cmd.exe is launched by specific parent processes on Windows systems. Such scrutiny is essential as cmd.exe, a command-line interpreter, can be legitimately used for various system tasks. However, its misuse by attackers for malicious purposes, such as executing scripts or commands for reconnaissance, lateral movement, or persistence, necessitates vigilant monitoring. The detection focuses on cmd.exe processes spawned from a list of parent processes which are not commonly associated with its legitimate execution. These parent processes include system and application processes like csrss.exe, ctfmon.exe, dllhost.exe, and several others which, under normal circumstances, would not typically launch cmd.exe. This detection is crucial for identifying potentially unauthorized or malicious activity, often indicative of an attacker's presence on the system, attempting to exploit legitimate functionalities for harmful objectives. The emphasis is on process creation within Windows, aiming to pinpoint unusual relationships that could signal compromise or an attack in progress, with a medium level of confidence. Identifying such anomalies is paramount in swiftly addressing potential security breaches, thereby reinforcing the system's defenses against sophisticated attack techniques."

Specifically, you need to focus on the event type 'CreateKey' which involves the creation of new registry keys. If any registry key additions occur under the path containing '\\software\\NetWire', it is indicative of potentially malicious activity associated with the NetWire Remote Access Trojan (RAT). This activity is of high importance due to its possible implications for unauthorized access and control over the affected system. Monitoring should be conducted through the Windows registry log source, specifically looking at registry addition categories. Be aware that there might be instances where false positives occur, although such instances are unknown. This detection mechanism is crucial for identifying tactics and techniques related to the use of malware for achieving persistence and command and control by threat actors."

      "answer": "In order to detect base64 encoded \"MpPreference\" PowerShell cmdlet code that tries to modify or tamper with Windows Defender AV, you should: Monitor the creation of processes on Windows systems, particularly focusing on the command line executions. Pay special attention to the presence of specific commands, which include both normal and lowercase variations of 'Add-MpPreference ' and 'Set-MpPreference '. Additionally, look for these commands encoded in UTF16-LE format in the command line executions. This approach helps to identify attempts to bypass or disable Windows Defender AV, ensuring the detection of sophisticated methods used to tamper with security settings silently. It's essential to note that while this method is highly effective at identifying suspicious activities, there may be cases where it generates unknown false positives, indicating the need for further investigation when such detections occur. The severity of this detection is considered high, indicating its potential impact on system security."

      "answer": "In order to detect PowerShell activity in which Get-AdDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy is used to get the default password policy for an Active Directory domain, you should: Monitor PowerShell script log sources on Windows systems, specifically focusing on script block logging. Enable Script Block Logging to ensure the capture of all PowerShell script executions. Look for the presence of the command \"Get-AdDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy\" within the text of the script blocks being executed. This command indicates an attempt to retrieve the default password policy settings of the Active Directory domain, which might be a part of reconnaissance activities by an attacker looking to understand password policies in place. Recognize that there may be false positives, as legitimate scripts used by administrators might also query this information for valid purposes. The risk level associated with this activity is considered low, reflecting the likelihood that, while potentially indicative of reconnaissance, it does not directly result in a breach or compromise."

      "answer": "In order to detect suspicious start of rundll32.exe without any parameters as found in CobaltStrike beacon activity, you should focus on monitoring process creation events on Windows systems. Specifically, look for instances where the command line ends with '\\rundll32.exe', indicating the start of the rundll32.exe process. It's essential to exclude cases where the parent process image ends with '\\svchost.exe' or contains paths like '\\AppData\\Local\\' or '\\Microsoft\\Edge\\', as these conditions could filter out legitimate occurrences of rundll32.exe being launched. Pay special attention to the parent process image and the parent process command line, as they can provide context that helps differentiate between normal and suspicious activity. While false positives are possible, they are considered rare for this behavior. This approach helps identify potential malicious activities associated with tactics and techniques like execution and persistence, commonly seen in malware attacks."

Monitoring should focus on:\n\n1. Commands that attempt to execute PowerShell with parameters designed to bypass execution policies and run scripts or commands in a hidden window. This includes looking for sequences that convert strings from Base64 encoding inline, an obfuscation technique often used to hide malicious scripts from simple inspection.\n\n2. Spot instances where the Invoke-Expression (iex) cmdlet is used in conjunction with commands that create new objects or download content over the network. The presence of 'iex' alongside parameters for non-interactivity, window hiding, and bypassing the execution policy can be indicative of an attempt to dynamically execute code that is fetched or constructed at runtime.\n\n3. Identifications of attempts to use encoded commands with PowerShell, which are passed using the `-Enc` parameter. This tactic is utilized to hide the actual commands being executed from plain view.\n\n4.

      "question": "suspicious PowerShell invocation command parameters",
      "answer": "In order to detect suspicious PowerShell invocation command parameters, you should monitor Windows PowerShell module activity for specific command-line parameters and techniques that attackers frequently use to evade detection, execute code, or persist on a system. Monitoring should focus on:\n\n1. Commands that attempt to execute PowerShell with parameters designed to bypass execution policies and run scripts or commands in a hidden window. This includes looking for sequences that convert strings from Base64 encoding inline, an obfuscation technique often used to hide malicious scripts from simple inspection.\n\n2. Spot instances where the Invoke-Expression (iex) cmdlet is used in conjunction with commands that create new objects or download content over the network. The presence of 'iex' alongside parameters for non-interactivity, window hiding, and bypassing the execution policy can be indicative of an attempt to dynamically execute code that is fetched or constructed at runtime.\n\n3. Identifications of attempts to use encoded commands with PowerShell, which are passed using the `-Enc` parameter. This tactic is utilized to hide the actual commands being executed from plain view.\n\n4. Checks for manipulation of Windows registry to establish persistence, specifically through adding entries under the `HKCU\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\currentversion\\run` path. This is a common method for ensuring malware or tools auto-start with the logged-on user's session.\n\n5. Look for utilization of the .NET WebClient class in scripts to download payloads or otherwise interact with external network resources while trying to remain hidden and potentially bypass execution policy through `-bypass` and `-noprofile` parameters.\n\n6. Monitor for scripts that use the combination of 'iex' for execution of expressions and `New-Object Net.WebClient` for network operations. This could indicate an attempt to download and execute scripts or commands from remote locations.\n\nExclude from alerts:\n- Legitimate installation scripts from known software deployment tools like Chocolatey, which may use similar techniques for legitimate purposes. Specifically, exclude commands involving downloading and running the Chocolatey installer script from the community site.\n\nThis monitoring should be considered high priority due to the high likelihood that such behavior is indicative of malicious activity, including but not limited to initial access, execution of malware, or establishing persistence within the network.\n\nTags related to the attack include execution, persistence, and defense evasion, signaling the broad impact and severity of detected activities that match these patterns."

      "question": "Detect standard users login that are part of high privileged groups such as the Administrator group",
      "answer": "In order to detect standard users login that are part of high privileged groups such as the Administrator group, you should monitor the Local Security Authority (LSA) server events on Windows systems. Specifically, focus on the Microsoft-Windows-LSA/Operational event log, identified by the GUID {199FE037-2B82-40A9-82AC-E1D46C792B99}, which must be collected to receive these events. Look for event ID 300, which indicates a security-sensitive operation occurred.\n\nFilter the events to detect those involving standard user accounts starting with 'S-1-5-21-', which typically represents domain user accounts. Further refine the detection by checking if these user accounts are associated with high privilege groups. The notable group identifiers to watch include 'S-1-5-32-544' for local administrators, '-500}' for domain admins, '-518}' for schema admins, and '-519}' for enterprise admins within the SidList field. However, it's crucial to exclude any security identifiers (SIDs) ending with '-500', '-518', and '-519', as these may represent legitimate domain admin, schema admin, and enterprise admin activities, respectively, and thus avoid false positives.\n\nManage potential false positives by specifically considering scenarios where standard domain users, out of necessity, are part of the administrator group. These instances should preferably be filtered out employing the \"TargetUserName\" field to focus on genuine security concerns. This approach is tagged with MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, including Initial Access and Privilege Escalation, as it aims to uncover attempts by attackers to gain footholds or elevate their access within a target system through manipulation or exploitation of user account group memberships."

      "answer": "In order to detect the registration of a debugger for a program that is available in the logon screen (sticky key backdoor), you should: Focus on monitoring process creation events within Windows environments. Specifically, look for commands that interact with the registry key path `\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\`. This registry path is critical because it's exploited in attacks where a debugger is set for legitimate Windows utilities. Pay extra attention to certain utilities that could be involved in these attacks, including `sethc.exe`, `utilman.exe`, `osk.exe`, `magnify.exe`, `narrator.exe`, `displayswitch.exe`, `atbroker.exe`, and `HelpPane.exe`. These utilities are commonly accessible from the logon screen, and adversaries may target them to establish a sticky key backdoor. Any process creation event involving modifications to these executable files through the specified registry path should be scrutinized. Note, however, that there might be instances where genuine software or system administrators perform legitimate actions that trigger similar alerts, but such cases are rare and should be verified to mitigate potential security risks. This method is associated with high alertness due to its strong links with tactics and techniques aimed at gaining persistent access and executing unauthorized commands or software."

      "answer": "In order to monitor process creation with \"wmic process call create\" and LOLBins in command-line with parent Office application processes, you should: Focus on Windows process creation logs to identify potentially malicious behavior. Specifically, look for the execution of commonly abused legitimate Windows utilities, known as Living Off the Land Binaries and Scripts (LOLBins). Examples of such binaries include 'regsvr32', 'rundll32', 'msiexec', 'mshta', and 'verclsid'. Additionally, the use of 'wbem\\WMIC.exe' or command lines that contain 'wmic ' should raise suspicion. Another critical detection vector is the spawning of these processes by parent processes associated with Microsoft Office applications, such as Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, which is a technique attackers may use to disguise malicious activities. Detection should cover command lines that specifically contain the keywords 'process', 'create', and 'call' together, which are indicative of an attempt to execute commands or payloads in a manner designed to evade simple parent-child process relationship checks. It is crucial to investigate these signs due to their high potential for being related to malicious activities, even though there could be legitimate uses that could lead to false positives."

      "answer": "In order to detect usage of the \"sqlite\" binary to query databases in Chromium-based browsers for potential data stealing, you should: Monitor Windows process creation logs for instances where the SQLite binary is executed, indicated by the appearance of 'sqlite.exe' or 'sqlite3.exe' in the process image path. Pay close attention to processes that involve command lines referencing common folders associated with user profile data of Chromium-based browsers, such as '\\User Data\\', '\\Opera Software\\', and '\\ChromiumViewer\\'. These folders are typically used by browsers like Google Chrome, Opera, and Sleipnir (Fenrir), respectively. It is critical to further scrutinize any command line activity that involves accessing or querying database files that contain sensitive information. This would include strings in the command line that point to 'Login Data' (where passwords might be stored), 'Cookies', 'Web Data' (which could include credit card information and autofill data), 'History', and 'Bookmarks'. Altogether, detecting such activities with specific attention to the mentioned criteria is crucial for identifying potential data theft attempts utilizing SQLite within Chromium-based browsers. It is important to note that while this method aims to identify malicious activities, there might be unknown cases leading to false positives, and the severity level for this type of detection has been classified as high."

      "question": "calls to base64 encoded WMI class such as \"Win32_Shadowcopy\", \"Win32_ScheduledJob\", etc.",
      "answer": "In order to detect calls to base64 encoded WMI class such as \"Win32_Shadowcopy\", \"Win32_ScheduledJob\", etc., you should monitor process creation events within Windows environments. Focus specifically on instances where either `powershell.exe` or `pwsh.exe` executables are launched, or files named `PowerShell.EXE` or `pwsh.dll` are invoked. These are common tools used in a variety of administrative tasks but can also be leveraged maliciously.\n\nPay close attention to command-line inputs that contain base64 encoded strings. These strings, when decoded, may refer to specific Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) classes such as `Win32_Shadowcopy` for creating shadow copies, `Win32_ScheduledJob` for scheduling tasks, `Win32_Process` for process management, `Win32_UserAccount` for user account manipulation, and `Win32_LoggedOnUser` for obtaining information about users currently logged on. \n\nThe presence of these encoded strings, especially when combined with PowerShell or pwsh usage, could indicate an attempt to leverage WMI classes in a manner that\u2019s typical of attackers aiming to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, manage processes, or gather sensitive information without directly calling attention to their activities through standard clear text commands. \n\nGiven the complexity and the potential for benign use of similar commands, any detection of this nature should be considered high priority and investigated to rule out false positives. This approach focuses on a nuanced understanding of potential cybersecurity threats, engaging with both the tools used and the manner of their use."

      "answer": "In order to detect the use of chcp to look up the system locale value as part of host discovery, you should monitor process creation logs on Windows systems. Focus specifically on instances where a command prompt (cmd.exe) is the parent process which launches chcp.com. Look for command-line invocations that include '/c', '/r', or '/k' as part of their arguments before launching 'chcp.com', along with the command lines ending specifically with 'chcp', 'chcp ', or 'chcp  ' (including variations with trailing spaces). However, be mindful of potential legitimate uses of the 'chcp' command that might trigger false positives, such as updates to the Anaconda environment or certain operations by the Discord application. This detection mechanism is of medium importance and is associated with host discovery techniques."

Additionally, ensure the command line arguments contain both ' -f' and a '.zip' file reference. This combination of conditions might indicate an attempt to misuse PrintBrm.exe for suspicious activities, such as manipulating ZIP files in a way that is uncommon for regular workstation use. It is crucial to be vigilant for these signs as they have a high level of severity, although be aware that instances where this might be a legitimate use are unknown."

      "answer": "In order to detect potentially suspicious SQL queries using SQLCmd targeting the Veeam backup databases in order to steal information, you should focus on monitoring Windows process creation logs for specific patterns of activity. Detect these patterns by identifying instances where the 'sqlcmd.exe' process is executed, especially when the command line involves keywords related to 'VeeamBackup' and 'From ' indicating a targeted query against Veeam backup databases. Additionally, look for command lines that contain references to 'BackupRepositories', 'Backups', 'Credentials', 'HostCreds', 'SmbFileShares', 'Ssh_creds', and 'VSphereInfo'. These elements signal attempts to access sensitive backup configuration details, credentials, and information across various repositories and platforms. It's essential to apply this detection mechanism across all related instances to catch any dubious activities aiming at extracting critical backup data. Pay attention to false positives which might arise, as the described activities could, under unknown circumstances, represent legitimate administrative behavior. This alert is of medium importance, indicating a need to analyze detected events to ensure they do not signify an ongoing or attempted compromise involving backup system information theft."

These flags are indicators that an attempt is being made to selectively disable or remove certain audit policies or to restore a custom policy owned by the threat actor. It is important to note that the old auditpol utility is not available by default on more recent versions of Windows, as it has been replaced by a newer version, meaning the rate of false positives should be very low except in cases where tools use a similar flag structure. The severity of this detection is considered high, underscoring the importance of monitoring for these specific command-line flags to prevent threat actors from manipulating audit policies and evading detection."

This activity is indicative of an attempt to manipulate registry keys associated with safe boot options, which can be a tactic used by attackers to disable security mechanisms that are configured to start during the system's safe boot mode. Given the context of this behavior and the high level of privilege required to modify these registry keys, such detections are marked with a high level of concern, and false positives are considered unlikely."

Additionally, attention should be paid when the details of these modifications are either 'DWORD (0x00000001)' or 'DWORD (0x00000002)', as these values indicate that DDE feature is being enabled or its security is being adjusted.\n\nSimilarly, for Microsoft Excel, track changes where EventType is \"SetValue\" concerning the registry keys ending with \"\\Excel\\Security\\DisableDDEServerLaunch\" and \"\\Excel\\Security\\DisableDDEServerLookup\". The key modifications of interest here involve setting these values to 'DWORD (0x00000000)' which effectively enables the DDE protocol despite any previous disablement, thus allowing data exchange.\n\nThe tagging of these monitoring actions aligns with certain tactics and techniques including the potential for execution through macros (when DDE is explicitly enabled) and persistence or privilege escalation (by allowing arbitrary code execution through DDE). While encountering these specific registry modifications may not always indicate malicious activity, as there can be legitimate reasons for their adjustment, it is crucial to investigate further to discern the true intent behind these changes. False positives are considered unknown, indicating that while not expected, they can occur, and thus each detection should be analyzed for its context. The overall level of concern for these activities is considered medium."

      "answer": "In order to detect network connections made by the \"hh.exe\" process, which could indicate the execution/download of remotely hosted .chm files, you should: Monitor network connections made by Windows systems, focusing on those initiated by the \"hh.exe\" process. Notably, this process should raise suspicion if it initiates connections to common web or network service ports such as 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 135 (RPC), and 445 (SMB/CIFS). These connections are indicative of potential unauthorized or malicious activities, particularly involving the execution or download of CHM (Compiled HTML Help) files remotely. It\u2019s critical to be aware, however, that not all activities flagged by this criterion are inherently malicious, and there may be unknown, benign cases leading to false positives. The severity of detections based on this criterion is considered medium, underscoring the importance of further investigation into each flagged event to confirm malicious intent or benign nature. This monitoring strategy aligns with understanding the tactics and techniques of adversaries as outlined by MITRE ATT&CK, notably those involving execution and command and control, highlighting the emphasis on vigilance against methods used to execute or download malicious files."

      "answer": "In order to detect WMIC executing \"process call create\" with suspicious calls to processes such as \"rundll32\", \"regsrv32\", etc., you should: focus on monitoring Windows process creation events. Specifically, watch for command lines that include both the phrases 'process ', 'call ', and 'create ' in conjunction, indicating a possible attempt to execute or manipulate processes suspiciously. Additionally, heightened alertness is warranted when command lines contain references to known tools or pathways often utilized in malicious activities such as \"rundll32\", \"bitsadmin\", \"regsvr32\", \"cmd.exe\" with various flags ('/c ', '/k ', '/r '), \"powershell\", \"pwsh\", \"certutil\", \"cscript\", \"wscript\", \"mshta\", or paths that are commonly abused by attackers like \"\\Users\\Public\\\", \"\\Windows\\Temp\\\", \"\\AppData\\Local\\\", and environment variables \"%temp%\", \"%tmp%\", \"%ProgramData%\", \"%appdata%\", \"%comspec%\", \"%localappdata%\". Logs containing these elements should be captured and analyzed, including both the command line used and the parent command line, to help identify potentially malicious activity. It's important to note that while this approach is effective in identifying suspicious behavior, there may be legitimate instances of these command lines, thus some alerts might not indicate a true security incident."

Therefore, while this detection is set at a medium level of confidence, any alerts should be investigated to differentiate between benign and malicious use of PsService."

      "answer": "In order to detect execution of attacker-controlled WsmPty.xsl or WsmTxt.xsl via winrm.vbs and copied cscript.exe (can be renamed), you should monitor file events on Windows systems specifically focusing on files ending with 'WsmPty.xsl' or 'WsmTxt.xsl'. Importantly, these detections become relevant when these files are not located in the system's default folders, specifically 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\' or 'C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\'. This approach helps to identify scenarios where attackers might attempt to execute malicious scripts outside standard system directories to evade detection. Given the specificity of this method, false positives are considered unlikely. The overall security level for this detection mechanism is rated as medium."

      "answer": "In order to detect the extraction of password protected ZIP archives with suspicious file names, you should: Monitor Windows security event logs specifically for event ID 5379, which indicates an attempt to access encrypted ZIP files. Focus on instances where the TargetName field includes the string 'Microsoft_Windows_Shell_ZipFolder:filename', as this signifies the action performed on a ZIP file. Additionally, pay close attention to filenames that contain certain keywords which are often associated with malicious activities or phishing attempts. These keywords include 'invoice', 'new order', 'rechnung' (invoice in German), 'factura' (invoice in Spanish), 'delivery', 'purchase', 'order', and 'payment'. The detection of such filenames being accessed in conjunction with the specific event ID raises the suspicion level. However, it's important to consider the possibility of false positives, which in this scenario could arise from legitimate use of encrypted ZIP files containing these keywords. The severity level for this type of detection is considered high, underlining the potential risk associated with the activity. This monitoring strategy aligns with several MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, notably those related to initial access, execution, and persistence, by identifying potentially malicious file extraction behavior that could indicate an attacker's footprint within the network."
