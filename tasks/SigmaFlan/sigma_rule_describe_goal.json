The goal of the Sigma rule above is to detect potential registry persistence technique using the Event Viewer \"Events.asp\" technique\n\nHere is how  the given sigma rule operates: In order to detect potential registry persistence technique using the Event Viewer \"Events.asp\" technique, you should monitor for specific registry modifications in Windows environments, focusing mainly on changes that involve Event Viewer configurations. Specifically, keep an eye on the registry paths associated with the Event Viewer, particularly those under the `\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Event Viewer` hierarchy. Look for modifications to the `MicrosoftRedirectionProgram` and `MicrosoftRedirectionURL` keys within this path. These keys might be altered as a method to maintain persistence by redirecting Event Viewer help requests to malicious URLs or programs.\n\nYou should exclude certain known benign configurations from triggering alerts. Specifically, ignore any changes that involve setting the `MicrosoftRedirectionProgram` to `C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\svchost.exe` via Group Policy Objects (GPO) with the specific detail of pointing to `%%SystemRoot%%\\PCHealth\\HelpCtr\\Binaries\\HelpCtr.exe`. Similarly, exclude configurations pointing the `MicrosoftRedirectionProgramCommandLineParameters` to `-url hcp://services/centers/support?topic=%%s` with the same `svchost.exe` image path. Moreover, any changes that simply set the redirection URL to 'http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp' or clear the details (making them empty) should not be considered suspicious.\n\nThis monitoring focuses on registry settings alterations, a critical log source in detecting this type of persistence technique. The key identifiers for detection are the specific registry paths and keys involved, the conditions under which changes should be excluded from suspicion, and the broader context of such modifications indicating potential malicious activity. This detection strategy is associated with persistence tactics and potentially unwanted modifications of system configuration to redirect and manipulate Event Viewer functionality, which may aid an attacker in maintaining a foothold or executing malicious payloads unnoticed.",
