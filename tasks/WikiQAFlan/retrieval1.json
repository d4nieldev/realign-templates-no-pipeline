The bug, despite having been fixed immediately, exposed the private data of approximately 500,000 Google+ users to the public. Google did not reveal the leak to the network's users. In November 2018, another data breach occurred following an update to the Google+ API. Although Google found no evidence of failure, approximately 52.5 million personal profiles were potentially exposed. In August 2019, Google declared a shutdown of Google+ due to low use and technological challenges.\n\n\n\n== Overview of Google+ ==\nGoogle+ was launched in June 2011 as an invite-only social network, but was opened for public access later in the year. It was managed by Vic Gundotra.Similar to Facebook, Google+ also included key features Circles, Hangouts and Sparks.\n\nCircles let users personalize their social groups by sorting friends into different categories. Once allowed into a Circle, users could regulate information in their individual spaces.\nHangouts included video chatting and instant messaging between users.\nSparks allowed Google to track users' past searches to find news and content related to their interests.Google+ was linked to other Google services, such as YouTube, Google Drive and Gmail, giving it access to roughly 2 billion user accounts. However, less than 400 million consumers actively used Google+, with 90% of those users using it for less than five seconds.\n\n== The breaches ==\nIn March 2018, Google developers found a data breach within the Google+ People API in which external apps acquired access to Profile fields that were not marked as public. 500,000 Google+ accounts were included in the breach, which allowed 438 external apps unauthorized access to private users' names, emails, addresses, occupations, genders and ages. This information was available between 2015 and 2018. Google found no evidence of any user's personal information being misused, nor that any third-party app developers were aware of the leak.\nIn November 2018, a software update created another data breach within the Google+ API. The bug impacted 52.5 million users, where, similarly to the March breach, unauthorized apps were able to access Google+ profiles, including users' names, email addresses, occupations and ages. Apps could not access financial information, national identification, numbers, or passwords. Blog posts, messages and phone numbers also remained inaccessible if marked as private. Unlike the previous breach, access was only available for six days before Google+ learned of the breach. Once more, Google+ found no evidence data being misused by third-party developers.\n\n== Responses ==\nIn October 2018, the Wall Street Journal published an article outlining the initial breach and Google's decision to not disclose it to users. At the time, there was no federal law that required Google to inform their consumers of data breaches. Google+ originally did not disclose the breach out of fears of being compared to Facebook's recent data leak and subsequent loss of consumer confidence. In response to the Wall Street Journal article, Google announced the shutdown of Google+ in August 2019. After the second data leak, the date was moved to April 2019. In response to the data breach, enterprise consumers were notified of the bug's impact and given instructions on how to save, download and delete their data prior to the Google+ shut down. Google's Privacy and Data Protection Office found no misuse of user data.\nPrior to the Google+ shutdown, Google set a 10-month period in which users could download and migrate their data. After the 10-month period, user content was deleted. On 4 February 2019, consumers were no longer able to create new Google+ profiles. Google shut down Google+ APIs on 7 March 2019 to ensure that developers did not continue to rely on the APIs prior to the Google+ shutdown.Google is the principal entity of its parent company, Alphabet Inc. After the data breach, Alphabet Inc. share prices fell by 1% to $1,157.06 on 9 October 2018 after an earlier drop of $1,135.40 that morning, the lowest price since 5 July 2018. After the publication of The Wall Street Journal article, share prices dropped as low as 2.1% in two days on 10 October 2018. Share prices steadily increased from this point and met the 8 October 2018 share price on 5 February 2019.Google planned to rebuild Google+ as a corporate enterprise network. Google Play will now assess which apps can ask for permission to access the user's SMS data. Only the default app for telephone distribution is able to make requests. Prior to the data breaches, apps were able to request access to all of a consumer's data simultaneously. Now, each app must request permission for each aspect of a consumer's profile.\n\nHow did Google handle the discovery of the data breaches?",

    "context": "",
    "output": "The strong RSA assumption is the foundation for constructing signature schemes that are provably secure against existential forgery. It allows for the creation of schemes that do not rely on the random oracle model, which is a theoretical construct that assumes the existence of a random function that can be queried by the adversary. While the random oracle model is useful for proving the security of certain cryptographic constructions, it does not always reflect the true security of a scheme when implemented in practice.

      "question": "How does the strong RSA assumption contribute to the construction of signature schemes, and why is it an improvement over the random oracle model?",
      "answer": "The strong RSA assumption is the foundation for constructing signature schemes that are provably secure against existential forgery. It allows for the creation of schemes that do not rely on the random oracle model, which is a theoretical construct that assumes the existence of a random function that can be queried by the adversary. While the random oracle model is useful for proving the security of certain cryptographic constructions, it does not always reflect the true security of a scheme when implemented in practice. By using the strong RSA assumption, cryptographers can create signature schemes with provable security guarantees that are more likely to hold in real-world scenarios.",

    "instruction": "Speck (cipher)\n\n==Introduction==\nSpeck is a family of lightweight block ciphers publicly released by the National Security Agency (NSA) in June 2013. Speck has been optimized for performance in software implementations, while its sister algorithm, Simon, has been optimized for hardware implementations. Speck is an add\u2013rotate\u2013xor (ARX) cipher.\nThe NSA began working on the Simon and Speck ciphers in 2011. The agency anticipated some agencies in the US federal government would need a cipher that would operate well on a diverse collection of Internet of Things devices while maintaining an acceptable level of security.\n\n== Cipher description ==\nSpeck supports a variety of block and key sizes.  A block is always two words, but the words may be 16, 24, 32, 48 or 64 bits in size.  The corresponding key is 2, 3 or 4 words.  The round function consists of two rotations, adding the right word to the left word, xoring the key into the left word, then xoring the left word into the right word.  The number of rounds depends on the parameters selected, as follows:\nThe key schedule uses the same round function as the main block cipher.\n\n== Reference code ==\nThe following is the designers' reference implementation, written in C, of the Speck variant with a 128-bit block size and key, where key\n\n== Performance ==\nAccording to ECRYPT's stream cipher benchmarks (eBASC), Speck is one of the fastest ciphers available, both for long as well as short messages. Some median performances for long messages (128-bit, 128-block size version) are: 1.99 cycles per byte (cpb) on an AMD Ryzen 7 1700; 1.27 cpb on an Intel Core i5-6600; 15.96 cpb on a Broadcom BCM2836 Cortex A7. For example, on the ARMv7 platform, Speck is about 3 times faster than AES.When implemented on 8-bit AVR microcontroller, Speck encryption with 64-bit blocks and 128-bit key consumes 192 bytes of flash memory, temporary variables consume 112 bytes of RAM, and takes 164 cycles to encrypt each byte in the block.Salsa20 is a stream cipher with comparable performance, but it is difficult to use stream ciphers securely in some applications where block ciphers like Speck work well. This led Google to add an implementation of Speck in Linux kernel version 4.17, planning to offer it as an option for disk encryption on low-end Android devices that would otherwise be unencrypted due to slow AES performance on processors that lack AES instructions. Speck was later dropped from the Linux kernel due to backlash and concerns, and Google switched to the Adiantum algorithm instead.\n\n== Security ==\n\n\n*** Cryptanalysis ***\nThe designers claim that Speck, though a \"lightweight\" cipher, is designed to have the full security possible for each block and key size, against standard chosen-plaintext (CPA) and chosen-ciphertext (CCA) attacks.  Resistance against related-key attacks was also stated as a goal, though a less crucial one as attacks in that model are not relevant for typical use cases.:\u200a2\u200a  No effort was made to resist attacks in the known-key distinguishing attack model, nor did the designers evaluate Speck for use as a hash function.:\u200a8\u200aAs of 2018, no successful attack on full-round Speck of any variant is known.  Due to interest in Simon and Speck, about 70 cryptanalysis papers have been published on them.:\u200a10\u200a  As is typical for iterated ciphers, reduced-round variants have been successfully attacked.  The best published attacks on Speck in the standard attack model (CPA/CCA with unknown key) are differential cryptanalysis attacks; these make it through about 70\u201375% of the rounds of most variants, though these best attacks are only marginally faster than brute-force.:\u200a12\u200a  The design team states that while designing Speck, they found differential attacks to be the limiting attacks, i.e. the type of attack that makes it through the most rounds; they then set the number of rounds to leave a security margin similar to AES-128's at approximately 30%.:\u200a12\u201313\u200a\nSpeck has been criticized for having too small a security margin, i.e. too few rounds between the best attacks and the full cipher, in comparison to more conservative ciphers such as ChaCha20.\nCiphers with small security margins are more likely to be broken by future advances in cryptanalysis.  Speck's design team counters that there is a real-world cost to unnecessarily large security margins, especially on lightweight devices, that cryptanalysis during the design phase allowed the number of rounds to be set appropriately, and that they targeted AES's security margin.:\u200a17\u200aSpeck includes a round counter in the key schedule.  The designers state this was included to block slide and rotational cryptanalysis attacks.:\u200a16\u200a  Still, rotational-XOR cryptanalysis has been used to find distinguishers against reduced-round versions of Speck. Though the authors don't describe standard key-recovery attacks based on their distinguishers, their best distinguishers on Speck32 and Speck48 in the known-key distinguishing attack model for certain weak key classes make it through slightly more rounds than the best differential distinguishers.  One of the authors has said that his research was resource-constrained and that rotational-XOR distinguishers on more rounds are probably possible. However, this type of cryptanalysis assumes the related-key or even the known-key attack models, which are not a concern in typical cryptographic protocols and solutions.:\u200a8\u200a  The designers also state that Speck was not designed to resist known-key distinguishing attacks (which do not directly compromise the confidentiality of ciphers).:\u200a8\u200aThe designers state that NSA cryptanalysis found the algorithms to have no weaknesses, and security commensurate with their key lengths.:\u200a2\u200a  The design team says that their cryptanalysis included linear and differential cryptanalysis using standard techniques such as Matsui's algorithm and SAT/SMT solvers, though a full list of techniques used is not given.:\u200a10\u200a  Speck's designers have been criticized for not providing more details on NSA cryptanalysis of the ciphers.The NSA has approved Simon128/256 and Speck128/256 for use in U.S. National Security Systems, though AES-256 is still recommended for non-constrained applications.\n\n\n*** Side-channel attacks ***\nBeing an ARX cipher, Speck does not use S-boxes or other lookup tables; it is therefore naturally immune to cache-timing attacks.:\u200a12\u200a This contrasts with ciphers that use lookup tables such as AES, which have been shown to be vulnerable to such attacks.  However, like most block ciphers (including AES) Speck is vulnerable to power analysis attacks unless hardware countermeasures are taken.:\u200a12\u200a\n\n\n*** Block and key sizes ***\nAlthough the Speck family of ciphers includes variants with the same block and key sizes as AES (Speck128/128, Speck128/192, and Speck128/256), it also includes variants with block size as low as 32 bits and key size as low as 64 bits.  These small block and key sizes are insecure for general use, as they can allow birthday attacks and brute-force attacks, regardless of the formal security of the cipher.  The designers state that these block and key sizes were included for highly resource-constrained devices where nothing better is possible, or where only very small amounts of data are ever encrypted, e.g. in RFID protocols.:\u200a2\u20133\u200a  Only the variant with a 128-bit block size and 256-bit key size is approved for use in U.S. National Security Systems.\n\n== Standardization efforts and controversies ==\nInitial attempts to standardise Simon and Speck failed to meet International Organization for Standardization super-majority required by the process and the ciphers were not adopted. Expert delegates to the ISO from several countries including Germany, Japan and Israel opposed the efforts by the NSA to standardise the Simon and Speck ciphers, citing concerns that the NSA is pushing for their standardisation with knowledge of exploitable weaknesses in the ciphers. The position was based on partial evidence of weaknesses in the ciphers, lack of clear need for standardisation of the new ciphers, and the NSA's previous involvement in the creation and promotion of the backdoored Dual_EC_DRBG cryptographic algorithm.In response to concerns, the NSA stated that more than 70 security analysis papers from some of the world's leading cryptographers support NSA's conclusion that the algorithms are secure and NSA affirmed that it is not aware of any cryptanalytic techniques that would allow them or anyone else to exploit Simon or SpeckAfter initial attempts to standardise the ciphers failed, the ISO standardised Simon and Speck in other working groups. As of October 2018, the Simon and Speck ciphers have been standardized by ISO as a part of the RFID air interface standard, International Standard ISO/29167-21 (for Simon) and International Standard ISO/29167-22 (for Speck), making them available for use by commercial entities.On August 7, 2018, Speck was removed from the Linux kernel 4.20 release completely.\nRead the text above and answer this question: What are the supported block and key sizes for Speck, and how do they affect the round function?",

Speck was later dropped from the Linux kernel due to backlash and concerns, and Google switched to the Adiantum algorithm instead.\n\n== Security ==\n\n\n*** Cryptanalysis ***\nThe designers claim that Speck, though a \"lightweight\" cipher, is designed to have the full security possible for each block and key size, against standard chosen-plaintext (CPA) and chosen-ciphertext (CCA) attacks.  Resistance against related-key attacks was also stated as a goal, though a less crucial one as attacks in that model are not relevant for typical use cases.:\u200a2\u200a  No effort was made to resist attacks in the known-key distinguishing attack model, nor did the designers evaluate Speck for use as a hash function.:\u200a8\u200aAs of 2018, no successful attack on full-round Speck of any variant is known.  Due to interest in Simon and Speck, about 70 cryptanalysis papers have been published on them.:\u200a10\u200a  As is typical for iterated ciphers, reduced-round variants have been successfully attacked.  The best published attacks on Speck in the standard attack model (CPA/CCA with unknown key) are differential cryptanalysis attacks; these make it through about 70\u201375% of the rounds of most variants, though these best attacks are only marginally faster than brute-force.:\u200a12\u200a  The design team states that while designing Speck, they found differential attacks to be the limiting attacks, i.e. the type of attack that makes it through the most rounds; they then set the number of rounds to leave a security margin similar to AES-128's at approximately 30%.:\u200a12\u201313\u200a\nSpeck has been criticized for having too small a security margin, i.e. too few rounds between the best attacks and the full cipher, in comparison to more conservative ciphers such as ChaCha20.\nCiphers with small security margins are more likely to be broken by future advances in cryptanalysis.  Speck's design team counters that there is a real-world cost to unnecessarily large security margins, especially on lightweight devices, that cryptanalysis during the design phase allowed the number of rounds to be set appropriately, and that they targeted AES's security margin.:\u200a17\u200aSpeck includes a round counter in the key schedule.  The designers state this was included to block slide and rotational cryptanalysis attacks.:\u200a16\u200a  Still, rotational-XOR cryptanalysis has been used to find distinguishers against reduced-round versions of Speck. Though the authors don't describe standard key-recovery attacks based on their distinguishers, their best distinguishers on Speck32 and Speck48 in the known-key distinguishing attack model for certain weak key classes make it through slightly more rounds than the best differential distinguishers.  One of the authors has said that his research was resource-constrained and that rotational-XOR distinguishers on more rounds are probably possible. However, this type of cryptanalysis assumes the related-key or even the known-key attack models, which are not a concern in typical cryptographic protocols and solutions.:\u200a8\u200a  The designers also state that Speck was not designed to resist known-key distinguishing attacks (which do not directly compromise the confidentiality of ciphers).:\u200a8\u200aThe designers state that NSA cryptanalysis found the algorithms to have no weaknesses, and security commensurate with their key lengths.:\u200a2\u200a  The design team says that their cryptanalysis included linear and differential cryptanalysis using standard techniques such as Matsui's algorithm and SAT/SMT solvers, though a full list of techniques used is not given.:\u200a10\u200a  Speck's designers have been criticized for not providing more details on NSA cryptanalysis of the ciphers.The NSA has approved Simon128/256 and Speck128/256 for use in U.S. National Security Systems, though AES-256 is still recommended for non-constrained applications.\n\n\n*** Side-channel attacks ***\nBeing an ARX cipher, Speck does not use S-boxes or other lookup tables; it is therefore naturally immune to cache-timing attacks.:\u200a12\u200a This contrasts with ciphers that use lookup tables such as AES, which have been shown to be vulnerable to such attacks.  However, like most block ciphers (including AES) Speck is vulnerable to power analysis attacks unless hardware countermeasures are taken.:\u200a12\u200a\n\n\n*** Block and key sizes ***\nAlthough the Speck family of ciphers includes variants with the same block and key sizes as AES (Speck128/128, Speck128/192, and Speck128/256), it also includes variants with block size as low as 32 bits and key size as low as 64 bits.  These small block and key sizes are insecure for general use, as they can allow birthday attacks and brute-force attacks, regardless of the formal security of the cipher.  The designers state that these block and key sizes were included for highly resource-constrained devices where nothing better is possible, or where only very small amounts of data are ever encrypted, e.g. in RFID protocols.:\u200a2\u20133\u200a  Only the variant with a 128-bit block size and 256-bit key size is approved for use in U.S. National Security Systems.\n\n== Standardization efforts and controversies ==\nInitial attempts to standardise Simon and Speck failed to meet International Organization for Standardization super-majority required by the process and the ciphers were not adopted. Expert delegates to the ISO from several countries including Germany, Japan and Israel opposed the efforts by the NSA to standardise the Simon and Speck ciphers, citing concerns that the NSA is pushing for their standardisation with knowledge of exploitable weaknesses in the ciphers. The position was based on partial evidence of weaknesses in the ciphers, lack of clear need for standardisation of the new ciphers, and the NSA's previous involvement in the creation and promotion of the backdoored Dual_EC_DRBG cryptographic algorithm.In response to concerns, the NSA stated that more than 70 security analysis papers from some of the world's leading cryptographers support NSA's conclusion that the algorithms are secure and NSA affirmed that it is not aware of any cryptanalytic techniques that would allow them or anyone else to exploit Simon or SpeckAfter initial attempts to standardise the ciphers failed, the ISO standardised Simon and Speck in other working groups. As of October 2018, the Simon and Speck ciphers have been standardized by ISO as a part of the RFID air interface standard, International Standard ISO/29167-21 (for Simon) and International Standard ISO/29167-22 (for Speck), making them available for use by commercial entities.On August 7, 2018, Speck was removed from the Linux kernel 4.20 release completely."

    "instruction": "Logjam (computer security)\n\n==Introduction==\nLogjam is a security vulnerability in systems that use Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange with the same prime number. It was discovered by a team of computer scientists and publicly reported on May 20, 2015. The discoverers were able to demonstrate their attack on 512-bit (US export-grade) DH systems. They estimated that a state level attacker could do so for 1024-bit systems, then widely used, thereby allowing decryption of a significant fraction of Internet traffic. They recommended upgrading to at least 2048-bits for shared prime systems.\n\n\n\n== Details ==\nDiffie\u2013Hellman key exchange depends for its security on the presumed difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem. The authors took advantage of the fact that the number field sieve algorithm, which is generally the most effective method for finding discrete logarithms, consists of four large computational steps, of which the first three depend only on the order of the group G, not on the specific number whose finite log is desired. If the results of the first three steps are precomputed and saved, they can be used to solve any discrete log problem for that prime group in relatively short time. This vulnerability was known as early as 1992. It turns out that much Internet traffic only uses one of a handful of groups that are of order 1024 bits or less.\nOne approach enabled by this vulnerability that the authors demonstrated was using a man-in-the-middle network attacker to downgrade a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection to use 512-bit DH export-grade cryptography, allowing them to read the exchanged data and inject data into the connection. It affects the HTTPS, SMTPS, and IMAPS protocols, among others. The authors needed several thousand CPU cores for a week to precompute data for a single 512-bit prime. Once that was done, however, individual logarithms could be solved in about a minute using two 18-core Intel Xeon CPUs. Its CVE ID is CVE-2015-4000.The authors also estimated the feasibility of the attack against 1024-bit Diffie\u2013Hellman primes. By design, many Diffie\u2013Hellman implementations use the same pre-generated prime for their field. This was considered secure, since the discrete log problem is still considered hard for big-enough primes even if the group is known and reused. The researchers calculated the cost of creating logjam precomputation for one 1024-bit prime at hundreds of millions of USD, and noted that this was well within range of the FY2012 $10.5 billion U.S. Consolidated Cryptologic Program (which includes NSA). Because of the reuse of primes, generating precomputation for just one prime would break two-thirds of VPNs and a quarter of all SSH servers globally. The researchers noted that this attack fits claims in leaked NSA papers that NSA is able to break much current cryptography. They recommend using primes of 2048 bits or more as a defense or switching to elliptic-curve Diffie\u2013Hellman (ECDH).  \nClaims on the practical implications of the attack were however disputed by security researchers Eyal Ronen and Adi Shamir in their paper \"Critical Review of Imperfect Forward Secrecy\".\n\n== Test tools ==\nTLS-based services such as web servers offering HTTPS can be checked for the vulnerability using scanners such as SSLyze, the Qualys SSL server test, ImmuniWeb SSL Security Test, SSLTrust, CryptCheck, CypherCraft, testssl.sh or the keycdn.com scanner.\nSSH servers can be tested using the ssh-audit or SSH-Weak-DH tools.\n\n== Responses ==\nOn May 12, 2015, Microsoft released a patch for Internet Explorer.\nOn June 16, 2015, the Tor Project provided a patch for Logjam to the Tor Browser.\nOn June 30, 2015, Apple released a patch for both OS X Yosemite and iOS 8 operating system.\nOn June 30, 2015, the Mozilla project released a fix for the Firefox browser.\nOn September 1, 2015, Google released a fix for the Chrome browser.\nOn December 6, 2017, IETF published RFC 8270 called \"Increase the Secure Shell Minimum Recommended Diffie-Hellman Modulus Size to 2048 Bits\".\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: How does the Logjam vulnerability relate to the use of 1024-bit primes in Diffie-Hellman key exchange?",

It was renamed Websense in 1999 and became a public company in 2000 at the peak of the dot-com bubble. Vista Equity Partners acquired Websense in 2013 for $906 million. Raytheon acquired an 80% interest in Websense in April 2015 for $1.9 billion and acquired the remaining 20% interest in 2019. In 2015, Websense acquired network security vendor Stonesoft from Intel and in 2016, the company was renamed Forcepoint. Francisco Partners acquired the company from Raytheon in January 2021.\n\n\n\n== Corporate history ==\n\n\n*** NetPartners ***\nThe company was founded in 1994 as NetPartners in Sorrento Valley, San Diego by Phil Trubey. The company began as a reseller of network security products, and then developed software for controlling Internet use by employees.In 1998, NetPartners raised $6 million in venture capital funding and had $6 million in annual revenue. Later that year, investors pushed Trubey out of the CEO position and appointed John Carrington as his replacement.\n\n\n*** Websense ***\nIn June 1999, NetPartners was renamed Websense.In March 2000, at the peak of the dot-com bubble, it raised $72 million in an initial public offering. The stock price doubled on its first day of trading.In 2006, former McAfee CEO Gene Hodges succeeded Carrington as chief executive officer of the company.In 2006, Websense acquired a fingerprint security company, PortAuthority. for $90 million. \nIn October 2007, it acquired email security vendor SurfControl for $400 million. In 2009, it acquired Defensio, a spam and malware company focused on social media.By 2009, Websense had 1,400 employees, with offices in England, China, Australia, and Israel. In 2011, Facebook deployed Websense to check every link users shared on the site.In 2013, Vista Equity Partners acquired the company for $906 million. Websense headquarters were moved to San Diego that year and to Austin, Texas in 2014.  In 2015, Raytheon acquired the firm from Vista Equity Partners for $1.9 billion and combined it with RCP, formerly part of its IIS segment, to form Raytheon|Websense. In October 2015, Raytheon added Foreground Security,, for $62 million.\n\n\n*** Forcepoint ***\nRaytheon acquired an 80% interest in Websense in May 2015 for about $1.9 billion. In October 2015, the company acquired two subsidiaries of Intel, Stonesoft and Sidewinder, for  $389 million. Stonesoft was a network security product previously known as \"McAfee Next-Generation Firewall;\" Sidewinder was a firewall previously known as McAfee Firewall Enterprise.In January 2016, Websense, along with the two subsidiaries Stonesoft and Sidewinder, were merged and rebranded as Forcepoint. Raytheon's \"Cyber Products\" business was also merged into the new brand. At the time, Forcepoint had 2,000 employees, with one-third of its customers being departments in the federal government of the United States. Forcepoint was the smallest of five major businesses owned by Raytheon, but had the highest profit margin. The following year, Forcepoint began shuffling executives in a re-organization effort that included some layoffs. The company was divided into four business units: Cloud Security, Network Security, Data & Insider Threat Security, and Global Governments.In April 2016, Matthew Moynahan was appointed chief executive officer of Forcepoint. In February 2017, Forcepoint acquired a cloud-based access broker (CASB) security product from Imperva called Skyfence. In August 2017, it acquired user and entity behavior analytics company RedOwl. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Raytheon acquired the remaining 20% of the company from Vista Ventures Partners LLC for $588 million.In October 2020, Francisco Partners announced their agreement to acquire Forcepoint from Raytheon. The transaction was completed in January 2021.\n\n\n*** Version history ***\nBy 1997, three years after Forcepoint was founded, the company had published version 3 of its software. Version 3.0 introduced the software's first graphical, web-based administrative user interface. At the time, Forcepoint's software was only used to prevent employees from viewing certain types of content at work, but in 2006 features were added to detect when employees were attempting to visit websites suspected of hosting malicious code.In 2007 Websense introduced a product to control the content a user can see on social media websites, an endpoint security product, a website reputation ranker, and a small business version. Additionally, a product was added to the Websense suite that identifies sensitive files in un-secure locations on the corporate network and looks for records of those files being transmitted.Websense introduced its first appliance product in 2009.In 2010, some products were consolidated into the Triton software, which became responsible for increasingly large portions of the company's revenue. In February 2012, Forcepoint released a cloud-based suite of IT security products for smartphones, tablets, laptops, USB drives, and other mobile devices. Upgrades to the suite in 2012 added the ability to identify confidential information in an image file. Three new products or revisions were introduced in 2016, all focused on security risks caused by employees.\n\n== Censorship ==\nForcepoint has a policy against selling to governments and ISPs that engage in Internet censorship, however it has been criticized for a \"perceived link to censorship of free speech and the dissemination of knowledge.\"In 2009, it was discovered that the Yemeni government was using Forcepoint's products to monitor the public's internet use and block tools that allow citizens to hide their internet use from the government and the software Alkasir was created to circumvent it. Forcepoint responded by cutting off the country's access to the firm's database updates. However, then Sanaa based British-Irish journalist Iona Craig complained  on Twitter, access to Tumblr, which many press agents use to spread news, remained closed inside Yemen, her pleas being ignored. It soon appeared that Canadian software company Netsweeper also aids Yemen authorities to censor, even the Houthi government being its customer.In 2011, Forcepoint said it would join the Global Network Initiative, which is focused on privacy and Internet freedom. It left the initiative in 2014.A 2002 study in JAMA found that Forcepoint had the best-performing web-filtering products in terms of blocking pornography while allowing health information. In contrast, a 2005 report by the Rhode Island branch of the American Civil Liberties Union said Forcepoint is a \"blunt instrument\" and that in public libraries equipped with Forcepoint people of all ages \"are still denied access to a wide range of legitimate material.\" A 2006 report by Brennan Center for Justice found that Forcepoint often blocked websites that discussed pornography, but did not actually feature pornography. The software also blocked a furniture website called \"the-strippers.com \", which is not pornographic, but a website for a furniture refinisher. In the author's study, 0-15 percent of the sites blocked by Forcepoint should have been viewable by the user and 10 percent of objectionable websites were let through, rather than blocked. According to blogger Jillian York, Forcepoint blocks pages that contain pornographic links anywhere in its content, even in the comments section. He said, \"a malicious attacker could get your whole site blocked at any time by the simple procedure of leaving dangerous, malicious or pornographic links in a blog's comments\".For approximately 15 minutes in 2009, Forcepoint classified router company Cisco Systems's website under 'hack sites', due to one of Cisco's IP addresses being named on a hacker website. The IP address was reviewed and deemed not a threat.\nAnswer this question: How does Forcepoint's web-filtering software handle cases where objectionable content is linked or referred to in otherwise legitimate websites, and what are the implications of this for freedom of speech and the dissemination of knowledge?",

The stock price doubled on its first day of trading.In 2006, former McAfee CEO Gene Hodges succeeded Carrington as chief executive officer of the company.In 2006, Websense acquired a fingerprint security company, PortAuthority. for $90 million. \nIn October 2007, it acquired email security vendor SurfControl for $400 million. In 2009, it acquired Defensio, a spam and malware company focused on social media.By 2009, Websense had 1,400 employees, with offices in England, China, Australia, and Israel. In 2011, Facebook deployed Websense to check every link users shared on the site.In 2013, Vista Equity Partners acquired the company for $906 million. Websense headquarters were moved to San Diego that year and to Austin, Texas in 2014.  In 2015, Raytheon acquired the firm from Vista Equity Partners for $1.9 billion and combined it with RCP, formerly part of its IIS segment, to form Raytheon|Websense. In October 2015, Raytheon added Foreground Security,, for $62 million.\n\n\n*** Forcepoint ***\nRaytheon acquired an 80% interest in Websense in May 2015 for about $1.9 billion. In October 2015, the company acquired two subsidiaries of Intel, Stonesoft and Sidewinder, for  $389 million. Stonesoft was a network security product previously known as \"McAfee Next-Generation Firewall;\" Sidewinder was a firewall previously known as McAfee Firewall Enterprise.In January 2016, Websense, along with the two subsidiaries Stonesoft and Sidewinder, were merged and rebranded as Forcepoint. Raytheon's \"Cyber Products\" business was also merged into the new brand. At the time, Forcepoint had 2,000 employees, with one-third of its customers being departments in the federal government of the United States. Forcepoint was the smallest of five major businesses owned by Raytheon, but had the highest profit margin. The following year, Forcepoint began shuffling executives in a re-organization effort that included some layoffs. The company was divided into four business units: Cloud Security, Network Security, Data & Insider Threat Security, and Global Governments.In April 2016, Matthew Moynahan was appointed chief executive officer of Forcepoint. In February 2017, Forcepoint acquired a cloud-based access broker (CASB) security product from Imperva called Skyfence. In August 2017, it acquired user and entity behavior analytics company RedOwl. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Raytheon acquired the remaining 20% of the company from Vista Ventures Partners LLC for $588 million.In October 2020, Francisco Partners announced their agreement to acquire Forcepoint from Raytheon. The transaction was completed in January 2021.\n\n\n*** Version history ***\nBy 1997, three years after Forcepoint was founded, the company had published version 3 of its software. Version 3.0 introduced the software's first graphical, web-based administrative user interface. At the time, Forcepoint's software was only used to prevent employees from viewing certain types of content at work, but in 2006 features were added to detect when employees were attempting to visit websites suspected of hosting malicious code.In 2007 Websense introduced a product to control the content a user can see on social media websites, an endpoint security product, a website reputation ranker, and a small business version. Additionally, a product was added to the Websense suite that identifies sensitive files in un-secure locations on the corporate network and looks for records of those files being transmitted.Websense introduced its first appliance product in 2009.In 2010, some products were consolidated into the Triton software, which became responsible for increasingly large portions of the company's revenue. In February 2012, Forcepoint released a cloud-based suite of IT security products for smartphones, tablets, laptops, USB drives, and other mobile devices. Upgrades to the suite in 2012 added the ability to identify confidential information in an image file. Three new products or revisions were introduced in 2016, all focused on security risks caused by employees.\n\n== Censorship ==\nForcepoint has a policy against selling to governments and ISPs that engage in Internet censorship, however it has been criticized for a \"perceived link to censorship of free speech and the dissemination of knowledge.\"In 2009, it was discovered that the Yemeni government was using Forcepoint's products to monitor the public's internet use and block tools that allow citizens to hide their internet use from the government and the software Alkasir was created to circumvent it. Forcepoint responded by cutting off the country's access to the firm's database updates. However, then Sanaa based British-Irish journalist Iona Craig complained  on Twitter, access to Tumblr, which many press agents use to spread news, remained closed inside Yemen, her pleas being ignored. It soon appeared that Canadian software company Netsweeper also aids Yemen authorities to censor, even the Houthi government being its customer.In 2011, Forcepoint said it would join the Global Network Initiative, which is focused on privacy and Internet freedom. It left the initiative in 2014.A 2002 study in JAMA found that Forcepoint had the best-performing web-filtering products in terms of blocking pornography while allowing health information. In contrast, a 2005 report by the Rhode Island branch of the American Civil Liberties Union said Forcepoint is a \"blunt instrument\" and that in public libraries equipped with Forcepoint people of all ages \"are still denied access to a wide range of legitimate material.\" A 2006 report by Brennan Center for Justice found that Forcepoint often blocked websites that discussed pornography, but did not actually feature pornography. The software also blocked a furniture website called \"the-strippers.com \", which is not pornographic, but a website for a furniture refinisher. In the author's study, 0-15 percent of the sites blocked by Forcepoint should have been viewable by the user and 10 percent of objectionable websites were let through, rather than blocked. According to blogger Jillian York, Forcepoint blocks pages that contain pornographic links anywhere in its content, even in the comments section. He said, \"a malicious attacker could get your whole site blocked at any time by the simple procedure of leaving dangerous, malicious or pornographic links in a blog's comments\".For approximately 15 minutes in 2009, Forcepoint classified router company Cisco Systems's website under 'hack sites', due to one of Cisco's IP addresses being named on a hacker website. The IP address was reviewed and deemed not a threat."

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nEmployee monitoring software\n\n==Introduction==\nEmployee monitoring software is a means of employee monitoring, and allows company administrators to monitor and supervise all their employee computers from a central location. It is normally deployed over a business network and allows for easy centralized log viewing via one central networked PC. Sometimes, companies opt to monitor their employees using remote desktop software instead.\n\n\n\n== Purpose ==\nEmployee monitoring software is used to supervise employees' performance, prevent illegal activities, avoid confidential info leakage, and catch insider threats. Nowadays employee monitoring software is widely used in technology companies.\n\n== Features ==\nAn employee monitoring program can monitor almost everything on a computer, such as keystrokes and passwords inputted, websites visited, chats in Facebook Messenger, Skype and other social chats. A piece of monitoring software can also capture screenshots of mobile activities. E-mail monitoring includes employers having access to records of employee\u2019s e-mails that are sent through the company\u2019s servers. Companies may use keyword searches to natural language processing to analyze e-mails. The administrator can view the logs through a cloud panel, or receive the logs by email.\n\n== Criticism ==\nBossware, also known as tattleware, is software that allows supervisors to automatically monitor the productivity of their employees. Common features of bossware include activity monitoring, screenshotting and/or screen recording, keystroke logging, webcam and/or microphone activation, and \"invisible\" monitoring. Bossware has been called a form of spyware. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of bossware by companies to monitor their employees increased.The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) denounced bossware as a violation of privacy. The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) denounced bossware as a threat to the safety and health of employees.During the COVID-19 pandemic, members of the r/antiwork subreddit shared various mouse jiggler strategies to combat bossware intended to monitor the productivity of remote workers.A study by Reports and Data predicts that the global market for employee remote monitoring software will hit $1.3 billion by 2027.\n\nWhat are some of the reasons why companies use employee monitoring software?",

    "instruction": "Rootkit\n\n==Introduction==\nA rootkit is a collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable access to a computer or an area of its software that is not otherwise allowed (for example, to an unauthorized user) and often masks its existence or the existence of other software. The term rootkit is a compound  of \"root\" (the traditional name of the privileged account on Unix-like operating systems) and the word \"kit\" (which refers to the software components that implement the tool). The term \"rootkit\" has negative connotations through its association with malware.Rootkit installation can be automated, or an attacker can install it after having obtained root or administrator access. Obtaining this access is a result of direct attack on a system, i.e. exploiting a vulnerability (such as privilege escalation) or a password (obtained by cracking or social engineering tactics like \"phishing\"). Once installed, it becomes possible to hide the intrusion as well as to maintain privileged access. Full control over a system means that existing software can be modified, including software that might otherwise be used to detect or circumvent it.\nRootkit detection is difficult because a rootkit may be able to subvert the software that is intended to find it. Detection methods include using an alternative and trusted operating system, behavioral-based methods, signature scanning, difference scanning, and memory dump analysis. Removal can be complicated or practically impossible, especially in cases where the rootkit resides in the kernel; reinstallation of the operating system may be the only available solution to the problem. When dealing with firmware rootkits, removal may require hardware replacement, or specialized equipment.\n\n== Uses ==\nModern rootkits do not elevate access, but rather are used to make another software payload undetectable by adding stealth capabilities. Most rootkits are classified as malware, because the payloads they are bundled with are malicious. For example, a payload might covertly steal user passwords, credit card information, computing resources, or conduct other unauthorized activities. A small number of rootkits may be considered utility applications by their users: for example, a rootkit might cloak a CD-ROM-emulation driver, allowing video game users to defeat anti-piracy measures that require insertion of the original installation media into a physical optical drive to verify that the software was legitimately purchased.\nRootkits and their payloads have many uses:\n\nProvide an attacker with full access via a backdoor, permitting unauthorized access to, for example, steal or falsify documents. One of the ways to carry this out is to subvert the login mechanism, such as the /bin/login program on Unix-like systems or GINA on Windows. The replacement appears to function normally, but also accepts a secret login combination that allows an attacker direct access to the system with administrative privileges, bypassing standard authentication and authorization mechanisms.\nConceal other malware, notably password-stealing key loggers and computer viruses.\nAppropriate the compromised machine as a zombie computer for attacks on other computers. (The attack originates from the compromised system or network, instead of the attacker's system.) \"Zombie\" computers are typically members of large botnets that can\u2013amongst other things\u2013launch denial-of-service attacks, distribute email spam, and conduct click fraud.In some instances, rootkits provide desired functionality, and may be installed intentionally on behalf of the computer user:\n\nDetect attacks, for example, in a honeypot.\nEnhance emulation software and security software. Alcohol 120% and Daemon Tools are commercial examples of non-hostile rootkits used to defeat copy-protection mechanisms such as SafeDisc and SecuROM. Kaspersky antivirus software also uses techniques resembling rootkits to protect itself from malicious actions. It loads its own drivers to intercept system activity, and then prevents other processes from doing harm to itself. Its processes are not hidden, but cannot be terminated by standard methods.\nAnti-theft protection: Laptops may have BIOS-based rootkit software that will periodically report to a central authority, allowing the laptop to be monitored, disabled or wiped of information in the event that it is stolen.\nBypassing Microsoft Product Activation\n\n== Types ==\n\nThere are at least five types of rootkit, ranging from those at the lowest level in firmware (with the highest privileges), through to the least privileged user-based variants that operate in Ring 3. Hybrid combinations of these may occur spanning, for example, user mode and kernel mode.\n\n\n*** User mode ***\n\nUser-mode rootkits run in Ring 3, along with other applications as user, rather than low-level system processes. They have a number of possible installation vectors to intercept and modify the standard behavior of application programming interfaces (APIs). Some inject a dynamically linked library (such as a .DLL file on Windows, or a .dylib file on Mac OS X) into other processes, and are thereby able to execute inside any target process to spoof it; others with sufficient privileges simply overwrite the memory of a target application. Injection mechanisms include:\nUse of vendor-supplied application extensions. For example, Windows Explorer has public interfaces that allow third parties to extend its functionality.\nInterception of messages.\nDebuggers.\nExploitation of security vulnerabilities.\nFunction hooking or patching of commonly used APIs, for example, to hide a running process or file that resides on a filesystem....since user mode applications all run in their own memory space, the rootkit needs to perform this patching in the memory space of every running application. In addition, the rootkit needs to monitor the system for any new applications that execute and patch those programs' memory space before they fully execute.\n\n\n*** Kernel mode ***\nKernel-mode rootkits run with the highest operating system privileges (Ring 0) by adding code or replacing portions of the core operating system, including both the kernel and associated device drivers. Most operating systems support kernel-mode device drivers, which execute with the same privileges as the operating system itself. As such, many kernel-mode rootkits are developed as device drivers or loadable modules, such as loadable kernel modules in Linux or device drivers in Microsoft Windows. This class of rootkit has unrestricted security access, but is more difficult to write. The complexity makes bugs common, and any bugs in code operating at the kernel level may seriously impact system stability, leading to discovery of the rootkit. One of the first widely known kernel rootkits was developed for Windows NT 4.0 and released in Phrack magazine in 1999 by Greg Hoglund. Kernel rootkits can be especially difficult to detect and remove because they operate at the same security level as the operating system itself, and are thus able to intercept or subvert the most trusted operating system operations. Any software, such as antivirus software, running on the compromised system is equally vulnerable. In this situation, no part of the system can be trusted.\nA rootkit can modify data structures in the Windows kernel using a method known as direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM). This method can be used to hide processes. A kernel mode rootkit can also hook the System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT), or modify the gates between user mode and kernel mode, in order to cloak itself. Similarly for the Linux operating system, a rootkit can modify the system call table to subvert kernel functionality. It is common that a rootkit creates a hidden, encrypted filesystem in which it can hide other malware or original copies of files it has infected. Operating systems are evolving to counter the threat of kernel-mode rootkits. For example, 64-bit editions of Microsoft Windows now implement mandatory signing of all kernel-level drivers in order to make it more difficult for untrusted code to execute with the highest privileges in a system.\n\n\n**** Bootkits ****\nA kernel-mode rootkit variant called a bootkit can infect startup code like the Master Boot Record (MBR), Volume Boot Record (VBR), or boot sector, and in this way can be used to attack full disk encryption systems.\nAn example of such an attack on disk encryption is the \"evil maid attack\", in which an attacker installs a bootkit on an unattended computer. The envisioned scenario is a maid sneaking into the hotel room where the victims left their hardware. The bootkit replaces the legitimate boot loader with one under their control. Typically the malware loader persists through the transition to protected mode when the kernel has loaded, and is thus able to subvert the kernel. For example, the \"Stoned Bootkit\" subverts the system by using a compromised boot loader to intercept encryption keys and passwords. In 2010, the Alureon rootkit has successfully subverted the requirement for 64-bit kernel-mode driver signing in Windows 7, by modifying the master boot record. Although not malware in the sense of doing something the user doesn't want, certain \"Vista Loader\" or \"Windows Loader\" software work in a similar way by injecting an ACPI SLIC (System Licensed Internal Code) table in the RAM-cached version of the BIOS during boot, in order to defeat the Windows Vista and Windows 7 activation process. This vector of attack was rendered useless in the (non-server) versions of Windows 8, which use a unique, machine-specific key for each system, that can only be used by that one machine. Many antivirus companies provide free utilities and programs to remove bootkits.\n\n\n*** Hypervisor level ***\nRootkits have been created as Type II Hypervisors in academia as proofs of concept. By exploiting hardware virtualization features such as Intel VT or AMD-V, this type of rootkit runs in Ring -1 and hosts the target operating system as a virtual machine, thereby enabling the rootkit to intercept hardware calls made by the original operating system. Unlike normal hypervisors, they do not have to load before the operating system, but can load into an operating system before promoting it into a virtual machine. A hypervisor rootkit does not have to make any modifications to the kernel of the target to subvert it; however, that does not mean that it cannot be detected by the guest operating system. For example, timing differences may be detectable in CPU instructions. The \"SubVirt\" laboratory rootkit, developed jointly by Microsoft and University of Michigan researchers, is an academic example of a virtual-machine\u2013based rootkit (VMBR),\nwhile Blue Pill software is another. In 2009, researchers from Microsoft and North Carolina State University demonstrated a hypervisor-layer anti-rootkit called Hooksafe, which provides generic protection against kernel-mode rootkits. Windows 10 introduced a new feature called \"Device Guard\", that takes advantage of virtualization to provide independent external protection of an operating system against rootkit-type malware.\n\n\n*** Firmware and hardware ***\nA firmware rootkit uses device or platform firmware to create a persistent malware image in hardware, such as a router, network card, hard drive, or the system BIOS. The rootkit hides in firmware, because firmware is not usually inspected for code integrity. John Heasman demonstrated the viability of firmware rootkits in both ACPI firmware routines and in a PCI expansion card ROM. In October 2008, criminals tampered with European credit-card-reading machines before they were installed. The devices intercepted and transmitted credit card details via a mobile phone network. In March 2009, researchers Alfredo Ortega and Anibal Sacco published details of a BIOS-level Windows rootkit that was able to survive disk replacement and operating system re-installation. A few months later they learned that some laptops are sold with a legitimate rootkit, known as Absolute CompuTrace or Absolute LoJack for Laptops, preinstalled in many BIOS images. This is an anti-theft technology system that researchers showed can be turned to malicious purposes.Intel Active Management Technology, part of Intel vPro, implements out-of-band management, giving administrators remote administration, remote management, and remote control of PCs with no involvement of the host processor or BIOS, even when the system is powered off. Remote administration includes remote power-up and power-down, remote reset, redirected boot, console redirection, pre-boot access to BIOS settings, programmable filtering for inbound and outbound network traffic, agent presence checking, out-of-band policy-based alerting, access to system information, such as hardware asset information, persistent event logs, and other information that is stored in dedicated memory (not on the hard drive) where it is accessible even if the OS is down or the PC is powered off. Some of these functions require the deepest level of rootkit, a second non-removable spy computer built around the main computer. Sandy Bridge and future chipsets have \"the ability to remotely kill and restore a lost or stolen PC via 3G\". Hardware rootkits built into the chipset can help recover stolen computers, remove data, or render them useless, but they also present privacy and security concerns of undetectable spying and redirection by management or hackers who might gain control.\n\n== Installation and cloaking ==\nRootkits employ a variety of techniques to gain control of a system; the type of rootkit influences the choice of attack vector. The most common technique leverages security vulnerabilities to achieve surreptitious privilege escalation. Another approach is to use a Trojan horse, deceiving a computer user into trusting the rootkit's installation program as benign\u2014in this case, social engineering convinces a user that the rootkit is beneficial. The installation task is made easier if the principle of least privilege is not applied, since the rootkit then does not have to explicitly request elevated (administrator-level) privileges. Other classes of rootkits can be installed only by someone with physical access to the target system. Some rootkits may also be installed intentionally by the owner of the system or somebody authorized by the owner, e.g. for the purpose of employee monitoring, rendering such subversive techniques unnecessary. Some malicious rootkit installations are commercially driven, with a pay-per-install (PPI) compensation method typical for distribution.Once installed, a rootkit takes active measures to obscure its presence within the host system through subversion or evasion of standard operating system security tools and application programming interface (APIs) used for diagnosis, scanning, and monitoring. Rootkits achieve this by modifying the behavior of core parts of an operating system through loading code into other processes, the installation or modification of drivers, or kernel modules. Obfuscation techniques include concealing running processes from system-monitoring mechanisms and hiding system files and other configuration data. It is not uncommon for a rootkit to disable the event logging capacity of an operating system, in an attempt to hide evidence of an attack. Rootkits can, in theory, subvert any operating system activities. The \"perfect rootkit\" can be thought of as similar to a \"perfect crime\": one that nobody realizes has taken place. Rootkits also take a number of measures to ensure their survival against detection and \"cleaning\" by antivirus software in addition to commonly installing into Ring 0 (kernel-mode), where they have complete access to a system. These include polymorphism (changing so their \"signature\" is hard to detect), stealth techniques, regeneration, disabling or turning off anti-malware software, and not installing on virtual machines where it may be easier for researchers to discover and analyze them.\n\n== Detection ==\nThe fundamental problem with rootkit detection is that if the operating system has been subverted, particularly by a kernel-level rootkit, it cannot be trusted to find unauthorized modifications to itself or its components. Actions such as requesting a list of running processes, or a list of files in a directory, cannot be trusted to behave as expected. In other words, rootkit detectors that work while running on infected systems are only effective against rootkits that have some defect in their camouflage, or that run with lower user-mode privileges than the detection software in the kernel. As with computer viruses, the detection and elimination of rootkits is an ongoing struggle between both sides of this conflict. Detection can take a number of different approaches, including looking for virus \"signatures\" (e.g. antivirus software), integrity checking (e.g. digital signatures), difference-based detection (comparison of expected vs. actual results), and behavioral detection (e.g. monitoring CPU usage or network traffic).\nFor kernel-mode rootkits, detection is considerably more complex, requiring careful scrutiny of the System Call Table to look for hooked functions where the malware may be subverting system behavior, as well as forensic scanning of memory for patterns that indicate hidden processes. Unix rootkit detection offerings include Zeppoo, chkrootkit, rkhunter and OSSEC. For Windows, detection tools include Microsoft Sysinternals RootkitRevealer, Avast Antivirus,  Sophos Anti-Rootkit, F-Secure, Radix, GMER, and WindowsSCOPE. Any rootkit detectors that prove effective ultimately contribute to their own ineffectiveness, as malware authors adapt and test their code to escape detection by well-used tools. Detection by examining storage while the suspect operating system is not operational can miss rootkits not recognised by the checking software, as the rootkit is not active and suspicious behavior is suppressed; conventional anti-malware software running with the rootkit operational may fail if the rootkit hides itself effectively.\n\n\n*** Alternative trusted medium ***\nThe best and most reliable method for operating-system-level rootkit detection is to shut down the computer suspected of infection, and then to check its storage by booting from an alternative trusted medium (e.g. a \"rescue\" CD-ROM or USB flash drive). The technique is effective because a rootkit cannot actively hide its presence if it is not running.\n\n\n*** Behavioral-based ***\nThe behavioral-based approach to detecting rootkits attempts to infer the presence of a rootkit by looking for rootkit-like behavior. For example, by profiling a system, differences in the timing and frequency of API calls or in overall CPU utilization can be attributed to a rootkit. The method is complex and is hampered by a high incidence of false positives. Defective rootkits can sometimes introduce very obvious changes to a system: the Alureon rootkit crashed Windows systems after a security update exposed a design flaw in its code. Logs from a packet analyzer, firewall, or intrusion prevention system may present evidence of rootkit behaviour in a networked environment.\n\n\n*** Signature-based ***\nAntivirus products rarely catch all viruses in public tests (depending on what is used and to what extent), even though security software vendors incorporate rootkit detection into their products. Should a rootkit attempt to hide during an antivirus scan, a stealth detector may notice; if the rootkit attempts to temporarily unload itself from the system, signature detection (or \"fingerprinting\") can still find it. This combined approach forces attackers to implement counterattack mechanisms, or \"retro\" routines, that attempt to terminate antivirus programs. Signature-based detection methods can be effective against well-published rootkits, but less so against specially crafted, custom-root rootkits.\n\n\n*** Difference-based ***\nAnother method that can detect rootkits compares \"trusted\" raw data with \"tainted\" content returned by an API. For example, binaries present on disk can be compared with their copies within operating memory (in some operating systems, the in-memory image should be identical to the on-disk image), or the results returned from file system or Windows Registry APIs can be checked against raw structures on the underlying physical disks\u2014however, in the case of the former, some valid differences can be introduced by operating system mechanisms like memory relocation or shimming. A rootkit may detect the presence of such a difference-based scanner or virtual machine (the latter being commonly used to perform forensic analysis), and adjust its behaviour so that no differences can be detected. Difference-based detection was used by Russinovich's RootkitRevealer tool to find the Sony DRM rootkit.\n\n\n*** Integrity checking ***\n\nCode signing uses public-key infrastructure to check if a file has been modified since being digitally signed by its publisher. Alternatively, a system owner or administrator can use a cryptographic hash function to compute a \"fingerprint\" at installation time that can help to detect subsequent unauthorized changes to on-disk code libraries. However, unsophisticated schemes check only whether the code has been modified since installation time; subversion prior to that time is not detectable. The fingerprint must be re-established each time changes are made to the system: for example, after installing security updates or a service pack. The hash function creates a message digest, a relatively short code calculated from each bit in the file using an algorithm that creates large changes in the message digest with even smaller changes to the original file. By recalculating and comparing the message digest of the installed files at regular intervals against a trusted list of message digests, changes in the system can be detected and monitored\u2014as long as the original baseline was created before the malware was added.\nMore-sophisticated rootkits are able to subvert the verification process by presenting an unmodified copy of the file for inspection, or by making code modifications only in memory, reconfiguration registers, which are later compared to a white list of expected values. The code that performs hash, compare, or extend operations must also be protected\u2014in this context, the notion of an immutable root-of-trust holds that the very first code to measure security properties of a system must itself be trusted to ensure that a rootkit or bootkit does not compromise the system at its most fundamental level.\n\n\n*** Memory dumps ***\nForcing a complete dump of virtual memory will capture an active rootkit (or a kernel dump in the case of a kernel-mode rootkit), allowing offline forensic analysis to be performed with a debugger against the resulting dump file, without the rootkit being able to take any measures to cloak itself. This technique is highly specialized, and may require access to non-public source code or debugging symbols. Memory dumps initiated by the operating system cannot always be used to detect a hypervisor-based rootkit, which is able to intercept and subvert the lowest-level attempts to read memory\u2014a hardware device, such as one that implements a non-maskable interrupt, may be required to dump memory in this scenario. Virtual machines also make it easier to analyze the memory of a compromised machine from the underlying hypervisor, so some rootkits will avoid infecting virtual machines for this reason.\n\n== Removal ==\nManual removal of a rootkit is often extremely difficult for a typical computer user, but a number of security-software vendors offer tools to automatically detect and remove some rootkits, typically as part of an antivirus suite. As of 2005, Microsoft's monthly Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool is able to detect and remove some classes of rootkits.   Also, Windows Defender Offline can remove rootkits, as it runs from a trusted environment before the operating system starts. Some antivirus scanners can bypass file system APIs, which are vulnerable to manipulation by a rootkit. Instead, they access raw file system structures directly, and use this information to validate the results from the system APIs to identify any differences that may be caused by a rootkit. There are experts who believe that the only reliable way to remove them is to re-install the operating system from trusted media. This is because antivirus and malware removal tools running on an untrusted system may be ineffective against well-written kernel-mode rootkits. Booting an alternative operating system from trusted media can allow an infected system volume to be mounted and potentially safely cleaned and critical data to be copied off\u2014or, alternatively, a forensic examination performed. Lightweight operating systems such as Windows PE, Windows Recovery Console, Windows Recovery Environment, BartPE, or Live Distros can be used for this purpose, allowing the system to be \"cleaned\". Even if the type and nature of a rootkit is known, manual repair may be impractical, while re-installing the operating system and applications is safer, simpler and quicker.\n\n== Defenses ==\nSystem hardening represents one of the first layers of defence against a rootkit, to prevent it from being able to install. Applying security patches, implementing the principle of least privilege, reducing the attack surface and installing antivirus software are some standard security best practices that are effective against all classes of malware. New secure boot specifications like UEFI have been designed to address the threat of bootkits, but even these are vulnerable if the security features they offer are not utilized. For server systems, remote server attestation using technologies such as Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) provide a way of verifying that servers remain in a known good state. For example, Microsoft Bitlocker's encryption of data-at-rest verifies that servers are in a known \"good state\" on bootup. PrivateCore vCage is a software offering that secures data-in-use (memory) to avoid bootkits and rootkits by verifying servers are in a known \"good\" state on bootup. The PrivateCore implementation works in concert with Intel TXT and locks down server system interfaces to avoid potential bootkits and rootkits.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question.

      "context": "Rootkit\n\n==Introduction==\nA rootkit is a collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable access to a computer or an area of its software that is not otherwise allowed (for example, to an unauthorized user) and often masks its existence or the existence of other software. The term rootkit is a compound  of \"root\" (the traditional name of the privileged account on Unix-like operating systems) and the word \"kit\" (which refers to the software components that implement the tool). The term \"rootkit\" has negative connotations through its association with malware.Rootkit installation can be automated, or an attacker can install it after having obtained root or administrator access. Obtaining this access is a result of direct attack on a system, i.e. exploiting a vulnerability (such as privilege escalation) or a password (obtained by cracking or social engineering tactics like \"phishing\"). Once installed, it becomes possible to hide the intrusion as well as to maintain privileged access. Full control over a system means that existing software can be modified, including software that might otherwise be used to detect or circumvent it.\nRootkit detection is difficult because a rootkit may be able to subvert the software that is intended to find it. Detection methods include using an alternative and trusted operating system, behavioral-based methods, signature scanning, difference scanning, and memory dump analysis. Removal can be complicated or practically impossible, especially in cases where the rootkit resides in the kernel; reinstallation of the operating system may be the only available solution to the problem. When dealing with firmware rootkits, removal may require hardware replacement, or specialized equipment.\n\n== Uses ==\nModern rootkits do not elevate access, but rather are used to make another software payload undetectable by adding stealth capabilities. Most rootkits are classified as malware, because the payloads they are bundled with are malicious. For example, a payload might covertly steal user passwords, credit card information, computing resources, or conduct other unauthorized activities. A small number of rootkits may be considered utility applications by their users: for example, a rootkit might cloak a CD-ROM-emulation driver, allowing video game users to defeat anti-piracy measures that require insertion of the original installation media into a physical optical drive to verify that the software was legitimately purchased.\nRootkits and their payloads have many uses:\n\nProvide an attacker with full access via a backdoor, permitting unauthorized access to, for example, steal or falsify documents. One of the ways to carry this out is to subvert the login mechanism, such as the /bin/login program on Unix-like systems or GINA on Windows. The replacement appears to function normally, but also accepts a secret login combination that allows an attacker direct access to the system with administrative privileges, bypassing standard authentication and authorization mechanisms.\nConceal other malware, notably password-stealing key loggers and computer viruses.\nAppropriate the compromised machine as a zombie computer for attacks on other computers. (The attack originates from the compromised system or network, instead of the attacker's system.) \"Zombie\" computers are typically members of large botnets that can\u2013amongst other things\u2013launch denial-of-service attacks, distribute email spam, and conduct click fraud.In some instances, rootkits provide desired functionality, and may be installed intentionally on behalf of the computer user:\n\nDetect attacks, for example, in a honeypot.\nEnhance emulation software and security software. Alcohol 120% and Daemon Tools are commercial examples of non-hostile rootkits used to defeat copy-protection mechanisms such as SafeDisc and SecuROM. Kaspersky antivirus software also uses techniques resembling rootkits to protect itself from malicious actions. It loads its own drivers to intercept system activity, and then prevents other processes from doing harm to itself. Its processes are not hidden, but cannot be terminated by standard methods.\nAnti-theft protection: Laptops may have BIOS-based rootkit software that will periodically report to a central authority, allowing the laptop to be monitored, disabled or wiped of information in the event that it is stolen.\nBypassing Microsoft Product Activation\n\n== Types ==\n\nThere are at least five types of rootkit, ranging from those at the lowest level in firmware (with the highest privileges), through to the least privileged user-based variants that operate in Ring 3. Hybrid combinations of these may occur spanning, for example, user mode and kernel mode.\n\n\n*** User mode ***\n\nUser-mode rootkits run in Ring 3, along with other applications as user, rather than low-level system processes. They have a number of possible installation vectors to intercept and modify the standard behavior of application programming interfaces (APIs). Some inject a dynamically linked library (such as a .DLL file on Windows, or a .dylib file on Mac OS X) into other processes, and are thereby able to execute inside any target process to spoof it; others with sufficient privileges simply overwrite the memory of a target application. Injection mechanisms include:\nUse of vendor-supplied application extensions. For example, Windows Explorer has public interfaces that allow third parties to extend its functionality.\nInterception of messages.\nDebuggers.\nExploitation of security vulnerabilities.\nFunction hooking or patching of commonly used APIs, for example, to hide a running process or file that resides on a filesystem....since user mode applications all run in their own memory space, the rootkit needs to perform this patching in the memory space of every running application. In addition, the rootkit needs to monitor the system for any new applications that execute and patch those programs' memory space before they fully execute.\n\n\n*** Kernel mode ***\nKernel-mode rootkits run with the highest operating system privileges (Ring 0) by adding code or replacing portions of the core operating system, including both the kernel and associated device drivers. Most operating systems support kernel-mode device drivers, which execute with the same privileges as the operating system itself. As such, many kernel-mode rootkits are developed as device drivers or loadable modules, such as loadable kernel modules in Linux or device drivers in Microsoft Windows. This class of rootkit has unrestricted security access, but is more difficult to write. The complexity makes bugs common, and any bugs in code operating at the kernel level may seriously impact system stability, leading to discovery of the rootkit. One of the first widely known kernel rootkits was developed for Windows NT 4.0 and released in Phrack magazine in 1999 by Greg Hoglund. Kernel rootkits can be especially difficult to detect and remove because they operate at the same security level as the operating system itself, and are thus able to intercept or subvert the most trusted operating system operations. Any software, such as antivirus software, running on the compromised system is equally vulnerable. In this situation, no part of the system can be trusted.\nA rootkit can modify data structures in the Windows kernel using a method known as direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM). This method can be used to hide processes. A kernel mode rootkit can also hook the System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT), or modify the gates between user mode and kernel mode, in order to cloak itself. Similarly for the Linux operating system, a rootkit can modify the system call table to subvert kernel functionality. It is common that a rootkit creates a hidden, encrypted filesystem in which it can hide other malware or original copies of files it has infected. Operating systems are evolving to counter the threat of kernel-mode rootkits. For example, 64-bit editions of Microsoft Windows now implement mandatory signing of all kernel-level drivers in order to make it more difficult for untrusted code to execute with the highest privileges in a system.\n\n\n**** Bootkits ****\nA kernel-mode rootkit variant called a bootkit can infect startup code like the Master Boot Record (MBR), Volume Boot Record (VBR), or boot sector, and in this way can be used to attack full disk encryption systems.\nAn example of such an attack on disk encryption is the \"evil maid attack\", in which an attacker installs a bootkit on an unattended computer. The envisioned scenario is a maid sneaking into the hotel room where the victims left their hardware. The bootkit replaces the legitimate boot loader with one under their control. Typically the malware loader persists through the transition to protected mode when the kernel has loaded, and is thus able to subvert the kernel. For example, the \"Stoned Bootkit\" subverts the system by using a compromised boot loader to intercept encryption keys and passwords. In 2010, the Alureon rootkit has successfully subverted the requirement for 64-bit kernel-mode driver signing in Windows 7, by modifying the master boot record. Although not malware in the sense of doing something the user doesn't want, certain \"Vista Loader\" or \"Windows Loader\" software work in a similar way by injecting an ACPI SLIC (System Licensed Internal Code) table in the RAM-cached version of the BIOS during boot, in order to defeat the Windows Vista and Windows 7 activation process. This vector of attack was rendered useless in the (non-server) versions of Windows 8, which use a unique, machine-specific key for each system, that can only be used by that one machine. Many antivirus companies provide free utilities and programs to remove bootkits.\n\n\n*** Hypervisor level ***\nRootkits have been created as Type II Hypervisors in academia as proofs of concept. By exploiting hardware virtualization features such as Intel VT or AMD-V, this type of rootkit runs in Ring -1 and hosts the target operating system as a virtual machine, thereby enabling the rootkit to intercept hardware calls made by the original operating system. Unlike normal hypervisors, they do not have to load before the operating system, but can load into an operating system before promoting it into a virtual machine. A hypervisor rootkit does not have to make any modifications to the kernel of the target to subvert it; however, that does not mean that it cannot be detected by the guest operating system. For example, timing differences may be detectable in CPU instructions. The \"SubVirt\" laboratory rootkit, developed jointly by Microsoft and University of Michigan researchers, is an academic example of a virtual-machine\u2013based rootkit (VMBR),\nwhile Blue Pill software is another. In 2009, researchers from Microsoft and North Carolina State University demonstrated a hypervisor-layer anti-rootkit called Hooksafe, which provides generic protection against kernel-mode rootkits. Windows 10 introduced a new feature called \"Device Guard\", that takes advantage of virtualization to provide independent external protection of an operating system against rootkit-type malware.\n\n\n*** Firmware and hardware ***\nA firmware rootkit uses device or platform firmware to create a persistent malware image in hardware, such as a router, network card, hard drive, or the system BIOS. The rootkit hides in firmware, because firmware is not usually inspected for code integrity. John Heasman demonstrated the viability of firmware rootkits in both ACPI firmware routines and in a PCI expansion card ROM. In October 2008, criminals tampered with European credit-card-reading machines before they were installed. The devices intercepted and transmitted credit card details via a mobile phone network. In March 2009, researchers Alfredo Ortega and Anibal Sacco published details of a BIOS-level Windows rootkit that was able to survive disk replacement and operating system re-installation. A few months later they learned that some laptops are sold with a legitimate rootkit, known as Absolute CompuTrace or Absolute LoJack for Laptops, preinstalled in many BIOS images. This is an anti-theft technology system that researchers showed can be turned to malicious purposes.Intel Active Management Technology, part of Intel vPro, implements out-of-band management, giving administrators remote administration, remote management, and remote control of PCs with no involvement of the host processor or BIOS, even when the system is powered off. Remote administration includes remote power-up and power-down, remote reset, redirected boot, console redirection, pre-boot access to BIOS settings, programmable filtering for inbound and outbound network traffic, agent presence checking, out-of-band policy-based alerting, access to system information, such as hardware asset information, persistent event logs, and other information that is stored in dedicated memory (not on the hard drive) where it is accessible even if the OS is down or the PC is powered off. Some of these functions require the deepest level of rootkit, a second non-removable spy computer built around the main computer. Sandy Bridge and future chipsets have \"the ability to remotely kill and restore a lost or stolen PC via 3G\". Hardware rootkits built into the chipset can help recover stolen computers, remove data, or render them useless, but they also present privacy and security concerns of undetectable spying and redirection by management or hackers who might gain control.\n\n== Installation and cloaking ==\nRootkits employ a variety of techniques to gain control of a system; the type of rootkit influences the choice of attack vector.

Lightweight operating systems such as Windows PE, Windows Recovery Console, Windows Recovery Environment, BartPE, or Live Distros can be used for this purpose, allowing the system to be \"cleaned\". Even if the type and nature of a rootkit is known, manual repair may be impractical, while re-installing the operating system and applications is safer, simpler and quicker.\n\n== Defenses ==\nSystem hardening represents one of the first layers of defence against a rootkit, to prevent it from being able to install. Applying security patches, implementing the principle of least privilege, reducing the attack surface and installing antivirus software are some standard security best practices that are effective against all classes of malware. New secure boot specifications like UEFI have been designed to address the threat of bootkits, but even these are vulnerable if the security features they offer are not utilized. For server systems, remote server attestation using technologies such as Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) provide a way of verifying that servers remain in a known good state. For example, Microsoft Bitlocker's encryption of data-at-rest verifies that servers are in a known \"good state\" on bootup. PrivateCore vCage is a software offering that secures data-in-use (memory) to avoid bootkits and rootkits by verifying servers are in a known \"good\" state on bootup. The PrivateCore implementation works in concert with Intel TXT and locks down server system interfaces to avoid potential bootkits and rootkits."

Both primary groups involved made attempts to hack into the opposing group's networks, across the Internet, X.25, and telephone networks. In a panel debate of The Next HOPE conference, Phiber Optik re-iterated that the rumored \"gang war in cyberspace\" between Legion of Doom and Masters of Deception never happened, and that it was \"a complete fabrication\" by the U.S attorney's office and some sensationalist media. Furthermore, two other high-ranking members of the LOD confirmed that the \"Great Hacker War\" never occurred, reinforcing the idea that this was just a competition of one-upmanship and not a war.\n\n== Timeline ==\nThe Great Hacker War escalated in the space of only a few days with four key events.\n\n\n*** Event One ***\nThe Great Hacker War began with the closing of an invite-only bulletin board called \"Fifth Amendment,\" whose participants were some of the world's most successful hackers. \nSaid board was run by members of the newly reformed LOD under the leadership of Chris Goggans (aka Erik Bloodaxe) and Loyd Blankenship (aka The Mentor).\nThe board's closing had been blamed on John Lee (\"Corrupt\") of the MOD in a cryptic message left to users. Chris Goggans (LOD) had claimed that Lee had been distributing information that was discussed on the board. MOD had discovered that Chris Goggans and his friends had decided to use the information being posted on the board to start a security company and contact all companies being discussed about the security flaws posted on Fifth Amendment.\n\n\n*** Event Two ***\nA few prank phone calls to the home number of the new LOD upset Goggans and prompted him to put out a call to find the personal information of the members of the MOD. Peacemakers intervened, and a conference call was arranged on an unnamed RBOC telephone bridge in the Midwest. As members of the MOD silently joined the conference call, they overheard the members of the LOD using racial slurs to describe the ethnicity of members of the MOD. The peace conference quickly degenerated into threats and prank calls to members of the LOD, whose personal information had already been uncovered by the MOD.\n\n\n*** Event Three ***\nA last-minute, late-night peace talk was held between Chris Goggans (LOD) and Mark Abene (\"Phiber Optik\") of MOD. Unknown to Goggans, John Lee (\"Corrupt\") was listening in on three-way. Goggans became angry that Abene would not fulfill his numerous demands for the personal information of MOD members, and for the MOD's hacking information that he considered the property of LOD.\nAbene refused to meet Goggans's demands, and Goggans uttered his infamous phrase that began the war in earnest \u2013 \"MOD is nothing but niggers, spics, and white trash.\" That night, prank phone calls began to flood Abene's house.\n\n\n*** Event Four ***\nThe members of the MOD decided to eavesdrop on Chris Goggans's phone calls to determine his motives. Using the undocumented remote headset feature on a DMS-100 phone switch local to Goggans, the MOD overheard what they had suspected earlier. Goggans, Scott Chasin (\"Doc Holiday\"), and Jake Kenyon Shulman (\"Malefactor\") had decided to form a security company called ComSec.\n\n\n*** Epilogue ***\nIn 1991, Phiber Optik, while attending the first CFP conference in San Francisco with Craig Neidorf, was invited to join a telephone conference bridge by fellow hackers where an apologetic Shulman expressed his remorse at how the situation had been blown out of proportion and his view that Goggans had crossed the line in informing on other hackers to law enforcement to increase the prestige of ComSec. Further, it was suspected by other LOD members that Goggans had baited Phoenix of the Australian hacker group The Realm, and was instrumental in providing evidence to Australian federal authorities. As a result, Phiber, a friend of Phoenix's, received a conference call from several original LOD members now suspicious of Goggans, wondering if they had been implicated by Goggans or other informants in Abene's pending legal case, in addition to expressing their general distaste and distrust of Goggans. In 1993 at the third CFP conference, also in San Francisco, Phiber/Abene met a small handful of his old LOD friends (minus Goggans) for the first time in person despite having been friends for nearly ten years by that point, and briefly reminisced about old times. Some years later in a public statement, Goggans would show some regret that he involved Abene in his testimonials to law enforcement. Perhaps the one thing in all this that Phiber and Lex Luthor agree on is that in reality, there simply was no \"Great Hacker War\", and that the notion of \"warring hacker gangs\" was an invention of overzealous law enforcement which was latched onto by irresponsible mass media because the imagery made for good copy.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question.

    "instruction": "Air gap (networking)\n\n==Introduction==\nAn air gap, air wall, air gapping or disconnected network is a network security measure employed on one or more computers to ensure that a secure computer network is physically isolated from unsecured networks, such as the public Internet or an unsecured local area network. It means a computer or network has no network interface controllers connected to other networks, with a physical or conceptual air gap, analogous to the air gap used in plumbing to maintain water quality.\n\n\n\n== Use in classified settings ==\nAn air-gapped computer or network is one that has no network interfaces, either wired or wireless, connected to outside networks.  Many computers, even when they are not plugged into a wired network, have a wireless network interface controller (WiFi) and are connected to nearby wireless networks to access the Internet and update software.  This represents a security vulnerability, so air-gapped computers either have their wireless interface controller permanently disabled or physically removed.  To move data between the outside world and the air-gapped system, it is necessary to write data to a physical medium such as a thumbdrive, and physically move it between computers.  Physical access has to be controlled (man identity and storage media itself). It is easier to control than a direct full network interface, which can be attacked from the exterior insecure system and, if malware infects the secure system, can be used to export secure data. That's why some new hardware technologies are also available like unidirectional data diodes or bidirectional diodes (also called electronic airgaps), that physically separate the network and transportation layers and copy and filter the application data.    \nIn environments where networks or devices are rated to handle different levels of classified information, the two disconnected devices or networks are referred to as low side and high side, low being unclassified and high referring to classified, or classified at a higher level.  This is also occasionally referred to as red (classified) and black (unclassified).  Access policies are often based on the Bell\u2013LaPadula confidentiality model, where data can be moved low-to-high with minimal security measures, while high-to-low requires much more stringent procedures to ensure protection of the data at a higher level of classification. In some cases (for instance industrial critical systems), the policy is different: data can be moved from high-to-low with minimal security measures, but low-to-high requires a high level of procedures to ensure integrity of the industrial safety system.  \nThe concept represents nearly the maximum protection one network can have from another (save turning the device off).  One way to transfer data between the outside world and the air-gapped system is to copy data on a removable storage medium such as a removable disk or USB flash drive and physically carry the storage to the other system. This access still has to be carefully controlled since USB drive may have vulnerabilities (see below). The upside to this is that such a network can generally be regarded as a closed system (in terms of information, signals, and emissions security), unable to be accessed from the outside world. The downside is that transferring information (from the outside world) to be analyzed by computers on the secure network is extraordinarily labor-intensive, often involving human security analysis of prospective programs or data to be entered onto air-gapped networks and possibly even human manual re-entry of the data following security analysis. That's why another way to transfer data, used in appropriate situations like critical industries, is to use data diodes and electronic airgaps, that assure a physical cut of the network by a specific hardware.\nSophisticated computer viruses for use in cyberwarfare, such as Stuxnet and agent.btz have been designed to infect air-gapped systems by exploiting security holes related to the handling of removable media. The possibility of using acoustic communication has also been demonstrated by researchers. Researchers have also demonstrated the feasibility of data exfiltration using FM frequency signals.\n\n== Examples ==\nExamples of the types of networks or systems that may be air gapped include:\n\nMilitary/governmental computer networks/systems;\nFinancial computer systems, such as stock exchanges;\nIndustrial control systems, such as SCADA in Oil & Gas fields;\nNational and state lottery game machines or random number generators, which are required to be completely isolated from networks to prevent lottery fraud\nLife-critical systems, such as:\nControls of nuclear power plants;\nComputers used in aviation, such as FADECs, air traffic control systems, and avionics;\nComputerized medical equipment;\nVery simple systems, where there is no need to compromise security in the first place, such as:\nThe engine control unit and other devices on the CAN bus in an automobile;\nA digital thermostat for temperature and compressor regulation in home HVAC and refrigeration systems;\nElectronic sprinkler controls for watering of lawns.Many of these systems have since added features that connect them during limited periods of time to the organisation's internet (for the need of surveillance or updates) or the public internet, and are no longer effectively and permanently air gapped, including thermostats with internet connections and automobiles with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and cellular phone connectivity.\n\n== Limitations ==\nLimitations imposed on devices used in these environments may include a ban on wireless connections to or from the secure network, or similar restrictions on EM leakage from the secure network through the use of TEMPEST or a Faraday cage.\nDespite a lack of direct connection to other systems, air-gapped networks have been shown to be vulnerable to attack in various circumstances.\nScientists in 2013 demonstrated the viability of air gap malware designed to defeat air gap isolation using acoustic signaling. Shortly after that, network security researcher Dragos Ruiu's BadBIOS received press attention.In 2014, researchers introduced AirHopper, a bifurcated attack pattern showing the feasibility of data exfiltration from an isolated computer to a nearby mobile phone, using FM frequency signals.In 2015, BitWhisper, a covert signaling channel between air-gapped computers using thermal manipulations was introduced. BitWhisper supports bidirectional communication and requires no additional dedicated peripheral hardware.Later in 2015, researchers introduced GSMem, a method for exfiltrating data from air-gapped computers over cellular frequencies. The transmission - generated by a standard internal bus - renders the computer into a small cellular transmitter antenna.ProjectSauron malware discovered in 2016 demonstrates how an infected USB device can be used to remotely leak data off of an air-gapped computer. The malware remained undetected for 5 years and relied on hidden partitions on a USB drive not visible to Windows as a transport channel between the air-gapped computer and a computer connected to the internet, presumably as a way to share files between the two systems.NFCdrip was the name given to the discovery of stealthy data exfiltration through NFC (Near-field communication) radio abuse and signal detection in 2018. Although NFC enables devices to establish effective communication by bringing them within a few centimeters of each other, researchers showed that it can be abused to transmit information at a much longer range than expected - up to 100 meters.In general, malware can exploit various hardware combinations to leak sensitive information from air-gapped systems using \"air-gap covert channels\". These hardware combinations use a number of different media to bridge the air-gap, including: acoustic, light, seismic, magnetic, thermal, and radio-frequency.\n\n== Software updates ==\nFrom a security perspective, the main drawback of an air gapped network is the inability of software to automatically self update. Users and system administrators must instead download and install updates manually. If a strict update routine is not followed, this results in out-of-date software running on the network, which may contain known security vulnerabilities. If an adversary manages to gain access to the air gapped network (for instance by contacting a disgruntled employee or using social engineering) they may be able to quickly spread within the air gapped network using such vulnerabilities with a possibly higher success rate than on the public Internet.\nSystem administrators may manage software updates in an air gapped network using dedicated solutions such as Windows Server Update Services or network logon scripts. Such mechanisms would allow all computers on the air gapped network to automatically install updates after the system administrator downloads the updates from the Internet once. The problem is not completely eliminated though, especially if users have administrative privileges on their local workstations and are therefore able to install software which is not centrally managed. The presence of IoT devices requiring firmware updates can also complicate matters, since often such updates cannot be centrally managed.\nQ: What is a Faraday cage and how is it used in air-gapped networks?",

The website was monetized via advertisements and through a tiered membership program where members with higher tiers would receive elevated access to the forum and its contents.\n\n\n\n== Domain seizure ==\nThe domain and its contents were seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on April 12, 2022 after a month of downtime, in collaboration with the United States Secret Service, the United States Department of Justice, and a variety of other national and international law enforcement agencies.\n\n== Administration ==\nThe website was allegedly founded by a 21-year old Portuguese national, Diogo Santos Coelho under the screen name \"Omnipotent\", who was arrested on January 31, 2022 in the United Kingdom. His arrest occurred pending several years of investigation after several of his devices were searched under warrant at the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in June 2018, suggesting he was the owner and primary administrator \"Omnipotent\". According to hackread.com, a separate administrator under screen name \"Jaw\" announced the seizure officially on the forum's public Telegram channel, and redirected subscribers of the channel to RaidForums' backup domain rf.to, which however went offline (and has remained offline for months) after this statement, only becoming reachable again after Diogo Santos Coelho's release on bail in August 2022.\n\n== Impact ==\nAt the time of its closure in 2022, the forum had over 530,000 registered users and was one of the most prolific and easily accessible clearnet illicit hacking forums."

    "instruction": "2017 Macron e-mail leaks\n\n==Introduction==\nThe 2017 Macron e-mail leaks were leaks of more than 20,000 e-mails related to the campaign of Emmanuel Macron during the 2017 French presidential elections, two days before the final vote. The leaks garnered an abundance of media attention due to how quickly news of the leak spread throughout the Internet, aided in large part by bots and spammers and drew accusations that the government of Russia under Vladimir Putin was responsible. The e-mails were shared by WikiLeaks and several American alt-right activists through social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, and 4chan.Originally posted on a filesharing site called PasteBin, the e-mails had little to no effect on the final vote as they were dumped just hours before a 44-hour media blackout that is legally required by French electoral law.The campaign said the e-mails had been \"fraudulently obtained\" and that false documents were mingled with genuine ones in order \"to create confusion and misinformation.\" Numerama, an online publication focusing on digital life, described the leaked material as \"utterly mundane\", consisting of \"the contents of a hard drive and several emails of co-workers and En Marche political officials.\" United States Senator from Virginia, Mark Warner cited the e-mail leak as a reinforcement of the cause behind the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Nonetheless, the Russian government denied all allegations of foreign electoral intervention.\n\n== Background ==\n\nAfter the first round of the 2017 French presidential election produced no majority winner, the top two candidates proceeded to a runoff election to be held on 7 May of that year. Emmanuel Macron of the En Marche! party and Marine Le Pen of the National Front both began campaigning across France on their competing points of view. The election was characterized by widespread dissatisfaction with the administration of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and the French governmental establishment as a whole.The election was widely regarded as a referendum between the internationalist centrism of Macron and the populist far-right ideology of Le Pen. After a slew of events considered to be detrimental to globalization and a triumph of nationalism and isolationism, such as the Brexit referendum, and the election of Donald Trump, many international observers viewed the French election as another possible trendsetting event for Western politics. Le Pen's anti-immigration, anti-NATO, and anti-European Union stances attracted her the widespread support of far-right politicians and activists as far as the United States, like Donald Trump, and raised questions about possible appeasement of Russia. Russia-funded media outlets such as Russia Today and Sputnik News consistently portrayed Le Pen in a positive light, and her campaign had even secured millions of Euros from a Russian lender in 2014.In the United States, Le Pen was praised by President Donald Trump on several occasions, and she saw widespread support and praise by large numbers of online conservative trolls and Internet alt-right activists on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and 4chan, who simultaneously attacked Macron.\nThese trolls used spamming of Internet memes and misinformation as tactics to assail Macron; accusing him of being a \"globalist puppet\" and a supporter of Islamic immigration. This was not a new strategy, it had been executed to much success during the 2016 United States presidential election. Legions of pro-Trump Internet users and bots had spammed social media and rapidly spread anti-Clinton news releases and leaks across the web as was the case with the Democratic National Committee leaks and the John Podesta e-mail leaks, allegedly with aid from the Kremlin. Prior to the election, American national security officials warned the French government of the high probability of Russian digital meddling in the election, according to the Director of the National Security Agency, Mike Rogers.\n\n== E-mail leaks ==\nOn Friday 5 May 2017, two days before the scheduled vote in the presidential election, the campaign of Emmanuel Macron claimed that it had been the target of a \"massive hack\". At the same time at least 9 gigabytes of data were dumped on an anonymous file sharing site called Pastebin using a profile called 'EMLEAKS'. The drop was made just hours before an election media blackout was due to take place in advance of Sunday's elections, as legally mandated under French electoral law which prevented Macron from issuing an effective response but also limited media coverage of the hack and subsequent leak. The e-mails, totaling 21,075, along with other data was quickly posted to the anonymous message board, 4chan, where it was shared by alt-right activists, notably Jack Posobiec, on Twitter  who had them translated by the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois wing of right-wing outlet The Rebel Media. It has been remarked that at that time, Rebel Media's Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois wing consisted solely of radio personality \u00c9ric Duhaime.The e-mail leak spread swiftly under the hashtag #MacronLeaks on Twitter and Facebook. Within three and a half hours of first being used, #MacronLeaks had reached 47,000 tweets. On Jack Posobiec's Twitter, the hashtag was retweeted 87 times within five minutes, likely pointing to the use of bots. WikiLeaks mentioned the leaks in subsequent tweets 15 times, contributing the most to the news' spread. Within a short period of time, #MacronLeaks was trending in France and was on a banner on the Drudge Report homepage. In another sign of bot use the ten most active accounts using the #MacronLeaks hashtag posted over 1,300 tweets in just over three hours. One particular account, posted 294 tweets in a span of two hours. Analysis shows that the hashtag was mentioned more times by American accounts than French ones, but posts concerning them were, by a slim margin, written more often in French than English.The leaked e-mails were claimed to show evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Macron and his campaign including the committing of tax evasion and election fraud. A less suggestive examination of the e-mails by Numerama, a French online publication focusing on technological news, described the leaked emails as \"utterly mundane\", consisting of \"the contents of a hard drive and several emails of co-workers and En Marche political officials.\" Leaked documents included \"memos, bills, loans for amounts that are hardly over-the-top, recommendations and other reservations, amidst, of course, exchanges that are strictly personal and private \u2014 personal notes on the rain and sunshine, a confirmation email for the publishing of a book, reservation of a table for friends, etc.\"\n\n\n*** Reaction ***\nIn response to the attack, Emmanuel Macron said it was \"democratic destabilisation, like that seen during the last presidential campaign in the United States\" and said the hackers had mixed falsified documents with genuine ones, \"in order to sow doubt and disinformation.\" Vice President of the National Front Florian Philippot and Le Pen adviser said in a tweet, \"Will #MacronLeaks teach us something that investigative journalism has deliberately killed?\" The French election commission warned media in the country that publishing the e-mails or discussing them so close to the election would be a violation of the law and issued a statement that in part read, \"On the eve of the most important election for our institutions, the commission calls on everyone present on internet sites and social networks, primarily the media, but also all citizens, to show responsibility and not to pass on this content, so as not to distort the sincerity of the ballot.\" The leak did not appear to have any impact on the French presidential election which continued as scheduled and ended with a Macron victory by a margin of 32%. Despite this, French security officials commenced an investigation into the hacking shortly after the election.Shortly after the alt-right media boosted the leak, chief of Macron's campaign Mounir Mahjoubi stated that they have been watching GRU hacking attempts since February, and let them steal a carefully prepared cache of trivial and forged documents. After this was confirmed against the leaks contents, its credibility was seriously undermined.In the United States, U.S. Senator from Virginia and ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner said the hacking and subsequent leak only emboldened his committee's investigation, and former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said in a tweet, \"Victory for Macron, for France, the EU, & the world. Defeat to those interfering w/democracy. (But the media says I can't talk about that).\"\n\n== Perpetrators ==\n\nAn assessment by Flashpoint, an American cybersecurity firm, stated that they determined with \"moderate confidence\" that the group behind the hacking and leak was APT28, better known as 'Fancy Bear', a hacking group with ties to Russian military intelligence. Metadata pulled from the dump revealed the name 'Georgy Petrovich Roshka', likely an alias, which has ties to a Moscow-based intelligence contractor. Many similarities, including the use of social media bots in an attempt to scrub metadata, also pointed to Fancy Bear. However, on 1 June 2017, Guillaume Poupard, the head of France's premier cybersecurity agency said in an interview with the Associated Press the hack, \"was so generic and simple that it could have been practically anyone\". On 9 May, two days after the election, Mike Rogers, head of the NSA, said in sworn testimony with the United States Senate he had been made aware of Russian attempts to hack French election infrastructure, though he did not mention anything related to the identities of those behind the Macron email hacking. This followed a French announcement that electronic voting for France's overseas citizens would be discontinued in light of cybersecurity threats.According to the Le Monde newspaper and with the work based on non-public rapport of Google and FireEye, the GRU is responsible.Vladimir Putin has denied claims of election interference, claiming Russia has also been targeted.\nQuestion: What tactics were used to spread the 2017 Macron e-mail leaks on social media?",

Bitdefender develops and delivers cybersecurity products and services, including endpoint protection, cloud and managed security, antivirus software and IoT security. Bitdefender products are distributed through partners in over 150 countries and the US market is estimated to generate more than 40% of its revenues.

It offers a range of products and services including endpoint protection, cloud security, and managed detection & response. Its flagship product is Bitdefender Antivirus which protects against viruses, spyware, malware, phishing attacks, ransomware, and other threats.\n\n== Fighting cyber-crime ==\nBitdefender advises Europol's European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) in supporting investigations into criminal activity in cyberspace, sharing relevant data and knowledge about disruption, prevention, investigation and prosecution.

These files were all marked as 'Trojan.FakeAlert.5' and were moved into quarantine. This action led to software and systems malfunctions that affected users around the world.  Bitdefender representatives announced the removal of the faulty update and a workaround for the users affected, except for those using the 2008 version.\n\n\n*** DarkSide ransomware ***\nIn 2021, Bitdefender was accused of self-promotion when releasing and publicly announcing a decryptor to the detriment of actual victims with regards to DarkSide, a hacking group.  In 2020, DarkSide switched their main encryption ransomware product over to an \"affiliate\" model wherein other attackers could download and use their software in exchange for a portion of the profits.  However, they introduced a bug in the process where affiliate hackers would all use the same private RSA key - meaning that a decryption package for a single target who paid the ransom would work on any target that had the ransomware installed.  Security researchers noticed and were quietly already helping victims of the software, but with no public notice, making it so that the attackers would only see an inexplicable decrease in ransom payments that could be written off as chance. At about the same time, Bitdefender researchers developed a decryptor and issued a blog post in January 2021 describing the flaw and offering the decryptor as a free download, in order to make as many organizations as possible aware of its existence to reduce the impact of Darkside ransomware attacks. This was criticized in an article in the MIT Technology Review: claiming, first, Bitdefender's program wasn't even safe - it was flawed and would \"damage\" files decrypted with it due to bugs within it. Second, the blog post tipped off DarkSide as to the nature of the flaw; DarkSide promptly patched the bug and sarcastically thanked Bitdefender for pointing it out, then went on with their campaign of extortion.  A notable incident that took place after Bitdefender's public disclosure was the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack in May 2021.  While the security researchers who had been using the flaw before acknowledge that it's probable DarkSide would eventually have noticed and fixed the issue, they still criticized Bitdefender for using the bug merely for a brief burst of publicity, rather than in the way that would most help victims of the scheme.

The article and blog post triggered a discussion among cybersecurity professionals about the pros and cons of publicly disclosing decryptors.\n\n\n*** REvil Ransomware ***\nIn September 2021, Bitdefender published a universal decryptor utility that will help past victims of the REvil ransomware  recover their encrypted files.\n\nWhat was the name of the faulty update that affected computers running Bitdefender under 64-bit versions of Windows in 2010?",

The article and blog post triggered a discussion among cybersecurity professionals about the pros and cons of publicly disclosing decryptors.\n\n\n*** REvil Ransomware ***\nIn September 2021, Bitdefender published a universal decryptor utility that will help past victims of the REvil ransomware  recover their encrypted files."

    "instruction": "DNS over TLS\n\n==Introduction==\nDNS over TLS (DoT) is a network security protocol for encrypting and wrapping Domain Name System (DNS) queries and answers via the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. The goal of the method is to increase user privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data via man-in-the-middle attacks. The well-known port number for DoT is 853.\nWhile DNS-over-TLS is applicable to any DNS transaction, it was first standardized for use between stub or forwarding resolvers and recursive resolvers, in RFC 7858 in May of 2016. Subsequent IETF efforts specify the use of DoT between recursive and authoritative servers (\"Authoritative DNS-over-TLS\" or \"ADoT\") and a related implementation between authoritative servers (Zone Transfer-over-TLS or \"xfr-over-TLS\").\n\n== Server software ==\nBIND supports DoT connections as of version 9.17. Earlier versions offered DoT capability by proxying through stunnel. Unbound has supported DNS over TLS since 22 January 2018. Unwind has supported DoT since 29 January 2019. With Android Pie's support for DNS over TLS, some ad blockers now support using the encrypted protocol as a relatively easy way to access their services versus any of the various work-around methods typically used such as VPNs and proxy servers.Simple DNS Plus, a resolving and authoritative DNS server for Windows, added support for DoT in version 9.0 released 28 September 2021.\n\n== Client software ==\nAndroid clients running Android 9 (Pie) or newer support DNS over TLS and will use it by default if the network infrastructure, for example the ISP, supports it.In April 2018, Google announced that Android Pie will include support for DNS over TLS, allowing users to set a DNS server phone-wide on both Wi-Fi and mobile connections, an option that was historically only possible on rooted devices. DNSDist, from PowerDNS, also announced support for DNS over TLS in version 1.3.0.Linux and Windows users can use DNS over TLS as a client through the NLnet Labs stubby daemon or Knot Resolver. Alternatively they may install getdns-utils to use DoT directly with the getdns_query tool. The unbound DNS resolver by NLnet Labs also supports DNS over TLS.Apple's iOS 14 introduced OS-level support for DNS over TLS (and DNS over HTTPS). iOS does not allow manual configuration of DoT servers, and requires the use of a third-party application to make configuration changes.systemd-resolved is a Linux-only implementation that can be configured to use DNS over TLS, by editing /etc/systemd/resolved.conf and enabling the setting DNSOverTLS. Most major Linux distributions have systemd installed by default.personalDNSfilter is an open source DNS filter with support for DoT and DNS over HTTPS (DoH) for Java-enabled devices including Android.\nNebulo is an open source DNS changer application for Android which supports both DoT and DoH.\n\n== Public resolvers ==\nDNS-over-TLS was first implemented in a public recursive resolver by Quad9 in 2017. Other recursive resolver operators such as Google and Cloudflare followed suit in subsequent years, and now it is a broadly-supported feature generally available in most large recursive resolvers.\n\n== Criticisms and implementation considerations ==\nDoT can impede analysis and monitoring of DNS traffic for cybersecurity purposes. DoT has been used to bypass parental controls which operate at the (unencrypted) standard DNS level; Circle, a parental control router which relies on DNS queries to check domains against a blocklist, blocks DoT by default due to this. However, there are DNS providers that offer filtering and parental controls along with support for both DoT and DoH. In that scenario, DNS queries are checked against block lists once they are received by the provider rather than prior to leaving the user's router.\nAs with any communication, encryption of DNS requests by itself does not protect privacy. It protects against third-party observers, but does not guarantee what the endpoints do with the (then decrypted) data.\nDoT clients do not necessarily directly query any authoritative name servers. The client may rely on the DoT server using traditional (port 53 or 853) queries to finally reach authoritative servers. Thus, DoT does not qualify as an end-to-end encrypted protocol, only hop-to-hop encrypted and only if DNS over TLS is used consistently.\n\n== Alternatives ==\nDNS over HTTPS (DoH) is a similar protocol standard for encrypting DNS queries, differing only in the methods used for encryption and delivery from DoT. On the basis of privacy and security, whether or not a superior protocol exists among the two is a matter of controversial debate, while others argue the merits of either depend on the specific use case.DNSCrypt is another network protocol that authenticates and encrypts DNS traffic, although it was never proposed to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with a Request for Comments (RFC).\nQ: What is Nebulo and what features does it support?",

    "instruction": "Russian web brigades\n\n==Introduction==\nRussian web brigades (also called Russian trolls, Russian bots, Kremlinbots, Kremlins or Rustapar) are state-sponsored anonymous Internet political commentators and trolls linked to the Government of Russia. Participants report that they are organized into teams and groups of commentators that participate in Russian and international political blogs and Internet forums using sockpuppets, social bots and large-scale orchestrated trolling and disinformation campaigns to promote pro-Putin and pro-Russian propaganda. Articles on the Russian Wikipedia concerning the MH17 crash and the Russo-Ukrainian War were targeted by Russian internet propaganda outlets. In June 2019 a group of 12 editors introducing coordinated pro-government and anti-opposition bias was blocked on the Russian-language Wikipedia. During the war by Russia against Ukraine in 2022, Kremlin trolls were still active on many social platforms and were spreading disinformation related to the war events.Kremlin trolls are closely tied to the Internet Research Agency, a Saint Petersburg-based company run by Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is a close ally to Vladimir Putin and head of the mercenary Wagner Group, known for committing war crimes.\n\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe earliest documented allegations of the existence of \"web brigades\" appear to be in the April 2003 Vestnik Online article \"The Virtual Eye of Big Brother\" by French journalist Anna Polyanskaya (a former assistant to assassinated Russian politician Galina Starovoitova) and two other authors, Andrey Krivov and Ivan Lomako. The authors claim that up to 1998, contributions to forums on Russian Internet sites (Runet) predominantly reflected liberal and democratic values, but after 2000, the vast majority of contributions reflected totalitarian values. This sudden change was attributed to the appearance of teams of pro-Russian commenters who appeared to be organized by the Russian state security service. According to the authors, about 70% of Russian Internet posters were of generally liberal views prior to 1998\u20131999, while a surge of \"antidemocratic\" posts (about 60\u201380%) suddenly occurred at many Russian forums in 2000. This could also be a reflection to the fact that access to Internet among the general Russian population soared during this time, which was until then accessible only to some sections of the society.\nIn January 2012, a hacktivist group calling itself the Russian arm of Anonymous published a massive collection of email allegedly belonging to former and present leaders of the pro-Putin youth organization Nashi (including a number of government officials). Journalists who investigated the leaked information found that the pro-Putin movement had engaged in a range of activities including paying commentators to post content and hijacking blog ratings in the fall of 2011. The e-mails indicated that members of the \"brigades\" were paid 85 rubles (about US$3) or more per comment, depending on whether the comment received replies. Some were paid as much as 600,000 roubles (about US$21,000) for leaving hundreds of comments on negative press articles on the internet, and were presented with iPads. A number of high-profile bloggers were also mentioned as being paid for promoting Nashi and government activities. The Federal Youth Agency, whose head (and the former leader of Nashi) Vasily Yakemenko was the highest-ranking individual targeted by the leaks, refused to comment on the authenticity of the e-mails.In 2013, a Freedom House report stated that 22 of 60 countries examined have been using paid pro-government commentators to manipulate online discussions, and that Russia has been at the forefront of this practice for several years, along with China and Bahrain.  In the same year, Russian reporters investigated the St. Petersburg Internet Research Agency, which employs at least 400 people. They found that the agency covertly hired young people as \"Internet operators\" paid to write pro-Russian postings and comments, smearing opposition leader Alexei Navalny and U.S. politics and culture.\nEach commenter was to write no less than 100 comments a day, while people in the other room were to write four postings a day, which then went to the other employees whose job was to post them on social networks as widely as possible.Some Russian opposition journalists state that such practices create a chilling effect on the few independent media outlets remaining in the country.Further investigations were performed by Russian opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta and Institute of Modern Russia in 2014\u201315, inspired by the peak of activity of the pro-Russian brigades during the Russo-Ukrainian War and assassination of Boris Nemtsov. The effort of using \"troll armies\" to promote Putin's policies is reported to be a multimillion-dollar operation. According to an investigation by the British Guardian newspaper, the flood of pro-Russian comments is part of a coordinated \"informational-psychological war operation\". One Twitter bot network was documented to use more than 20,500 fake Twitter accounts to spam negative comments after the death of Boris Nemtsov and events related to the Ukrainian conflict.An article based on the original Polyanskaya article, authored by the Independent Customers' Association, was published in May 2008 at Expertiza.Ru. In this article the term web brigades is replaced by the term Team \"G\".During his presidency, Donald Trump retweeted a tweet by a fake account operated by Russians. In 2017, he was among almost 40 celebrities and politicians, along with over 3,000 global news outlets, identified to have inadvertently shared content from Russian troll-farm accounts.\n\n== Methods ==\nWeb brigades commentators sometimes leave hundreds of postings a day that criticize the country's opposition and promote Kremlin-backed policymakers. Commentators simultaneously react to discussions of \"taboo\" topics, including the historical role of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, political opposition, dissidents such as Mikhail Khodorkovsky, murdered journalists, and cases of international conflict or rivalry (with countries such as Estonia, Georgia, and Ukraine, but also with the foreign policies of the United States and the European Union). Prominent journalist and Russia expert Peter Pomerantsev believes Russia's efforts are aimed at confusing the audience, rather than convincing it. He states that they cannot censor information but can \"trash it with conspiracy theories and rumours\".To avert suspicions, the users sandwich political remarks between neutral articles on travelling, cooking and pets. They overwhelm comment sections of media to render meaningful dialogue impossible.\nThe effect created by such Internet trolls is not very big, but they manage to make certain forums meaningless because people stop commenting on the articles when these trolls sit there and constantly create an aggressive, hostile atmosphere toward those whom they don\u2019t like. The trolls react to certain news with torrents of mud and abuse. This makes it meaningless for a reasonable person to comment on anything there.\nA collection of leaked documents, published by Moy Rayon, suggests that work at the \"troll den\" is strictly regulated by a set of guidelines. Any blog post written by an agency employee, according to the leaked files, must contain \"no fewer than 700 characters\" during day shifts and \"no fewer than 1,000 characters\" on night shifts. Use of graphics and keywords in the post's body and headline is also mandatory. In addition to general guidelines, bloggers are also provided with \"technical tasks\" \u2013 keywords and talking points on specific issues, such as Ukraine, Russia's internal opposition and relations with the West. On an average working day, the workers are to post on news articles 50 times. Each blogger is to maintain six Facebook accounts publishing at least three posts a day and discussing the news in groups at least twice a day. By the end of the first month, they are expected to have won 500 subscribers and get at least five posts on each item a day. On Twitter, the bloggers are expected to manage 10 accounts with up to 2,000 followers and tweet 50 times a day.\n\n== Timeline ==\n\nIn 2015, Lawrence Alexander disclosed a network of propaganda websites sharing the same Google Analytics identifier and domain registration details, allegedly run by Nikita Podgorny from Internet Research Agency. The websites were mostly meme repositories focused on attacking Ukraine, Euromaidan, Russian opposition and Western policies. Other websites from this cluster promoted president Putin and Russian nationalism, and spread alleged news from Syria presenting anti-Western and pro-Bashar al-Assad viewpoints.In August 2015, Russian researchers correlated Google search statistics of specific phrases with their geographic origin, observing increases in specific politically loaded phrases (such as \"Poroshenko\", \"Maidan\", \"sanctions\") starting from 2013 and originating from very small, peripheral locations in Russia, such as Olgino, which also happens to be the headquarters of the Internet Research Agency company. The  Internet Research Agency also appears to be the primary sponsor of an anti-Western exhibition Material Evidence.Since 2015, Finnish reporter Jessikka Aro has inquired into web brigades and Russian trolls. In addition, Western journalists have referred to the phenomenon and have supported traditional media.In May 2019, it was reported that a study from the George Washington University found that Russian Twitter bots had tried to inflame the United States' anti-vaccination debate by posting opinions on both sides in 2018.In June 2019 a group of 12 editors introducing coordinated pro-government and anti-opposition bias was blocked on the Russian-language Wikipedia. In July 2019 two operatives of the Internet Research Agency were detained in Libya and charged with attempting to  influence local elections. They were reportedly employees of Alexander Malkevich, manager of USA Really, a propaganda website.In 2020, the research firm Graphika published a report detailing one particular Russian disinformation group codenamed \"Secondary Infektion\" (alluding to 80's Operation Infektion) operating running since 2014. Over 6 years the group published over 2,500 items in seven languages and to over 300 platforms such as social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit) and discussion forums. The group specialized in highly divisive topics regarding immigration, environment, politics, international relations and frequently used fake images presented as \"leaked documents\".Starting in February 2022, a special attempt was made to back the Russian war in Ukraine. Particular effort was made to target Facebook and YouTube.\n\n\n*** War in Ukraine 2022 ***\nIn May 2022, during the Russian war with Ukraine the trolls allegedly hired by Internet Research Agency (IRA) had reportedly extended their foothold into TikTok, spreading misinformation on war events and attempting to question or sow doubt about the Ukraine war. Authentic-looking profiles had allegedly hundreds of thousands of followers. IRA was reported to be active across different platforms, including Instagram and Telegram.\n\n== Literature ==\nJolanta Darczewska: The Anatomy of Russian Information Warfare: The Crimean Operation, a Case Study.

Other websites from this cluster promoted president Putin and Russian nationalism, and spread alleged news from Syria presenting anti-Western and pro-Bashar al-Assad viewpoints.In August 2015, Russian researchers correlated Google search statistics of specific phrases with their geographic origin, observing increases in specific politically loaded phrases (such as \"Poroshenko\", \"Maidan\", \"sanctions\") starting from 2013 and originating from very small, peripheral locations in Russia, such as Olgino, which also happens to be the headquarters of the Internet Research Agency company. The  Internet Research Agency also appears to be the primary sponsor of an anti-Western exhibition Material Evidence.Since 2015, Finnish reporter Jessikka Aro has inquired into web brigades and Russian trolls. In addition, Western journalists have referred to the phenomenon and have supported traditional media.In May 2019, it was reported that a study from the George Washington University found that Russian Twitter bots had tried to inflame the United States' anti-vaccination debate by posting opinions on both sides in 2018.In June 2019 a group of 12 editors introducing coordinated pro-government and anti-opposition bias was blocked on the Russian-language Wikipedia. In July 2019 two operatives of the Internet Research Agency were detained in Libya and charged with attempting to  influence local elections. They were reportedly employees of Alexander Malkevich, manager of USA Really, a propaganda website.In 2020, the research firm Graphika published a report detailing one particular Russian disinformation group codenamed \"Secondary Infektion\" (alluding to 80's Operation Infektion) operating running since 2014. Over 6 years the group published over 2,500 items in seven languages and to over 300 platforms such as social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit) and discussion forums. The group specialized in highly divisive topics regarding immigration, environment, politics, international relations and frequently used fake images presented as \"leaked documents\".Starting in February 2022, a special attempt was made to back the Russian war in Ukraine. Particular effort was made to target Facebook and YouTube.\n\n\n*** War in Ukraine 2022 ***\nIn May 2022, during the Russian war with Ukraine the trolls allegedly hired by Internet Research Agency (IRA) had reportedly extended their foothold into TikTok, spreading misinformation on war events and attempting to question or sow doubt about the Ukraine war. Authentic-looking profiles had allegedly hundreds of thousands of followers. IRA was reported to be active across different platforms, including Instagram and Telegram.\n\n== Literature ==\nJolanta Darczewska: The Anatomy of Russian Information Warfare: The Crimean Operation, a Case Study.

    "instruction": "Domain Name System Security Extensions\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are a suite of extension specifications by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for securing data exchanged in the Domain Name System (DNS) in Internet Protocol (IP) networks. The protocol provides cryptographic authentication of data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity, but not availability or confidentiality.\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe original design of the Domain Name System did not include any security features. It was conceived only as a scalable distributed system. The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) attempt to add security, while maintaining backward compatibility. RFC 3833 documents some of the known threats to the DNS, and their solutions in DNSSEC.\nDNSSEC was designed to protect applications using DNS from accepting forged or manipulated DNS data, such as that created by DNS cache poisoning. All answers from DNSSEC protected zones are digitally signed. By checking the digital signature, a DNS resolver is able to check if the information is identical (i.e. unmodified and complete) to the information published by the zone owner and served on an authoritative DNS server. While protecting IP addresses is the immediate concern for many users, DNSSEC can protect any data published in the DNS, including text records (TXT) and mail exchange records (MX), and can be used to bootstrap other security systems that publish references to cryptographic certificates stored in the DNS such as Certificate Records (CERT records, RFC 4398), SSH fingerprints (SSHFP, RFC 4255), IPSec public keys (IPSECKEY, RFC 4025), TLS Trust Anchors (TLSA, RFC 6698), or Encrypted Client Hello (SVCB/HTTPS records for ECH  ).\nDNSSEC does not provide confidentiality of data; in particular, all DNSSEC responses are authenticated but not encrypted. DNSSEC does not protect against DoS attacks directly, though it indirectly provides some benefit (because signature checking allows the use of potentially untrustworthy parties).Other standards (not DNSSEC) are used to secure bulk data (such as a DNS zone transfer) sent between DNS servers. As documented in IETF RFC 4367, some users and developers make false assumptions about DNS names, such as assuming that a company's common name plus \".com\" is always its domain name. DNSSEC cannot protect against false assumptions; it can only authenticate that the data is truly from or not available from the domain owner.The DNSSEC specifications (called DNSSEC-bis) describe the current DNSSEC protocol in great detail. See RFC 4033, RFC 4034, and RFC 4035. With the publication of these new RFCs (March 2005), an earlier RFC, RFC 2535 has become obsolete. The full set of RFCs that specify DNSSEC are collected in RFC 9364, which is also BCP 237.\nIt is widely believed that securing the DNS is critically important for securing the Internet as a whole, but deployment of DNSSEC specifically has been hampered (As of 22 January 2010) by several difficulties:\n\nThe need to design a backward-compatible standard that can scale to the size of the Internet\nPrevention of \"zone enumeration\" where desired\nDeployment of DNSSEC implementations across a wide variety of DNS servers and resolvers (clients)\nDisagreement among implementers over who should own the top-level domain root keys\nOvercoming the perceived complexity of DNSSEC and DNSSEC deployment\n\n== Operation ==\nDNSSEC works by digitally signing records for DNS lookup using public-key cryptography. The correct DNSKEY record is authenticated via a chain of trust, starting with a set of verified public keys for the DNS root zone which is the trusted third party. Domain owners generate their own keys, and upload them using their DNS control panel at their domain-name registrar, which in turn pushes the keys via secDNS to the zone operator (e.g., Verisign for .com) who signs and publishes them in DNS.\n\n\n*** Resource records ***\nDNS is implemented by the use of several resource records. To implement DNSSEC, several new DNS record types were created or adapted to use with DNSSEC:\n\nRRSIG (resource record signature)\nContains the DNSSEC signature for a record set. DNS resolvers verify the signature with a public key, stored in a DNSKEY record.\nDNSKEY\nContains the public key that a DNS resolver uses to verify DNSSEC signatures in RRSIG records.\nDS (delegation signer)\nHolds the name of a delegated zone. References a DNSKEY record in the sub-delegated zone. The DS record is placed in the parent zone along with the delegating NS records.\nNSEC (next secure record)\nContains a link to the next record name in the zone and lists the record types that exist for the record's name. DNS resolvers use NSEC records to verify the non-existence of a record name and type as part of DNSSEC validation.\nNSEC3 (next secure record version 3)\nContains links to the next record name in the zone (in hashed name sorting order) and lists the record types that exist for the name covered by the hash value in the first label of the NSEC3 record's own name. These records can be used by resolvers to verify the non-existence of a record name and type as part of DNSSEC validation. NSEC3 records are similar to NSEC records, but NSEC3 uses cryptographically hashed record names to avoid the enumeration of the record names in a zone.\nNSEC3PARAM (next secure record version 3 parameters)\nAuthoritative DNS servers use this record to calculate and determine which NSEC3 records to include in responses to DNSSEC requests for non-existing names/types.When DNSSEC is used, each answer to a DNS lookup contains an RRSIG DNS record, in addition to the record type that was requested.  The RRSIG record is a digital signature of the answer DNS resource record set. The digital signature is verified by locating the correct public key found in a DNSKEY record. The NSEC and NSEC3 records are used to provide cryptographic evidence of the non-existence of any Resource Record (RR). The DS record is used in the authentication of DNSKEYs in the lookup procedure using the chain of trust. NSEC and NSEC3 records are used for robust resistance against spoofing.\n\n\n**** Algorithms ****\nDNSSEC was designed to be extensible so that as attacks are discovered against existing algorithms, new ones can be introduced in a backward-compatible fashion as described in RFC 8624. The following table defines, as of June 2019, the security algorithms that are or were most often used:\n\n\n*** The lookup procedure ***\nFrom the results of a DNS lookup, a security-aware DNS resolver can determine whether the authoritative name server for the domain being queried supports DNSSEC, whether the answer it receives is secure, and whether there is some sort of error. The lookup procedure is different for recursive name servers such as those of many ISPs, and for stub resolvers such as those included by default in mainstream operating systems. Microsoft Windows uses a stub resolver, and Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 in particular use a non-validating but DNSSEC-aware stub resolver.\n\n\n**** Recursive name servers ****\nUsing the chain of trust model, a Delegation Signer (DS) record in a parent domain (DNS zone) can be used to verify a DNSKEY record in a subdomain, which can then contain other DS records to verify further subdomains. Say that a recursive resolver such as an ISP name server wants to get the IP addresses (A record and/or AAAA records) of the domain \"www.example.com\".\n\nThe process starts when a security-aware resolver sets the \"DO\" (\"DNSSEC OK\") flag bit in a DNS query. Since the DO bit is in the extended flag bits defined by Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS), RFC 6891, all DNSSEC transactions must support EDNS. EDNS support is also needed to allow for the much larger packet sizes that DNSSEC transactions require.\nWhen the resolver receives an answer via the normal DNS lookup process, it then checks to make sure that the answer is correct. Ideally, the security-aware resolver would start with verifying the DS and DNSKEY records at the DNS root. Then it would use the DS records for the \"com\" top-level domain found at the root to verify the DNSKEY records in the \"com\" zone. From there, it would see if there is a DS record for the \"example.com\" subdomain in the \"com\" zone, and if there were, it would then use the DS record to verify a DNSKEY record found in the \"example.com\" zone. Finally, it would verify the RRSIG record found in the answer for the A records for \"www.example.com\".There are several exceptions to the above example.\nFirst, if \"example.com\" does not support DNSSEC, there will be no RRSIG record in the answer and there will not be a DS record for \"example.com\" in the \"com\" zone.  If there is a DS record for \"example.com\", but no RRSIG record in the reply, something is wrong and maybe a man in the middle attack is going on, stripping the DNSSEC information and modifying the A records.  Or, it could be a broken security-oblivious name server along the way that stripped the DO flag bit from the query or the RRSIG record from the answer.  Or, it could be a configuration error.\nNext, it may be that there is not a domain name named \"www.example.com\", in which case instead of returning a RRSIG record in the answer, there will be either an NSEC record or an NSEC3 record.  These are \"next secure\" records that allow the resolver to prove that a domain name does not exist.  The NSEC/NSEC3 records have RRSIG records, which can be verified as above.\nFinally, it may be that the \"example.com\" zone implements DNSSEC, but either the \"com\" zone or the root zone do not, creating an \"island of security\" which needs to be validated in some other way. As of 15 July 2010, deployment of DNSSEC to root is completed. The .com domain was signed with valid security keys and the secure delegation was added to the root zone on 1 April 2011.\n\n\n**** Stub resolvers ****\nStub resolvers are \"minimal DNS resolvers that use recursive query mode to offload most of the work of DNS resolution to a recursive name server.\" A stub resolver will simply forward a request to a recursive name server, and use the Authenticated Data (AD) bit in the response as a \"hint to find out whether the recursive name server was able to validate signatures for all of the data in the Answer and Authority sections of the response.\" Microsoft Windows uses a stub resolver, and Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 in particular use a non-validating but AD-bit-aware stub resolver.A validating stub resolver can also potentially perform its own signature validation by setting the Checking Disabled (CD) bit in its query messages. A validating stub resolver uses the CD bit to perform its own recursive authentication. Using such a validating stub resolver gives the client end-to-end DNS security for domains implementing DNSSEC, even if the Internet service provider or the connection to them is not trusted.\nNon-validating stub resolvers must rely on external DNSSEC validation services, such as those controlled by the user's Internet service provider or a public recursive name server, and the communication channels between itself and those name servers, using methods such as DNS over TLS.\n\n\n*** Trust anchors and authentication chains ***\nTo be able to prove that a DNS answer is correct, one needs to know at least one key or DS record that is correct from sources other than the DNS.  These starting points are known as trust anchors and are typically obtained with the operating system or via some other trusted source.  When DNSSEC was originally designed, it was thought that the only trust anchor that would be needed was for the DNS root. The root anchors were first published on 15 July 2010.An authentication chain is a series of linked DS and DNSKEY records, starting with a trust anchor to the authoritative name server for the domain in question.  Without a complete authentication chain, an answer to a DNS lookup cannot be securely authenticated.\n\n\n*** Signatures and zone signing ***\nTo limit replay attacks, there are not only the normal DNS TTL values for caching purposes, but additional timestamps in RRSIG records to limit the validity of a signature. Unlike TTL values which are relative to when the records were sent, the timestamps are absolute.  This means that all security-aware DNS resolvers must have clocks that are fairly closely in sync, say to within a few minutes.\nThese timestamps imply that a zone must regularly be re-signed and re-distributed to secondary servers, or the signatures will be rejected by validating resolvers.\n\n\n*** Key management ***\nDNSSEC involves many different keys, stored both in DNSKEY records, and from other sources to form trust anchors.\nIn order to allow for replacement keys, a key rollover scheme is required.  Typically, this involves first rolling out new keys in new DNSKEY records, in addition to the existing old keys.  Then, when it is safe to assume that the time to live values have caused the caching of old keys to have passed, these new keys can be used.  Finally, when it is safe to assume that the caching of records using the old keys have expired, the old DNSKEY records can be deleted.   This process is more complicated for things such as the keys to trust anchors, such as at the root, which may require an update of the operating system.\nKeys in DNSKEY records can be used for two different things and typically different DNSKEY records are used for each.  First, there are key signing keys (KSK) which are used to sign other DNSKEY records containing zone signing keys (ZSK), which are used to sign other records.  Since the ZSKs are under complete control and use by one particular DNS zone, they can be switched more easily and more often.  As a result, ZSKs can be much shorter than KSKs and still offer the same level of protection while reducing the size of the RRSIG/DNSKEY records.\nWhen a new KSK is created, the DS record must be transferred to the parent zone and published there.  The DS records use a message digest of the KSK instead of the complete key in order to keep the size of the records small.  This is helpful for zones such as the .com domain, which are very large.  The procedure to update DS keys in the parent zone is also simpler than earlier DNSSEC versions that required DNSKEY records to be in the parent zone.\n\n\n*** DANE Working Group ***\nDNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) is an IETF working group with the goal of developing protocols and techniques that allow Internet applications to establish cryptographically secured communications with TLS, DTLS, SMTP, and S/MIME based on DNSSEC.\nThe new protocols will enable additional assurances and constraints for the traditional model based on public key infrastructure. They will also enable domain holders to assert certificates for themselves, without reference to third-party certificate authorities.\nSupport for DNSSEC stapled certificates was enabled in Google Chrome 14, but was later removed. For Mozilla Firefox, support was provided by an add-on while native support is currently awaiting someone to start working on it.\n\n== Authenticating NXDOMAIN responses and NSEC ==\nCryptographically proving the absence of a domain requires signing the response to every query for a non-existent domain.  This is not a problem for online signing servers, which keep their keys available online.  However, DNSSEC was designed around using offline computers to sign records so that zone-signing-keys could be kept in cold storage.  This represents a problem when trying to authenticate responses to queries for non-existent domains since it is impossible to pre-generate a response to every possible hostname query.\nThe initial solution was to create NSEC records for every pair of domains in a zone.  Thus if a client queried for a record at the non-existent k.example.com, the server would respond with an NSEC record stating that nothing exists between a.example.com and z.example.com.  However, this leaks more information about the zone than traditional unauthenticated NXDOMAIN errors because it exposes the existence of real domains.\n\n\n*** Preventing domain walking ***\nThe NSEC3 records (RFC 5155) were created as an alternative which hashes the name instead of listing them directly.  Over time, advancements in hashing using GPUs and dedicated hardware meant that NSEC3 responses could be cheaply brute forced using offline dictionary attacks.  NSEC5 has been proposed to allow authoritative servers to sign NSEC responses without having to keep a private key that can be used to modify the zone.  Thus stealing an NSEC5KEY would only result in the ability to more easily enumerate a zone.Due to the messy evolution of the protocol and a desire to preserve backwards compatibility, online DNSSEC signing servers return a \"white lie\" instead of authenticating a denial of existence directly. The technique outlined in RFC 4470 returns a NSEC record in which the pairs of domains lexically surrounding the requested domain.  For example, request for k.example.com would thus result in an NSEC record proving that nothing exists between the (fictitious) domains j.example.com and l.example.com. This is also possible with NSEC3 records.CloudFlare pioneered a pair of alternative approaches, which manage to achieve the same result in one third of the response size. The first is a variation on the \"white lies\" approach, called \"black lies\", which exploits common DNS client behavior to state the nonexistence more compactly. The second approach instead chooses to prove that \"the record exists but the requested record type does not\", which they call \"DNS shotgun\".\n\n== Deployment ==\nThe Internet is critical infrastructure, yet its operation depends on the fundamentally insecure DNS.\nThus, there is strong incentive to secure DNS, and deploying DNSSEC is generally considered to be a critical part of that effort.\nFor example, the U.S. National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace specifically identified the need to secure DNS.\nWide-scale deployment of DNSSEC could resolve many other security problems as well, such as secure key distribution for e-mail addresses.\nDNSSEC deployment in large-scale networks is also challenging. Ozment and Schechter observe that DNSSEC (and other technologies) has a \"bootstrap problem\": users typically only deploy a technology if they receive an immediate benefit, but if a minimal level of deployment is required before any users receive a benefit greater than their costs (as is true for DNSSEC), it is difficult to deploy. DNSSEC can be deployed at any level of a DNS hierarchy, but it must be widely available in a zone before many others will want to adopt it. DNS servers must be updated with software that supports DNSSEC, and DNSSEC data must be created and added to the DNS zone data. A TCP/IP-using client must have their DNS resolver (client) updated before it can use DNSSEC's capabilities. What is more, any resolver must have, or have a way to acquire, at least one public key that it can trust before it can start using DNSSEC.\nDNSSEC implementation can add significant load to some DNS servers. Common DNSSEC-signed responses are far larger than the default UDP size of 512 bytes. In theory, this can be handled through multiple IP fragments, but many \"middleboxes\" in the field do not handle these correctly. This leads to the use of TCP instead. Yet many current TCP implementations store a great deal of data for each TCP connection; heavily loaded servers can run out of resources simply trying to respond to a larger number of (possibly bogus) DNSSEC requests. Some protocol extensions, such as TCP Cookie Transactions, have been developed to reduce this loading. To address these challenges, significant effort is ongoing to deploy DNSSEC, because the Internet is so vital to so many organizations.\n\n\n*** Early deployments ***\nEarly adopters include Brazil (.br), Bulgaria (.bg), Czech Republic (.cz), Namibia (.na) Puerto Rico (.pr) and Sweden (.se), who use DNSSEC for their country code top-level domains; RIPE NCC, who have signed all the reverse lookup records (in-addr.arpa) that are delegated to it from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). ARIN is also signing their reverse zones. In February 2007, TDC became the first Swedish ISP to start offering this feature to its customers.IANA publicly tested a sample signed root since June 2007. During this period prior to the production signing of the root, there were also several alternative trust anchors. The IKS Jena introduced one on January 19, 2006, the Internet Systems Consortium introduced another on March 27 of the same year, while ICANN themselves announced a third on February 17, 2009.On June 2, 2009, Afilias, the registry service provider for Public Interest Registry's .org zone signed the .org TLD. Afilias and PIR also detailed on September 26, 2008, that the first phase, involving large registrars it has a strong working relationship with (\"friends and family\") would be the first to be able to sign their domains, beginning \"early 2009\". On June 23, 2010, 13 registrars were listed as offering DNSSEC records for .ORG domains.VeriSign ran a pilot project to allow .com and .net domains to register themselves for the purpose of NSEC3 experimentation. On February 24, 2009, they announced that they would deploy DNSSEC across all their top-level domains (.com, .net, etc.) within 24 months, and on November 16 of the same year, they said the .com and .net domains would be signed by the first quarter of 2011, after delays caused by technical aspects of the implementation. This goal was achieved on-schedule and Verisign's DNSSEC VP, Matt Larson, won InfoWorld's Technology Leadership Award for 2011 for his role in advancing DNSSEC.\n\n\n*** Deployment at the DNS root ***\nDNSSEC was first deployed at the root level on July 15, 2010. This is expected to greatly simplify the deployment of DNSSEC resolvers, since the root trust anchor can be used to validate any DNSSEC zone that has a complete chain of trust from the root. Since the chain of trust must be traced back to a trusted root without interruption in order to validate, trust anchors must still be configured for secure zones if any of the zones above them are not secure. For example, if the zone \"signed.example.org\" was secured but the \"example.org\" zone was not, then, even though the \".org\" zone and the root are signed, a trust anchor has to be deployed in order to validate the zone.\nPolitical issues surrounding signing the root have been a continuous concern, primarily about some central issues:\n\nOther countries are concerned about U.S. control over the Internet, and may reject any centralized keying for this reason.\nSome governments might try to ban DNSSEC-backed encryption key distribution.\n\n\n**** Planning ****\nIn September 2008, ICANN and VeriSign each published implementation proposals and in October, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) asked the public for comments. It is unclear if the comments received affected the design of the final deployment plan.\nOn June 3, 2009, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced plans to sign the root by the end of 2009, in conjunction with ICANN, VeriSign and the NTIA.On October 6, 2009, at the 59th RIPE Conference meeting, ICANN and VeriSign announced the planned deployment timeline for deploying DNSSEC within the root zone. At the meeting it was announced that it would be incrementally deployed to one root name server a month, starting on December 1, 2009, with the final root name server serving a DNSSEC signed zone on July 1, 2010, and the root zone will be signed with a RSA/SHA256 DNSKEY. During the incremental roll-out period the root zone will serve a Deliberately Unvalidatable Root Zone (DURZ) that uses dummy keys, with the final DNSKEY record not being distributed until July 1, 2010. This means the keys that were used to sign the zone use are deliberately unverifiable; the reason for this deployment was to monitor changes in traffic patterns caused by the larger responses to queries requesting DNSSEC resource records.\nThe .org top-level domain has been signed with DNSSEC in June 2010, followed by .com, .net, and .edu later in 2010 and 2011. Country code top-level domains were able to deposit keys starting in May 2010. As of November 2011 more than 25% of top-level domains are signed with DNSSEC.\n\n\n**** Implementation ****\nOn January 25, 2010, the L (ell) root server began serving a Deliberately Unvalidatable Root Zone (DURZ). The zone uses signatures of a SHA-2 (SHA-256) hash created using the RSA algorithm, as defined in RFC 5702. As of May 2010, all thirteen root servers began serving the DURZ.  On July 15, 2010, the first root full production DNSSEC root zone was signed, with the SOA serial 2010071501.   Root trust anchors are available from IANA.\n\n\n*** Deployment at the TLD level ***\nUnderneath the root there is a large set of top-level domains that must be signed in order to achieve full DNSSEC deployment.  The List of Internet top-level domains provides details about which of the existing top-level domains have been signed and linked to the root.\n\n\n*** DNSSEC Lookaside Validation - historical ***\nIn March 2006, the Internet Systems Consortium introduced the DNSSEC Lookaside Validation registry. DLV was intended to make DNSSEC easier to deploy in the absence of a root trust anchor. At the time it was imagined that a validator might have to maintain large numbers of trust anchors corresponding to signed subtrees of the DNS. The purpose of DLV was to allow validators to offload the effort of managing a trust anchor repository to a trusted third party. The DLV registry maintained a central list of trust anchors, instead of each validator repeating the work of maintaining its own list.\nTo use DLV, a validator that supports it was needed, such as BIND or Unbound, configured with a trust anchor for a DLV zone. This zone contained DLV records; these had exactly the same format as DS records, but instead of referring to a delegated sub-zone, they referred to a zone elsewhere in the DNS tree. When the validator could not find a chain of trust from the root to the RRset it is trying to check, it searched for a DLV record that could provide an alternative chain of trust.Gaps in the chain of trust, such as unsigned top-level domains or registrars that did not support DNSSEC delegations, meant administrators of lower-level domains could use DLV to allow their DNS data to be validated by resolvers which had been configured to use DLV. This may have hindered DNSSEC deployment by taking pressure off registrars and TLD registries to properly support DNSSEC. DLV also added complexity by adding more actors and code paths for DNSSEC validation.\nISC decommissioned its DLV registry in 2017.  DLV support was deprecated in BIND 9.12 and completely removed from BIND 9.16. Unbound version 1.5.4 (July 2015) marked DLV as decommissioned in the example configuration and manual page. Knot Resolver and PowerDNS Recursor never implemented DLV.\nIn March 2020, the IETF published RFC 8749, retiring DLV as a standard and moving RFC 4432 and RFC 5074 to \"Historic\" status.\n\n\n*** DNSSEC deployment initiative by the U.S. federal government ***\nThe Science and Technology Directorate of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sponsors the \"DNSSEC Deployment Initiative\".\nThis initiative encourages \"all sectors to voluntarily adopt security measures that will improve security of the Internet's naming infrastructure, as part of a global, cooperative effort that involves many nations and organizations in the public and private sectors.\"\nDHS also funds efforts to mature DNSSEC and get it deployed inside the U.S. federal government.\nIt was reported that on March 30, 2007, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security proposed \"to have the key to sign the DNS root zone solidly in the hands of the US government.\"  However no U.S. Government officials were present in the meeting room and the comment that sparked the article was made by another party.  DHS later commented on why they believe others jumped to the false conclusion that the U.S. Government had made such a proposal: \"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is funding the development of a technical plan for implementing DNSSec, and last October distributed an initial draft of it to a long list of international experts for comments.  The draft lays out a series of options for who could be the holder, or \"operator,\" of the Root Zone Key, essentially boiling down to a governmental agency or a contractor.  \"Nowhere in the document do we make any proposal about the identity of the Root Key Operator,\" said Maughan, the cyber-security research and development manager for Homeland Security.\"\n\n\n*** DNSSEC deployment in the U.S. federal government ***\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published NIST Special Publication 800-81 Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide on May 16, 2006, with guidance on how to deploy DNSSEC. NIST intended to release new DNSSEC Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements in NIST SP800-53-R1, referencing this deployment guide. U.S. agencies would then have had one year after final publication of NIST SP800-53-R1 to meet these new FISMA requirements.  However, at the time NSEC3 had not been completed.  NIST had suggested using split domains, a technique that is known to be possible but is difficult to deploy correctly, and has the security weaknesses noted above.\nOn 22 August 2008, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a memorandum requiring U.S. Federal Agencies to deploy DNSSEC across .gov sites; the .gov root must be signed by January 2009, and all subdomains under .gov must be signed by December 2009.  While the memo focuses on .gov sites, the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency says it intends to meet OMB DNSSEC requirements in the .mil (U.S. military) domain as well.  NetworkWorld's Carolyn Duffy Marsan stated that DNSSEC \"hasn't been widely deployed because it suffers from a classic chicken-and-egg dilemma... with the OMB mandate, it appears the egg is cracking.\"\n\n\n*** Deployment in resolvers ***\nSeveral ISPs have started to deploy DNSSEC-validating DNS recursive resolvers. Comcast became the first major ISP to do so in the United States, announcing their intentions on October 18, 2010 and completing deployment on January 11, 2012.According to a study at APNIC, the proportion of clients who exclusively use DNS resolvers that perform DNSSEC validation rose to 8.3% in May 2013. About half of these clients were using Google's public DNS resolver.\nIn September 2015, Verisign announced their free public DNS resolver service, and although unmentioned in their press releases, it also performs DNSSEC validation.\nBy the beginning of 2016, APNIC's monitoring showed the proportion of clients who exclusively use DNS resolvers that perform DNSSEC validation had increased to about 15%.\n\n\n**** DNSSEC support ****\nGoogle's public recursive DNS server enabled DNSSEC validation on May 6, 2013.BIND, the most popular DNS management software, enables DNSSEC support by default since version 9.5.\nThe Quad9 public recursive DNS has performed DNSSEC validation on its main 9.9.9.9 address since it was established on May 11, 2016. Quad9 also provides an alternate service which does not perform DNSSEC validation, principally for debugging.\n\n== IETF publications ==\nRFC 2535 Domain Name System Security Extensions\nRFC 3225 Indicating Resolver Support of DNSSEC\nRFC 3226 DNSSEC and IPv6 A6 Aware Server/Resolver Message Size Requirements\nRFC 3833 A Threat Analysis of the Domain Name System\nRFC 4033 DNS Security Introduction and Requirements (DNSSEC-bis)\nRFC 4034 Resource Records for the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC-bis)\nRFC 4035 Protocol Modifications for the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC-bis)\nRFC 4398 Storing Certificates in the Domain Name System (DNS)\nRFC 4431 The DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) DNS Resource Record\nRFC 4470 Minimally Covering NSEC Records and DNSSEC On-line Signing\nRFC 4509 Use of SHA-256 in DNSSEC Delegation Signer (DS) Resource Records (RRs)\nRFC 4641 DNSSEC Operational Practices\nRFC 4955 DNS Security (DNSSEC) Experiments\nRFC 5011 Automated Updates of DNS Security (DNSSEC) Trust Anchors\nRFC 5155 DNSSEC Hashed Authenticated Denial of Existence\nRFC 5702 Use of SHA-2 Algorithms with RSA in DNSKEY and RRSIG Resource Records for DNSSEC\nRFC 6605 Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) for DNSSEC\nRFC 6725 DNS Security (DNSSEC) DNSKEY Algorithm IANA Registry Updates\nRFC 6781 DNSSEC Operational Practices, Version 2\nRFC 6840 Clarifications and Implementation Notes for DNS Security (DNSSEC)\nRFC 7129 Authenticated Denial of Existence in the DNS\nRFC 7344 Automating DNSSEC Delegation Trust Maintenance\nRFC 7583 DNSSEC Key Rollover Timing Considerations\nRFC 8080 Edwards-Curve Digital Security Algorithm (EdDSA) for DNSSEC\nRFC 8624 Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance for DNSSEC\nRFC 8749 Moving DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) to Historic Status\nRFC 9276\tGuidance for NSEC3 Parameter Settings\nRFC 9364 (BCP 237) DNS Security Extensions\n\n== Tools ==\nDNSSEC deployment requires software on the server and client side.

      "context": "Domain Name System Security Extensions\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are a suite of extension specifications by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for securing data exchanged in the Domain Name System (DNS) in Internet Protocol (IP) networks. The protocol provides cryptographic authentication of data, authenticated denial of existence, and data integrity, but not availability or confidentiality.\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe original design of the Domain Name System did not include any security features. It was conceived only as a scalable distributed system. The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) attempt to add security, while maintaining backward compatibility. RFC 3833 documents some of the known threats to the DNS, and their solutions in DNSSEC.\nDNSSEC was designed to protect applications using DNS from accepting forged or manipulated DNS data, such as that created by DNS cache poisoning. All answers from DNSSEC protected zones are digitally signed. By checking the digital signature, a DNS resolver is able to check if the information is identical (i.e. unmodified and complete) to the information published by the zone owner and served on an authoritative DNS server. While protecting IP addresses is the immediate concern for many users, DNSSEC can protect any data published in the DNS, including text records (TXT) and mail exchange records (MX), and can be used to bootstrap other security systems that publish references to cryptographic certificates stored in the DNS such as Certificate Records (CERT records, RFC 4398), SSH fingerprints (SSHFP, RFC 4255), IPSec public keys (IPSECKEY, RFC 4025), TLS Trust Anchors (TLSA, RFC 6698), or Encrypted Client Hello (SVCB/HTTPS records for ECH  ).\nDNSSEC does not provide confidentiality of data; in particular, all DNSSEC responses are authenticated but not encrypted. DNSSEC does not protect against DoS attacks directly, though it indirectly provides some benefit (because signature checking allows the use of potentially untrustworthy parties).Other standards (not DNSSEC) are used to secure bulk data (such as a DNS zone transfer) sent between DNS servers. As documented in IETF RFC 4367, some users and developers make false assumptions about DNS names, such as assuming that a company's common name plus \".com\" is always its domain name. DNSSEC cannot protect against false assumptions; it can only authenticate that the data is truly from or not available from the domain owner.The DNSSEC specifications (called DNSSEC-bis) describe the current DNSSEC protocol in great detail. See RFC 4033, RFC 4034, and RFC 4035. With the publication of these new RFCs (March 2005), an earlier RFC, RFC 2535 has become obsolete. The full set of RFCs that specify DNSSEC are collected in RFC 9364, which is also BCP 237.\nIt is widely believed that securing the DNS is critically important for securing the Internet as a whole, but deployment of DNSSEC specifically has been hampered (As of 22 January 2010) by several difficulties:\n\nThe need to design a backward-compatible standard that can scale to the size of the Internet\nPrevention of \"zone enumeration\" where desired\nDeployment of DNSSEC implementations across a wide variety of DNS servers and resolvers (clients)\nDisagreement among implementers over who should own the top-level domain root keys\nOvercoming the perceived complexity of DNSSEC and DNSSEC deployment\n\n== Operation ==\nDNSSEC works by digitally signing records for DNS lookup using public-key cryptography. The correct DNSKEY record is authenticated via a chain of trust, starting with a set of verified public keys for the DNS root zone which is the trusted third party. Domain owners generate their own keys, and upload them using their DNS control panel at their domain-name registrar, which in turn pushes the keys via secDNS to the zone operator (e.g., Verisign for .com) who signs and publishes them in DNS.\n\n\n*** Resource records ***\nDNS is implemented by the use of several resource records. To implement DNSSEC, several new DNS record types were created or adapted to use with DNSSEC:\n\nRRSIG (resource record signature)\nContains the DNSSEC signature for a record set. DNS resolvers verify the signature with a public key, stored in a DNSKEY record.\nDNSKEY\nContains the public key that a DNS resolver uses to verify DNSSEC signatures in RRSIG records.\nDS (delegation signer)\nHolds the name of a delegated zone. References a DNSKEY record in the sub-delegated zone. The DS record is placed in the parent zone along with the delegating NS records.\nNSEC (next secure record)\nContains a link to the next record name in the zone and lists the record types that exist for the record's name. DNS resolvers use NSEC records to verify the non-existence of a record name and type as part of DNSSEC validation.\nNSEC3 (next secure record version 3)\nContains links to the next record name in the zone (in hashed name sorting order) and lists the record types that exist for the name covered by the hash value in the first label of the NSEC3 record's own name. These records can be used by resolvers to verify the non-existence of a record name and type as part of DNSSEC validation. NSEC3 records are similar to NSEC records, but NSEC3 uses cryptographically hashed record names to avoid the enumeration of the record names in a zone.\nNSEC3PARAM (next secure record version 3 parameters)\nAuthoritative DNS servers use this record to calculate and determine which NSEC3 records to include in responses to DNSSEC requests for non-existing names/types.When DNSSEC is used, each answer to a DNS lookup contains an RRSIG DNS record, in addition to the record type that was requested.  The RRSIG record is a digital signature of the answer DNS resource record set. The digital signature is verified by locating the correct public key found in a DNSKEY record. The NSEC and NSEC3 records are used to provide cryptographic evidence of the non-existence of any Resource Record (RR). The DS record is used in the authentication of DNSKEYs in the lookup procedure using the chain of trust. NSEC and NSEC3 records are used for robust resistance against spoofing.\n\n\n**** Algorithms ****\nDNSSEC was designed to be extensible so that as attacks are discovered against existing algorithms, new ones can be introduced in a backward-compatible fashion as described in RFC 8624. The following table defines, as of June 2019, the security algorithms that are or were most often used:\n\n\n*** The lookup procedure ***\nFrom the results of a DNS lookup, a security-aware DNS resolver can determine whether the authoritative name server for the domain being queried supports DNSSEC, whether the answer it receives is secure, and whether there is some sort of error. The lookup procedure is different for recursive name servers such as those of many ISPs, and for stub resolvers such as those included by default in mainstream operating systems. Microsoft Windows uses a stub resolver, and Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 in particular use a non-validating but DNSSEC-aware stub resolver.\n\n\n**** Recursive name servers ****\nUsing the chain of trust model, a Delegation Signer (DS) record in a parent domain (DNS zone) can be used to verify a DNSKEY record in a subdomain, which can then contain other DS records to verify further subdomains. Say that a recursive resolver such as an ISP name server wants to get the IP addresses (A record and/or AAAA records) of the domain \"www.example.com\".\n\nThe process starts when a security-aware resolver sets the \"DO\" (\"DNSSEC OK\") flag bit in a DNS query. Since the DO bit is in the extended flag bits defined by Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS), RFC 6891, all DNSSEC transactions must support EDNS. EDNS support is also needed to allow for the much larger packet sizes that DNSSEC transactions require.\nWhen the resolver receives an answer via the normal DNS lookup process, it then checks to make sure that the answer is correct. Ideally, the security-aware resolver would start with verifying the DS and DNSKEY records at the DNS root. Then it would use the DS records for the \"com\" top-level domain found at the root to verify the DNSKEY records in the \"com\" zone. From there, it would see if there is a DS record for the \"example.com\" subdomain in the \"com\" zone, and if there were, it would then use the DS record to verify a DNSKEY record found in the \"example.com\" zone. Finally, it would verify the RRSIG record found in the answer for the A records for \"www.example.com\".There are several exceptions to the above example.\nFirst, if \"example.com\" does not support DNSSEC, there will be no RRSIG record in the answer and there will not be a DS record for \"example.com\" in the \"com\" zone.  If there is a DS record for \"example.com\", but no RRSIG record in the reply, something is wrong and maybe a man in the middle attack is going on, stripping the DNSSEC information and modifying the A records.  Or, it could be a broken security-oblivious name server along the way that stripped the DO flag bit from the query or the RRSIG record from the answer.  Or, it could be a configuration error.\nNext, it may be that there is not a domain name named \"www.example.com\", in which case instead of returning a RRSIG record in the answer, there will be either an NSEC record or an NSEC3 record.  These are \"next secure\" records that allow the resolver to prove that a domain name does not exist.  The NSEC/NSEC3 records have RRSIG records, which can be verified as above.\nFinally, it may be that the \"example.com\" zone implements DNSSEC, but either the \"com\" zone or the root zone do not, creating an \"island of security\" which needs to be validated in some other way. As of 15 July 2010, deployment of DNSSEC to root is completed. The .com domain was signed with valid security keys and the secure delegation was added to the root zone on 1 April 2011.\n\n\n**** Stub resolvers ****\nStub resolvers are \"minimal DNS resolvers that use recursive query mode to offload most of the work of DNS resolution to a recursive name server.\" A stub resolver will simply forward a request to a recursive name server, and use the Authenticated Data (AD) bit in the response as a \"hint to find out whether the recursive name server was able to validate signatures for all of the data in the Answer and Authority sections of the response.\" Microsoft Windows uses a stub resolver, and Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 in particular use a non-validating but AD-bit-aware stub resolver.A validating stub resolver can also potentially perform its own signature validation by setting the Checking Disabled (CD) bit in its query messages. A validating stub resolver uses the CD bit to perform its own recursive authentication. Using such a validating stub resolver gives the client end-to-end DNS security for domains implementing DNSSEC, even if the Internet service provider or the connection to them is not trusted.\nNon-validating stub resolvers must rely on external DNSSEC validation services, such as those controlled by the user's Internet service provider or a public recursive name server, and the communication channels between itself and those name servers, using methods such as DNS over TLS.\n\n\n*** Trust anchors and authentication chains ***\nTo be able to prove that a DNS answer is correct, one needs to know at least one key or DS record that is correct from sources other than the DNS.  These starting points are known as trust anchors and are typically obtained with the operating system or via some other trusted source.  When DNSSEC was originally designed, it was thought that the only trust anchor that would be needed was for the DNS root. The root anchors were first published on 15 July 2010.An authentication chain is a series of linked DS and DNSKEY records, starting with a trust anchor to the authoritative name server for the domain in question.  Without a complete authentication chain, an answer to a DNS lookup cannot be securely authenticated.\n\n\n*** Signatures and zone signing ***\nTo limit replay attacks, there are not only the normal DNS TTL values for caching purposes, but additional timestamps in RRSIG records to limit the validity of a signature. Unlike TTL values which are relative to when the records were sent, the timestamps are absolute.  This means that all security-aware DNS resolvers must have clocks that are fairly closely in sync, say to within a few minutes.\nThese timestamps imply that a zone must regularly be re-signed and re-distributed to secondary servers, or the signatures will be rejected by validating resolvers.\n\n\n*** Key management ***\nDNSSEC involves many different keys, stored both in DNSKEY records, and from other sources to form trust anchors.\nIn order to allow for replacement keys, a key rollover scheme is required.  Typically, this involves first rolling out new keys in new DNSKEY records, in addition to the existing old keys.  Then, when it is safe to assume that the time to live values have caused the caching of old keys to have passed, these new keys can be used.  Finally, when it is safe to assume that the caching of records using the old keys have expired, the old DNSKEY records can be deleted.   This process is more complicated for things such as the keys to trust anchors, such as at the root, which may require an update of the operating system.\nKeys in DNSKEY records can be used for two different things and typically different DNSKEY records are used for each.  First, there are key signing keys (KSK) which are used to sign other DNSKEY records containing zone signing keys (ZSK), which are used to sign other records.  Since the ZSKs are under complete control and use by one particular DNS zone, they can be switched more easily and more often.  As a result, ZSKs can be much shorter than KSKs and still offer the same level of protection while reducing the size of the RRSIG/DNSKEY records.\nWhen a new KSK is created, the DS record must be transferred to the parent zone and published there.  The DS records use a message digest of the KSK instead of the complete key in order to keep the size of the records small.  This is helpful for zones such as the .com domain, which are very large.  The procedure to update DS keys in the parent zone is also simpler than earlier DNSSEC versions that required DNSKEY records to be in the parent zone.\n\n\n*** DANE Working Group ***\nDNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) is an IETF working group with the goal of developing protocols and techniques that allow Internet applications to establish cryptographically secured communications with TLS, DTLS, SMTP, and S/MIME based on DNSSEC.\nThe new protocols will enable additional assurances and constraints for the traditional model based on public key infrastructure. They will also enable domain holders to assert certificates for themselves, without reference to third-party certificate authorities.\nSupport for DNSSEC stapled certificates was enabled in Google Chrome 14, but was later removed. For Mozilla Firefox, support was provided by an add-on while native support is currently awaiting someone to start working on it.\n\n== Authenticating NXDOMAIN responses and NSEC ==\nCryptographically proving the absence of a domain requires signing the response to every query for a non-existent domain.  This is not a problem for online signing servers, which keep their keys available online.  However, DNSSEC was designed around using offline computers to sign records so that zone-signing-keys could be kept in cold storage.  This represents a problem when trying to authenticate responses to queries for non-existent domains since it is impossible to pre-generate a response to every possible hostname query.\nThe initial solution was to create NSEC records for every pair of domains in a zone.  Thus if a client queried for a record at the non-existent k.example.com, the server would respond with an NSEC record stating that nothing exists between a.example.com and z.example.com.  However, this leaks more information about the zone than traditional unauthenticated NXDOMAIN errors because it exposes the existence of real domains.\n\n\n*** Preventing domain walking ***\nThe NSEC3 records (RFC 5155) were created as an alternative which hashes the name instead of listing them directly.  Over time, advancements in hashing using GPUs and dedicated hardware meant that NSEC3 responses could be cheaply brute forced using offline dictionary attacks.  NSEC5 has been proposed to allow authoritative servers to sign NSEC responses without having to keep a private key that can be used to modify the zone.  Thus stealing an NSEC5KEY would only result in the ability to more easily enumerate a zone.Due to the messy evolution of the protocol and a desire to preserve backwards compatibility, online DNSSEC signing servers return a \"white lie\" instead of authenticating a denial of existence directly. The technique outlined in RFC 4470 returns a NSEC record in which the pairs of domains lexically surrounding the requested domain.  For example, request for k.example.com would thus result in an NSEC record proving that nothing exists between the (fictitious) domains j.example.com and l.example.com. This is also possible with NSEC3 records.CloudFlare pioneered a pair of alternative approaches, which manage to achieve the same result in one third of the response size. The first is a variation on the \"white lies\" approach, called \"black lies\", which exploits common DNS client behavior to state the nonexistence more compactly. The second approach instead chooses to prove that \"the record exists but the requested record type does not\", which they call \"DNS shotgun\".\n\n== Deployment ==\nThe Internet is critical infrastructure, yet its operation depends on the fundamentally insecure DNS.\nThus, there is strong incentive to secure DNS, and deploying DNSSEC is generally considered to be a critical part of that effort.\nFor example, the U.S. National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace specifically identified the need to secure DNS.\nWide-scale deployment of DNSSEC could resolve many other security problems as well, such as secure key distribution for e-mail addresses.\nDNSSEC deployment in large-scale networks is also challenging. Ozment and Schechter observe that DNSSEC (and other technologies) has a \"bootstrap problem\": users typically only deploy a technology if they receive an immediate benefit, but if a minimal level of deployment is required before any users receive a benefit greater than their costs (as is true for DNSSEC), it is difficult to deploy. DNSSEC can be deployed at any level of a DNS hierarchy, but it must be widely available in a zone before many others will want to adopt it. DNS servers must be updated with software that supports DNSSEC, and DNSSEC data must be created and added to the DNS zone data. A TCP/IP-using client must have their DNS resolver (client) updated before it can use DNSSEC's capabilities. What is more, any resolver must have, or have a way to acquire, at least one public key that it can trust before it can start using DNSSEC.\nDNSSEC implementation can add significant load to some DNS servers. Common DNSSEC-signed responses are far larger than the default UDP size of 512 bytes. In theory, this can be handled through multiple IP fragments, but many \"middleboxes\" in the field do not handle these correctly. This leads to the use of TCP instead. Yet many current TCP implementations store a great deal of data for each TCP connection; heavily loaded servers can run out of resources simply trying to respond to a larger number of (possibly bogus) DNSSEC requests. Some protocol extensions, such as TCP Cookie Transactions, have been developed to reduce this loading. To address these challenges, significant effort is ongoing to deploy DNSSEC, because the Internet is so vital to so many organizations.\n\n\n*** Early deployments ***\nEarly adopters include Brazil (.br), Bulgaria (.bg), Czech Republic (.cz), Namibia (.na) Puerto Rico (.pr) and Sweden (.se), who use DNSSEC for their country code top-level domains; RIPE NCC, who have signed all the reverse lookup records (in-addr.arpa) that are delegated to it from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). ARIN is also signing their reverse zones. In February 2007, TDC became the first Swedish ISP to start offering this feature to its customers.IANA publicly tested a sample signed root since June 2007. During this period prior to the production signing of the root, there were also several alternative trust anchors. The IKS Jena introduced one on January 19, 2006, the Internet Systems Consortium introduced another on March 27 of the same year, while ICANN themselves announced a third on February 17, 2009.On June 2, 2009, Afilias, the registry service provider for Public Interest Registry's .org zone signed the .org TLD. Afilias and PIR also detailed on September 26, 2008, that the first phase, involving large registrars it has a strong working relationship with (\"friends and family\") would be the first to be able to sign their domains, beginning \"early 2009\". On June 23, 2010, 13 registrars were listed as offering DNSSEC records for .ORG domains.VeriSign ran a pilot project to allow .com and .net domains to register themselves for the purpose of NSEC3 experimentation. On February 24, 2009, they announced that they would deploy DNSSEC across all their top-level domains (.com, .net, etc.) within 24 months, and on November 16 of the same year, they said the .com and .net domains would be signed by the first quarter of 2011, after delays caused by technical aspects of the implementation. This goal was achieved on-schedule and Verisign's DNSSEC VP, Matt Larson, won InfoWorld's Technology Leadership Award for 2011 for his role in advancing DNSSEC.\n\n\n*** Deployment at the DNS root ***\nDNSSEC was first deployed at the root level on July 15, 2010. This is expected to greatly simplify the deployment of DNSSEC resolvers, since the root trust anchor can be used to validate any DNSSEC zone that has a complete chain of trust from the root. Since the chain of trust must be traced back to a trusted root without interruption in order to validate, trust anchors must still be configured for secure zones if any of the zones above them are not secure. For example, if the zone \"signed.example.org\" was secured but the \"example.org\" zone was not, then, even though the \".org\" zone and the root are signed, a trust anchor has to be deployed in order to validate the zone.\nPolitical issues surrounding signing the root have been a continuous concern, primarily about some central issues:\n\nOther countries are concerned about U.S. control over the Internet, and may reject any centralized keying for this reason.\nSome governments might try to ban DNSSEC-backed encryption key distribution.\n\n\n**** Planning ****\nIn September 2008, ICANN and VeriSign each published implementation proposals and in October, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) asked the public for comments. It is unclear if the comments received affected the design of the final deployment plan.\nOn June 3, 2009, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced plans to sign the root by the end of 2009, in conjunction with ICANN, VeriSign and the NTIA.On October 6, 2009, at the 59th RIPE Conference meeting, ICANN and VeriSign announced the planned deployment timeline for deploying DNSSEC within the root zone. At the meeting it was announced that it would be incrementally deployed to one root name server a month, starting on December 1, 2009, with the final root name server serving a DNSSEC signed zone on July 1, 2010, and the root zone will be signed with a RSA/SHA256 DNSKEY. During the incremental roll-out period the root zone will serve a Deliberately Unvalidatable Root Zone (DURZ) that uses dummy keys, with the final DNSKEY record not being distributed until July 1, 2010. This means the keys that were used to sign the zone use are deliberately unverifiable; the reason for this deployment was to monitor changes in traffic patterns caused by the larger responses to queries requesting DNSSEC resource records.\nThe .org top-level domain has been signed with DNSSEC in June 2010, followed by .com, .net, and .edu later in 2010 and 2011. Country code top-level domains were able to deposit keys starting in May 2010. As of November 2011 more than 25% of top-level domains are signed with DNSSEC.\n\n\n**** Implementation ****\nOn January 25, 2010, the L (ell) root server began serving a Deliberately Unvalidatable Root Zone (DURZ). The zone uses signatures of a SHA-2 (SHA-256) hash created using the RSA algorithm, as defined in RFC 5702. As of May 2010, all thirteen root servers began serving the DURZ.  On July 15, 2010, the first root full production DNSSEC root zone was signed, with the SOA serial 2010071501.   Root trust anchors are available from IANA.\n\n\n*** Deployment at the TLD level ***\nUnderneath the root there is a large set of top-level domains that must be signed in order to achieve full DNSSEC deployment.  The List of Internet top-level domains provides details about which of the existing top-level domains have been signed and linked to the root.\n\n\n*** DNSSEC Lookaside Validation - historical ***\nIn March 2006, the Internet Systems Consortium introduced the DNSSEC Lookaside Validation registry. DLV was intended to make DNSSEC easier to deploy in the absence of a root trust anchor. At the time it was imagined that a validator might have to maintain large numbers of trust anchors corresponding to signed subtrees of the DNS. The purpose of DLV was to allow validators to offload the effort of managing a trust anchor repository to a trusted third party. The DLV registry maintained a central list of trust anchors, instead of each validator repeating the work of maintaining its own list.\nTo use DLV, a validator that supports it was needed, such as BIND or Unbound, configured with a trust anchor for a DLV zone. This zone contained DLV records; these had exactly the same format as DS records, but instead of referring to a delegated sub-zone, they referred to a zone elsewhere in the DNS tree. When the validator could not find a chain of trust from the root to the RRset it is trying to check, it searched for a DLV record that could provide an alternative chain of trust.Gaps in the chain of trust, such as unsigned top-level domains or registrars that did not support DNSSEC delegations, meant administrators of lower-level domains could use DLV to allow their DNS data to be validated by resolvers which had been configured to use DLV. This may have hindered DNSSEC deployment by taking pressure off registrars and TLD registries to properly support DNSSEC. DLV also added complexity by adding more actors and code paths for DNSSEC validation.\nISC decommissioned its DLV registry in 2017.  DLV support was deprecated in BIND 9.12 and completely removed from BIND 9.16. Unbound version 1.5.4 (July 2015) marked DLV as decommissioned in the example configuration and manual page. Knot Resolver and PowerDNS Recursor never implemented DLV.\nIn March 2020, the IETF published RFC 8749, retiring DLV as a standard and moving RFC 4432 and RFC 5074 to \"Historic\" status.\n\n\n*** DNSSEC deployment initiative by the U.S. federal government ***\nThe Science and Technology Directorate of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) sponsors the \"DNSSEC Deployment Initiative\".\nThis initiative encourages \"all sectors to voluntarily adopt security measures that will improve security of the Internet's naming infrastructure, as part of a global, cooperative effort that involves many nations and organizations in the public and private sectors.\"\nDHS also funds efforts to mature DNSSEC and get it deployed inside the U.S. federal government.\nIt was reported that on March 30, 2007, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security proposed \"to have the key to sign the DNS root zone solidly in the hands of the US government.\"  However no U.S. Government officials were present in the meeting room and the comment that sparked the article was made by another party.  DHS later commented on why they believe others jumped to the false conclusion that the U.S. Government had made such a proposal: \"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is funding the development of a technical plan for implementing DNSSec, and last October distributed an initial draft of it to a long list of international experts for comments.  The draft lays out a series of options for who could be the holder, or \"operator,\" of the Root Zone Key, essentially boiling down to a governmental agency or a contractor.  \"Nowhere in the document do we make any proposal about the identity of the Root Key Operator,\" said Maughan, the cyber-security research and development manager for Homeland Security.\"\n\n\n*** DNSSEC deployment in the U.S. federal government ***\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published NIST Special Publication 800-81 Secure Domain Name System (DNS) Deployment Guide on May 16, 2006, with guidance on how to deploy DNSSEC. NIST intended to release new DNSSEC Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requirements in NIST SP800-53-R1, referencing this deployment guide. U.S. agencies would then have had one year after final publication of NIST SP800-53-R1 to meet these new FISMA requirements.  However, at the time NSEC3 had not been completed.  NIST had suggested using split domains, a technique that is known to be possible but is difficult to deploy correctly, and has the security weaknesses noted above.\nOn 22 August 2008, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a memorandum requiring U.S. Federal Agencies to deploy DNSSEC across .gov sites; the .gov root must be signed by January 2009, and all subdomains under .gov must be signed by December 2009.  While the memo focuses on .gov sites, the U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency says it intends to meet OMB DNSSEC requirements in the .mil (U.S. military) domain as well.  NetworkWorld's Carolyn Duffy Marsan stated that DNSSEC \"hasn't been widely deployed because it suffers from a classic chicken-and-egg dilemma... with the OMB mandate, it appears the egg is cracking.\"\n\n\n*** Deployment in resolvers ***\nSeveral ISPs have started to deploy DNSSEC-validating DNS recursive resolvers. Comcast became the first major ISP to do so in the United States, announcing their intentions on October 18, 2010 and completing deployment on January 11, 2012.According to a study at APNIC, the proportion of clients who exclusively use DNS resolvers that perform DNSSEC validation rose to 8.3% in May 2013. About half of these clients were using Google's public DNS resolver.\nIn September 2015, Verisign announced their free public DNS resolver service, and although unmentioned in their press releases, it also performs DNSSEC validation.\nBy the beginning of 2016, APNIC's monitoring showed the proportion of clients who exclusively use DNS resolvers that perform DNSSEC validation had increased to about 15%.\n\n\n**** DNSSEC support ****\nGoogle's public recursive DNS server enabled DNSSEC validation on May 6, 2013.BIND, the most popular DNS management software, enables DNSSEC support by default since version 9.5.\nThe Quad9 public recursive DNS has performed DNSSEC validation on its main 9.9.9.9 address since it was established on May 11, 2016. Quad9 also provides an alternate service which does not perform DNSSEC validation, principally for debugging.\n\n== IETF publications ==\nRFC 2535 Domain Name System Security Extensions\nRFC 3225 Indicating Resolver Support of DNSSEC\nRFC 3226 DNSSEC and IPv6 A6 Aware Server/Resolver Message Size Requirements\nRFC 3833 A Threat Analysis of the Domain Name System\nRFC 4033 DNS Security Introduction and Requirements (DNSSEC-bis)\nRFC 4034 Resource Records for the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC-bis)\nRFC 4035 Protocol Modifications for the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC-bis)\nRFC 4398 Storing Certificates in the Domain Name System (DNS)\nRFC 4431 The DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) DNS Resource Record\nRFC 4470 Minimally Covering NSEC Records and DNSSEC On-line Signing\nRFC 4509 Use of SHA-256 in DNSSEC Delegation Signer (DS) Resource Records (RRs)\nRFC 4641 DNSSEC Operational Practices\nRFC 4955 DNS Security (DNSSEC) Experiments\nRFC 5011 Automated Updates of DNS Security (DNSSEC) Trust Anchors\nRFC 5155 DNSSEC Hashed Authenticated Denial of Existence\nRFC 5702 Use of SHA-2 Algorithms with RSA in DNSKEY and RRSIG Resource Records for DNSSEC\nRFC 6605 Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) for DNSSEC\nRFC 6725 DNS Security (DNSSEC) DNSKEY Algorithm IANA Registry Updates\nRFC 6781 DNSSEC Operational Practices, Version 2\nRFC 6840 Clarifications and Implementation Notes for DNS Security (DNSSEC)\nRFC 7129 Authenticated Denial of Existence in the DNS\nRFC 7344 Automating DNSSEC Delegation Trust Maintenance\nRFC 7583 DNSSEC Key Rollover Timing Considerations\nRFC 8080 Edwards-Curve Digital Security Algorithm (EdDSA) for DNSSEC\nRFC 8624 Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance for DNSSEC\nRFC 8749 Moving DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) to Historic Status\nRFC 9276\tGuidance for NSEC3 Parameter Settings\nRFC 9364 (BCP 237) DNS Security Extensions\n\n== Tools ==\nDNSSEC deployment requires software on the server and client side. Some of the tools that support DNSSEC include:\n\nWindows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 include a \"security-aware\" stub resolver that is able to differentiate between secure and non-secure responses by a recursive name server. Windows Server 2012 DNSSEC is compatible with secure dynamic updates with Active Directory-integrated zones, plus Active Directory replication of anchor keys to other such servers.\nBIND, the most popular DNS name server (which includes dig), incorporates the newer DNSSEC-bis (DS records) protocol as well as support for NSEC3 records.\nUnbound is a DNS name server that was written from the ground up to be designed around DNSSEC concepts.\nmysqlBind, the GPL DNS management software for DNS ASPs, now supports DNSSEC.\nOpenDNSSEC is a designated DNSSEC signer tool using PKCS#11 to interface with hardware security modules.\nKnot DNS has added support for automatic DNSSEC signing in version 1.4.0.\nPowerDNS fully supports DNSSEC as of version 3.0 in pre-signed and live-signed modes.\nDNSSEC: What is it and why is it important to implement it for a long time? \u2014 Check it Initiative of the Internet community and the Dutch government"

    "instruction": "Shamoon\n\n==Introduction==\nShamoon (Persian: \u0634\u0645\u0639\u0648\u0646), also known as W32.DistTrack, is a modular computer virus that was discovered in 2012, targeting then-recent 32-bit NT kernel versions of Microsoft Windows. The virus was notable due to the destructive nature of the attack and the cost of recovery. Shamoon can spread from an infected machine to other computers on the network. Once a system is infected, the virus continues to compile a list of files from specific locations on the system, upload them to the attacker, and erase them. Finally the virus overwrites the master boot record of the infected computer, making it unusable.The virus was used for cyberwarfare against national oil companies including Saudi Arabia's Saudi Aramco and Qatar's RasGas. A group named \"Cutting Sword of Justice\" claimed responsibility for an attack on 30,000 Saudi Aramco workstations, causing the company to spend more than a week restoring their services. The group later indicated that the Shamoon virus had been used in the attack. Computer systems at RasGas were also knocked offline by an unidentified computer virus, with some security experts attributing the damage to Shamoon. It was later described as the \"biggest hack in history\".Symantec, Kaspersky Lab, and Seculert announced discovery of the malware on 16 August 2012. Kaspersky Lab and Seculert found similarities between Shamoon and the Flame malware. Shamoon made a surprise comeback in November 2016, January 2017, and December 2018.\n\n\n\n== Design ==\nShamoon was designed to erase and overwrite hard drive data with a corrupted image and report the addresses of infected computers back to the computer inside the company's network. The malware had a logic bomb which triggered the master boot record and data wiping payload at 11:08 am local time on Wednesday, August 15. The attack occurred during the month of Ramadan in 2012. It would appear that the attack was timed to occur after most staff had gone on holiday reducing the chance of discovery before maximum damage could be caused, hampering recovery.\nThe virus consisted of three components, the Dropper, the Wiper and the Reporter. The Dropper, the source of the infection, creates a service with the name 'NtsSrv' that enables it to remain persistent on the infected computer. The Dropper was built in 32-bit and 64-bit versions. If the 32-bit dropper detects a 64-bit architecture, it drops the 64-bit version. This component drops the Wiper and the Reporter onto the infected computer and executes itself. It spreads across a local network by copying itself to network shares and on to other computers.The Wiper component utilizes an Eldos-produced driver known as RawDisk to achieve direct user-mode access to a hard drive without using Windows APIs. It identifies the locations of all files on the infected computers and erases them. It sends information about the files destroyed to the attacker and then overwrites the erased files with corrupted data so they cannot be recovered. The component used portions of an image. In the 2012 attack it used an image of a burning U.S. flag; in the 2016 attack it used a photo of the body of Alan Kurdi.\n\n== Before the attack ==\nThe malware was unique, used to target the Saudi government by causing destruction to the state-owned national oil company Saudi Aramco. The attackers posted a pastie on Pastebin hours prior to the wiper logic bomb occurring, citing oppression and the Al-Saud regime as a reason behind the attack. According to Chris Kubecka, a security advisor to Saudi Aramco after the attack and group leader of security for Aramco Overseas, the attack was well-staged. It was initiated by a phishing email attack that an unnamed Saudi Aramco Information Technology employee opened, giving the group entry into the company's network around mid-2012.\nWe, behalf of an anti-oppression hacker group that have been fed up of crimes and atrocities taking place in various countries around the world, especially in the neighboring countries such as Syria, Bahrain, Yemen, Lebanon, Egypt and ..., and also of dual approach of the world community to these nations, want to hit the main supporters of these disasters by this action. One of the main supporters of this disasters [sic] is Al-Saud corrupt regime that sponsors such oppressive measures by using Muslims oil resources. Al-Saud is a partner in committing these crimes. It's [sic] hands are infected with the blood of innocent children and people. In the first step, an action was performed against Aramco company, as the largest financial source for Al-Saud regime. In this step, we penetrated a system of Aramco company by using the hacked systems in several countries and then sent a malicious virus to destroy thirty thousand computers networked in this company. The destruction operations began on Wednesday, Aug 15, 2012 at 11:08 AM (Local time in Saudi Arabia) and will be completed within a few hours.\n\nKubecka described in a Black Hat USA talk that Saudi Aramco placed the majority of their security budget on the ICS control network, leaving the business network at risk for a major incident.\n\n== During the attack ==\nOn 15 August at 11:08 am local time, over 30,000 Windows based systems began to be overwritten. Symantec found some of the affected systems showed an image of an American flag while their data was being deleted and overwritten. Saudi Aramco announced the attack on their Facebook page and went offline again until a company statement was issued on 25 August 2012. The statement falsely reported normal business was resumed on 25 August 2012. However a Middle Eastern journalist leaked photographs taken on 1 September 2012 showing kilometers of petrol trucks unable to be loaded due to hacked business systems still inoperable.\n\n\"Saudi Aramco has restored all its main internal network services that were impacted on August 15, 2012, by a malicious virus that originated from external sources and affected about 30,000 workstations. The workstations have since been cleaned and restored to service. As a precaution, remote Internet access to online resources was restricted. Saudi Aramco employees returned to work August 25, 2012, following the Eid holidays, resuming normal business. The company confirmed that its primary enterprise systems of hydrocarbon exploration and production were unaffected as they operate on isolated network systems. Production plants were also fully operational as these control systems are also isolated.\"\nOn August 29, 2012 the same attackers behind Shamoon posted another pastie on PasteBin.com, taunting Saudi Aramco with proof they still retained access to the company network. The post contained the username and password on security and network equipment and the new password for Aramco CEO Khalid Al-Falih. The attackers also referenced a portion of the Shamoon malware as further proof in the pastie:\n\n\"mon 29th aug, good day, SHN/AMOO/lib/pr/~/reversed\nWe think it's funny and weird that there are no news coming out from Saudi Aramco regarding Saturday's night. well, we expect that but just to make it more clear and prove that we're done with we promised, just read the following facts -valuable ones- about the company's systems:\n- internet service routers are three and their info as follows:\n\nCore router:   SA-AR-CO-1#  password (telnet): c1sc0p@ss-ar-cr-tl  / (enable): c1sc0p@ss-ar-cr-bl\nBackup router: SA-AR-CO-3#  password (telnet): c1sc0p@ss-ar-bk-tl  / (enable): c1sc0p@ss-ar-bk-bl\nMiddle router: SA-AR-CO-2#  password (telnet): c1sc0p@ss-ar-st-tl  / (enable): c1sc0p@ss-ar-st-bl- Khalid A. Al-Falih, CEO, email info as follows:\n\nKhalid.falih@aramco.com      password:kal@ram@sa1960- security appliances used:\n\nCisco ASA    #    McAfee #   FireEye :\ndefault passwords for all!!!!!!!!!!We think and truly believe that our mission is done and we need no more time to waste. I guess it's time for SA to yell and release something to the public. however, silence is no solution.\nI hope you enjoyed that. and wait our final paste regarding SHN/AMOO/lib/pr/~\n\nangry internet lovers #SH\"\nAccording to Kubecka, in order to restore operations, Saudi Aramco used its large private fleet of aircraft and available funds to purchase much of the world's hard drives, driving the price up. New hard drives were required as quickly as possible so oil prices were not affected by speculation. By September 1, 2012 gasoline resources were dwindling for the public of Saudi Arabia 17 days after the August 15th attack. RasGas was also affected by a different variant, crippling them in a similar manner.It is unclear why the attacker may have an interest in actually destroying the infected PC. Kaspersky Labs hinted that the 900 KB malware could be related to Wiper, that was used in a cyber attack on Iran in April. After a 2-day analysis, the company erroneously concluded that the malware is more likely to come from \"scriptkiddies\" who were inspired by Wiper. Later, in a blog post, Eugene Kaspersky clarified the use of Shamoon categorizing as cyberwarfare.\nQuestion: What was the impact of the Shamoon virus attack on RasGas?",

In the 2012 attack it used an image of a burning U.S. flag; in the 2016 attack it used a photo of the body of Alan Kurdi.\n\n== Before the attack ==\nThe malware was unique, used to target the Saudi government by causing destruction to the state-owned national oil company Saudi Aramco. The attackers posted a pastie on Pastebin hours prior to the wiper logic bomb occurring, citing oppression and the Al-Saud regime as a reason behind the attack. According to Chris Kubecka, a security advisor to Saudi Aramco after the attack and group leader of security for Aramco Overseas, the attack was well-staged. It was initiated by a phishing email attack that an unnamed Saudi Aramco Information Technology employee opened, giving the group entry into the company's network around mid-2012.\nWe, behalf of an anti-oppression hacker group that have been fed up of crimes and atrocities taking place in various countries around the world, especially in the neighboring countries such as Syria, Bahrain, Yemen, Lebanon, Egypt and ..., and also of dual approach of the world community to these nations, want to hit the main supporters of these disasters by this action. One of the main supporters of this disasters [sic] is Al-Saud corrupt regime that sponsors such oppressive measures by using Muslims oil resources. Al-Saud is a partner in committing these crimes. It's [sic] hands are infected with the blood of innocent children and people. In the first step, an action was performed against Aramco company, as the largest financial source for Al-Saud regime. In this step, we penetrated a system of Aramco company by using the hacked systems in several countries and then sent a malicious virus to destroy thirty thousand computers networked in this company. The destruction operations began on Wednesday, Aug 15, 2012 at 11:08 AM (Local time in Saudi Arabia) and will be completed within a few hours.\n\nKubecka described in a Black Hat USA talk that Saudi Aramco placed the majority of their security budget on the ICS control network, leaving the business network at risk for a major incident.\n\n== During the attack ==\nOn 15 August at 11:08 am local time, over 30,000 Windows based systems began to be overwritten. Symantec found some of the affected systems showed an image of an American flag while their data was being deleted and overwritten. Saudi Aramco announced the attack on their Facebook page and went offline again until a company statement was issued on 25 August 2012. The statement falsely reported normal business was resumed on 25 August 2012. However a Middle Eastern journalist leaked photographs taken on 1 September 2012 showing kilometers of petrol trucks unable to be loaded due to hacked business systems still inoperable.\n\n\"Saudi Aramco has restored all its main internal network services that were impacted on August 15, 2012, by a malicious virus that originated from external sources and affected about 30,000 workstations. The workstations have since been cleaned and restored to service. As a precaution, remote Internet access to online resources was restricted. Saudi Aramco employees returned to work August 25, 2012, following the Eid holidays, resuming normal business. The company confirmed that its primary enterprise systems of hydrocarbon exploration and production were unaffected as they operate on isolated network systems. Production plants were also fully operational as these control systems are also isolated.\"\nOn August 29, 2012 the same attackers behind Shamoon posted another pastie on PasteBin.com, taunting Saudi Aramco with proof they still retained access to the company network. The post contained the username and password on security and network equipment and the new password for Aramco CEO Khalid Al-Falih. The attackers also referenced a portion of the Shamoon malware as further proof in the pastie:\n\n\"mon 29th aug, good day, SHN/AMOO/lib/pr/~/reversed\nWe think it's funny and weird that there are no news coming out from Saudi Aramco regarding Saturday's night. well, we expect that but just to make it more clear and prove that we're done with we promised, just read the following facts -valuable ones- about the company's systems:\n- internet service routers are three and their info as follows:\n\nCore router:   SA-AR-CO-1#  password (telnet): c1sc0p@ss-ar-cr-tl  / (enable): c1sc0p@ss-ar-cr-bl\nBackup router: SA-AR-CO-3#  password (telnet): c1sc0p@ss-ar-bk-tl  / (enable): c1sc0p@ss-ar-bk-bl\nMiddle router: SA-AR-CO-2#  password (telnet): c1sc0p@ss-ar-st-tl  / (enable): c1sc0p@ss-ar-st-bl- Khalid A. Al-Falih, CEO, email info as follows:\n\nKhalid.falih@aramco.com      password:kal@ram@sa1960- security appliances used:\n\nCisco ASA    #    McAfee #   FireEye :\ndefault passwords for all!!!!!!!!!!We think and truly believe that our mission is done and we need no more time to waste. I guess it's time for SA to yell and release something to the public. however, silence is no solution.\nI hope you enjoyed that. and wait our final paste regarding SHN/AMOO/lib/pr/~\n\nangry internet lovers #SH\"\nAccording to Kubecka, in order to restore operations, Saudi Aramco used its large private fleet of aircraft and available funds to purchase much of the world's hard drives, driving the price up. New hard drives were required as quickly as possible so oil prices were not affected by speculation. By September 1, 2012 gasoline resources were dwindling for the public of Saudi Arabia 17 days after the August 15th attack. RasGas was also affected by a different variant, crippling them in a similar manner.It is unclear why the attacker may have an interest in actually destroying the infected PC. Kaspersky Labs hinted that the 900 KB malware could be related to Wiper, that was used in a cyber attack on Iran in April. After a 2-day analysis, the company erroneously concluded that the malware is more likely to come from \"scriptkiddies\" who were inspired by Wiper. Later, in a blog post, Eugene Kaspersky clarified the use of Shamoon categorizing as cyberwarfare."

A Monkey Program, a single instance of the HoneyMonkey project, launches Internet Explorer to visit a site. It also records all registry and file read or write operations. The monkey does not allow pop-ups, nor does it allow installation of software. Any read or write that happens out of Internet Explorer's temporary folder therefore must have used browser exploits. These are then analyzed by malware detection programs and then manually analyzed. The monkey program then restarts the virtual machine to crawl another site in a fresh state."

    "instruction": "Context: The Unknowns\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Unknowns is a self-proclaimed ethical hacking group that came to attention in May 2012 after exploiting weaknesses in the security of NASA, CIA, White House, the European Space Agency, Harvard University, Renault, the United States Military Joint Pathology Center, the Royal Thai Navy, and several ministries of defense. The group posted their reasons for these attacks on the sites Anonpaste & Pastebin including a link to a compressed file which contained a lot of files obtained from the US Military sites they breached. The Unknowns claim \"... our goal was never to harm anyone, we want to make this whole internet world more secured because, simply, it's not at all and we want to help.\" The group claims to be ethical in their hacking activities, but nonetheless lifted internal documents from their victims, posting them online. They claim this was because they had reported the security holes to many of their victims, but did not receive a response back from any of them. The whole point was to show that these government-run sites have loopholes in their code and anyone can exploit them. The group used methods like advanced SQL injection to gain access to the victim websites. NASA and the ESA have both confirmed the attack. They claimed that the affected systems were taken offline and have since been patched. At the time this was one of the most wanted hacking groups in Europe and also wanted by the FBI, although they refused to tell if they were investigating the hacks.\n\n== Members ==\nThe team had 6 not 7 core members:\nPixiedust, founder, spokesperson, and leader,\nMr. P-Teo, programmer\n\nFabien L\u00e9ac,a French researcher in computer faults and a white hacker\nMrSecurity, a black-hat hacker, programmer and ghostwriter of The Unknowns\nNeTRoX, a black-hat hacker, penetration tester and researcher.

He was later released because he was just sixteen years old at the time. He has trials taking place in 2014 supposedly. His life is related in a book written by his mother Sophie L\u00e9ac L'histoire vraie d'un jeune hacker fran\u00e7ais (in October 2013) or the true story of a French teen-hacker. A second book is in preparation: Hack! There will be cyberwar!.\n\n== Hacked websites and applications ==\nThe group has hacked many websites and applications using a series of different attacks. The most notable, however, being SQL injection. There have been a lot of companies affected by the group, but some of the hacks even for big companies did not make the media (probably due to keeping the multi-country legal investigation a secret). However, the most notable hacks done by The Unknowns, mostly government related websites, did make mass media.

The National Security Council nominally sets policy for the NISP, while the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office is nominally the authority for implementation.  Under the ISOO, the Secretary of Defense is nominally the Executive Agent, but the NISP recognizes four different Cognizant Security Agencies, all of which have equal authority: the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency administers the NISP on behalf of the Department of Defense and 34 other federal agencies.\n\n== NISP Operating Manual (DoD 5220.22-M) ==\nA major component of the NISP is the NISP Operating Manual, also called NISPOM, or DoD  5220.22-M.

Furthermore, the NISPOM does not actually specify any particular method.  Standards for sanitization are left up to the Cognizant Security Authority.  The Defense Security Service provides a Clearing and Sanitization Matrix (C&SM) which does specify methods.

Furthermore, the NISPOM does not actually specify any particular method.  Standards for sanitization are left up to the Cognizant Security Authority.  The Defense Security Service provides a Clearing and Sanitization Matrix (C&SM) which does specify methods.  As of the June 2007 edition of the DSS C&SM, overwriting is no longer acceptable for sanitization of magnetic media; only degaussing or physical destruction is acceptable."

    "instruction": "John the Ripper\n\n==Introduction==\nJohn the Ripper is a free password cracking software tool. Originally developed for the Unix operating system, it can run on fifteen different platforms (eleven of which are architecture-specific versions of Unix, DOS, Win32, BeOS, and OpenVMS). It is among the most frequently used password testing and breaking programs as it combines a number of password crackers into one package, autodetects password hash types, and includes a customizable cracker. It can be run against various encrypted password formats including several crypt password hash types most commonly found on various Unix versions (based on DES, MD5, or Blowfish), Kerberos AFS, and Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 LM hash. Additional modules have extended its ability to include MD4-based password hashes and passwords stored in LDAP, MySQL, and others.\n\n== Sample output ==\nHere is a sample output in a Debian environment.\n\nThe first line is a command to expand the data stored in the file \"pass.txt\". The next line is the contents of the file, i.e. the user (AZl) and the hash associated with that user (zWwxIh15Q). The third line is the command for running John the Ripper utilizing the \"-w\" flag. \"password.lst\" is the name of a text file full of words the program will use against the hash, pass.txt makes another appearance as the file we want John to work on.\nThen we see output from John working. Loaded 1 password hash \u2014 the one we saw with the \"cat\" command \u2014 and the type of hash John thinks it is (Traditional DES). We also see that the attempt required one guess at a time of 0 with a 100% guess rate.\n\n== Attack types ==\nOne of the modes John can use is the dictionary attack. It takes text string samples (usually from a file, called a wordlist, containing words found in a dictionary or real passwords cracked before), encrypting it in the same format as the password being examined (including both the encryption algorithm and key), and comparing the output to the encrypted string. It can also perform a variety of alterations to the dictionary words and try these. Many of these alterations are also used in John's single attack mode, which modifies an associated plaintext (such as a username with an encrypted password) and checks the variations against the hashes.\nJohn also offers a brute force mode. In this type of attack, the program goes through all the possible plaintexts, hashing each one and then comparing it to the input hash. John uses character frequency tables to try plaintexts containing more frequently used characters first. This method is useful for cracking passwords that do not appear in dictionary wordlists, but it takes a long time to run.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question.

    "instruction": "Secure Remote Password protocol\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Secure Remote Password protocol (SRP) is an augmented password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocol, specifically designed to work around existing patents.Like all PAKE protocols, an eavesdropper or man in the middle cannot obtain enough information to be able to brute-force guess a password or apply a dictionary attack without further interactions with the parties for each guess. Furthermore, being an augmented PAKE protocol, the server does not store password-equivalent data. This means that an attacker who steals the server data cannot masquerade as the client unless they first perform a brute force search for the password.\nIn layman's terms, during SRP (or any other PAKE protocol) authentication, one party (the \"client\" or \"user\") demonstrates to another party (the \"server\") that they know the password, without sending the password itself nor any other information from which the password can be derived. The password never leaves the client and is unknown to the server.\nFurthermore, the server also needs to know about the password (but not the password itself) in order to instigate the secure connection. This means that the server also authenticates itself to the client which prevents phishing without reliance on the user parsing complex URLs.\nNewer alternative algorithms include AuCPace\nand OPAQUE\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe SRP protocol has a number of desirable properties: it allows a user to authenticate themselves to a server, it is resistant to dictionary attacks mounted by an eavesdropper, and it does not require a trusted third party. It effectively conveys a zero-knowledge password proof from the user to the server. In revision 6 of the protocol only one password can be guessed per connection attempt. One of the interesting properties of the protocol is that even if one or two of the cryptographic primitives it uses are attacked, it is still secure. The SRP protocol has been revised several times, and is currently at revision 6a.\nThe SRP protocol creates a large private key shared between the two parties in a manner similar to Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange based on the client side having the user password and the server side having a cryptographic verifier derived from the password. The shared public key is derived from two random numbers, one generated by the client, and the other generated by the server, which are unique to the login attempt. In cases where encrypted communications as well as authentication are required, the SRP protocol is more secure than the alternative SSH protocol and faster than using Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange with signed messages. It is also independent of third parties, unlike Kerberos. The SRP protocol, version 3 is described in RFC 2945. SRP version 6 is also used for strong password authentication in SSL/TLS (in TLS-SRP) and other standards such as EAP and SAML, and is being standardized in IEEE P1363 and ISO/IEC 11770-4.\n\n== Protocol ==\nThe following notation is used in this description of the protocol, version 6:\n\nq and N\nQuestion: What is the significance of the SRP protocol being a zero-knowledge password proof protocol?",

    "instruction": "Johannes Trithemius\n\n==Introduction==\nJohannes Trithemius (; 1 February 1462 \u2013 13 December 1516), born Johann Heidenberg, was a German Benedictine abbot and a polymath who was active in the German Renaissance as a lexicographer, chronicler, cryptographer, and occultist. He is considered the founder of modern cryptography (a claim shared with Leon Battista Alberti) and steganography, as well as the founder of bibliography and literary studies as branches of knowledge. He had considerable influence on the development of early modern and modern occultism. His students included Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus.\n\n== Early life ==\nThe byname Trithemius refers to his native town of Trittenheim on the Moselle River, at the time part of the Electorate of Trier.\nWhen Johannes was still an infant his father, Johann von Heidenburg, died. His stepfather, whom his mother Elisabeth married seven years later, was hostile to education and thus Johannes could only learn in secret and with many difficulties. He learned Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. When he was 17 years old he escaped from his home and wandered around looking for good teachers, travelling to Trier, Cologne, the Netherlands, and Heidelberg. He studied at the University of Heidelberg.\n\n== Career ==\nTravelling from the university to his home town in 1482, he was surprised by a snowstorm and took refuge in the Benedictine abbey of Sponheim near Bad Kreuznach. He decided to stay and was elected abbot in 1483, at the age of twenty-one. He often served as featured speaker and chapter secretary at the Bursfelde Congregation's annual chapter from 1492 to 1503, the annual meeting of reform-minded abbots. Trithemius also supervised the visits of the Congregation's abbeys.\nTrithemius wrote extensively as a historian, starting with a chronicle of Sponheim and culminating in a two-volume work on the history of Hirsau Abbey. His work was distinguished by mastery of the Latin language and eloquent phrasing, yet it was soon discovered that he inserted several fictional passages into his works. \nEven during Trithemius's lifetime, several critics pointed out the invented sources he used. His forgery regarding the connection between the Franks and the Trojans was part of a larger project to establish a link between the current dynasty of Austria with ancient heroes. While his colleagues like Jakob Mennel and Ladislaus Suntheim often inserted invented ancestors in their works, Trithemius invented entire sources, such as Hunibald, supposedly a Scythian historian. For his research on monasteries, he utilized \u201cMeginfrid,\u201d an imagined early chronicler of Fulda and Meginfrid's nonexistent treatise De temporibus gratiae to substantiate Trithemius's ideal of monastic piety and erudition, which were supposed to be the same values shared by the monks of the ninth century. Others opine that Meginfrid was not strictly forgery but the combination of wishful thinking with faulty memory.In the process though, Trithemius became a famous builder of libraries, which he created in Sponheim and W\u00fcrzburg. In Sponheim, he set out to transform the abbey from a neglected and undisciplined place into a centre of learning. In his time, the abbey library increased from around fifty items to more than two thousand.\nHis efforts did not meet with praise, and his reputation as a magician did not further his acceptance. Increasing differences with the convent led to his resignation in 1506, when he decided to take up the offer of the Bishop of W\u00fcrzburg, Lorenz von Bibra (bishop from 1495 to 1519), to become the abbot of St. James's Abbey, the Schottenkloster in W\u00fcrzburg. He remained there until the end of his life.\nTrithemius seemed to have a falling out with Maximilian regarding their differences when the emperor wanted to organize a separate ecclesiastical council in 1511, in slight of Pope Julius II. The relationship recovered after Julius's death, though.\n\n== Death ==\nTrithemius was buried in St. James's Abbey's church; a tombstone by the famous Tilman Riemenschneider was erected in his honor. In 1825, the tombstone was moved to the Neum\u00fcnster church, next to the cathedral. It was damaged in the firebombing of 1945, and subsequently restored by the workshop of Theodor Spiegel.\n\n== Legacy ==\nNotably, the German polymath, physician, legal scholar, soldier, theologian, and occult writer Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (1486\u20131535) and the Swiss physician, alchemist, and astrologer Paracelsus (1493\u20131541) were among his pupils.\n\n== Steganographia ==\n\nTrithemius' most famous work, Steganographia (written c. 1499; published Frankfurt, 1606), was placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum in 1609 and removed in 1900. This book is in three volumes, and appears to be about magic\u2014specifically, about using spirits to communicate over long distances. Since the publication of the decryption key to the first two volumes in 1606, they have been known to be actually concerned with cryptography and steganography. Until recently, the third volume was widely still believed to be solely about magic, but the \"magical\" formulae have now been shown to be covertexts for yet more cryptographic content. However, mentions of the magical work within the third book by such figures as Agrippa and John Dee still lend credence to the idea of a mystic-magical foundation concerning the third volume. Additionally, while Trithemius's steganographic methods can be established to be free of the need for angelic\u2013astrological mediation, still left intact is an underlying theological motive for their contrivance. The preface to the Polygraphia equally establishes that the everyday practicability of cryptography was conceived by Trithemius as a \"secular consequent of the ability of a soul specially empowered by God to reach, by magical means, from earth to Heaven\". Robert Hooke suggested, in the chapter Of Dr. Dee's Book of Spirits, that John Dee made use of Trithemian steganography to conceal his communication with Queen Elizabeth I. Amongst the codes used in this book is the Ave Maria cipher, where each coded letter is replaced by a short sentence about Jesus in Latin.\n\nThe reason for Polygraphia and Steganographia as covertexts being written are unknown. Possible explanations are that either its real target audience was the selected few such as Maximilian, or that Trithemius wanted to attract public attention to a tedious field.\n\n== Works ==\n\nExhortationes ad monachos, 1486\nDe institutione vitae sacerdotalis, 1486\nDe regimine claustralium, 1486\nDe visitatione monachorum, about 1490\nCatalogus illustrium virorum Germaniae, 1491\u20131495\nDe laude scriptorum manualium, 1492 (printed 1494) Zum Lob der Schreiber; Freunde Mainfr\u00e4nkischer Kunst and Geschichte e.

      "context": "Johannes Trithemius\n\n==Introduction==\nJohannes Trithemius (; 1 February 1462 \u2013 13 December 1516), born Johann Heidenberg, was a German Benedictine abbot and a polymath who was active in the German Renaissance as a lexicographer, chronicler, cryptographer, and occultist. He is considered the founder of modern cryptography (a claim shared with Leon Battista Alberti) and steganography, as well as the founder of bibliography and literary studies as branches of knowledge. He had considerable influence on the development of early modern and modern occultism. His students included Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa and Paracelsus.\n\n== Early life ==\nThe byname Trithemius refers to his native town of Trittenheim on the Moselle River, at the time part of the Electorate of Trier.\nWhen Johannes was still an infant his father, Johann von Heidenburg, died. His stepfather, whom his mother Elisabeth married seven years later, was hostile to education and thus Johannes could only learn in secret and with many difficulties. He learned Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. When he was 17 years old he escaped from his home and wandered around looking for good teachers, travelling to Trier, Cologne, the Netherlands, and Heidelberg. He studied at the University of Heidelberg.\n\n== Career ==\nTravelling from the university to his home town in 1482, he was surprised by a snowstorm and took refuge in the Benedictine abbey of Sponheim near Bad Kreuznach. He decided to stay and was elected abbot in 1483, at the age of twenty-one. He often served as featured speaker and chapter secretary at the Bursfelde Congregation's annual chapter from 1492 to 1503, the annual meeting of reform-minded abbots. Trithemius also supervised the visits of the Congregation's abbeys.\nTrithemius wrote extensively as a historian, starting with a chronicle of Sponheim and culminating in a two-volume work on the history of Hirsau Abbey. His work was distinguished by mastery of the Latin language and eloquent phrasing, yet it was soon discovered that he inserted several fictional passages into his works. \nEven during Trithemius's lifetime, several critics pointed out the invented sources he used. His forgery regarding the connection between the Franks and the Trojans was part of a larger project to establish a link between the current dynasty of Austria with ancient heroes. While his colleagues like Jakob Mennel and Ladislaus Suntheim often inserted invented ancestors in their works, Trithemius invented entire sources, such as Hunibald, supposedly a Scythian historian. For his research on monasteries, he utilized \u201cMeginfrid,\u201d an imagined early chronicler of Fulda and Meginfrid's nonexistent treatise De temporibus gratiae to substantiate Trithemius's ideal of monastic piety and erudition, which were supposed to be the same values shared by the monks of the ninth century. Others opine that Meginfrid was not strictly forgery but the combination of wishful thinking with faulty memory.In the process though, Trithemius became a famous builder of libraries, which he created in Sponheim and W\u00fcrzburg. In Sponheim, he set out to transform the abbey from a neglected and undisciplined place into a centre of learning. In his time, the abbey library increased from around fifty items to more than two thousand.\nHis efforts did not meet with praise, and his reputation as a magician did not further his acceptance. Increasing differences with the convent led to his resignation in 1506, when he decided to take up the offer of the Bishop of W\u00fcrzburg, Lorenz von Bibra (bishop from 1495 to 1519), to become the abbot of St. James's Abbey, the Schottenkloster in W\u00fcrzburg.

    "instruction": "Domain Based Security\n\n==Introduction==\n\"Domain Based Security\", abbreviated to \"DBSy\", is a model-based approach to help analyze information security risks in a business context and provide a clear and direct mapping between the risks and the security controls needed to manage them. A variant of the approach is used by the UK government's HMG Infosec Standard No.1 technical risk-assessment method. DBSy is a registered trade mark of QinetiQ Ltd.\nDBSy was developed in the late 1990s by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA). It is a model-based approach to information assurance that describes the requirements for security in an organisation, taking account of the business that needs to be supported. The model is based around the concept of a security domain, which represents a logical place where people work with information using a computer system, and which has connections with other security domains where this is necessary to support business activity. Hence the focus is on the information that needs protection, the people that work with it and the people they exchange information with. The model can also describe the physical environments where people work and the system boundaries where major system security measures are placed. A systematic method is then applied to the model to identify and describe the risks to which valuable information assets are exposed and specify security measures that are effective in managing the risks.\n\n\n\n== The DBSy model ==\nThe DBSy approach uses simple models to represent the requirements for security in an organisation using two different but related viewpoints: the Infosec Business Model represents the security aspects of the business, while the Infosec Infrastructure Model represents the logical provision of strong boundaries that enforce separation. When combined, they make up an Infosec Architecture Model\n. \nThis model forms the basis for conducting a systematic and rigorous risk assessment.\nThe Infosec business model defines security domains and the connections between them. The model specifies the limits of what information can be processed and exchanged between security domains and so forms the set of security requirements for the business. In particular, connections that are not explicitly modelled are not permitted and are required not to occur. A security domain is characterised by a set of information assets, which may be valuable to the organisation, as well as the people that work with the information and the applications and services that act on their behalf.   Connections between domains are characterised by the nature of the interaction that is required (such as interpersonal messages, or shared access to a database) and the sensitivity and integrity requirements of the information exchange. The model can also represent the kinds of physical environment from which a domain can be accessed.\nThe Infosec infrastructure model defines islands of computing infrastructure that are required to be logically separate, so that information cannot be exchanged between them except at identifiable and manageable points of connection, referred to as causeways. An island is characterised by the strength of separation between it and any other islands and by the people who manage its computing infrastructure.\nAn Infosec architecture model combines the business and infrastructure views, by showing which security domains are supported by which islands of infrastructure. Where there are connections between security domains that are hosted on different islands, the connections must be supported by an appropriate causeway.\n\n== Risk assessment method ==\nThe DBSy method uses a rational risk framework for describing the risks to which some information assets are exposed. Similar kinds of assets are grouped together as a focus of interest, and the risk assessment process is applied to each focus of interest in turn.\nThe key factors determining the risk to a particular focus of interest are:\n\nbusiness Impact of compromise to the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the focus of interest;\nsets of people who might wish to inflict damage (threat sources) and their motivation for doing so;\ngroups of people with different opportunities to inflict damage (threat actors) and their capability to do so, who may also be threat sources or could be influenced by others;\nthe means by which each threat actor might cause damage (causes of compromise);\nthe defences in place (or planned) to protect the focus of interest.This risk framework is applied in a systematic fashion to an organisation-specific Infosec architecture model, representing the security-relevant features of an organisation's business and IT systems. Through this process a set of Compromise Paths can be systematically described and the relative effectiveness of different countermeasures can be assessed \n.\n\n== Comparison with other IA risk methods ==\nDBSy differs from other IT risk management methods in that its primary focus is on people, the business drivers of an organisation and the way the business works, rather than on technical security measures. The analyst is required to systematically define the groups of people that pose a threat and the ways they might cause harm, providing a rigorous, business-oriented framework for the concepts of threat and vulnerability. The aim is to understand and analyse information security risks faced by an organisation, especially where the risks appear to conflict with needs for business efficiency across the organisation or in dealings with customers and business partners.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: How does DBSy group similar kinds of assets together as a focus of interest in the risk assessment process?",

It can therefore be said that the purpose of database encryption is to protect the data stored in a database from being accessed by individuals with potentially \"malicious\" intentions. The act of encrypting a database also reduces the incentive for individuals to hack the aforementioned database as \"meaningless\" encrypted data is of little to no use for hackers. There are multiple techniques and technologies available for database encryption, the most important of which will be detailed in this article.\n\n\n\n== Transparent/External database encryption ==\nTransparent data encryption (often abbreviated as TDE) is used to encrypt an entire database, which therefore involves encrypting \"data at rest\". Data at rest can generally be defined as \"inactive\" data that is not currently being edited or pushed across a network. As an example, a text file stored on a computer is \"at rest\" until it is opened and edited. Data at rest are stored on physical storage media solutions such as tapes or hard disk drives. The act of storing large amounts of sensitive data on physical storage media naturally raises concerns of security and theft. TDE ensures that the data on physical storage media cannot be read by malicious individuals that may have the intention to steal them. Data that cannot be read is worthless, thus reducing the incentive for theft. Perhaps the most important strength that is attributed to TDE is its transparency. Given that TDE encrypts all data it can be said that no applications need to be altered in order for TDE to run correctly. It is important to note that TDE encrypts the entirety of the database as well as backups of the database. The transparent element of TDE has to do with the fact that TDE encrypts on \"the page level\", which essentially means that data is encrypted when stored and decrypted when it is called into the system's memory. The contents of the database are encrypted using a symmetric key that is often referred to as a \"database encryption key\".\n\n== Column-level encryption ==\nIn order to explain column-level encryption it is important to outline basic database structure. A typical relational database is divided into tables that are divided into columns that each have rows of data. Whilst TDE usually encrypts an entire database, column-level encryption allows for individual columns within a database to be encrypted. It is important to establish that the granularity of column-level encryption causes specific strengths and weaknesses to arise when compared to encrypting an entire database. Firstly, the ability to encrypt individual columns allows for column-level encryption to be significantly more flexible when compared to encryption systems that encrypt an entire database such as TDE. Secondly, it is possible to use an entirely unique and separate encryption key for each column within a database. This effectively increases the difficulty of generating rainbow tables which thus implies that the data stored within each column is less likely to be lost or leaked. The main disadvantage associated with column-level database encryption is speed, or a loss thereof. Encrypting separate columns with different unique keys in the same database can cause database performance to decrease, and additionally also decreases the speed at which the contents of the database can be indexed or searched.\n\n== Field-level encryption ==\nExperimental work is being done on providing database operations (like searching or arithmetical operations) on encrypted fields without the need to decrypt them. Strong encryption is required to be randomized - a different result must be generated each time.  This is known as probabilistic encryption.  Field-level encryption is weaker than randomized encryption, but it allows users to test for equality without decrypting the data.\n\n== Filesystem-level encryption ==\n\n\n*** Encrypting File System (EFS) ***\n\nIt is important to note that traditional database encryption techniques normally encrypt and decrypt the contents of a database. Databases are managed by \"Database Management Systems\" (DBMS) that run on top of an existing operating system (OS). This raises a potential security concern, as an encrypted database may be running on an accessible and potentially vulnerable operating system. EFS can encrypt data that is not part of a database system, which implies that the scope of encryption for EFS is much wider when compared to a system such as TDE that is only capable of encrypting database files. Whilst EFS does widen the scope of encryption, it also decreases database performance and can cause administration issues as system administrators require operating system access to use EFS. Due to the issues concerning performance, EFS is not typically used in databasing applications that require frequent database input and output. In order to offset the performance issues it is often recommended that EFS systems be used in environments with few users.\n\n== Full disk encryption ==\n\nBitLocker does not have the same performance concerns associated with EFS.\n\n== Symmetric and asymmetric database encryption ==\n\n\n*** Symmetric database encryption ***\nSymmetric encryption in the context of database encryption involves a private key being applied to data that is stored and called from a database. This private key alters the data in a way that causes it to be unreadable without first being decrypted. Data is encrypted when saved, and decrypted when opened given that the user knows the private key. Thus if the data is to be shared through a database the receiving individual must have a copy of the secret key used by the sender in order to decrypt and view the data. A clear disadvantage related to symmetric encryption is that sensitive data can be leaked if the private key is spread to individuals that should not have access to the data. However, given that only one key is involved in the encryption process it can generally be said that speed is an advantage of symmetric encryption.\n\n\n*** Asymmetric database encryption ***\nAsymmetric encryption expands on symmetric encryption by incorporating two different types of keys into the encryption method: private and public keys. A public key can be accessed by anyone and is unique to one user whereas a private key is a secret key that is unique to and only known by one user. In most scenarios the public key is the encryption key whereas the private key is the decryption key. As an example, if individual A would like to send a message to individual B using asymmetric encryption, he would encrypt the message using Individual B's public key and then send the encrypted version. Individual B would then be able to decrypt the message using his private key. Individual C would not be able to decrypt Individual A's message, as Individual C's private key is not the same as Individual B's private key. Asymmetric encryption is often described as being more secure in comparison to symmetric database encryption given that private keys do not need to be shared as two separate keys handle encryption and decryption processes. For performance reasons, asymmetric encryption is used in Key management rather than to encrypt the data which is usually done with symmetric encryption.\n\n== Key management ==\nThe Symmetric & Asymmetric Database Encryption section introduced the concept of public and private keys with basic examples in which users exchange keys. The act of exchanging keys becomes impractical from a logistical point of view, when many different individuals need to communicate with each-other. In database encryption the system handles the storage and exchange of keys. This process is called key management. If encryption keys are not managed and stored properly, highly sensitive data may be leaked. Additionally, if a key management system deletes or loses a key, the information that was encrypted via said key is essentially rendered \"lost\" as well. The complexity of key management logistics is also a topic that needs to be taken into consideration. As the number of application that a firm uses increases, the number of keys that need to be stored and managed increases as well. Thus it is necessary to establish a way in which keys from all applications can be managed through a single channel, which is also known as enterprise key management. Enterprise Key Management Solutions are sold by a great number of suppliers in the technology industry. These systems essentially provide a centralised key management solution that allows administrators to manage all keys in a system through one hub. Thus it can be said that the introduction of enterprise key management solutions has the potential to lessen the risks associated with key management in the context of database encryption, as well as to reduce the logistical troubles that arise when many individuals attempt to manually share keys.\n\n== Hashing ==\nHashing is used in database systems as a method to protect sensitive data such as passwords; however it is also used to improve the efficiency of database referencing. Inputted data is manipulated by a hashing algorithm. The hashing algorithm converts the inputted data into a string of fixed length that can then be stored in a database. Hashing systems have two crucially important characteristics that will now be outlined. Firstly, hashes are \"unique and repeatable\". As an example, running the word \"cat\" through the same hashing algorithm multiple times will always yield the same hash, however it is extremely difficult to find a word that will return the same hash that \"cat\" does. Secondly, hashing algorithms are not reversible. To relate this back to the example provided above, it would be nearly impossible to convert the output of the hashing algorithm back to the original input, which was \"cat\". In the context of database encryption, hashing is often used in password systems. When a user first creates their password it is run through a hashing algorithm and saved as a hash. When the user logs back into the website, the password that they enter is run through the hashing algorithm and is then compared to the stored hash. Given the fact that hashes are unique, if both hashes match then it is said that the user inputted the correct password. One example of a popular hash function is SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) 256.\n\n\n*** Salting ***\nOne issue that arises when using hashing for password management in the context of database encryption is the fact that a malicious user could potentially use an Input to Hash table rainbow table for the specific hashing algorithm that the system uses. This would effectively allow the individual to decrypt the hash and thus have access to stored passwords. A solution for this issue is to 'salt' the hash. Salting is the process of encrypting more than just the password in a database. The more information that is added to a string that is to be hashed, the more difficult it becomes to collate rainbow tables. As an example, a system may combine a user's email and password into a single hash. This increase in the complexity of a hash means that it is far more difficult and thus less likely for rainbow tables to be generated. This naturally implies that the threat of sensitive data loss is minimised through salting hashes.\n\n\n*** Pepper ***\nSome systems incorporate a \"pepper\" in addition to salts in their hashing systems. Pepper systems are controversial, however it is still necessary to explain their use. A pepper is a value that is added to a hashed password that has been salted. This pepper is often unique to one website or service, and it is important to note that the same pepper is usually added to all passwords saved in a database. In theory the inclusion of peppers in password hashing systems has the potential to decrease the risk of rainbow (Input : Hash) tables, given the system-level specificity of peppers, however the real world benefits of pepper implementation are highly disputed.\n\n== Application-level encryption ==\nIn application-level encryption, the process of encrypting data is completed by the application that has been used to generate or modify the data that is to be encrypted. Essentially this means that data is encrypted before it is written to the database. This unique approach to encryption allows for the encryption process to be tailored to each user based on the information (such as entitlements or roles) that the application knows about its users.According to Eugene Pilyankevich, \"Application-level encryption is becoming a good practice for systems with increased security requirements, with a general drift toward perimeter-less and more exposed cloud systems\".\n\n\n*** Advantages of application-level encryption ***\nOne of the most important advantages of application-level encryption is the fact that application-level encryption has the potential to simplify the encryption process used by a company. If an application encrypts the data that it writes/modifies from a database then a secondary encryption tool will not need to be integrated into the system. The second main advantage relates to the overarching theme of theft. Given that data is encrypted before it is written to the server, a hacker would need to have access to the database contents as well as the applications that were used to encrypt and decrypt the contents of the database in order to decrypt sensitive data.\n\n\n*** Disadvantages of application-level encryption ***\nThe first important disadvantage of Application-level encryption is that applications used by a firm will need to be modified to encrypt data themselves. This has the potential to consume a significant amount of time and other resources. Given the nature of opportunity cost firms may not believe that application-level encryption is worth the investment. In addition, application-level encryption may have a limiting effect on database performance. If all data on a database is encrypted by a multitude of different applications then it becomes impossible to index or search data on the database. To ground this in reality in the form of a basic example: it would be impossible to construct a glossary in a single language for a book that was written in 30 languages. Lastly the complexity of key management increases, as multiple different applications need to have the authority and access to encrypt data and write it to the database.\n\n== Risks of database encryption ==\nWhen discussing the topic of database encryption it is imperative to be aware of the risks that are involved in the process. The first set of risks are related to key management. If private keys are not managed in an \"isolated system\", system administrators with malicious intentions may have the ability to decrypt sensitive data using keys that they have access to. The fundamental principle of keys also gives rise to a potentially devastating risk: if keys are lost then the encrypted data is essentially lost as well, as decryption without keys is almost impossible.\n\nHow does EFS differ from TDE in terms of encryption scope?",

    "instruction": "Digital DawgPound\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Digital DawgPound (more commonly referred to as the \"DDP\") is a group of hackers, best known for a series of articles in hacker magazines such as 2600: The Hacker Quarterly and Make, the long-running webcast Binary Revolution Radio, and a very active set of forums with posts from high-profile hackers such as Strom Carlson, decoder, Phiber Optik and StankDawg. The stated mission of the DDP is to propagate a more positive image of hackers than the negative mass media stereotype.  The group welcomes new members who want to learn about hacking, and attempts to teach them more positive aspects and steer them away from the negative aspects, by reinforcing the hacker ethic.  Their goal is to show that hackers can, and regularly do, make positive contributions not only to technology, but to society as a whole.\n\n\n\n== Members ==\nOver the years, DDP membership has included several staff writers for 2600: The Hacker Quarterly and Blacklisted! 411 magazine including StankDawg and bland_inquisitor.  They frequently publish articles, provide content, and appear on many media sources across the global Interweb.  DDP members are also regular speakers at hacking conferences such as DEF CON, H.O.P.E., and Interzone.\nThe majority of DDP members are college graduates and have professional experience in the computer industry.  Some work for Fortune 500 companies, while others have been entrepreneurs who have created successful businesses.  They hold memberships in Mensa and the International High IQ society.\n\n== Binary Revolution ==\nThe best known of the DDP projects is that of Binary Revolution, or \"BinRev\".  This project was created in an attempt to bring the hacking community back together, working towards a common, positive goal of reclaiming the name of hackers.  The Binary Revolution emphasizes positive aspects of hacking and projects that help society.  It does this in a variety of outlets including monthly meetings, the weekly radio show Binary Revolution Radio(BRR), a video-based series of shows called HackTV, and very active message board forums.\nBinary Revolution Radio, often shortened to \"BRR\", is one small part of the binrev community.  It is common for people to discover BRR on one of the many podcast sites or applications out there and not realize that the \"Binary Revolution\" refers to a larger community than just the radio show.  When people refer to \"BinRev\" they should not be referring only to the radio show.  They should be referring to the community of projects as a whole, specifically focusing on the forums.\n\n== Recognition ==\nThe DDP maintains a blog \"which they refer to as a \"blawg\". Posts by DDP members have been featured on other technology-related sites such as those of Make Magazine,\nHackADay,\nHacked Gadgets, and others.\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n*** Printed ***\nNatas - \"Backspoofing 101\", Spring 2007, 2600 Magazine\nNatas - \"Ownage by AdSense\", Fall 2006, 2600 Magazine\nBlack Ratchet - \"Not Quite Dead Yet\", Spring 2006, 2600 Magazine\ndual_parallel - \"Port Knocking Simplified\", Winter 2005, Blacklisted411 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"The Art of Electronic Deduction\", Winter 2005, Blacklisted411 Magazine\ndual_parallel - \"Remote Encrypted Data Access\", Fall 2005, Blacklisted411 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"Stupid Webstats Tricks\", Fall 2005, 2600 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"Hacking Google AdWords\", Summer 2005, 2600 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"Disposable Email Vulnerabilities\", Spring 2005, 2600 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"0wning Universal Studios Florida\", Fall 2004, Blacklisted411 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"How to Hack The Lottery\", Fall 2004, 2600 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"Robots and Spiders\", Winter 2003, 2600 Magazine\nntheory - \"Backspoofing: Let the Telco Do the Walking\", July 2004, BR magazine Issue 2.1\nntheory - \"Packet8 IP Phone service\", July 2004, BR magazine Issue 2.1\ndual_parallel - \"White Hat Wi-Fi\", July 2004, BR magazine Issue 2.1\nhacnslash - \"An IR receiver for your PC\", July 2004, BR magazine Issue 2.1\nStankDawg - \"Hacking 101:  Directory Transversal\", July 2004, BR magazine Issue 2.1\nntheory - \"Hacking Coinstar\", September 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.2\nw1nt3rmut3 - \"Best buy insecurities: revisited\", September 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.2\nbland_inquisitor - \"Kismet on Knoppix HD install\", September 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.2\ndual_parallel - \"A Physical Security Primer for the Community\", September 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.2\nlogan5 - \"case modeling\", September 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.2\nvooduHAL - \"Insecurities in my cafe cup\", September 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.2\nStankDawg - \"Hacking 101:  Targeting Theory\", September 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.2\nbland_inquisitor - \"Denial of Service Attacks, Tools of the Tools\", May 2003, BR magazine and Fall 2003, 2600 Magazine Issue 1.1\nStankDawg - \"Hacking 101: Footprinting a system\", May 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.1\nevo_tech - \"Your rights and why you have already lost them\", May 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.1\nnick84 & StankDawg - \"2600 Secrets\", May 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.1\nnick84 - \"Watching the watchers\", May 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.1\ndual_parallel - \"Public TTYs: Description and Methodologies for Free Calling\", May 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.1\nbland_inquisitor - \"Cookies:  The good, the bad, and the ugly\", May 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.1\nStankDawg - \"A newbies guide to ghettodriving\", May 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.1\nw1nt3rmut3 - \"Phreaking Italy\", May 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.1\nw1nt3rmut3 - \"Best Buy Insecurities\", Spring 2003, 2600 Magazine\nbland_inquisitor - \"Honeypots: Building the Better Hacker\", Winter 2002, 2600 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"A History of 31337sp34k\", Fall 2002, 2600 Magazine\nbland_inquisitor - \"Telezapper, Telemarketers, and the TCPA\", Fall 2002, 2600 Magazine\ndual_parallel - \"Retail Hardware Revisited\", Spring 2002, 2600 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"Transaction Based Systems\", Spring 2002, 2600 Magazine\ndual_parallel - \"Hacking Retail Hardware\", Fall 2001, 2600 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"Batch vs. Interactive\", Summer 1999, 2600 Magazine\n\n\n*** Online ***\nStankDawg - \"Wardriving with Mickey\", October 2005\ndual_parallel & bland_inquisitor - \"Slackware 10.2 Tips\", September 2005\nlogan5 - \"The iPod: It's not just for music anymore\", January 2005\nbland_inquisitor - \"Kodak Picture Maker: In's and Out's\", December 2004\nStankDawg - \"Hackers Insomnia\", October 2004, Frequency zine\ndual_parallel & bland_inquisitor - \"Basic Slackware Security\", April 2004\nStankDawg - \"Scanning GO.MSN.COM\", May 2004, Radical Future zine Issue #5\nStankDawg - \"Fun with the dnL flipit chatbot\", December 2003, Outbreak zine issue #14\nStankDawg & bi0s - \"Inside Circuit City\", December 2003, Outbreak zine issue #14\nhacnslash - \"Dumpster Diving - Art or Science?\", September 23, 2003\nbland_inquisitor - \"Social Insecurity\", December 2003, Radical Future zine Issue #4\nntheory - \"Generating Millisecond Accurate, Multi-Frequency Wave Files in Perl\", July 2003\nStankDawg - \"DMCA vs googlefight.com\", December 2002, Outbreak zine issue #12\nStankDawg - \"Basic Directory Transversal\", November 2002, Outbreak zine issue #11\nStankDawg - \"Hacking Movies\", Winter 2002, Radical Future zine Issue #3\nStankDawg - \"AIM Transcript (Campaign For Freedom)\", Winter 2002, Radical Future zine Issue #3\n\n\n*** Presentations ***\nStankDawg - \"Binary Revolution Radio - Season 4 live!\", July 2006, H.O.P.E.

      "context": "Digital DawgPound\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Digital DawgPound (more commonly referred to as the \"DDP\") is a group of hackers, best known for a series of articles in hacker magazines such as 2600: The Hacker Quarterly and Make, the long-running webcast Binary Revolution Radio, and a very active set of forums with posts from high-profile hackers such as Strom Carlson, decoder, Phiber Optik and StankDawg. The stated mission of the DDP is to propagate a more positive image of hackers than the negative mass media stereotype.  The group welcomes new members who want to learn about hacking, and attempts to teach them more positive aspects and steer them away from the negative aspects, by reinforcing the hacker ethic.  Their goal is to show that hackers can, and regularly do, make positive contributions not only to technology, but to society as a whole.\n\n\n\n== Members ==\nOver the years, DDP membership has included several staff writers for 2600: The Hacker Quarterly and Blacklisted! 411 magazine including StankDawg and bland_inquisitor.  They frequently publish articles, provide content, and appear on many media sources across the global Interweb.  DDP members are also regular speakers at hacking conferences such as DEF CON, H.O.P.E., and Interzone.\nThe majority of DDP members are college graduates and have professional experience in the computer industry.  Some work for Fortune 500 companies, while others have been entrepreneurs who have created successful businesses.  They hold memberships in Mensa and the International High IQ society.\n\n== Binary Revolution ==\nThe best known of the DDP projects is that of Binary Revolution, or \"BinRev\".  This project was created in an attempt to bring the hacking community back together, working towards a common, positive goal of reclaiming the name of hackers.  The Binary Revolution emphasizes positive aspects of hacking and projects that help society.  It does this in a variety of outlets including monthly meetings, the weekly radio show Binary Revolution Radio(BRR), a video-based series of shows called HackTV, and very active message board forums.\nBinary Revolution Radio, often shortened to \"BRR\", is one small part of the binrev community.  It is common for people to discover BRR on one of the many podcast sites or applications out there and not realize that the \"Binary Revolution\" refers to a larger community than just the radio show.  When people refer to \"BinRev\" they should not be referring only to the radio show.  They should be referring to the community of projects as a whole, specifically focusing on the forums.\n\n== Recognition ==\nThe DDP maintains a blog \"which they refer to as a \"blawg\". Posts by DDP members have been featured on other technology-related sites such as those of Make Magazine,\nHackADay,\nHacked Gadgets, and others.\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n*** Printed ***\nNatas - \"Backspoofing 101\", Spring 2007, 2600 Magazine\nNatas - \"Ownage by AdSense\", Fall 2006, 2600 Magazine\nBlack Ratchet - \"Not Quite Dead Yet\", Spring 2006, 2600 Magazine\ndual_parallel - \"Port Knocking Simplified\", Winter 2005, Blacklisted411 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"The Art of Electronic Deduction\", Winter 2005, Blacklisted411 Magazine\ndual_parallel - \"Remote Encrypted Data Access\", Fall 2005, Blacklisted411 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"Stupid Webstats Tricks\", Fall 2005, 2600 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"Hacking Google AdWords\", Summer 2005, 2600 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"Disposable Email Vulnerabilities\", Spring 2005, 2600 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"0wning Universal Studios Florida\", Fall 2004, Blacklisted411 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"How to Hack The Lottery\", Fall 2004, 2600 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"Robots and Spiders\", Winter 2003, 2600 Magazine\nntheory - \"Backspoofing: Let the Telco Do the Walking\", July 2004, BR magazine Issue 2.1\nntheory - \"Packet8 IP Phone service\", July 2004, BR magazine Issue 2.1\ndual_parallel - \"White Hat Wi-Fi\", July 2004, BR magazine Issue 2.1\nhacnslash - \"An IR receiver for your PC\", July 2004, BR magazine Issue 2.1\nStankDawg - \"Hacking 101:  Directory Transversal\", July 2004, BR magazine Issue 2.1\nntheory - \"Hacking Coinstar\", September 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.2\nw1nt3rmut3 - \"Best buy insecurities: revisited\", September 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.2\nbland_inquisitor - \"Kismet on Knoppix HD install\", September 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.2\ndual_parallel - \"A Physical Security Primer for the Community\", September 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.2\nlogan5 - \"case modeling\", September 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.2\nvooduHAL - \"Insecurities in my cafe cup\", September 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.2\nStankDawg - \"Hacking 101:  Targeting Theory\", September 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.2\nbland_inquisitor - \"Denial of Service Attacks, Tools of the Tools\", May 2003, BR magazine and Fall 2003, 2600 Magazine Issue 1.1\nStankDawg - \"Hacking 101: Footprinting a system\", May 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.1\nevo_tech - \"Your rights and why you have already lost them\", May 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.1\nnick84 & StankDawg - \"2600 Secrets\", May 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.1\nnick84 - \"Watching the watchers\", May 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.1\ndual_parallel - \"Public TTYs: Description and Methodologies for Free Calling\", May 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.1\nbland_inquisitor - \"Cookies:  The good, the bad, and the ugly\", May 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.1\nStankDawg - \"A newbies guide to ghettodriving\", May 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.1\nw1nt3rmut3 - \"Phreaking Italy\", May 2003, BR magazine Issue 1.1\nw1nt3rmut3 - \"Best Buy Insecurities\", Spring 2003, 2600 Magazine\nbland_inquisitor - \"Honeypots: Building the Better Hacker\", Winter 2002, 2600 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"A History of 31337sp34k\", Fall 2002, 2600 Magazine\nbland_inquisitor - \"Telezapper, Telemarketers, and the TCPA\", Fall 2002, 2600 Magazine\ndual_parallel - \"Retail Hardware Revisited\", Spring 2002, 2600 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"Transaction Based Systems\", Spring 2002, 2600 Magazine\ndual_parallel - \"Hacking Retail Hardware\", Fall 2001, 2600 Magazine\nStankDawg - \"Batch vs. Interactive\", Summer 1999, 2600 Magazine\n\n\n*** Online ***\nStankDawg - \"Wardriving with Mickey\", October 2005\ndual_parallel & bland_inquisitor - \"Slackware 10.2 Tips\", September 2005\nlogan5 - \"The iPod: It's not just for music anymore\", January 2005\nbland_inquisitor - \"Kodak Picture Maker: In's and Out's\", December 2004\nStankDawg - \"Hackers Insomnia\", October 2004, Frequency zine\ndual_parallel & bland_inquisitor - \"Basic Slackware Security\", April 2004\nStankDawg - \"Scanning GO.MSN.COM\", May 2004, Radical Future zine Issue #5\nStankDawg - \"Fun with the dnL flipit chatbot\", December 2003, Outbreak zine issue #14\nStankDawg & bi0s - \"Inside Circuit City\", December 2003, Outbreak zine issue #14\nhacnslash - \"Dumpster Diving - Art or Science?\", September 23, 2003\nbland_inquisitor - \"Social Insecurity\", December 2003, Radical Future zine Issue #4\nntheory - \"Generating Millisecond Accurate, Multi-Frequency Wave Files in Perl\", July 2003\nStankDawg - \"DMCA vs googlefight.com\", December 2002, Outbreak zine issue #12\nStankDawg - \"Basic Directory Transversal\", November 2002, Outbreak zine issue #11\nStankDawg - \"Hacking Movies\", Winter 2002, Radical Future zine Issue #3\nStankDawg - \"AIM Transcript (Campaign For Freedom)\", Winter 2002, Radical Future zine Issue #3\n\n\n*** Presentations ***\nStankDawg - \"Binary Revolution Radio - Season 4 live!\", July 2006, H.O.P.E.

    "instruction": "Qubes OS\n\n==Introduction==\nQubes OS is a security-focused desktop operating system that aims to provide security through isolation. Virtualization is performed by Xen, and user environments can be based on the officially supported Fedora or Debian, or with the community supported Whonix, Ubuntu, Arch Linux, CentOS, or Gentoo.Operating Systems like Qubes OS are referred to in academia as Converged Multi-Level Secure (MLS) Systems. Other proposals of similar systems have surfaced and SecureView and VMware vSphere are commercial competitors.\n\n\n\n== Security goals ==\n\nQubes implements a Security by Isolation approach. \nThe assumption is that there can be no perfect, bug-free desktop environment: such an environment counts millions of lines of code and billions of software/hardware interactions. One critical bug in any of these interactions may be enough for malicious software to take control of a machine.To secure a desktop a Qubes user takes care to isolate various environments, so that if one of the components gets compromised, the malicious software would get access to only the data inside that environment.In Qubes, the isolation is provided in two dimensions: hardware controllers can be isolated into functional domains (e.g. network domains, USB controller domains), whereas the user's digital life is divided into domains with different levels of trust. \nFor instance: work domain (most trusted), shopping domain, random domain (less trusted). Each of those domains is run in a separate virtual machine (VM).\nQubes VMs, by default, have passwordless root access (e.g. passwordless sudo). UEFI Secure Boot is not supported out of the box, but this is not considered a major security issue. \nQubes is not a multiuser system.\n\n== Installation and requirements ==\nQubes was not intended to be run as part of a multi-boot system because if an attacker were to take control of one of the other operating systems then they would likely be able to compromise Qubes (e.g. before Qubes boots). \nHowever, it is still possible to use Qubes as part of a multi-boot system and even to use grub2 as the boot loader/boot manager. \nA standard Qubes installation takes all space on the storage medium (e.g. hard drive, USB flash drive) to which it is installed (not just all available free space) and it uses LUKS/dm-crypt full disk encryption. \nIt is possible to customize much of the Qubes OS installation but for security reasons, this is discouraged for users that are not intimately familiar with Qubes. \nQubes 4.x needs at least 32 GiB of disk space and 4 GB of RAM.\nHowever, in practice, it typically needs upwards of 6-8 GB of RAM, since although it is possible to run it with only 4 GB of RAM, users will likely be limited to running no more than about three Qubes at a time.Since 2013, Qubes has not had support for 32-bit x86 architectures and now requires a 64-bit processor. \nQubes uses Intel VT-d/AMD's AMD-Vi, which is only available on 64-bit architectures, to isolate devices and drivers. \nThe 64-bit architecture also provides a little more protection against some classes of attacks. \nSince Qubes 4.x, Qubes requires either an Intel processor with support for VT-x with EPT and Intel VT-d virtualization technology or an AMD processor with support for AMD-V with RVI (SLAT) and AMD-Vi (aka AMD IOMMU) virtualization technology. \nQubes targets the desktop market. \nThis market is dominated by laptops running Intel processors and chipsets and consequently, Qubes developers focus on Intel's VT-x/VT-d technologies. \nThis is not a major issue for AMD processors since AMD IOMMU is functionally identical to Intel's VT-d.\n\n== User experience ==\nThe users interact with Qubes OS very much the same way they would interact with a regular desktop operating system. But there are some key differences:\n\nEach security domain (Qube) is identified by a different colored window border\nOpening an application for the first time in that session for a particular security domain will take around 30 seconds, depending on hardware\nCopying files and clipboard is a little different since domains do not share a clipboard or file system\nThe user can create and manage security compartments\n\n== System architecture overview ==\n\n\n*** Xen hypervisor and administrative domain (Dom0) ***\nThe Xen hypervisor provides isolation between its hosted VMs, called domains in Xen parlance. The first, administrative, domain is referred to as Domain 0 or more commonly Dom0. Most other domains are referred to as AppVMs (see below).\n[Elsewhere in this document, the security isolation concepts refer to secure domains. As a result, further references in this section will prefer the term virtual machine / VM.]\nThe operating system in Dom0 is currently Fedora Linux which runs a Xen-enabled Linux kernel. It is the Dom0 kernel that controls and brokers access to all the physical system hardware, via standard Linux kernel device drivers.\nDom0 hosts the GUI and controls the graphics device, as well as input devices, such as the keyboard and mouse. The GUI runs the X server, which displays the user's desktop, and the window manager, which allows the user to start and stop the applications and manipulate their applications' windows.\nIn order to protect the integrity of Dom0, it is completely isolated from the network. Applications running directly in Dom0 (i.e.- not in a VM) have no means of connecting to any network, by design.\nThe virtual storage devices (hard disk, CD/DVD) of the AppVMs is managed by Dom0. These are usually stored as a single monolithic file \"per-virtual-disk\" or .ISO CD/DVD image on the local file systems available to Dom0.\nDom0 has the least possible interaction with the AppVMs in order to minimize the possibility of an attack originating from there.(Updates to the Dom0 Linux operating system and the included Template OS images are performed via a special mechanism which does not require Dom0 to connect to a network.\n\n\n*** Application Virtual Machines (AppVMs) ***\nIn Qubes, all VMs other than Dom0, the  Network and the Firewall are called AppVMs. They permit secure, compartmented execution of standard user applications such as a web browser, an email client or a text editor.\nOperation of AppVMs is controlled by the Application Viewer. It launches the discrete AppVMs and presents them on the desktop of Dom0 as normal process windows.\nFor security purposes, AppVMs can be used to group applications and functions based on the level of trust and isolation they require, such as personal, work, shopping, banking, etc. \nIn addition to persistent AppVMs , applications can be run, and documents can be handled, in Disposable VMs through an action available in the Application Viewer.\nThis mechanism follows the idea of a sandboxes. After running the application, viewing the document, etc., the whole Disposable VM will be destroyed on shutdown.Qubes integrates all of the AppVMs into a single common desktop environment. The identity of each AppVM for a given process is provided by an unforgeable, colored window border which is defined in the properties of the AppVM.\nDisk usage in Dom0 is can be minimized by allowing multiple AppVMs to share a common \"template VM\" root file system image maintained in read-only mode. Additional disk storage is only used for user\u02bcs applications, data and per-VM settings. \nThis allows software installation and updates to be centralized by updating the template VMs which are \"inherited\" by the AppVMs based on them. It is also possible to install software within in a single AppVM, by installing it as the non-root user, or by installing it in the non-standard, Qubes-specific /rw hierarchy.\n\n\n*** Network domain ***\nThe network mechanism is the most exposed to security attacks. To circumvent this, it is isolated in a separate, unprivileged VM, named the Network Domain.\nAnother firewall Domain is used to house the Linux-kernel-based firewall, so that even if the network domain is compromised, the firewall is still isolated and protected (as it is running in a separate Linux kernel in a separate VM).\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: How does Qubes OS minimize disk usage in Dom0?",

Tor protects personal privacy by concealing a user's location and usage from anyone performing network surveillance or traffic analysis. It protects the user's freedom and ability to communicate confidentially through IP address anonymity using Tor exit nodes.\n\n== Usage ==\n\nTor enables its users to surf the Internet, chat and send instant messages anonymously, and is used by a wide variety of people for both licit and illicit purposes. Tor has, for example, been used by criminal enterprises, hacktivism groups, and law enforcement agencies at cross purposes, sometimes simultaneously; likewise, agencies within the U.S. government variously fund Tor (the U.S. State Department, the National Science Foundation, and \u2013 through the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which itself partially funded Tor until October 2012 \u2013 Radio Free Asia) and seek to subvert it.Tor is not meant to completely solve the issue of anonymity on the web. Tor is not designed to completely erase tracking but instead to reduce the likelihood for sites to trace actions and data back to the user.Tor is also used for illegal activities. These can include privacy protection or censorship circumvention, as well as distribution of child abuse content, drug sales, or malware distribution.Tor has been described by The Economist, in relation to Bitcoin and Silk Road, as being \"a dark corner of the web\". It has been targeted by the American National Security Agency and the British GCHQ signals intelligence agencies, albeit with marginal success, and more successfully by the British National Crime Agency in its Operation Notarise. At the same time, GCHQ has been using a tool named \"Shadowcat\" for \"end-to-end encrypted access to VPS over SSH using the Tor network\". Tor can be used for anonymous defamation, unauthorized news leaks of sensitive information, copyright infringement, distribution of illegal sexual content, selling controlled substances, weapons, and stolen credit card numbers, money laundering, bank fraud, credit card fraud, identity theft and the exchange of counterfeit currency; the black market utilizes the Tor infrastructure, at least in part, in conjunction with Bitcoin. It has also been used to brick IoT devices.In its complaint against Ross William Ulbricht of Silk Road, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation acknowledged that Tor has \"known legitimate uses\". According to CNET, Tor's anonymity function is \"endorsed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and other civil liberties groups as a method for whistleblowers and human rights workers to communicate with journalists\". EFF's Surveillance Self-Defense guide includes a description of where Tor fits in a larger strategy for protecting privacy and anonymity.In 2014, the EFF's Eva Galperin told Businessweek that \"Tor's biggest problem is press. No one hears about that time someone wasn't stalked by their abuser. They hear how somebody got away with downloading child porn.\"The Tor Project states that Tor users include \"normal people\" who wish to keep their Internet activities private from websites and advertisers, people concerned about cyber-spying, and users who are evading censorship such as activists, journalists, and military professionals. In November 2013, Tor had about four million users. According to the Wall Street Journal, in 2012 about 14% of Tor's traffic connected from the United States, with people in \"Internet-censoring countries\" as its second-largest user base. Tor is increasingly used by victims of domestic violence and the social workers and agencies that assist them, even though shelter workers may or may not have had professional training on cyber-security matters. Properly deployed, however, it precludes digital stalking, which has increased due to the prevalence of digital media in contemporary online life. Along with SecureDrop, Tor is used by news organizations such as The Guardian, The New Yorker, ProPublica and The Intercept to protect the privacy of whistleblowers.In March 2015, the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology released a briefing which stated that \"There is widespread agreement that banning online anonymity systems altogether is not seen as an acceptable policy option in the U.K.\" and that \"Even if it were, there would be technical challenges.\" The report further noted that Tor \"plays only a minor role in the online viewing and distribution of indecent images of children\" (due in part to its inherent latency); its usage by the Internet Watch Foundation, the utility of its onion services for whistleblowers, and its circumvention of the Great Firewall of China were touted.Tor's executive director, Andrew Lewman, also said in August 2014 that agents of the NSA and the GCHQ have anonymously provided Tor with bug reports.The Tor Project's FAQ offers supporting reasons for the EFF's endorsement:\n\nCriminals can already do bad things. Since they're willing to break laws, they already have lots of options available that provide better privacy than Tor provides...\nTor aims to provide protection for ordinary people who want to follow the law. Only criminals have privacy right now, and we need to fix that...\n\nSo yes, criminals could in theory use Tor, but they already have better options, and it seems unlikely that taking Tor away from the world will stop them from doing their bad things. At the same time, Tor and other privacy measures can fight identity theft, physical crimes like stalking, and so on.\n\n== Operation ==\n\nTor aims to conceal its users' identities and their online activity from surveillance and traffic analysis by separating identification and routing. It is an implementation of onion routing, which encrypts and then randomly bounces communications through a network of relays run by volunteers around the globe. These onion routers employ encryption in a multi-layered manner (hence the onion metaphor) to ensure perfect forward secrecy between relays, thereby providing users with anonymity in a network location. That anonymity extends to the hosting of censorship-resistant content by Tor's anonymous onion service feature. Furthermore, by keeping some of the entry relays (bridge relays) secret, users can evade Internet censorship that relies upon blocking public Tor relays.Because the IP address of the sender and the recipient are not both in cleartext at any hop along the way, anyone eavesdropping at any point along the communication channel cannot directly identify both ends. Furthermore, to the recipient, it appears that the last Tor node (called the exit node), rather than the sender, is the originator of the communication.\n\n\n*** Originating traffic ***\n\nA Tor user's SOCKS-aware applications can be configured to direct their network traffic through a Tor instance's SOCKS interface, which is listening on TCP port 9050 (for standalone Tor) or 9150 (for Tor Browser bundle) at localhost. Tor periodically creates virtual circuits through the Tor network through which it can multiplex and onion-route that traffic to its destination. Once inside a Tor network, the traffic is sent from router to router along the circuit, ultimately reaching an exit node at which point the cleartext packet is available and is forwarded on to its original destination. Viewed from the destination, the traffic appears to originate at the Tor exit node.\n\nTor's application independence sets it apart from most other anonymity networks: it works at the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) stream level. Applications whose traffic is commonly anonymized using Tor include Internet Relay Chat (IRC), instant messaging, and World Wide Web browsing.\n\n\n*** Onion services ***\n\nTor can also provide anonymity to websites and other servers. Servers configured to receive inbound connections only through Tor are called onion services (formerly, hidden services). Rather than revealing a server's IP address (and thus its network location), an onion service is accessed through its onion address, usually via the Tor Browser. The Tor network understands these addresses by looking up their corresponding public keys and introduction points from a distributed hash table within the network. It can route data to and from onion services, even those hosted behind firewalls or network address translators (NAT), while preserving the anonymity of both parties. Tor is necessary to access these onion services.Onion services were first specified in 2003 and have been deployed on the Tor network since 2004. Other than the database that stores the onion service descriptors, Tor is decentralized by design; there is no direct readable list of all onion services, although a number of onion services catalog publicly known onion addresses. TorSearch is an internet search engine that indexes pages to help find content in websites located on the Tor network.Because onion services route their traffic entirely through the Tor network, connection to an onion service is encrypted end-to-end and not subject to eavesdropping. There are, however, security issues involving Tor onion services. For example, services that are reachable through Tor onion services and the public Internet are susceptible to correlation attacks and thus not perfectly hidden. Other pitfalls include misconfigured services (e.g. identifying information included by default in web server error responses), uptime and downtime statistics, intersection attacks, and user error. The open source OnionScan program, written by independent security researcher Sarah Jamie Lewis, comprehensively examines onion services for numerous flaws and vulnerabilities. (Lewis has also pioneered the field of \"Onion Dildonics\", sex toys which make use of Tor through the Ricochet protocol)Onion services can also be accessed from a standard web browser without client-side connection to the Tor network, using services like Tor2web. Popular sources of .onion links include Pastebin, Twitter, Reddit, and other Internet forums.\n\n== Weaknesses ==\nLike all current low-latency anonymity networks, Tor cannot and does not attempt to protect against monitoring of traffic at the boundaries of the Tor network (i.e., the traffic entering and exiting the network). While Tor does provide protection against traffic analysis, it cannot prevent traffic confirmation (also called end-to-end correlation).A 2009 study revealed that Tor and the alternative network system JonDonym (Java Anon Proxy, JAP) are considered more resilient to website fingerprinting techniques than other tunneling protocols.The reason for this is that conventional single-hop VPN protocols do not need to reconstruct packet data nearly as much as a multi-hop service like Tor or JonDonym. Website fingerprinting yielded greater than 90% accuracy for identifying HTTP packets on conventional VPN protocols versus Tor which yielded only 2.96% accuracy. However, some protocols like OpenSSH and OpenVPN required a large amount of data before HTTP packets were identified.Researchers from the University of Michigan developed a network scanner allowing identification of 86% of live Tor \"bridges\" with a single scan.\n\n\n*** Consensus blocking ***\nLike many decentralized systems, Tor relies on a consensus mechanism to periodically update its current operating parameters, which for Tor are network parameters like which nodes are good/bad relays, exits, guards, and how much traffic each can handle. Tor's architecture for deciding the consensus relies on a small number of directory authority nodes voting on current network parameters. Currently, there are eight directory authority nodes, and their health is publicly monitored. The IP addresses of the authority nodes are hard coded into each Tor client. The authority nodes vote every hour to update the consensus, and clients download the most recent consensus on startup. A network congestion attack, such as a DDoS, can prevent the consensus nodes from communicating and thus prevent voting to update the consensus.\n\n\n*** Eavesdropping ***\n\n\n**** Autonomous system (AS) eavesdropping ****\nIf the same autonomous system (AS), responsible for routing packets at least partly, is present on both path segments from a client to entry relay and from exit relay to destination, such an AS can statistically correlate traffic on the entry and exit segments of the path (i.e. traffic confirmation) and potentially infer the destination with which the client communicated. In 2012, LASTor proposed a method to predict a set of potential ASes on these two segments and then avoid choosing this path during the path selection algorithm on the client side. In this paper, they also improve latency by choosing shorter geographical paths between a client and destination.\n\n\n**** Exit node eavesdropping ****\nIn September 2007, Dan Egerstad, a Swedish security consultant, revealed he had intercepted usernames and passwords for email accounts by operating and monitoring Tor exit nodes. As Tor cannot encrypt the traffic between an exit node and the target server, any exit node is in a position to capture traffic passing through it that does not use end-to-end encryption such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS). While this may not inherently breach the anonymity of the source, traffic intercepted in this way by malicious Tor exit nodes operators can expose information about the source in either or both of payload and protocol data. Furthermore, Egerstad is circumspect about the possible subversion of Tor by intelligence agencies:\nIf you actually look into where these Tor nodes are hosted and how big they are, some of these nodes cost thousands of dollars each month just to host because they're using lots of bandwidth, they're heavy-duty servers and so on. Who would pay for this and be anonymous?\nIn October 2019, a Tor researcher revealed that since at least 2017, there were hundreds of highly suspicious entry, relay, and exit nodes, run by an unknown group, in an unprecedented scale. It was alleged that this number of servers could pose the risk of a sybil attack as it could map Tor users' routes inside the network, increasing risk of deanonymization. At some point there were about 900 nodes running and by November 2021 about 600 of them were purged. \nAlthough described as being a deanonymization attempt, the motives and the achievements of this possibly on-going event are still unknown.\n\n\n**** Internal communication attack ****\nIn October 2011, a research team from ESIEA claimed to have discovered a way to compromise the Tor network by decrypting communication passing over it. The technique they describe requires creating a map of Tor network nodes, controlling one-third of them, and then acquiring their encryption keys and algorithm seeds. Then, using these known keys and seeds, they claim the ability to decrypt two encryption layers out of three. They claim to break the third key by a statistical attack. In order to redirect Tor traffic to the nodes they controlled, they used a denial-of-service attack. A response to this claim has been published on the official Tor Blog stating these rumors of Tor's compromise are greatly exaggerated.\n\n\n*** Traffic-analysis attack ***\nThere are two methods of traffic-analysis attack, passive and active. In the passive traffic-analysis method, the attacker extracts features from the traffic of a specific flow on one side of the network and looks for those features on the other side of the network. In the active traffic-analysis method, the attacker alters the timings of the packets of a flow according to a specific pattern and looks for that pattern on the other side of the network; therefore, the attacker can link the flows in one side to the other side of the network and break the anonymity of it. It is shown that, although timing noise is added to the packets, there are active traffic analysis methods that are robust against such a noise.Steven Murdoch and George Danezis from University of Cambridge presented an article at the 2005 IEEE Symposium on security and privacy on traffic-analysis techniques that allow adversaries with only a partial view of the network to infer which nodes are being used to relay the anonymous streams. These techniques greatly reduce the anonymity provided by Tor. Murdoch and Danezis have also shown that otherwise unrelated streams can be linked back to the same initiator. This attack, however, fails to reveal the identity of the original user. Murdoch has been working with and has been funded by Tor since 2006.\n\n\n*** Tor exit node block ***\nOperators of Internet sites have the ability to prevent traffic from Tor exit nodes or to offer reduced functionality for Tor users. For example, it is not generally possible to edit Wikipedia when using Tor or when using an IP address also used by a Tor exit node. The BBC blocks the IP addresses of all known Tor exit nodes from its iPlayer service, although non-exit relays and bridges are not blocked.\n\n\n*** Bad apple attack ***\nIn March 2011, researchers with the Rocquencourt French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique, INRIA), documented an attack that is capable of revealing the IP addresses of BitTorrent users on the Tor network. The \"bad apple attack\" exploits Tor's design and takes advantage of insecure application used to associate the simultaneous use of a secure application with the IP address of the Tor user in question. One method of attack depends on control of an exit node or hijacking tracker responses, while a secondary attack method is based in part on the statistical exploitation of distributed hash table tracking. According to the study:The results presented in the bad apple attack research paper are based on an attack launched against the Tor network by the authors of the study. The attack targeted six exit nodes, lasted for twenty-three days, and revealed a total of 10,000 IP addresses of active Tor users. This study is significant because it is the first documented attack designed to target P2P file-sharing applications on Tor. BitTorrent may generate as much as 40% of all traffic on Tor. Furthermore, the bad apple attack is effective against insecure use of any application over Tor, not just BitTorrent.\n\n\n*** Sniper attack ***\nJansen et al.., describes a DDoS attack targeted at the Tor node software, as well as defenses against that attack and its variants. The attack works using a colluding client and server, and filling the queues of the exit node until the node runs out of memory, and hence can serve no other (genuine) clients. By attacking a significant proportion of the exit nodes this way, an attacker can degrade the network and increase the chance of targets using nodes controlled by the attacker.\n\n\n*** Heartbleed bug ***\nThe Heartbleed OpenSSL bug disrupted the Tor network for several days in April 2014 while private keys were renewed. The Tor Project recommended Tor relay operators and onion service operators revoke and generate fresh keys after patching OpenSSL, but noted Tor relays use two sets of keys and Tor's multi-hop design minimizes the impact of exploiting a single relay. Five hundred eighty-six relays, later found to be susceptible to the Heartbleed bug, were taken offline as a precautionary measure.\n\n\n*** Relay early traffic confirmation attack ***\n\nOn 30 July 2014, the Tor Project issued the security advisory \"relay early traffic confirmation attack\" in which the project discovered a group of relays that tried to de-anonymize onion service users and operators. In summary, the attacking onion service directory node changed the headers of cells being relayed tagging them as \"relay\" or \"relay early\" cells differently to encode additional information and sent them back to the requesting user/operator. If the user's/operator's guard/entry node was also part of the attacking relays, the attacking relays might be able to capture the IP address of the user/operator along with the onion service information that the user/operator was requesting. The attacking relays were stable enough to be designated as \"suitable as hidden service directory\" and \"suitable as entry guard\"; therefore, both the onion service users and the onion services might have used those relays as guards and hidden service directory nodes.The attacking nodes joined the network early in the year on 30 January and the project removed them on 4 July. Although the attack's beginning is unclear, the project implied that between February and July, IP addresses of onion service users and operators might have been exposed.The project mentioned the following mitigations besides removing the attacking relays from the network:\n\npatched relay software to prevent relays from relaying cells with \"relay early\" headers that were not intended.\nplanned update for users' proxy software so that they could inspect if they received \"relay early\" cells from the relays (as they are not supposed to), along with the settings to connect to just one guard node instead of selecting randomly from 3 to reduce the probability of connecting to an attacking relay\nrecommended that onion services should consider changing their locations\nreminded users and onion service operators that Tor could not prevent de-anonymization if the attacker controlled or could listen to both ends of the Tor circuit, like in this attack.In November 2014 there was speculation in the aftermath of Operation Onymous, resulting in 17 arrests internationally, that a Tor weakness had been exploited. A representative of Europol was secretive about the method used, saying: \"This is something we want to keep for ourselves. The way we do this, we can't share with the whole world, because we want to do it again and again and again.\"\nA BBC source cited a \"technical breakthrough\"\nthat allowed tracking physical locations of servers, and the initial number of infiltrated sites led to the exploit speculation. Andrew Lewman\u2014a Tor Project representative\u2014downplayed this possibility, suggesting that execution of more traditional police work was more likely.In November 2015 court documents on the matter\naddressed concerns about security research ethics and the right of not being unreasonably searched as guaranteed by the US Fourth Amendment. Moreover, the documents, along with expert opinions, may also show the connection between the network attack and the law enforcement operation including:\n\nthe search warrant for an administrator of Silkroad 2.0 indicated that from January 2014 until July, the FBI received information from a \"university-based research institute\" with the information being \"reliable IP addresses for Tor and onion services such as SR2\" that led to the identification of \"at least another seventeen black markets on Tor\" and \"approximately 78 IP addresses that accessed a vendor .onion address.\" One of these IP addresses led to the arrest of the administrator\nthe chronology and nature of the attack fitted well with the operation\na senior researcher of International Computer Science Institute, part of University of California, Berkeley, said in an interview that the institute which worked with the FBI was \"almost certainly\" Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), and this concurred with the Tor Project's assessment and with an earlier analysis of Edward Felten, a computer security professor at Princeton University, about researchers from CMU's CERT/CC being involvedIn his analysis published on 31 July, besides raising ethical issues, Felten also questioned the fulfillment of CERT/CC's purposes which were to prevent attacks, inform the implementers of vulnerabilities, and eventually inform the public. Because in this case, CERT/CC's staff did the opposite which was to carry out a large-scale long-lasting attack, withhold vulnerability information from the implementers, and withhold the same information from the public. CERT/CC is a non-profit, computer security research organization publicly funded through the US federal government.\n\n\n*** Mouse fingerprinting ***\nIn March 2016, a security researcher based in Barcelona demonstrated laboratory techniques using time measurement via JavaScript at the 1-millisecond level which could potentially identify and correlate a user's unique mouse movements, provided the user has visited the same \"fingerprinting\" website with both the Tor browser and a regular browser. This proof of concept exploits the \"time measurement via JavaScript\" issue, which had been an open ticket on the Tor Project for ten months.\n\n\n*** Circuit fingerprinting attack ***\nIn 2015, the administrators of Agora, a darknet market, announced they were taking the site offline in response to a recently discovered security vulnerability in Tor. They did not say what the vulnerability was, but Wired speculated it was the \"Circuit Fingerprinting Attack\" presented at the USENIX security conference.\n\n\n*** Volume information ***\nA study showed \"anonymization solutions protect only partially against target selection that may lead to efficient surveillance\" as they typically \"do not hide the volume information necessary to do target selection\".\n\n== Implementations ==\n\nThe main implementation of Tor is written primarily in C.\n\n\n*** Tor Browser ***\n\nThe Tor Browser is a web browser capable of accessing the Tor network. It was created as the Tor Browser Bundle by Steven J. Murdoch and announced in January 2008. The Tor Browser consists of a modified Mozilla Firefox ESR web browser, the TorButton, TorLauncher, NoScript and the Tor proxy. Users can run the Tor Browser from removable media. It can operate under Microsoft Windows, macOS, Android and Linux.The default search engine is DuckDuckGo (until version 4.5, Startpage.com was its default). The Tor Browser automatically starts Tor background processes and routes traffic through the Tor network. Upon termination of a session the browser deletes privacy-sensitive data such as HTTP cookies and the browsing history. This is effective in reducing web tracking and canvas fingerprinting, and it also helps to prevent creation of a filter bubble.To allow download from places where accessing the Tor Project URL may be risky or blocked, a GitHub repository is maintained with links for releases hosted in other domains.\n\n\n**** Firefox/Tor browser attack ****\nIn 2011, the Dutch authority investigating child pornography discovered the IP address of a Tor onion service site called \"Pedoboard\" from an unprotected administrator's account and gave it to the FBI, who traced it to Aaron McGrath. After a year of surveillance, the FBI launched \"Operation Torpedo\" which resulted in McGrath's arrest and allowed them to install their Network Investigative Technique (NIT) malware on the servers for retrieving information from the users of the three onion service sites that McGrath controlled. The technique, exploiting a Firefox/Tor browser's vulnerability that had been patched and targeting users that had not updated, had a Flash application pinging a user's IP address directly back to an FBI server, and resulted in revealing at least 25 US users as well as numerous users from other countries. McGrath was sentenced to 20 years in prison in early 2014, with at least 18 other users including a former Acting HHS Cyber Security Director being sentenced in subsequent cases.In August 2013 it was discovered that the Firefox browsers in many older versions of the Tor Browser Bundle were vulnerable to a JavaScript-deployed shellcode attack, as NoScript was not enabled by default. Attackers used this vulnerability to extract users' MAC and IP addresses and Windows computer names. News reports linked this to a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) operation targeting Freedom Hosting's owner, Eric Eoin Marques, who was arrested on a provisional extradition warrant issued by a United States' court on 29 July. The FBI extradited Marques from Ireland to the state of Maryland on 4 charges: distributing; conspiring to distribute; and advertising child pornography, as well as aiding and abetting advertising of child pornography. The warrant alleged that Marques was \"the largest facilitator of child porn on the planet\". The FBI acknowledged the attack in a 12 September 2013 court filing in Dublin; further technical details from a training presentation leaked by Edward Snowden revealed the code name for the exploit as \"EgotisticalGiraffe\".In 2022, Kaspersky researchers found that when looking up \"Tor Browser\" in Chinese on YouTube, one of the URLs provided under the top-ranked Chinese-language video actually pointed to a malware disguised as Tor Browser. Once installed, it saves browsing history and form data that genuine Tor forgot by default, and even downloads malicious components to computers with IP addresses in China. Kaspersky researchers noted that the malware was not stealing data to sell for profit, but was designed to identify users.\n\n\n*** Tor Messenger ***\nOn 29 October 2015, the Tor Project released Tor Messenger Beta, an instant messaging program based on Instantbird with Tor and OTR built in and used by default. Like Pidgin and Adium, Tor Messenger supports multiple different instant messaging protocols; however, it accomplishes this without relying on libpurple, implementing all chat protocols in the memory-safe language JavaScript instead.According to Lucian Armasu of Toms Hardware, in April 2018, the Tor Project shut down the Tor Messenger project for three reasons: the developers of \"Instabird\"  [sic] discontinued support for their own software, limited resources and known metadata problems. The Tor Messenger developers explained that overcoming any vulnerabilities discovered in the future would be impossible due to the project relying on outdated software dependencies.\n\n\n*** Tor Phone ***\n\nIn 2016, Tor developer Mike Perry announced a prototype tor-enabled smartphone bases on CopperheadOS. It was meant as  a direction for Tor on mobile. The project was called 'Mission Improbable'. Copperhead's then lead developer Daniel Micay welcomed the prototype. Using Tor with Orbot and Tor Browser are supported by custom Android operating systems CalyxOS and DivestOS. GrapheneOS supports using Orbot VPN but not Tor Browser.\n\n\n*** Third-party applications ***\nThe Vuze (formerly Azureus) BitTorrent client, Bitmessage anonymous messaging system, and TorChat instant messenger include Tor support. The Briar messenger routes all messaging via Tor by default. OnionShare allows users to share files using Tor.The Guardian Project is actively developing a free and open-source suite of applications and firmware for the Android operating system to improve the security of mobile communications. The applications include the ChatSecure instant messaging client, Orbot Tor implementation (also available for iOS), Orweb (discontinued) privacy-enhanced mobile browser, Orfox, the mobile counterpart of the Tor Browser, ProxyMob Firefox add-on, and ObscuraCam.Onion Browser is open-source, privacy-enhancing web browser for iOS, which uses Tor. It is available in the iOS App Store, and source code is available on GitHub.Brave added support for Tor in its desktop browser's private-browsing mode. Users can switch to Tor-enabled browsing by clicking on the hamburger menu on the top right corner of the browser.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n*** Security-focused operating systems ***\nSeveral security-focused operating systems make or made extensive use of Tor. These include Hardened Linux From Scratch, Incognito, Libert\u00e9 Linux, Qubes OS, Subgraph, Parrot OS, Tails, Tor-ramdisk, and Whonix.\n\n== Reception, impact, and legislation ==\n\nTor has been praised for providing privacy and anonymity to vulnerable Internet users such as political activists fearing surveillance and arrest, ordinary web users seeking to circumvent censorship, and people who have been threatened with violence or abuse by stalkers. The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has called Tor \"the king of high-secure, low-latency Internet anonymity\", and BusinessWeek magazine has described it as \"perhaps the most effective means of defeating the online surveillance efforts of intelligence agencies around the world\". Other media have described Tor as \"a sophisticated privacy tool\", \"easy to use\" and \"so secure that even the world's most sophisticated electronic spies haven't figured out how to crack it\".Advocates for Tor say it supports freedom of expression, including in countries where the Internet is censored, by protecting the privacy and anonymity of users. The mathematical underpinnings of Tor lead it to be characterized as acting \"like a piece of infrastructure, and governments naturally fall into paying for infrastructure they want to use\".The project was originally developed on behalf of the U.S. intelligence community and continues to receive U.S. government funding, and has been criticized as \"more resembl[ing] a spook project than a tool designed by a culture that values accountability or transparency\". As of 2012, 80% of The Tor Project's $2M annual budget came from the United States government, with the U.S. State Department, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, and the National Science Foundation as major contributors, aiming \"to aid democracy advocates in authoritarian states\". Other public sources of funding include DARPA, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, and the Government of Sweden. Some have proposed that the government values Tor's commitment to free speech, and uses the darknet to gather intelligence. Tor also receives funding from NGOs including Human Rights Watch, and private sponsors including Reddit and Google. Dingledine said that the United States Department of Defense funds are more similar to a research grant than a procurement contract. Tor executive director Andrew Lewman said that even though it accepts funds from the U.S. federal government, the Tor service did not collaborate with the NSA to reveal identities of users.Critics say that Tor is not as secure as it claims, pointing to U.S. law enforcement's investigations and shutdowns of Tor-using sites such as web-hosting company Freedom Hosting and online marketplace Silk Road. In October 2013, after analyzing documents leaked by Edward Snowden, The Guardian reported that the NSA had repeatedly tried to crack Tor and had failed to break its core security, although it had had some success attacking the computers of individual Tor users. The Guardian also published a 2012 NSA classified slide deck, entitled \"Tor Stinks\", which said: \"We will never be able to de-anonymize all Tor users all the time\", but \"with manual analysis we can de-anonymize a very small fraction of Tor users\". When Tor users are arrested, it is typically due to human error, not to the core technology being hacked or cracked. On 7 November 2014, for example, a joint operation by the FBI, ICE Homeland Security investigations and European Law enforcement agencies led to 17 arrests and the seizure of 27 sites containing 400 pages. A late 2014 report by Der Spiegel using a new cache of Snowden leaks revealed, however, that as of 2012 the NSA deemed Tor on its own as a \"major threat\" to its mission, and when used in conjunction with other privacy tools such as OTR, Cspace, ZRTP, RedPhone, Tails, and TrueCrypt was ranked as \"catastrophic,\" leading to a \"near-total loss/lack of insight to target communications, presence...\"\n\n\n*** 2011 ***\nIn March 2011, The Tor Project received the Free Software Foundation's 2010 Award for Projects of Social Benefit. The citation read, \"Using free software, Tor has enabled roughly 36 million people around the world to experience freedom of access and expression on the Internet while keeping them in control of their privacy and anonymity. Its network has proved pivotal in dissident movements in both Iran and more recently Egypt.\"Iran tried to block Tor at least twice in 2011. One attempt simply blocked all servers with 2-hour-expiry security certificates; it was successful for less than 24 hours.\n\n\n*** 2012 ***\nIn 2012, Foreign Policy magazine named Dingledine, Mathewson, and Syverson among its Top 100 Global Thinkers \"for making the web safe for whistleblowers\".\n\n\n*** 2013 ***\nIn 2013, Jacob Appelbaum described Tor as a \"part of an ecosystem of software that helps people regain and reclaim their autonomy. It helps to enable people to have agency of all kinds; it helps others to help each other and it helps you to help yourself. It runs, it is open and it is supported by a large community spread across all walks of life.\"In June 2013, whistleblower Edward Snowden used Tor to send information about PRISM to The Washington Post and The Guardian.\n\n\n*** 2014 ***\nIn 2014, the Russian government offered a $111,000 contract to \"study the possibility of obtaining technical information about users and users' equipment on the Tor anonymous network\".In September 2014, in response to reports that Comcast had been discouraging customers from using the Tor Browser, Comcast issued a public statement that \"We have no policy against Tor, or any other browser or software.\"In October 2014, The Tor Project hired the public relations firm Thomson Communications to improve its public image (particularly regarding the terms \"Dark Net\" and \"hidden services,\" which are widely viewed as being problematic) and to educate journalists about the technical aspects of Tor.Turkey blocked downloads of Tor Browser from the Tor Project.\n\n\n*** 2015 ***\nIn June 2015, the special rapporteur from the United Nations' Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights specifically mentioned Tor in the context of the debate in the U.S. about allowing so-called backdoors in encryption programs for law enforcement purposes in an interview for The Washington Post.\nIn July 2015, the Tor Project announced an alliance with the Library Freedom Project to establish exit nodes in public libraries. The pilot program, which established a middle relay running on the excess bandwidth afforded by the Kilton Library in Lebanon, New Hampshire, making it the first library in the U.S. to host a Tor node, was briefly put on hold when the local city manager and deputy sheriff voiced concerns over the cost of defending search warrants for information passed through the Tor exit node. Although the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had alerted New Hampshire authorities to the fact that Tor is sometimes used by criminals, the Lebanon Deputy Police Chief and the Deputy City Manager averred that no pressure to strong-arm the library was applied, and the service was re-established on 15 September 2015. U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif) released a letter on 10 December 2015, in which she asked the DHS to clarify its procedures, stating that \"While the Kilton Public Library's board ultimately voted to restore their Tor relay, I am no less disturbed by the possibility that DHS employees are pressuring or persuading public and private entities to discontinue or degrade services that protect the privacy and anonymity of U.S. citizens.\" In a 2016 interview, Kilton Library IT Manager Chuck McAndrew stressed the importance of getting libraries involved with Tor: \"Librarians have always cared deeply about protecting privacy, intellectual freedom, and access to information (the freedom to read). Surveillance has a very well-documented chilling effect on intellectual freedom. It is the job of librarians to remove barriers to information.\" The second library to host a Tor node was the Las Naves Public Library in Valencia, Spain, implemented in the first months of 2016.In August 2015, an IBM security research group, called \"X-Force\", put out a quarterly report that advised companies to block Tor on security grounds, citing a \"steady increase\" in attacks from Tor exit nodes as well as botnet traffic.In September 2015, Luke Millanta created OnionView (now defunct), a web service that plots the location of active Tor relay nodes onto an interactive map of the world. The project's purpose was to detail the network's size and escalating growth rate.In December 2015, Daniel Ellsberg (of the Pentagon Papers), Cory Doctorow (of Boing Boing), Edward Snowden, and artist-activist Molly Crabapple, amongst others, announced their support of Tor.\n\n\n*** 2016 ***\nIn March 2016, New Hampshire state representative Keith Ammon introduced a bill allowing public libraries to run privacy software. The bill specifically referenced Tor. The text was crafted with extensive input from Alison Macrina, the director of the Library Freedom Project. The bill was passed by the House 268\u201362.Also in March 2016, the first Tor node, specifically a middle relay, was established at a library in Canada, the Graduate Resource Centre (GRC) in the Faculty of Information and Media Studies (FIMS) at the University of Western Ontario. Given that the running of a Tor exit node is an unsettled area of Canadian law, and that in general institutions are more capable than individuals to cope with legal pressures, Alison Macrina of the Library Freedom Project has opined that in some ways she would like to see intelligence agencies and law enforcement attempt to intervene in the event that an exit node were established.On 16 May 2016, CNN reported on the case of core Tor developer isis agora lovecruft, who had fled to Germany under the threat of a subpoena by the FBI during the Thanksgiving break of the previous year. The Electronic Frontier Foundation legally represented lovecruft.On 2 December 2016, The New Yorker reported on burgeoning digital privacy and security workshops in the San Francisco Bay Area, particularly at the hackerspace Noisebridge, in the wake of the 2016 United States presidential election; downloading the Tor browser was mentioned. Also, in December 2016, Turkey has blocked the usage of Tor, together with ten of the most used VPN services in Turkey, which were popular ways of accessing banned social media sites and services.Tor (and Bitcoin) was fundamental to the operation of the darkweb marketplace AlphaBay, which was taken down in an international law enforcement operation in July 2017. Despite federal claims that Tor would not shield a user, however, elementary operational security errors outside of the ambit of the Tor network led to the site's downfall.\n\n\n*** 2017 ***\nIn June 2017 the Democratic Socialists of America recommended intermittent Tor usage. And in August 2017, according to reportage cybersecurity firms which specialize in monitoring and researching the dark Web (which relies on Tor as its infrastructure) on behalf of banks and retailers routinely share their findings with the FBI and with other law enforcement agencies \"when possible and necessary\" regarding illegal content. The Russian-speaking underground offering a crime-as-a-service model is regarded as being particularly robust.\n\n\n*** 2018 ***\nIn June 2018, Venezuela blocked access to the Tor network. The block affected both direct connections to the network and connections being made via bridge relays.On 20 June 2018, Bavarian police raided the homes of the board members of the non-profit Zwiebelfreunde, a member of torservers.net, which handles the European financial transactions of riseup.net in connection with a blog post there which apparently promised violence against the upcoming Alternative for Germany convention. Tor came out strongly against the raid against its support organization, which provides legal and financial aid for the setting up and maintenance of high-speed relays and exit nodes. According to torservers.net, on 23 August 2018 the German court at Landgericht M\u00fcnchen ruled that the raid and seizures were illegal. The hardware and documentation seized had been kept under seal, and purportedly were neither analyzed nor evaluated by the Bavarian police.Since October 2018, Chinese online communities within Tor have begun to dwindle due to increased efforts to stop them by the Chinese government.\n\n\n*** 2019 ***\nIn November 2019, Edward Snowden called for a full, unabridged simplified Chinese translation of his autobiography, Permanent Record, as the Chinese publisher had violated their agreement by expurgating all mentions of Tor and other matters deemed politically sensitive by the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\n*** 2021 ***\nOn 8 December 2021, the Russian government agency Roskomnadzor announced it has banned Tor and six VPN services for failing to abide by the Russian Internet blacklist. Russian ISPs unsuccessfully attempted to block Tor's main website as well as several bridges beginning on 1 December 2021. The Tor Project has appealed to Russian courts over this ban.\n\n\n*** 2022 ***\nIn response to Internet censorship during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the BBC and VOA have directed Russian audiences to Tor. The Russian government increased efforts to block access to Tor through technical and political means, while the network reported an increase in traffic from Russia, and increased Russian use of its anti-censorship Snowflake tool.Russian courts temporarily lifted the blockade on Tor's website (but not connections to relays) on May 24, 2022 due to Russian law requiring that the Tor Project be involved in the case. However, the blockade was reinstated on July 21, 2022.Iran implemented rolling internet blackouts during the Mahsa Amini protests, and Tor and Snowflake were used to circumvent them.China, with its highly centralized control of its internet, had effectively blocked Tor.\n\n== Improved security ==\nTor responded to earlier vulnerabilities listed above by patching them and improving security. In one way or another, human (user) errors can lead to detection. The Tor Project website provides the best practices (instructions) on how to properly use the Tor browser. When improperly used, Tor is not secure. For example, Tor warns its users that not all traffic is protected; only the traffic routed through the Tor browser is protected. Users are also warned to use HTTPS versions of websites, not to torrent with Tor, not to enable browser plugins, not to open documents downloaded through Tor while online, and to use safe bridges. Users are also warned that they cannot provide their name or other revealing information in web forums over Tor and stay anonymous at the same time.Despite intelligence agencies' claims that 80% of Tor users would be de-anonymized within 6 months in the year 2013, that has still not happened. In fact, as late as September 2016, the FBI could not locate, de-anonymize and identify the Tor user who hacked into the email account of a staffer on Hillary Clinton's email server.The best tactic of law enforcement agencies to de-anonymize users appears to remain with Tor-relay adversaries running poisoned nodes, as well as counting on the users themselves using the Tor browser improperly. For example, downloading a video through the Tor browser and then opening the same file on an unprotected hard drive while online can make the users' real IP addresses available to authorities.\n\n\n*** Odds of detection ***\nWhen properly used, odds of being de-anonymized through Tor are said to be extremely low. Tor project's co-founder Nick Mathewson explained that the problem of \"Tor-relay adversaries\" running poisoned nodes means that a theoretical adversary of this kind is not the network's greatest threat:\n\n\"No adversary is truly global, but no adversary needs to be truly global,\" he says. \"Eavesdropping on the entire Internet is a several-billion-dollar problem. Running a few computers to eavesdrop on a lot of traffic, a selective denial of service attack to drive traffic to your computers, that's like a tens-of-thousands-of-dollars problem.\" At the most basic level, an attacker who runs two poisoned Tor nodes\u2014one entry, one exit\u2014is able to analyse traffic and thereby identify the tiny, unlucky percentage of users whose circuit happened to cross both of those nodes. In 2016 the Tor network offers a total of around 7,000 relays, around 2,000 guard (entry) nodes and around 1,000 exit nodes. So the odds of such an event happening are one in two million (1\u20442000 \u00d7 1\u20441000), give or take.\"\nTor does not provide protection against end-to-end timing attacks: if an attacker can watch the traffic coming out of the target computer, and also the traffic arriving at the target's chosen destination (e.g. a server hosting a .onion site), that attacker can use statistical analysis to discover that they are part of the same circuit.\n\n\n*** Levels of security ***\nDepending on individual user needs, Tor browser offers three levels of security located under the Security Level (the small gray shield at the top-right of the screen) icon > Advanced Security Settings. In addition to encrypting the data, including constantly changing an IP address through a virtual circuit comprising successive, randomly selected Tor relays, several other layers of security are at a user's disposal:\nStandard (default) \u2013 at this security level, all browser features are enabled.\nThis level provides the most usable experience, and the lowest level of security.\nSafer \u2013 at this security level, the following changes apply:\nJavaScript is disabled on non-HTTPS sites.\nOn sites where JavaScript is enabled, performance optimizations are disabled. Scripts on some sites may run slower.\nSome mechanisms of displaying math equations are disabled.\nAudio and video (HTML5 media), and WebGL are click-to-play.\nSafest \u2013 at this security level, these additional changes apply:\nJavaScript is disabled by default on all sites.\nSome fonts, icons, math symbols, and images are disabled.\nAudio and video (HTML5 media), and WebGL are click-to-play.\n\n== Citations ==\n\n== General and cited references ==\nQ: What is the bad apple attack, and how does it exploit Tor's design to reveal the IP addresses of BitTorrent users on the Tor network?",

      "context": "Tor (network)\n\n==Introduction==\nTor, short for \"The Onion Router,\" is free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication. It directs Internet traffic via a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay network that consists of more than seven thousand relays.Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace a user's Internet activity. Tor protects personal privacy by concealing a user's location and usage from anyone performing network surveillance or traffic analysis. It protects the user's freedom and ability to communicate confidentially through IP address anonymity using Tor exit nodes.\n\n== Usage ==\n\nTor enables its users to surf the Internet, chat and send instant messages anonymously, and is used by a wide variety of people for both licit and illicit purposes. Tor has, for example, been used by criminal enterprises, hacktivism groups, and law enforcement agencies at cross purposes, sometimes simultaneously; likewise, agencies within the U.S. government variously fund Tor (the U.S. State Department, the National Science Foundation, and \u2013 through the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which itself partially funded Tor until October 2012 \u2013 Radio Free Asia) and seek to subvert it.Tor is not meant to completely solve the issue of anonymity on the web. Tor is not designed to completely erase tracking but instead to reduce the likelihood for sites to trace actions and data back to the user.Tor is also used for illegal activities. These can include privacy protection or censorship circumvention, as well as distribution of child abuse content, drug sales, or malware distribution.Tor has been described by The Economist, in relation to Bitcoin and Silk Road, as being \"a dark corner of the web\". It has been targeted by the American National Security Agency and the British GCHQ signals intelligence agencies, albeit with marginal success, and more successfully by the British National Crime Agency in its Operation Notarise. At the same time, GCHQ has been using a tool named \"Shadowcat\" for \"end-to-end encrypted access to VPS over SSH using the Tor network\". Tor can be used for anonymous defamation, unauthorized news leaks of sensitive information, copyright infringement, distribution of illegal sexual content, selling controlled substances, weapons, and stolen credit card numbers, money laundering, bank fraud, credit card fraud, identity theft and the exchange of counterfeit currency; the black market utilizes the Tor infrastructure, at least in part, in conjunction with Bitcoin. It has also been used to brick IoT devices.In its complaint against Ross William Ulbricht of Silk Road, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation acknowledged that Tor has \"known legitimate uses\". According to CNET, Tor's anonymity function is \"endorsed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and other civil liberties groups as a method for whistleblowers and human rights workers to communicate with journalists\". EFF's Surveillance Self-Defense guide includes a description of where Tor fits in a larger strategy for protecting privacy and anonymity.In 2014, the EFF's Eva Galperin told Businessweek that \"Tor's biggest problem is press. No one hears about that time someone wasn't stalked by their abuser. They hear how somebody got away with downloading child porn.\"The Tor Project states that Tor users include \"normal people\" who wish to keep their Internet activities private from websites and advertisers, people concerned about cyber-spying, and users who are evading censorship such as activists, journalists, and military professionals. In November 2013, Tor had about four million users. According to the Wall Street Journal, in 2012 about 14% of Tor's traffic connected from the United States, with people in \"Internet-censoring countries\" as its second-largest user base. Tor is increasingly used by victims of domestic violence and the social workers and agencies that assist them, even though shelter workers may or may not have had professional training on cyber-security matters. Properly deployed, however, it precludes digital stalking, which has increased due to the prevalence of digital media in contemporary online life. Along with SecureDrop, Tor is used by news organizations such as The Guardian, The New Yorker, ProPublica and The Intercept to protect the privacy of whistleblowers.In March 2015, the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology released a briefing which stated that \"There is widespread agreement that banning online anonymity systems altogether is not seen as an acceptable policy option in the U.K.\" and that \"Even if it were, there would be technical challenges.\" The report further noted that Tor \"plays only a minor role in the online viewing and distribution of indecent images of children\" (due in part to its inherent latency); its usage by the Internet Watch Foundation, the utility of its onion services for whistleblowers, and its circumvention of the Great Firewall of China were touted.Tor's executive director, Andrew Lewman, also said in August 2014 that agents of the NSA and the GCHQ have anonymously provided Tor with bug reports.The Tor Project's FAQ offers supporting reasons for the EFF's endorsement:\n\nCriminals can already do bad things. Since they're willing to break laws, they already have lots of options available that provide better privacy than Tor provides...\nTor aims to provide protection for ordinary people who want to follow the law. Only criminals have privacy right now, and we need to fix that...\n\nSo yes, criminals could in theory use Tor, but they already have better options, and it seems unlikely that taking Tor away from the world will stop them from doing their bad things. At the same time, Tor and other privacy measures can fight identity theft, physical crimes like stalking, and so on.\n\n== Operation ==\n\nTor aims to conceal its users' identities and their online activity from surveillance and traffic analysis by separating identification and routing. It is an implementation of onion routing, which encrypts and then randomly bounces communications through a network of relays run by volunteers around the globe. These onion routers employ encryption in a multi-layered manner (hence the onion metaphor) to ensure perfect forward secrecy between relays, thereby providing users with anonymity in a network location. That anonymity extends to the hosting of censorship-resistant content by Tor's anonymous onion service feature. Furthermore, by keeping some of the entry relays (bridge relays) secret, users can evade Internet censorship that relies upon blocking public Tor relays.Because the IP address of the sender and the recipient are not both in cleartext at any hop along the way, anyone eavesdropping at any point along the communication channel cannot directly identify both ends. Furthermore, to the recipient, it appears that the last Tor node (called the exit node), rather than the sender, is the originator of the communication.\n\n\n*** Originating traffic ***\n\nA Tor user's SOCKS-aware applications can be configured to direct their network traffic through a Tor instance's SOCKS interface, which is listening on TCP port 9050 (for standalone Tor) or 9150 (for Tor Browser bundle) at localhost. Tor periodically creates virtual circuits through the Tor network through which it can multiplex and onion-route that traffic to its destination. Once inside a Tor network, the traffic is sent from router to router along the circuit, ultimately reaching an exit node at which point the cleartext packet is available and is forwarded on to its original destination. Viewed from the destination, the traffic appears to originate at the Tor exit node.\n\nTor's application independence sets it apart from most other anonymity networks: it works at the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) stream level. Applications whose traffic is commonly anonymized using Tor include Internet Relay Chat (IRC), instant messaging, and World Wide Web browsing.\n\n\n*** Onion services ***\n\nTor can also provide anonymity to websites and other servers. Servers configured to receive inbound connections only through Tor are called onion services (formerly, hidden services). Rather than revealing a server's IP address (and thus its network location), an onion service is accessed through its onion address, usually via the Tor Browser. The Tor network understands these addresses by looking up their corresponding public keys and introduction points from a distributed hash table within the network. It can route data to and from onion services, even those hosted behind firewalls or network address translators (NAT), while preserving the anonymity of both parties. Tor is necessary to access these onion services.Onion services were first specified in 2003 and have been deployed on the Tor network since 2004. Other than the database that stores the onion service descriptors, Tor is decentralized by design; there is no direct readable list of all onion services, although a number of onion services catalog publicly known onion addresses. TorSearch is an internet search engine that indexes pages to help find content in websites located on the Tor network.Because onion services route their traffic entirely through the Tor network, connection to an onion service is encrypted end-to-end and not subject to eavesdropping. There are, however, security issues involving Tor onion services. For example, services that are reachable through Tor onion services and the public Internet are susceptible to correlation attacks and thus not perfectly hidden. Other pitfalls include misconfigured services (e.g. identifying information included by default in web server error responses), uptime and downtime statistics, intersection attacks, and user error. The open source OnionScan program, written by independent security researcher Sarah Jamie Lewis, comprehensively examines onion services for numerous flaws and vulnerabilities. (Lewis has also pioneered the field of \"Onion Dildonics\", sex toys which make use of Tor through the Ricochet protocol)Onion services can also be accessed from a standard web browser without client-side connection to the Tor network, using services like Tor2web. Popular sources of .onion links include Pastebin, Twitter, Reddit, and other Internet forums.\n\n== Weaknesses ==\nLike all current low-latency anonymity networks, Tor cannot and does not attempt to protect against monitoring of traffic at the boundaries of the Tor network (i.e., the traffic entering and exiting the network). While Tor does provide protection against traffic analysis, it cannot prevent traffic confirmation (also called end-to-end correlation).A 2009 study revealed that Tor and the alternative network system JonDonym (Java Anon Proxy, JAP) are considered more resilient to website fingerprinting techniques than other tunneling protocols.The reason for this is that conventional single-hop VPN protocols do not need to reconstruct packet data nearly as much as a multi-hop service like Tor or JonDonym. Website fingerprinting yielded greater than 90% accuracy for identifying HTTP packets on conventional VPN protocols versus Tor which yielded only 2.96% accuracy. However, some protocols like OpenSSH and OpenVPN required a large amount of data before HTTP packets were identified.Researchers from the University of Michigan developed a network scanner allowing identification of 86% of live Tor \"bridges\" with a single scan.\n\n\n*** Consensus blocking ***\nLike many decentralized systems, Tor relies on a consensus mechanism to periodically update its current operating parameters, which for Tor are network parameters like which nodes are good/bad relays, exits, guards, and how much traffic each can handle. Tor's architecture for deciding the consensus relies on a small number of directory authority nodes voting on current network parameters. Currently, there are eight directory authority nodes, and their health is publicly monitored. The IP addresses of the authority nodes are hard coded into each Tor client. The authority nodes vote every hour to update the consensus, and clients download the most recent consensus on startup. A network congestion attack, such as a DDoS, can prevent the consensus nodes from communicating and thus prevent voting to update the consensus.\n\n\n*** Eavesdropping ***\n\n\n**** Autonomous system (AS) eavesdropping ****\nIf the same autonomous system (AS), responsible for routing packets at least partly, is present on both path segments from a client to entry relay and from exit relay to destination, such an AS can statistically correlate traffic on the entry and exit segments of the path (i.e. traffic confirmation) and potentially infer the destination with which the client communicated. In 2012, LASTor proposed a method to predict a set of potential ASes on these two segments and then avoid choosing this path during the path selection algorithm on the client side. In this paper, they also improve latency by choosing shorter geographical paths between a client and destination.\n\n\n**** Exit node eavesdropping ****\nIn September 2007, Dan Egerstad, a Swedish security consultant, revealed he had intercepted usernames and passwords for email accounts by operating and monitoring Tor exit nodes. As Tor cannot encrypt the traffic between an exit node and the target server, any exit node is in a position to capture traffic passing through it that does not use end-to-end encryption such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS). While this may not inherently breach the anonymity of the source, traffic intercepted in this way by malicious Tor exit nodes operators can expose information about the source in either or both of payload and protocol data. Furthermore, Egerstad is circumspect about the possible subversion of Tor by intelligence agencies:\nIf you actually look into where these Tor nodes are hosted and how big they are, some of these nodes cost thousands of dollars each month just to host because they're using lots of bandwidth, they're heavy-duty servers and so on. Who would pay for this and be anonymous?\nIn October 2019, a Tor researcher revealed that since at least 2017, there were hundreds of highly suspicious entry, relay, and exit nodes, run by an unknown group, in an unprecedented scale. It was alleged that this number of servers could pose the risk of a sybil attack as it could map Tor users' routes inside the network, increasing risk of deanonymization. At some point there were about 900 nodes running and by November 2021 about 600 of them were purged. \nAlthough described as being a deanonymization attempt, the motives and the achievements of this possibly on-going event are still unknown.\n\n\n**** Internal communication attack ****\nIn October 2011, a research team from ESIEA claimed to have discovered a way to compromise the Tor network by decrypting communication passing over it. The technique they describe requires creating a map of Tor network nodes, controlling one-third of them, and then acquiring their encryption keys and algorithm seeds. Then, using these known keys and seeds, they claim the ability to decrypt two encryption layers out of three. They claim to break the third key by a statistical attack. In order to redirect Tor traffic to the nodes they controlled, they used a denial-of-service attack. A response to this claim has been published on the official Tor Blog stating these rumors of Tor's compromise are greatly exaggerated.\n\n\n*** Traffic-analysis attack ***\nThere are two methods of traffic-analysis attack, passive and active. In the passive traffic-analysis method, the attacker extracts features from the traffic of a specific flow on one side of the network and looks for those features on the other side of the network. In the active traffic-analysis method, the attacker alters the timings of the packets of a flow according to a specific pattern and looks for that pattern on the other side of the network; therefore, the attacker can link the flows in one side to the other side of the network and break the anonymity of it. It is shown that, although timing noise is added to the packets, there are active traffic analysis methods that are robust against such a noise.Steven Murdoch and George Danezis from University of Cambridge presented an article at the 2005 IEEE Symposium on security and privacy on traffic-analysis techniques that allow adversaries with only a partial view of the network to infer which nodes are being used to relay the anonymous streams. These techniques greatly reduce the anonymity provided by Tor. Murdoch and Danezis have also shown that otherwise unrelated streams can be linked back to the same initiator. This attack, however, fails to reveal the identity of the original user. Murdoch has been working with and has been funded by Tor since 2006.\n\n\n*** Tor exit node block ***\nOperators of Internet sites have the ability to prevent traffic from Tor exit nodes or to offer reduced functionality for Tor users. For example, it is not generally possible to edit Wikipedia when using Tor or when using an IP address also used by a Tor exit node. The BBC blocks the IP addresses of all known Tor exit nodes from its iPlayer service, although non-exit relays and bridges are not blocked.\n\n\n*** Bad apple attack ***\nIn March 2011, researchers with the Rocquencourt French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique, INRIA), documented an attack that is capable of revealing the IP addresses of BitTorrent users on the Tor network. The \"bad apple attack\" exploits Tor's design and takes advantage of insecure application used to associate the simultaneous use of a secure application with the IP address of the Tor user in question. One method of attack depends on control of an exit node or hijacking tracker responses, while a secondary attack method is based in part on the statistical exploitation of distributed hash table tracking. According to the study:The results presented in the bad apple attack research paper are based on an attack launched against the Tor network by the authors of the study. The attack targeted six exit nodes, lasted for twenty-three days, and revealed a total of 10,000 IP addresses of active Tor users. This study is significant because it is the first documented attack designed to target P2P file-sharing applications on Tor. BitTorrent may generate as much as 40% of all traffic on Tor. Furthermore, the bad apple attack is effective against insecure use of any application over Tor, not just BitTorrent.\n\n\n*** Sniper attack ***\nJansen et al.., describes a DDoS attack targeted at the Tor node software, as well as defenses against that attack and its variants. The attack works using a colluding client and server, and filling the queues of the exit node until the node runs out of memory, and hence can serve no other (genuine) clients. By attacking a significant proportion of the exit nodes this way, an attacker can degrade the network and increase the chance of targets using nodes controlled by the attacker.\n\n\n*** Heartbleed bug ***\nThe Heartbleed OpenSSL bug disrupted the Tor network for several days in April 2014 while private keys were renewed. The Tor Project recommended Tor relay operators and onion service operators revoke and generate fresh keys after patching OpenSSL, but noted Tor relays use two sets of keys and Tor's multi-hop design minimizes the impact of exploiting a single relay. Five hundred eighty-six relays, later found to be susceptible to the Heartbleed bug, were taken offline as a precautionary measure.\n\n\n*** Relay early traffic confirmation attack ***\n\nOn 30 July 2014, the Tor Project issued the security advisory \"relay early traffic confirmation attack\" in which the project discovered a group of relays that tried to de-anonymize onion service users and operators. In summary, the attacking onion service directory node changed the headers of cells being relayed tagging them as \"relay\" or \"relay early\" cells differently to encode additional information and sent them back to the requesting user/operator. If the user's/operator's guard/entry node was also part of the attacking relays, the attacking relays might be able to capture the IP address of the user/operator along with the onion service information that the user/operator was requesting. The attacking relays were stable enough to be designated as \"suitable as hidden service directory\" and \"suitable as entry guard\"; therefore, both the onion service users and the onion services might have used those relays as guards and hidden service directory nodes.The attacking nodes joined the network early in the year on 30 January and the project removed them on 4 July. Although the attack's beginning is unclear, the project implied that between February and July, IP addresses of onion service users and operators might have been exposed.The project mentioned the following mitigations besides removing the attacking relays from the network:\n\npatched relay software to prevent relays from relaying cells with \"relay early\" headers that were not intended.\nplanned update for users' proxy software so that they could inspect if they received \"relay early\" cells from the relays (as they are not supposed to), along with the settings to connect to just one guard node instead of selecting randomly from 3 to reduce the probability of connecting to an attacking relay\nrecommended that onion services should consider changing their locations\nreminded users and onion service operators that Tor could not prevent de-anonymization if the attacker controlled or could listen to both ends of the Tor circuit, like in this attack.In November 2014 there was speculation in the aftermath of Operation Onymous, resulting in 17 arrests internationally, that a Tor weakness had been exploited. A representative of Europol was secretive about the method used, saying: \"This is something we want to keep for ourselves. The way we do this, we can't share with the whole world, because we want to do it again and again and again.\"\nA BBC source cited a \"technical breakthrough\"\nthat allowed tracking physical locations of servers, and the initial number of infiltrated sites led to the exploit speculation. Andrew Lewman\u2014a Tor Project representative\u2014downplayed this possibility, suggesting that execution of more traditional police work was more likely.In November 2015 court documents on the matter\naddressed concerns about security research ethics and the right of not being unreasonably searched as guaranteed by the US Fourth Amendment. Moreover, the documents, along with expert opinions, may also show the connection between the network attack and the law enforcement operation including:\n\nthe search warrant for an administrator of Silkroad 2.0 indicated that from January 2014 until July, the FBI received information from a \"university-based research institute\" with the information being \"reliable IP addresses for Tor and onion services such as SR2\" that led to the identification of \"at least another seventeen black markets on Tor\" and \"approximately 78 IP addresses that accessed a vendor .onion address.\" One of these IP addresses led to the arrest of the administrator\nthe chronology and nature of the attack fitted well with the operation\na senior researcher of International Computer Science Institute, part of University of California, Berkeley, said in an interview that the institute which worked with the FBI was \"almost certainly\" Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), and this concurred with the Tor Project's assessment and with an earlier analysis of Edward Felten, a computer security professor at Princeton University, about researchers from CMU's CERT/CC being involvedIn his analysis published on 31 July, besides raising ethical issues, Felten also questioned the fulfillment of CERT/CC's purposes which were to prevent attacks, inform the implementers of vulnerabilities, and eventually inform the public. Because in this case, CERT/CC's staff did the opposite which was to carry out a large-scale long-lasting attack, withhold vulnerability information from the implementers, and withhold the same information from the public. CERT/CC is a non-profit, computer security research organization publicly funded through the US federal government.\n\n\n*** Mouse fingerprinting ***\nIn March 2016, a security researcher based in Barcelona demonstrated laboratory techniques using time measurement via JavaScript at the 1-millisecond level which could potentially identify and correlate a user's unique mouse movements, provided the user has visited the same \"fingerprinting\" website with both the Tor browser and a regular browser. This proof of concept exploits the \"time measurement via JavaScript\" issue, which had been an open ticket on the Tor Project for ten months.\n\n\n*** Circuit fingerprinting attack ***\nIn 2015, the administrators of Agora, a darknet market, announced they were taking the site offline in response to a recently discovered security vulnerability in Tor. They did not say what the vulnerability was, but Wired speculated it was the \"Circuit Fingerprinting Attack\" presented at the USENIX security conference.\n\n\n*** Volume information ***\nA study showed \"anonymization solutions protect only partially against target selection that may lead to efficient surveillance\" as they typically \"do not hide the volume information necessary to do target selection\".\n\n== Implementations ==\n\nThe main implementation of Tor is written primarily in C.\n\n\n*** Tor Browser ***\n\nThe Tor Browser is a web browser capable of accessing the Tor network. It was created as the Tor Browser Bundle by Steven J. Murdoch and announced in January 2008. The Tor Browser consists of a modified Mozilla Firefox ESR web browser, the TorButton, TorLauncher, NoScript and the Tor proxy. Users can run the Tor Browser from removable media. It can operate under Microsoft Windows, macOS, Android and Linux.The default search engine is DuckDuckGo (until version 4.5, Startpage.com was its default). The Tor Browser automatically starts Tor background processes and routes traffic through the Tor network. Upon termination of a session the browser deletes privacy-sensitive data such as HTTP cookies and the browsing history. This is effective in reducing web tracking and canvas fingerprinting, and it also helps to prevent creation of a filter bubble.To allow download from places where accessing the Tor Project URL may be risky or blocked, a GitHub repository is maintained with links for releases hosted in other domains.\n\n\n**** Firefox/Tor browser attack ****\nIn 2011, the Dutch authority investigating child pornography discovered the IP address of a Tor onion service site called \"Pedoboard\" from an unprotected administrator's account and gave it to the FBI, who traced it to Aaron McGrath. After a year of surveillance, the FBI launched \"Operation Torpedo\" which resulted in McGrath's arrest and allowed them to install their Network Investigative Technique (NIT) malware on the servers for retrieving information from the users of the three onion service sites that McGrath controlled. The technique, exploiting a Firefox/Tor browser's vulnerability that had been patched and targeting users that had not updated, had a Flash application pinging a user's IP address directly back to an FBI server, and resulted in revealing at least 25 US users as well as numerous users from other countries. McGrath was sentenced to 20 years in prison in early 2014, with at least 18 other users including a former Acting HHS Cyber Security Director being sentenced in subsequent cases.In August 2013 it was discovered that the Firefox browsers in many older versions of the Tor Browser Bundle were vulnerable to a JavaScript-deployed shellcode attack, as NoScript was not enabled by default. Attackers used this vulnerability to extract users' MAC and IP addresses and Windows computer names. News reports linked this to a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) operation targeting Freedom Hosting's owner, Eric Eoin Marques, who was arrested on a provisional extradition warrant issued by a United States' court on 29 July. The FBI extradited Marques from Ireland to the state of Maryland on 4 charges: distributing; conspiring to distribute; and advertising child pornography, as well as aiding and abetting advertising of child pornography. The warrant alleged that Marques was \"the largest facilitator of child porn on the planet\". The FBI acknowledged the attack in a 12 September 2013 court filing in Dublin; further technical details from a training presentation leaked by Edward Snowden revealed the code name for the exploit as \"EgotisticalGiraffe\".In 2022, Kaspersky researchers found that when looking up \"Tor Browser\" in Chinese on YouTube, one of the URLs provided under the top-ranked Chinese-language video actually pointed to a malware disguised as Tor Browser. Once installed, it saves browsing history and form data that genuine Tor forgot by default, and even downloads malicious components to computers with IP addresses in China. Kaspersky researchers noted that the malware was not stealing data to sell for profit, but was designed to identify users.\n\n\n*** Tor Messenger ***\nOn 29 October 2015, the Tor Project released Tor Messenger Beta, an instant messaging program based on Instantbird with Tor and OTR built in and used by default. Like Pidgin and Adium, Tor Messenger supports multiple different instant messaging protocols; however, it accomplishes this without relying on libpurple, implementing all chat protocols in the memory-safe language JavaScript instead.According to Lucian Armasu of Toms Hardware, in April 2018, the Tor Project shut down the Tor Messenger project for three reasons: the developers of \"Instabird\"  [sic] discontinued support for their own software, limited resources and known metadata problems. The Tor Messenger developers explained that overcoming any vulnerabilities discovered in the future would be impossible due to the project relying on outdated software dependencies.\n\n\n*** Tor Phone ***\n\nIn 2016, Tor developer Mike Perry announced a prototype tor-enabled smartphone bases on CopperheadOS. It was meant as  a direction for Tor on mobile. The project was called 'Mission Improbable'. Copperhead's then lead developer Daniel Micay welcomed the prototype. Using Tor with Orbot and Tor Browser are supported by custom Android operating systems CalyxOS and DivestOS. GrapheneOS supports using Orbot VPN but not Tor Browser.\n\n\n*** Third-party applications ***\nThe Vuze (formerly Azureus) BitTorrent client, Bitmessage anonymous messaging system, and TorChat instant messenger include Tor support. The Briar messenger routes all messaging via Tor by default. OnionShare allows users to share files using Tor.The Guardian Project is actively developing a free and open-source suite of applications and firmware for the Android operating system to improve the security of mobile communications. The applications include the ChatSecure instant messaging client, Orbot Tor implementation (also available for iOS), Orweb (discontinued) privacy-enhanced mobile browser, Orfox, the mobile counterpart of the Tor Browser, ProxyMob Firefox add-on, and ObscuraCam.Onion Browser is open-source, privacy-enhancing web browser for iOS, which uses Tor. It is available in the iOS App Store, and source code is available on GitHub.Brave added support for Tor in its desktop browser's private-browsing mode. Users can switch to Tor-enabled browsing by clicking on the hamburger menu on the top right corner of the browser.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n*** Security-focused operating systems ***\nSeveral security-focused operating systems make or made extensive use of Tor. These include Hardened Linux From Scratch, Incognito, Libert\u00e9 Linux, Qubes OS, Subgraph, Parrot OS, Tails, Tor-ramdisk, and Whonix.\n\n== Reception, impact, and legislation ==\n\nTor has been praised for providing privacy and anonymity to vulnerable Internet users such as political activists fearing surveillance and arrest, ordinary web users seeking to circumvent censorship, and people who have been threatened with violence or abuse by stalkers. The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has called Tor \"the king of high-secure, low-latency Internet anonymity\", and BusinessWeek magazine has described it as \"perhaps the most effective means of defeating the online surveillance efforts of intelligence agencies around the world\". Other media have described Tor as \"a sophisticated privacy tool\", \"easy to use\" and \"so secure that even the world's most sophisticated electronic spies haven't figured out how to crack it\".Advocates for Tor say it supports freedom of expression, including in countries where the Internet is censored, by protecting the privacy and anonymity of users. The mathematical underpinnings of Tor lead it to be characterized as acting \"like a piece of infrastructure, and governments naturally fall into paying for infrastructure they want to use\".The project was originally developed on behalf of the U.S. intelligence community and continues to receive U.S. government funding, and has been criticized as \"more resembl[ing] a spook project than a tool designed by a culture that values accountability or transparency\". As of 2012, 80% of The Tor Project's $2M annual budget came from the United States government, with the U.S. State Department, the Broadcasting Board of Governors, and the National Science Foundation as major contributors, aiming \"to aid democracy advocates in authoritarian states\". Other public sources of funding include DARPA, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, and the Government of Sweden. Some have proposed that the government values Tor's commitment to free speech, and uses the darknet to gather intelligence. Tor also receives funding from NGOs including Human Rights Watch, and private sponsors including Reddit and Google. Dingledine said that the United States Department of Defense funds are more similar to a research grant than a procurement contract. Tor executive director Andrew Lewman said that even though it accepts funds from the U.S. federal government, the Tor service did not collaborate with the NSA to reveal identities of users.Critics say that Tor is not as secure as it claims, pointing to U.S. law enforcement's investigations and shutdowns of Tor-using sites such as web-hosting company Freedom Hosting and online marketplace Silk Road. In October 2013, after analyzing documents leaked by Edward Snowden, The Guardian reported that the NSA had repeatedly tried to crack Tor and had failed to break its core security, although it had had some success attacking the computers of individual Tor users. The Guardian also published a 2012 NSA classified slide deck, entitled \"Tor Stinks\", which said: \"We will never be able to de-anonymize all Tor users all the time\", but \"with manual analysis we can de-anonymize a very small fraction of Tor users\". When Tor users are arrested, it is typically due to human error, not to the core technology being hacked or cracked. On 7 November 2014, for example, a joint operation by the FBI, ICE Homeland Security investigations and European Law enforcement agencies led to 17 arrests and the seizure of 27 sites containing 400 pages. A late 2014 report by Der Spiegel using a new cache of Snowden leaks revealed, however, that as of 2012 the NSA deemed Tor on its own as a \"major threat\" to its mission, and when used in conjunction with other privacy tools such as OTR, Cspace, ZRTP, RedPhone, Tails, and TrueCrypt was ranked as \"catastrophic,\" leading to a \"near-total loss/lack of insight to target communications, presence...\"\n\n\n*** 2011 ***\nIn March 2011, The Tor Project received the Free Software Foundation's 2010 Award for Projects of Social Benefit. The citation read, \"Using free software, Tor has enabled roughly 36 million people around the world to experience freedom of access and expression on the Internet while keeping them in control of their privacy and anonymity. Its network has proved pivotal in dissident movements in both Iran and more recently Egypt.\"Iran tried to block Tor at least twice in 2011. One attempt simply blocked all servers with 2-hour-expiry security certificates; it was successful for less than 24 hours.\n\n\n*** 2012 ***\nIn 2012, Foreign Policy magazine named Dingledine, Mathewson, and Syverson among its Top 100 Global Thinkers \"for making the web safe for whistleblowers\".\n\n\n*** 2013 ***\nIn 2013, Jacob Appelbaum described Tor as a \"part of an ecosystem of software that helps people regain and reclaim their autonomy. It helps to enable people to have agency of all kinds; it helps others to help each other and it helps you to help yourself. It runs, it is open and it is supported by a large community spread across all walks of life.\"In June 2013, whistleblower Edward Snowden used Tor to send information about PRISM to The Washington Post and The Guardian.\n\n\n*** 2014 ***\nIn 2014, the Russian government offered a $111,000 contract to \"study the possibility of obtaining technical information about users and users' equipment on the Tor anonymous network\".In September 2014, in response to reports that Comcast had been discouraging customers from using the Tor Browser, Comcast issued a public statement that \"We have no policy against Tor, or any other browser or software.\"In October 2014, The Tor Project hired the public relations firm Thomson Communications to improve its public image (particularly regarding the terms \"Dark Net\" and \"hidden services,\" which are widely viewed as being problematic) and to educate journalists about the technical aspects of Tor.Turkey blocked downloads of Tor Browser from the Tor Project.\n\n\n*** 2015 ***\nIn June 2015, the special rapporteur from the United Nations' Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights specifically mentioned Tor in the context of the debate in the U.S. about allowing so-called backdoors in encryption programs for law enforcement purposes in an interview for The Washington Post.\nIn July 2015, the Tor Project announced an alliance with the Library Freedom Project to establish exit nodes in public libraries. The pilot program, which established a middle relay running on the excess bandwidth afforded by the Kilton Library in Lebanon, New Hampshire, making it the first library in the U.S. to host a Tor node, was briefly put on hold when the local city manager and deputy sheriff voiced concerns over the cost of defending search warrants for information passed through the Tor exit node. Although the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had alerted New Hampshire authorities to the fact that Tor is sometimes used by criminals, the Lebanon Deputy Police Chief and the Deputy City Manager averred that no pressure to strong-arm the library was applied, and the service was re-established on 15 September 2015. U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif) released a letter on 10 December 2015, in which she asked the DHS to clarify its procedures, stating that \"While the Kilton Public Library's board ultimately voted to restore their Tor relay, I am no less disturbed by the possibility that DHS employees are pressuring or persuading public and private entities to discontinue or degrade services that protect the privacy and anonymity of U.S. citizens.\" In a 2016 interview, Kilton Library IT Manager Chuck McAndrew stressed the importance of getting libraries involved with Tor: \"Librarians have always cared deeply about protecting privacy, intellectual freedom, and access to information (the freedom to read). Surveillance has a very well-documented chilling effect on intellectual freedom. It is the job of librarians to remove barriers to information.\" The second library to host a Tor node was the Las Naves Public Library in Valencia, Spain, implemented in the first months of 2016.In August 2015, an IBM security research group, called \"X-Force\", put out a quarterly report that advised companies to block Tor on security grounds, citing a \"steady increase\" in attacks from Tor exit nodes as well as botnet traffic.In September 2015, Luke Millanta created OnionView (now defunct), a web service that plots the location of active Tor relay nodes onto an interactive map of the world. The project's purpose was to detail the network's size and escalating growth rate.In December 2015, Daniel Ellsberg (of the Pentagon Papers), Cory Doctorow (of Boing Boing), Edward Snowden, and artist-activist Molly Crabapple, amongst others, announced their support of Tor.\n\n\n*** 2016 ***\nIn March 2016, New Hampshire state representative Keith Ammon introduced a bill allowing public libraries to run privacy software. The bill specifically referenced Tor. The text was crafted with extensive input from Alison Macrina, the director of the Library Freedom Project. The bill was passed by the House 268\u201362.Also in March 2016, the first Tor node, specifically a middle relay, was established at a library in Canada, the Graduate Resource Centre (GRC) in the Faculty of Information and Media Studies (FIMS) at the University of Western Ontario. Given that the running of a Tor exit node is an unsettled area of Canadian law, and that in general institutions are more capable than individuals to cope with legal pressures, Alison Macrina of the Library Freedom Project has opined that in some ways she would like to see intelligence agencies and law enforcement attempt to intervene in the event that an exit node were established.On 16 May 2016, CNN reported on the case of core Tor developer isis agora lovecruft, who had fled to Germany under the threat of a subpoena by the FBI during the Thanksgiving break of the previous year. The Electronic Frontier Foundation legally represented lovecruft.On 2 December 2016, The New Yorker reported on burgeoning digital privacy and security workshops in the San Francisco Bay Area, particularly at the hackerspace Noisebridge, in the wake of the 2016 United States presidential election; downloading the Tor browser was mentioned. Also, in December 2016, Turkey has blocked the usage of Tor, together with ten of the most used VPN services in Turkey, which were popular ways of accessing banned social media sites and services.Tor (and Bitcoin) was fundamental to the operation of the darkweb marketplace AlphaBay, which was taken down in an international law enforcement operation in July 2017. Despite federal claims that Tor would not shield a user, however, elementary operational security errors outside of the ambit of the Tor network led to the site's downfall.\n\n\n*** 2017 ***\nIn June 2017 the Democratic Socialists of America recommended intermittent Tor usage. And in August 2017, according to reportage cybersecurity firms which specialize in monitoring and researching the dark Web (which relies on Tor as its infrastructure) on behalf of banks and retailers routinely share their findings with the FBI and with other law enforcement agencies \"when possible and necessary\" regarding illegal content. The Russian-speaking underground offering a crime-as-a-service model is regarded as being particularly robust.\n\n\n*** 2018 ***\nIn June 2018, Venezuela blocked access to the Tor network. The block affected both direct connections to the network and connections being made via bridge relays.On 20 June 2018, Bavarian police raided the homes of the board members of the non-profit Zwiebelfreunde, a member of torservers.net, which handles the European financial transactions of riseup.net in connection with a blog post there which apparently promised violence against the upcoming Alternative for Germany convention. Tor came out strongly against the raid against its support organization, which provides legal and financial aid for the setting up and maintenance of high-speed relays and exit nodes. According to torservers.net, on 23 August 2018 the German court at Landgericht M\u00fcnchen ruled that the raid and seizures were illegal. The hardware and documentation seized had been kept under seal, and purportedly were neither analyzed nor evaluated by the Bavarian police.Since October 2018, Chinese online communities within Tor have begun to dwindle due to increased efforts to stop them by the Chinese government.\n\n\n*** 2019 ***\nIn November 2019, Edward Snowden called for a full, unabridged simplified Chinese translation of his autobiography, Permanent Record, as the Chinese publisher had violated their agreement by expurgating all mentions of Tor and other matters deemed politically sensitive by the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\n*** 2021 ***\nOn 8 December 2021, the Russian government agency Roskomnadzor announced it has banned Tor and six VPN services for failing to abide by the Russian Internet blacklist. Russian ISPs unsuccessfully attempted to block Tor's main website as well as several bridges beginning on 1 December 2021. The Tor Project has appealed to Russian courts over this ban.\n\n\n*** 2022 ***\nIn response to Internet censorship during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the BBC and VOA have directed Russian audiences to Tor. The Russian government increased efforts to block access to Tor through technical and political means, while the network reported an increase in traffic from Russia, and increased Russian use of its anti-censorship Snowflake tool.Russian courts temporarily lifted the blockade on Tor's website (but not connections to relays) on May 24, 2022 due to Russian law requiring that the Tor Project be involved in the case. However, the blockade was reinstated on July 21, 2022.Iran implemented rolling internet blackouts during the Mahsa Amini protests, and Tor and Snowflake were used to circumvent them.China, with its highly centralized control of its internet, had effectively blocked Tor.\n\n== Improved security ==\nTor responded to earlier vulnerabilities listed above by patching them and improving security. In one way or another, human (user) errors can lead to detection. The Tor Project website provides the best practices (instructions) on how to properly use the Tor browser. When improperly used, Tor is not secure. For example, Tor warns its users that not all traffic is protected; only the traffic routed through the Tor browser is protected. Users are also warned to use HTTPS versions of websites, not to torrent with Tor, not to enable browser plugins, not to open documents downloaded through Tor while online, and to use safe bridges. Users are also warned that they cannot provide their name or other revealing information in web forums over Tor and stay anonymous at the same time.Despite intelligence agencies' claims that 80% of Tor users would be de-anonymized within 6 months in the year 2013, that has still not happened. In fact, as late as September 2016, the FBI could not locate, de-anonymize and identify the Tor user who hacked into the email account of a staffer on Hillary Clinton's email server.The best tactic of law enforcement agencies to de-anonymize users appears to remain with Tor-relay adversaries running poisoned nodes, as well as counting on the users themselves using the Tor browser improperly. For example, downloading a video through the Tor browser and then opening the same file on an unprotected hard drive while online can make the users' real IP addresses available to authorities.\n\n\n*** Odds of detection ***\nWhen properly used, odds of being de-anonymized through Tor are said to be extremely low. Tor project's co-founder Nick Mathewson explained that the problem of \"Tor-relay adversaries\" running poisoned nodes means that a theoretical adversary of this kind is not the network's greatest threat:\n\n\"No adversary is truly global, but no adversary needs to be truly global,\" he says. \"Eavesdropping on the entire Internet is a several-billion-dollar problem. Running a few computers to eavesdrop on a lot of traffic, a selective denial of service attack to drive traffic to your computers, that's like a tens-of-thousands-of-dollars problem.\" At the most basic level, an attacker who runs two poisoned Tor nodes\u2014one entry, one exit\u2014is able to analyse traffic and thereby identify the tiny, unlucky percentage of users whose circuit happened to cross both of those nodes. In 2016 the Tor network offers a total of around 7,000 relays, around 2,000 guard (entry) nodes and around 1,000 exit nodes. So the odds of such an event happening are one in two million (1\u20442000 \u00d7 1\u20441000), give or take.\"\nTor does not provide protection against end-to-end timing attacks: if an attacker can watch the traffic coming out of the target computer, and also the traffic arriving at the target's chosen destination (e.g. a server hosting a .onion site), that attacker can use statistical analysis to discover that they are part of the same circuit.\n\n\n*** Levels of security ***\nDepending on individual user needs, Tor browser offers three levels of security located under the Security Level (the small gray shield at the top-right of the screen) icon > Advanced Security Settings. In addition to encrypting the data, including constantly changing an IP address through a virtual circuit comprising successive, randomly selected Tor relays, several other layers of security are at a user's disposal:\nStandard (default) \u2013 at this security level, all browser features are enabled.\nThis level provides the most usable experience, and the lowest level of security.\nSafer \u2013 at this security level, the following changes apply:\nJavaScript is disabled on non-HTTPS sites.\nOn sites where JavaScript is enabled, performance optimizations are disabled. Scripts on some sites may run slower.\nSome mechanisms of displaying math equations are disabled.\nAudio and video (HTML5 media), and WebGL are click-to-play.\nSafest \u2013 at this security level, these additional changes apply:\nJavaScript is disabled by default on all sites.\nSome fonts, icons, math symbols, and images are disabled.\nAudio and video (HTML5 media), and WebGL are click-to-play.\n\n== Citations ==\n\n== General and cited references =="

    "instruction": "SYN flood\n\n==Introduction==\nA SYN flood is a form of denial-of-service attack in which an attacker rapidly initiates a connection to a server without finalizing the connection.

While the former authentication mechanism contained information about where the code originated from and who signed that code, JAAS adds a marker about who runs the code. By extending the verification vectors JAAS extends the security architecture for Java applications that require authentication and authorization modules.\n\n\n\n== Administration ==\nFor the system administrator, JAAS consists of two kinds of configuration file:\n\n*.login.conf: specifies how to plug vendor-supplied login modules into particular applications\n*.policy: specifies which identities (users or programs) are granted which permissionsFor example, an application may have this login.conf file indicating how different authentication mechanisms are to be run to authenticate the user:\n\n   PetShopApplication {\n      com.sun.security.auth.module.LdapLoginModule sufficient;\n      com.foo.SmartcardLoginModule                 requisite;\n      com.sun.security.auth.module.UnixLoginModule required debug\n\n== Application interface ==\nFor the application developer, JAAS is a standard library that provides:\n\na representation of identity (Principal) and a set of credentials (Subject)\na login service that will invoke your application callbacks to ask the user things like username and password. It returns a new Subject\na service that tests if a Subject was granted a permission by an administrator.\n\n== Security system integration ==\nFor the security system integrator, JAAS provides interfaces:\n\nto provide your identity namespace to applications\nto attach credentials to threads (Subject)\nfor developing login modules. Your module invokes callbacks to query the user, checks their response and generates a Subject.\n\n== Login Modules ==\nLogin modules are primarily concerned with authentication rather than authorization and form a widely used component of JAAS.  A login module is required to implement the javax.security.auth.spi.LoginModule interface, which specifies the following methods:\nNote: A Subject is the user that is attempting to log in.\n\ninitialize:  Code to initialize the login module, usually by storing the parameters passed into appropriate fields of the Class.\nlogin:  Actually check the credentials provided via an Object that implements the javax.security.auth.Callback interface (e.g. check against a database).  This method could prompt the user for their login and password or it could use details previously obtained.  It is important to note here that, if invalid credentials are supplied then a javax.security.auth.login.FailedLoginException should be thrown (rather than returning false, which indicates that this login module should be ignored, which potentially allows authentication to succeed).\ncommit:  The identity of the subject has been verified, so code in this method sets up the Principal and Groups (roles) for the successfully authenticated subject.  This method has to be written carefully in enterprise applications as Java EE application servers often expect the relationships between the Principal and Group objects to be set up in a certain way.  This method should throw a javax.security.auth.login.FailedLoginException if authentication fails (e.g. a user has specified an incorrect login or password).\nabort:  Called if the authentication process itself fails.  If this method returns false, then this Login Module is ignored.\nlogout:  Code that should be executed upon logout (e.g. could remove the Principal from the Subject or could invalidate a web session).Login modules can provide single sign on (SSO) via a particular SSO protocol/framework (e.g. SAML, OpenID, and SPNEGO), can check for the presence of hardware security tokens (e.g. USB token), etc.  In an n-tier application, LoginModules can be present on both the client side and server side.\n\n\n*** LoginModule (javax.security.auth.spi.LoginModule) ***\nLogin modules are written by implementing this interface; they contain the actual code for authentication. It can use various mechanisms to authenticate user credentials. The code could retrieve a password from a database and compare it to the password supplied to the module.\n\n\n*** LoginContext (javax.security.auth.login.LoginContext) ***\nThe login context is the core of the JAAS framework which kicks off the authentication process by creating a Subject. As the authentication process proceeds, the subject is populated with various principals and credentials for further processing.\n\n\n*** Subject (javax.security.auth.Subject) ***\nA subject represents a single user, entity or system \u2013in other words, a client\u2013 requesting authentication.\n\n\n*** Principal (java.security.Principal) ***\nA principal represents the face of a subject. It encapsulates features or properties of a subject. A subject can contain multiple principals.\n\n\n*** Credentials ***\nCredentials are nothing but pieces of information regarding the subject in consideration. They might be account numbers, passwords, certificates etc. As the credential represents some important information, the further interfaces might be useful for creating a proper and secure credential \u2013 javax.security.auth.Destroyable and javax.security.auth.Refreshable. Suppose that after the successful authentication of the user you populate the subject with a secret ID (in the form of a credential) with which the subject can execute some critical services, but the credential should be removed after a specific time. In that case, one might want to implement the Destroyable interface.

Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect programs, data, additional computers or a network. An exploit taking advantage of a zero-day is called a zero-day exploit, or zero-day attack.\nThe term \"zero-day\" originally referred to the number of days since a new piece of software was released to the public, so \"zero-day software\" was obtained by hacking into a developer's computer before release. Eventually the term was applied to the vulnerabilities that allowed this hacking, and to the number of days that the vendor has had to fix them. Once the vendors learn of the vulnerability, they will usually create patches or advise workarounds to mitigate it.\nThe more recently that the vendor has become aware of the vulnerability, the more likely it is that no fix or mitigation has been developed. Once a fix is developed, the chance of the exploit succeeding decreases as more users apply the fix over time. For zero-day exploits, unless the vulnerability is inadvertently fixed, such as by an unrelated update that happens to fix the vulnerability, the probability that a user has applied a vendor-supplied patch that fixes the problem is zero, so the exploit would remain available. Zero-day attacks are a severe threat.\n\n\n\n== Attack vectors ==\nPotential attack vectors for a zero-day vulnerability are identical to known vulnerabilities and those that have available patches. For example, when a user visits a rogue website, malicious code on the site can exploit unpatched vulnerabilities in a Web browser. Web browsers are a particular target for criminals because of their widespread distribution and usage. Cybercriminals, as well as international vendors of spyware such as Israel\u2019s NSO Group, can also send malicious e-mail attachments via SMTP, which exploit vulnerabilities in the application opening the attachment. Exploits that take advantage of common file types are numerous and frequent, as evidenced by their increasing appearances in databases such as US-CERT. Criminals can engineer malware to take advantage of these file type exploits to compromise attacked systems or steal confidential data.\n\n== Window of vulnerability ==\nThe time from when a software exploit first becomes active to the time when the number of vulnerable systems shrinks to insignificance is known as the window of vulnerability. The timeline for each software vulnerability is defined by the following main events: \n\nt0: The vulnerability is discovered (by anyone).\nt1a: A security patch is published (e.g., by the software vendor).\nt1b: An exploit becomes active.\nt2: Most vulnerable systems have applied the patch.Thus the formula for the length of the window of vulnerability is: t2 \u2212 t1b.\nIn this formulation, it is always true that t0 \u2264 t1a, and t0 \u2264 t1b. Note that t0 is not the same as day zero. For example, if a hacker is the first to discover (at t0) the vulnerability, the vendor might not learn of it until much later (on day zero).\nFor normal vulnerabilities, t1b > t1a. This implies that the software vendor was aware of the vulnerability and had time to publish a security patch (t1a) before any hacker could craft a workable exploit (t1b). For zero-day exploits, t1b \u2264 t1a, such that the exploit becomes active before a patch is made available.\nBy not disclosing known vulnerabilities, a software vendor hopes to reach t2 before t1b is reached, thus avoiding any exploits. However, the vendor has no guarantees that hackers will not find vulnerabilities on their own. Furthermore, hackers can analyze the security patches themselves, and thereby discover the underlying vulnerabilities and automatically generate working exploits. These exploits can be used effectively up until time t2.\nIn practice, the length of the window of vulnerability varies between systems, vendors, and individual vulnerabilities. It is often measured in days, with one report from 2006 estimating the average as 28 days.\n\n== Protection ==\nZero-day protection is the ability to provide protection against zero-day exploits. Since zero-day attacks are generally unknown to the public, it is often difficult to defend against them. Zero-day attacks are often effective against \"secure\" networks and can remain undetected even after they are launched. Thus, users of so-called secure systems must also exercise common sense and practice safe computing habits.Many techniques exist to limit the effectiveness of zero-day memory corruption vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows. These protection mechanisms exist in contemporary operating systems such as macOS, Windows Vista and beyond (see also: Security and safety features new to Windows Vista), Solaris, Linux, Unix, and Unix-like environments; Windows XP Service Pack 2 includes limited protection against generic memory corruption vulnerabilities and previous versions include even less. Desktop and server protection software also exist to mitigate zero-day buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Typically, these technologies involve heuristic termination analysis in order to stop attacks before they cause any harm.It has been suggested that a solution of this kind may be out of reach because it is algorithmically impossible in the general case to analyze any arbitrary code to determine if it is malicious, as such an analysis reduces to the halting problem over a linear bounded automaton, which is unsolvable. It is, however, unnecessary to address the general case (that is, to sort all programs into the categories of malicious or non-malicious) under most circumstances in order to eliminate a wide range of malicious behaviors. It suffices to recognize the safety of a limited set of programs (e.g., those that can access or modify only a given subset of machine resources) while rejecting both some safe and all unsafe programs. This does require the integrity of those safe programs to be maintained, which may prove difficult in the face of a kernel-level exploit.The Zeroday Emergency Response Team (ZERT) was a group of software engineers who worked to release non-vendor patches for zero-day exploits.\n\n== Worms ==\nZero-day worms take advantage of a surprise attack while they are still unknown to computer security professionals. Recent history shows an increasing rate of worm propagation. Well designed worms can spread very fast with devastating consequences to the Internet and other systems.\n\n== Ethics ==\nDiffering ideologies exist relating to the collection and use of zero-day vulnerability information. Many computer security vendors perform research on zero-day vulnerabilities in order to better understand the nature of vulnerabilities and their exploitation by individuals, computer worms and viruses. Alternatively, some vendors purchase vulnerabilities to augment their research capacity. An example of such a program is TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative. While selling and buying these vulnerabilities is not technically illegal in most parts of the world, there is a lot of controversy over the method of disclosure. A 2006 German decision to include Article 6 of the Convention on Cybercrime and the EU Framework Decision on Attacks against Information Systems may make selling or even manufacturing vulnerabilities illegal.Most formal programs follow some form of Rain Forest Puppy's disclosure guidelines or the more recent OIS Guidelines for Security Vulnerability Reporting and Response. In general, these rules forbid the public disclosure of vulnerabilities without notification to the vendor and adequate time to produce a patch.\n\n== Viruses ==\nA zero-day virus (also known as zero-day malware or next-generation malware) is a previously unknown computer virus or other malware for which specific antivirus software signatures are not yet available.Traditionally, antivirus software relied upon signatures to identify malware. A virus signature is a unique pattern or code that can be used to detect and identify specific viruses. The antivirus scans file signatures and compares them to a database of known malicious codes. If they match, the file is flagged and treated as a threat. The major limitation of signature-based detection is that it is only capable of flagging already known malware, making it useless against zero-day attacks. Most modern antivirus software still uses signatures but also carries out other types of analysis.\n\n\n*** Code analysis ***\nIn code analysis, the machine code of the file is analysed to see if there is anything that looks suspicious. Typically, malware has characteristic behaviour; code analysis attempts to detect if this is present in the code.\nAlthough useful, code analysis has significant limitations. It is not always easy to determine what a section of code is intended to do, particularly if it is very complex and has been deliberately written with the intention of defeating analysis. Another limitation of code analysis is the time and resources available. In the competitive world of antivirus software, there is always a balance between the effectiveness of analysis and the time delay involved.\nOne approach to overcome the limitations of code analysis is for the antivirus software to run suspect sections of code in a safe sandbox and observe their behavior. This can be orders of magnitude faster than analyzing the same code, but must resist (and detect) attempts by the code to detect the sandbox.\n\n\n*** Generic signatures ***\nGeneric signatures are signatures that are specific to certain behaviour rather than a specific item of malware. Most new malware is not totally novel, but is a variation on earlier malware, or contains code from one or more earlier examples of malware. Thus, the results of previous analysis can be used against new malware.\n\n\n*** Competitiveness in the antivirus software industry ***\nIt is generally accepted in the antivirus industry that most vendors' signature-based protection is identically effective. If a signature is available for an item of malware, then every product (unless dysfunctional) should detect it. However, some vendors are significantly faster than others at becoming aware of new viruses and/or updating their customers' signature databases to detect them.There is a wide range of effectiveness in terms of zero-day virus protection. The German computer magazine c't found that detection rates for zero-day viruses varied from 20% to 68%. It is primarily in the area of zero-day virus performance that manufacturers now compete.\n\n== U.S. government involvement ==\n\n\n*** NSA's use of zero-day exploits (2017) ***\nIn mid-April 2017 the hackers known as The Shadow Brokers (TSB), who are allegedly linked to the Russian government, released files from the NSA (initially just regarded as alleged to be from the NSA, later confirmed through internal details and by American whistleblower Edward Snowden) which include a series of 'zero-day exploits' targeting Microsoft Windows software and a tool to penetrate the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)'s service provider. Ars Technica had reported Shadow Brokers' hacking claims in mid-January 2017, and in April the Shadow Brokers posted the exploits as proof.\n\n\n*** Vulnerabilities Equities Process ***\n\nThe Vulnerabilities Equities Process, first revealed publicly in 2016, is a process used by the U.S. federal government to determine on a case-by-case basis how it should treat zero-day computer security vulnerabilities: whether to disclose them to the public to help improve general computer security or to keep them secret for offensive use against the government's adversaries. The process has been criticized for a number of deficiencies, including restriction by non-disclosure agreements, lack of risk ratings, special treatment for the NSA, and a less than full commitment to disclosure as the default option.\nRead the text above and answer this question: How did the term \"zero-day\" come about and what does it originally refer to?",

The project proposed to allow a user to enter information to send across the internet, thereby relinquishing control of it.  However, the user is able to include an \"expiration date,\" after which the information is no longer usable by anyone who may have a copy of it, even the creator.  The Vanish approach was found to be vulnerable to a Sybil attack, and thus insecure, by a team called Unvanish from the University of Texas, University of Michigan, and Princeton.\n\n\n\n== Theory ==\nVanish acts by automating the encryption of information entered by the user with an encryption key that is unknown to the user.  Along with the information the user enters, the user also enters metadata concerning how long the information should remain available.  The system then encrypts the information, but does not store either the encryption key or the original information. Instead, it breaks up the decryption key into smaller components that are disseminated across distributed hash tables, or DHTs via the Internet.  The DHTs refresh information within their nodes on a set schedule unless configured to make the information persistent.  The time delay entered by the user in the metadata controls how long the DHTs should allow the information to persist, but once that time period is over, the DHTs will reuse those nodes, making the information about the decryption stored irretrievable.

    "instruction": "ISO/IEC 27701\n\n==Introduction==\nISO/IEC 27701:2019 (formerly known as ISO/IEC 27552 during the drafting period) is a privacy extension to ISO/IEC 27001. The design goal is to enhance the existing Information Security Management System (ISMS) with additional requirements in order to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve a Privacy Information Management System (PIMS). The standard outlines a framework for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Controllers and PII Processors to manage privacy controls to reduce the risk to the privacy rights of individuals.ISO/IEC 27701 is intended to be a certifiable extension to ISO/IEC 27001 certifications. In other words, organizations planning to seek an ISO/IEC 27701 certification will also need to have an ISO/IEC 27001 certification.\n\n== Intended application of the standard ==\nThe intended application of ISO/IEC 27701 is to augment the existing ISMS with privacy-specific controls and, thus, create PIMS to enable effective privacy management within an organization.\nA robust PIMS has many potential benefits for PII Controllers and PII Processors, with at least three significant advantages:\nFirst, achieving compliance to privacy requirements (particularly laws and regulations, plus agreements with third parties, plus corporate privacy policies etc.) is burdensome, especially if the requirements are not organized in the most effective way for PII Controllers and PII Processors. Organizations subject to multiple privacy compliance obligations (e.g. from several jurisdictions in which they operate or data subjects live) face additional burdens to reconcile, satisfy and keep watch on all the applicable requirements. A managed approach eases the compliance burden, for example as demonstrated by Annex C of the standard, a single privacy control may satisfy multiple requirements from General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Second, achieving and maintaining compliance with applicable requirements is a governance and assurance issue. Based on the PIMS (and, potentially, its certification), Privacy or Data Protection Officers can provide the necessary evidence to assure stakeholders such as senior management, owners and the authorities that applicable privacy requirements are satisfied.\nThird, PIMS certification can be valuable in communicating privacy compliance to customers and partners. PII Controllers generally demand evidence from PII Processors that the PII Processors\u2019 privacy management system adheres to applicable privacy requirements. A uniform evidence framework based on international standard can greatly simplify such communication of compliance transparency, especially when the evidence is validated by an accredited third-party auditor. This necessity in communication of compliance transparency is also critical for strategic business decisions such as mergers and acquisitions and co-Controllers scenarios involving data sharing agreement. Lastly, PIMS certification can potentially serve to signal trustworthiness to the public.\n\n== Normative references ==\nISO/IEC 27701 normatively references the following documents:\n\nISO/IEC 27001\nISO/IEC 27002:2017-06\n\n== Structure of the standard ==\nThe requirements of the standard are segregated into the four following groups:\n\nPIMS requirements related to ISO/IEC 27001 are outlined in clause 5.\nPIMS requirements related to ISO/IEC 27002 are outlined in clause 6.\nPIMS guidance for PII Controllers are outlined in clause 7.\nPIMS guidance for PII Processors are outlined in clause 8.The standard further includes the following Annexes:\nAnnex A PIMS-specific reference control objectives and controls (PII Controllers)\nAnnex B PIMS-specific reference control objectives and controls (PII Processors)\nAnnex C Mapping to ISO/IEC 29100\nAnnex D Mapping to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nAnnex E Mapping to ISO/IEC 27018 and ISO/IEC 29151\nAnnex F How to apply ISO/IEC 27701 to ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002\n\n== History of the standard ==\nA new work item was proposed to JTC 1/SC 27 by JTC 1/SC 27/WG 5 \"Identity management and privacy technologies\" in April 2016 based on an initiative by experts from the French National Body of JTC 1/SC 27.\nThe project was then developed in JTC 1/SC 27/WG 5 under the number ISO/IEC 27552. \nBritish Standards Institution (BSI) made the first CD of ISO/IEC 27552 publicly available from its web store in February 2018.\nThe second CD of ISO/IEC 27552 was published in August 2018.\nThe DIS of ISO/IEC 27552 was issued in January 2019 and approved in March 2019. As no technical changes were necessary, the FDIS ballot was bypassed.\nISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 completed the technical work on ISO/IEC 27552 in April 2019.\nBefore its publication, ISO/IEC 27552 was renumbered to ISO/IEC 27701 as per the Resolution 39/2019 of ISO/Technical Management Board, which mandates that any Management System \"type A\" (containing requirements) shall have a number finishing with \u201c01\u201d as its last two digits. The renumbering was finalized in July 2019.\nThe standard was published on August 6th, 2019.\n\nWhen was the standard published on August 6th, 2019?",

      "answer": "The standard was published on August 6th, 2019, after being renumbered from ISO/IEC 27552 to ISO/IEC 27701 and approved by ISO/Technical Management Board.",
      "context": "ISO/IEC 27701\n\n==Introduction==\nISO/IEC 27701:2019 (formerly known as ISO/IEC 27552 during the drafting period) is a privacy extension to ISO/IEC 27001. The design goal is to enhance the existing Information Security Management System (ISMS) with additional requirements in order to establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve a Privacy Information Management System (PIMS). The standard outlines a framework for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Controllers and PII Processors to manage privacy controls to reduce the risk to the privacy rights of individuals.ISO/IEC 27701 is intended to be a certifiable extension to ISO/IEC 27001 certifications. In other words, organizations planning to seek an ISO/IEC 27701 certification will also need to have an ISO/IEC 27001 certification.\n\n== Intended application of the standard ==\nThe intended application of ISO/IEC 27701 is to augment the existing ISMS with privacy-specific controls and, thus, create PIMS to enable effective privacy management within an organization.\nA robust PIMS has many potential benefits for PII Controllers and PII Processors, with at least three significant advantages:\nFirst, achieving compliance to privacy requirements (particularly laws and regulations, plus agreements with third parties, plus corporate privacy policies etc.) is burdensome, especially if the requirements are not organized in the most effective way for PII Controllers and PII Processors. Organizations subject to multiple privacy compliance obligations (e.g. from several jurisdictions in which they operate or data subjects live) face additional burdens to reconcile, satisfy and keep watch on all the applicable requirements. A managed approach eases the compliance burden, for example as demonstrated by Annex C of the standard, a single privacy control may satisfy multiple requirements from General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Second, achieving and maintaining compliance with applicable requirements is a governance and assurance issue. Based on the PIMS (and, potentially, its certification), Privacy or Data Protection Officers can provide the necessary evidence to assure stakeholders such as senior management, owners and the authorities that applicable privacy requirements are satisfied.\nThird, PIMS certification can be valuable in communicating privacy compliance to customers and partners. PII Controllers generally demand evidence from PII Processors that the PII Processors\u2019 privacy management system adheres to applicable privacy requirements. A uniform evidence framework based on international standard can greatly simplify such communication of compliance transparency, especially when the evidence is validated by an accredited third-party auditor. This necessity in communication of compliance transparency is also critical for strategic business decisions such as mergers and acquisitions and co-Controllers scenarios involving data sharing agreement. Lastly, PIMS certification can potentially serve to signal trustworthiness to the public.\n\n== Normative references ==\nISO/IEC 27701 normatively references the following documents:\n\nISO/IEC 27001\nISO/IEC 27002:2017-06\n\n== Structure of the standard ==\nThe requirements of the standard are segregated into the four following groups:\n\nPIMS requirements related to ISO/IEC 27001 are outlined in clause 5.\nPIMS requirements related to ISO/IEC 27002 are outlined in clause 6.\nPIMS guidance for PII Controllers are outlined in clause 7.\nPIMS guidance for PII Processors are outlined in clause 8.The standard further includes the following Annexes:\nAnnex A PIMS-specific reference control objectives and controls (PII Controllers)\nAnnex B PIMS-specific reference control objectives and controls (PII Processors)\nAnnex C Mapping to ISO/IEC 29100\nAnnex D Mapping to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nAnnex E Mapping to ISO/IEC 27018 and ISO/IEC 29151\nAnnex F How to apply ISO/IEC 27701 to ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002\n\n== History of the standard ==\nA new work item was proposed to JTC 1/SC 27 by JTC 1/SC 27/WG 5 \"Identity management and privacy technologies\" in April 2016 based on an initiative by experts from the French National Body of JTC 1/SC 27.\nThe project was then developed in JTC 1/SC 27/WG 5 under the number ISO/IEC 27552. \nBritish Standards Institution (BSI) made the first CD of ISO/IEC 27552 publicly available from its web store in February 2018.\nThe second CD of ISO/IEC 27552 was published in August 2018.\nThe DIS of ISO/IEC 27552 was issued in January 2019 and approved in March 2019. As no technical changes were necessary, the FDIS ballot was bypassed.\nISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 completed the technical work on ISO/IEC 27552 in April 2019.\nBefore its publication, ISO/IEC 27552 was renumbered to ISO/IEC 27701 as per the Resolution 39/2019 of ISO/Technical Management Board, which mandates that any Management System \"type A\" (containing requirements) shall have a number finishing with \u201c01\u201d as its last two digits. The renumbering was finalized in July 2019.\nThe standard was published on August 6th, 2019."

    "instruction": "TRESOR\n\n==Introduction==\nTRESOR (recursive acronym for \"TRESOR Runs Encryption Securely Outside RAM\", and also the German word for a safe) is a Linux kernel patch which provides encryption using only the CPU to defend against cold boot attacks on computer systems by performing encryption inside CPU registers rather than random-access memory (RAM). It is one of two proposed solutions for general-purpose computers. The other, called \"frozen cache\" uses the CPU cache instead. It was developed from its predecessor AESSE, presented at EuroSec 2010 and presented at USENIX Security 2011. The authors state that it allows RAM to be treated as untrusted from a security viewpoint without hindering the system.\n\n== Motivation ==\nIn computer security, a common problem for data security is how an intruder can access encrypted data on a computer. Modern encryption algorithms, correctly implemented and with strong passwords, are often unbreakable with current technology, so emphasis has moved to techniques that bypass this requirement, by exploiting aspects of data security where the encryption can be \"broken\" with much less effort, or else bypassed completely.\nA cold boot attack is one such means by which an intruder can defeat encryption despite system security, if they can gain physical access to the running machine. It is premised on the physical properties of the circuitry within memory devices that are commonly used in computers. The concept is that when a computer system has encrypted data open, the encryption keys themselves used to read or write that data are usually stored on a temporary basis in physical memory, in a plain readable form. (Holding these keys in \"plain\" form during use is hard or impossible to avoid with usual systems since the system itself must be able to access the data when instructed by the authorized user). Usually this is no benefit to an unauthorised intruder, because they cannot access or use those keys\u2014for example due to security built into the software or system. However, if the memory devices can be accessed outside the running system without loss of contents, for example by quickly restarting the computer or removing the devices to a different device, then the current contents\u2014including any encryption keys in use\u2014can be plainly read and used. This can be important if the system cannot be used to view, copy or access that data\u2014for example the system is locked, or may have booby traps or other intrusion controls, or is needed in a guaranteed untouched form for forensic or evidentiary purposes.\nSince this is a physical property of the hardware itself, and based on physical properties of memory devices, it cannot be defeated easily by pure software techniques, since all software running in memory at the point of intervention becomes accessible. As a result, any encryption software whose keys could be accessed this way is vulnerable to such attacks. Usually a cold boot attack involves cooling memory chips or quickly restarting the computer, and exploiting the fact that data is not immediately lost (or not lost if power is very quickly restored) and the data that was held at the point of intervention will be left accessible to examination.\nCold boot attacks can therefore be a means of unauthorized data theft, loss or access. Such attacks can be nullified if the encryption keys are not accessible at a hardware level to an intruder\u2013i.e., the devices in which the keys are stored when in use are not amenable to cold boot attacks\u2013but this is not the usual case.\n\n== TRESOR's approach ==\nTRESOR is a software approach that seeks to resolve this insecurity by storing and manipulating encryption keys almost exclusively on the CPU alone, and in registers accessible at ring 0 (the highest privilege level) only\u2014the exception being the brief period of initial calculation at the start of a session. This ensures that encryption keys are almost never available to userspace code or following a cold boot attack. TRESOR is written as a patch to the kernel that stores encryption keys in the x86 debug registers, and uses on-the-fly round key generation, atomicity, and blocking of usual ptrace access to the debug registers for security.\nTRESOR was foreshadowed by a 2010 thesis by Tilo Muller which analyzed the cold boot attack issue. He concluded that modern x86 processors had two register areas where CPU-based kernel encryption was realistic: the SSE registers which could in effect be made privileged by disabling all SSE instructions (and necessarily, any programs relying on them), and the debug registers which were much smaller but had no such issues. He left the latter for others to examine, and developed a proof of concept distribution called Paranoix based on the SSE register method.Its developers state that \"running TRESOR on a 64-bit CPU that supports AES-NI, there is no performance penalty compared to a generic implementation of AES\", and run slightly faster than standard encryption despite the need for key recalculation, a result which initially surprised the authors as well.\n\n== Potential vulnerabilities ==\nThe authors' paper notes the following:\n\nAlthough they cannot rule out CPU data leaking into RAM, they were unable to observe any case this happened during formal testing. Any such case is expected to be patchable.\nRoot access to the encryption keys via the kernel of a running system is possible using loadable kernel modules or virtual memory (/dev/kmem) and physical memory (/dev/mem), if compiled to support these, but otherwise appears not to be accessible in any known way on a standard running system.\nACPI sleep and low power states: - on real processors registers are reset to zero during ACPI S3 states (suspend-to-ram) and S4 (suspend-to-disk) states since the CPU is switched off for these.\nCold boot attacks on the CPU: - on real processors registers are cleared to zero on both hardware resets and software resets (\"Ctrl-Alt-Delete\"). However CPU registers are currently vulnerable on virtual machines, since they are reset during simulated hardware resets but not during software resets. The authors deem this an apparent flaw in many implementations of virtual machines, but note that virtual systems would be inherently vulnerable even if this were rectified, since all registers on a virtual machine are likely to be accessible using the host system.\nTRESOR is resistant to timing attacks and cache-based attacks by design of the AES-NI instruction, where the CPU supports AES instruction set extensions. Processors capable of handling AES extensions as of 2011 are Intel Westmere and Sandy Bridge (some i3 excepted) and successors, AMD Bulldozer, and certain VIA PadLock processors.\nIn 2012 a paper called TRESOR-HUNT showed how a DMA attack could break this system, by injecting code that would invisibly function at ring 0 (the highest privilege level), bypassing the \"lockout\" imposed by TRESOR, which would allow it to read the keys from the debug registers and transfer them to usual memory. The paper also proposed ways to mitigate such attacks.\n\n== References and notes ==\n\nWhat is the difference between TRESOR and the \"frozen cache\" solution for protecting against cold boot attacks?",

    "instruction": "Wired Equivalent Privacy\n\n==Introduction==\nWired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was a security algorithm for 802.11 wireless networks. Introduced as part of the original IEEE 802.11 standard ratified in 1997, its intention was to provide data confidentiality comparable to that of a traditional wired network. WEP, recognizable by its key of 10 or 26 hexadecimal digits (40 or 104 bits), was at one time widely used, and was often the first security choice presented to users by router configuration tools.In 2003, the Wi-Fi Alliance announced that WEP had been superseded by Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). In 2004, with the ratification of the full 802.11i standard (i.e. WPA2), the IEEE declared that both WEP-40 and WEP-104 have been deprecated.WEP was the only encryption protocol available to 802.11a and 802.11b devices built before the WPA standard, which was available for 802.11g devices. However, some 802.11b devices were later provided with firmware or software updates to enable WPA, and newer devices had it built in.\n\n== Encryption details ==\nWEP was included as the privacy component of the original IEEE 802.11 standard ratified in 1997. WEP uses the stream cipher RC4 for confidentiality, and the CRC-32 checksum for integrity. It was deprecated in 2004 and is documented in the current standard.\n\nStandard 64-bit WEP uses a 40-bit key (also known as WEP-40), which is concatenated with a 24-bit initialization vector (IV) to form the RC4 key. At the time that the original WEP standard was drafted, the U.S. Government's export restrictions on cryptographic technology limited the key size. Once the restrictions were lifted, manufacturers of access points implemented an extended 128-bit WEP protocol using a 104-bit key size (WEP-104).\nA 64-bit WEP key is usually entered as a string of 10 hexadecimal (base 16) characters (0\u20139 and A\u2013F). Each character represents 4 bits, 10 digits of 4 bits each gives 40 bits; adding the 24-bit IV produces the complete 64-bit WEP key (4 bits \u00d7 10 + 24-bit IV\n\n== Authentication ==\nTwo methods of authentication can be used with WEP: Open System authentication and Shared Key authentication.\nIn Open System authentication, the WLAN client does not provide its credentials to the access point during authentication. Any client can authenticate with the access point and then attempt to associate. In effect, no authentication occurs. Subsequently, WEP keys can be used for encrypting data frames. At this point, the client must have the correct keys.\nIn Shared Key authentication, the WEP key is used for authentication in a four-step challenge\u2013response handshake:\n\nThe client sends an authentication request to the access point.\nThe access point replies with a clear-text challenge.\nThe client encrypts the challenge-text using the configured WEP key and sends it back in another authentication request.\nThe access point decrypts the response. If this matches the challenge text, the access point sends back a positive reply.After the authentication and association, the pre-shared WEP key is also used for encrypting the data frames using RC4.\nAt first glance, it might seem as though Shared Key authentication is more secure than Open System authentication since the latter offers no real authentication. However, it is quite the reverse. It is possible to derive the keystream used for the handshake by capturing the challenge frames in Shared Key authentication. Therefore, data can be more easily intercepted and decrypted with Shared Key authentication than with Open System authentication. If privacy is a primary concern, it is more advisable to use Open System authentication for WEP authentication, rather than Shared Key authentication; however, this also means that any WLAN client can connect to the AP. (Both authentication mechanisms are weak; Shared Key WEP is deprecated in favor of WPA/WPA2.)\n\n== Weak security ==\n\nBecause RC4 is a stream cipher, the same traffic key must never be used twice. The purpose of an IV, which is transmitted as plaintext, is to prevent any repetition, but a 24-bit IV is not long enough to ensure this on a busy network. The way the IV was used also opened WEP to a related-key attack. For a 24-bit IV, there is a 50% probability the same IV will repeat after 5,000 packets.\nIn August 2001, Scott Fluhrer, Itsik Mantin, and Adi Shamir published a cryptanalysis of WEP that exploits the way the RC4 ciphers and IV are used in WEP, resulting in a passive attack that can recover the RC4 key after eavesdropping on the network. Depending on the amount of network traffic, and thus the number of packets available for inspection, a successful key recovery could take as little as one minute. If an insufficient number of packets are being sent, there are ways for an attacker to send packets on the network and thereby stimulate reply packets, which can then be inspected to find the key. The attack was soon implemented, and automated tools have since been released. It is possible to perform the attack with a personal computer, off-the-shelf hardware, and freely available software such as aircrack-ng to crack any WEP key in minutes.\nCam-Winget et al. surveyed a variety of shortcomings in WEP. They wrote \"Experiments in the field show that, with proper equipment, it is practical to eavesdrop on WEP-protected networks from distances of a mile or more from the target.\" They also reported two generic weaknesses:\n\nthe use of WEP was optional, resulting in many installations never even activating it, and\nby default, WEP relies on a single shared key among users, which leads to practical problems in handling compromises, which often leads to ignoring compromises.In 2005, a group from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation gave a demonstration where they cracked a WEP-protected network in three minutes using publicly available tools. Andreas Klein presented another analysis of the RC4 stream cipher. Klein showed that there are more correlations between the RC4 keystream and the key than the ones found by Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir, which can additionally be used to break WEP in WEP-like usage modes.\nIn 2006, Bittau, Handley, and Lackey showed that the 802.11 protocol itself can be used against WEP to enable earlier attacks that were previously thought impractical. After eavesdropping a single packet, an attacker can rapidly bootstrap to be able to transmit arbitrary data. The eavesdropped packet can then be decrypted one byte at a time (by transmitting about 128 packets per byte to decrypt) to discover the local network IP addresses. Finally, if the 802.11 network is connected to the Internet, the attacker can use 802.11 fragmentation to replay eavesdropped packets while crafting a new IP header onto them. The access point can then be used to decrypt these packets and relay them on to a buddy on the Internet, allowing real-time decryption of WEP traffic within a minute of eavesdropping the first packet.\nIn 2007, Erik Tews, Andrei Pychkine, and Ralf-Philipp Weinmann were able to extend Klein's 2005 attack and optimize it for usage against WEP. With the new attack it is possible to recover a 104-bit WEP key with a probability of 50% using only 40,000 captured packets. For 60,000 available data packets, the success probability is about 80%, and for 85,000 data packets, about 95%. Using active techniques like Wi-Fi deauthentication attacks and ARP re-injection, 40,000 packets can be captured in less than one minute under good conditions. The actual computation takes about 3 seconds and 3 MB of main memory on a Pentium-M 1.7 GHz and can additionally be optimized for devices with slower CPUs. The same attack can be used for 40-bit keys with an even higher success probability.\nIn 2008 the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) updated the Data Security Standard (DSS) to prohibit use of WEP as part of any credit-card processing after 30 June 2010, and prohibit any new system from being installed that uses WEP after 31 March 2009. The use of WEP contributed to the TJ Maxx parent company network invasion.\n\n\n*** Caffe Latte attack ***\nThe Caffe Latte attack is another way to defeat WEP. It is not necessary for the attacker to be in the area of the network using this exploit. By using a process that targets the Windows wireless stack, it is possible to obtain the WEP key from a remote client. By sending a flood of encrypted ARP requests, the assailant takes advantage of the shared key authentication and the message modification flaws in 802.11 WEP. The attacker uses the ARP responses to obtain the WEP key in less than 6 minutes.\n\n== Remedies ==\nUse of encrypted tunneling protocols (e.g., IPsec, Secure Shell) can provide secure data transmission over an insecure network. However, replacements for WEP have been developed with the goal of restoring security to the wireless network itself.\n\n\n*** 802.11i (WPA and WPA2) ***\nThe recommended solution to WEP security problems is to switch to WPA2. WPA was an intermediate solution for hardware that could not support WPA2. Both WPA and WPA2 are much more secure than WEP. To add support for WPA or WPA2, some old Wi-Fi access points might need to be replaced or have their firmware upgraded. WPA was designed as an interim software-implementable solution for WEP that could forestall immediate deployment of new hardware. However, TKIP (the basis of WPA) has reached the end of its designed lifetime, has been partially broken, and has been officially deprecated with the release of the 802.11-2012 standard.\n\n\n*** Implemented non-standard fixes ***\n\n\n**** WEP2 ****\nThis stopgap enhancement to WEP was present in some of the early 802.11i drafts. It was implementable on some (not all) hardware not able to handle WPA or WPA2, and extended both the IV and the key values to 128 bits. It was hoped to eliminate the duplicate IV deficiency as well as stop brute-force key attacks.\nAfter it became clear that the overall WEP algorithm was deficient (and not just the IV and key sizes) and would require even more fixes, both the WEP2 name and original algorithm were dropped. The two extended key lengths remained in what eventually became WPA's TKIP.\n\n\n**** WEPplus ****\nWEPplus, also known as WEP+, is a proprietary enhancement to WEP by Agere Systems (formerly a subsidiary of Lucent Technologies) that enhances WEP security by avoiding \"weak IVs\". It is only completely effective when WEPplus is used at both ends of the wireless connection. As this cannot easily be enforced, it remains a serious limitation. It also does not necessarily prevent replay attacks, and is ineffective against later statistical attacks that do not rely on weak IVs.\n\n\n**** Dynamic WEP ****\nDynamic WEP refers to the combination of 802.1x technology and the Extensible Authentication Protocol. Dynamic WEP changes WEP keys dynamically. It is a vendor-specific feature provided by several vendors such as 3Com.\nThe dynamic change idea made it into 802.11i as part of TKIP, but not for the WEP protocol itself.\nQ: Why was the use of WEP prohibited in credit-card processing after 30 June 2010 and why was it officially deprecated with the release of the 802.11-2012 standard?",

      "context": "Wired Equivalent Privacy\n\n==Introduction==\nWired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was a security algorithm for 802.11 wireless networks. Introduced as part of the original IEEE 802.11 standard ratified in 1997, its intention was to provide data confidentiality comparable to that of a traditional wired network. WEP, recognizable by its key of 10 or 26 hexadecimal digits (40 or 104 bits), was at one time widely used, and was often the first security choice presented to users by router configuration tools.In 2003, the Wi-Fi Alliance announced that WEP had been superseded by Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). In 2004, with the ratification of the full 802.11i standard (i.e. WPA2), the IEEE declared that both WEP-40 and WEP-104 have been deprecated.WEP was the only encryption protocol available to 802.11a and 802.11b devices built before the WPA standard, which was available for 802.11g devices. However, some 802.11b devices were later provided with firmware or software updates to enable WPA, and newer devices had it built in.\n\n== Encryption details ==\nWEP was included as the privacy component of the original IEEE 802.11 standard ratified in 1997. WEP uses the stream cipher RC4 for confidentiality, and the CRC-32 checksum for integrity. It was deprecated in 2004 and is documented in the current standard.\n\nStandard 64-bit WEP uses a 40-bit key (also known as WEP-40), which is concatenated with a 24-bit initialization vector (IV) to form the RC4 key. At the time that the original WEP standard was drafted, the U.S. Government's export restrictions on cryptographic technology limited the key size. Once the restrictions were lifted, manufacturers of access points implemented an extended 128-bit WEP protocol using a 104-bit key size (WEP-104).\nA 64-bit WEP key is usually entered as a string of 10 hexadecimal (base 16) characters (0\u20139 and A\u2013F). Each character represents 4 bits, 10 digits of 4 bits each gives 40 bits; adding the 24-bit IV produces the complete 64-bit WEP key (4 bits \u00d7 10 + 24-bit IV\n\n== Authentication ==\nTwo methods of authentication can be used with WEP: Open System authentication and Shared Key authentication.\nIn Open System authentication, the WLAN client does not provide its credentials to the access point during authentication. Any client can authenticate with the access point and then attempt to associate. In effect, no authentication occurs. Subsequently, WEP keys can be used for encrypting data frames. At this point, the client must have the correct keys.\nIn Shared Key authentication, the WEP key is used for authentication in a four-step challenge\u2013response handshake:\n\nThe client sends an authentication request to the access point.\nThe access point replies with a clear-text challenge.\nThe client encrypts the challenge-text using the configured WEP key and sends it back in another authentication request.\nThe access point decrypts the response. If this matches the challenge text, the access point sends back a positive reply.After the authentication and association, the pre-shared WEP key is also used for encrypting the data frames using RC4.\nAt first glance, it might seem as though Shared Key authentication is more secure than Open System authentication since the latter offers no real authentication. However, it is quite the reverse. It is possible to derive the keystream used for the handshake by capturing the challenge frames in Shared Key authentication. Therefore, data can be more easily intercepted and decrypted with Shared Key authentication than with Open System authentication. If privacy is a primary concern, it is more advisable to use Open System authentication for WEP authentication, rather than Shared Key authentication; however, this also means that any WLAN client can connect to the AP. (Both authentication mechanisms are weak; Shared Key WEP is deprecated in favor of WPA/WPA2.)\n\n== Weak security ==\n\nBecause RC4 is a stream cipher, the same traffic key must never be used twice. The purpose of an IV, which is transmitted as plaintext, is to prevent any repetition, but a 24-bit IV is not long enough to ensure this on a busy network. The way the IV was used also opened WEP to a related-key attack. For a 24-bit IV, there is a 50% probability the same IV will repeat after 5,000 packets.\nIn August 2001, Scott Fluhrer, Itsik Mantin, and Adi Shamir published a cryptanalysis of WEP that exploits the way the RC4 ciphers and IV are used in WEP, resulting in a passive attack that can recover the RC4 key after eavesdropping on the network. Depending on the amount of network traffic, and thus the number of packets available for inspection, a successful key recovery could take as little as one minute. If an insufficient number of packets are being sent, there are ways for an attacker to send packets on the network and thereby stimulate reply packets, which can then be inspected to find the key. The attack was soon implemented, and automated tools have since been released. It is possible to perform the attack with a personal computer, off-the-shelf hardware, and freely available software such as aircrack-ng to crack any WEP key in minutes.\nCam-Winget et al. surveyed a variety of shortcomings in WEP. They wrote \"Experiments in the field show that, with proper equipment, it is practical to eavesdrop on WEP-protected networks from distances of a mile or more from the target.\" They also reported two generic weaknesses:\n\nthe use of WEP was optional, resulting in many installations never even activating it, and\nby default, WEP relies on a single shared key among users, which leads to practical problems in handling compromises, which often leads to ignoring compromises.In 2005, a group from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation gave a demonstration where they cracked a WEP-protected network in three minutes using publicly available tools.

    "instruction": "Security breach notification laws\n\n==Introduction==\nSecurity breach notification laws or data breach notification laws are laws that require individuals or entities affected by a data breach, unauthorized access to data, to notify their customers and other parties about the breach, as well as take specific steps to remedy the situation based on state legislature. Data breach notification laws have two main goals. The first goal is to allow individuals a chance to mitigate risks against data breaches. The second goal is to promote company incentive to strengthen data security.Together, these goals work to minimize consumer harm from data breaches, including impersonation, fraud, and identity theft.Such laws have been irregularly enacted in all 50 U.S. states since 2002. Currently, all 50 states have enacted forms of data breach notification laws. There is no federal data breach notification law, despite previous legislative attempts. These laws were enacted in response to an escalating number of breaches of consumer databases containing personally identifiable information. Similarly, multiple other countries, like the European Unions's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Australia's Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 (Cth), have added data breach notification laws to combat the increasing occurrences of data breaches.The rise in data breaches conducted by both countries and individuals is evident and alarming, as the number of reported data breaches has increased from 421 in 2011, to 1,091 in 2016, and 1,579 in 2017 according to the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC). It has also impacted millions of people and gained increasing public awareness due to large data breaches such as the October 2017 Equifax breach that exposed almost 146 million individual's personal information.\n\n== Australia ==\nOn February 22, 2018, Australia passed the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 (Cth), which went into action in 2018. This amended the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), which had established a notification system for data breaches involving personal information that lead to harm. Now, entities with existing personal information security obligations under the Australian Privacy Act are required to notify the Office of Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and affected individuals of all \u201celigible data breaches.\u201d The amendment is coming off large data breaches experiences in Australia, such as the Yahoo hack in 2013 involving thousands of government officials and the data breach of NGO Australian Red Cross releasing 550,000 blood donor's personal information.\nCriticism of the data breach notification include: the unjustified exemption of certain entities such as small businesses and the Privacy Commissioner not required to post data breaches in one permanent place to be used as data for future research. In addition, notification obligations are not consistent at a state level.\n\n== China ==\nIn mid-2017, China adopted a new Cyber security Law, which included data breach notification requirements.\n\n== European Union ==\nIn 1995, the EU passed the Data Protection Directive (DPD), which has recently been replaced with the 2016 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a comprehensive federal data breach notification law. The GDPR offers stronger data protection laws, broader data breach notification laws, and new factors such as the right to data portability. However, certain areas of the data breach notification laws are supplemented by other data security laws.Examples of this include, the European Union implemented a breach notification law in the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (E-Privacy Directive) in 2009, specific to personal data held by telecoms and Internet service providers. This law contains some of the notification obligations for data breaches.The traffic data of the subscribers, who use voice and data via a network company, is saved from the company only for operational reasons. However, the traffic data must be deleted when they aren\u2019t necessary anymore, in order to avoid the breaches.\nHowever, the traffic data is necessary for the creation and treatment of subscriber billing. The use of these data is available only up to the end of the period that the bill can be repaid based on the law of European Union (Article 6 - paragraphs 1-6 ).\nRegarding the marketing usage of the traffic data for the sale of additional chargeable services, they can be used from the company only if the subscriber gives his/her consent (but, the consent can be withdrawn at every time). Also, the service provider must inform the subscriber or user of the types of traffic data which are processed and of the duration of that based on the above assumptions. Processing of traffic data, in accordance with the above details, must be restricted to persons acting under the authority of providers of the public communications networks and publicly available electronic communications services handling billing or traffic management, customer enquiries, fraud detection, marketing electronic communications services or providing a value added service, and must be restricted to what is necessary for the purposes of such activities.\nData breach notification obligations are included in the new Directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive). This creates notification requirements on essential services and digital service providers. Among these include immediately notifying the authorities or computer security incident response teams (CSIRTS) if they experience a significant data breach.\nSimilar to US concerns for a state-by-state approach creating increased costs and difficulty complying with all the state laws, the EU's various breach notification requirements in different laws creates concern.\n\n== Japan ==\nIn 2015, Japan amended the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) to combat massive data leaks. Specifically, the massive Benesse Corporation data leak in 2014 where nearly 29 million pieces of private customer information was leaked and sold. This includes new penal sanctions on illegal transaction, however, there is no specific provision dealing with data breach notification in the APPI. Instead, the Policies Concerning the Protection of Personal Information, in accordance with the APPI, creates a policy that encourages business operators to disclose data breaches voluntarily.Kaori Ishii and Taro Komukai have theorized that the Japanese culture offers a potential explanation for why there is no specific data breach notification law to encourage companies to strengthen data security. The Japanese general public and mass media, in particularly, condemn leaks. Consequently, data leaks quickly result in losing customer trust, brand value, and ultimately profits. An example of this include, after a 2004 data leak, Softbank swiftly lost 107 billion yen and Benesse Corporation lost 940,000 customers after the data leak. This has resulted in compliance with disclosing data leaks in accordance with the policy.While proving the Japanese culture makes specific data breach notification laws necessary is difficult to objectively prove, what has been shown is that companies that experience data breach do experience both financial and reputation harm.\n\n== New Zealand ==\nNew Zealand\u2019s Privacy Act 2020 came into force on December 1, 2020, replacing the 1993 act. The act makes notification of privacy breaches mandatory. Organisations receiving and collecting data will now have to report any privacy breach they believe has caused, or is likely to cause, serious harm.\n\n== United States ==\nData Breach Notification Laws have been enacted in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. As of August 2021, attempts to pass a federal data breach notification law have been unsuccessful.\n\n\n*** The 50 States ***\nThe first such law, the California data security breach notification law, was enacted in 2002 and became effective on July 1, 2003. The bill was enacted in reaction to the fear of identity theft and fraud. As related in the bill statement, law requires \"a state agency, or a person or business that conducts business in California, that owns or licenses computerized data that includes personal information, as defined, to disclose in specified ways, any breach of the security of the data, as defined, to any resident of California whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person.\" In addition, the law permits delayed notification \"if a law enforcement agency determines that it would impede a criminal investigation.\" The law also requires any entity that licenses such information to notify the owner or licensee of the information of any breach of the security of the data.\nIn general, most state laws follow the basic tenets of California's original law: Companies must immediately disclose a data breach to customers, usually in writing. California has since broadened its law to include compromised medical and health insurance information. Where bills differ most is at what level the breach must be reported to the state Attorney General (usually when it affects 500 or 1000 individuals or more). Some states like California publish these data breach notifications on their oag.gov websites. Breaches must be reported if \"sensitive personally identifying information\nhas been acquired or is reasonably believed to have been acquired by an unauthorized person, and is reasonably likely to cause substantial harm to the individuals to whom the information relates.\" This leaves room for some interpretation (will it cause substantial harm?); but breaches of encrypted data need not be reported. Nor must it be reported if data has been obtained or viewed by unauthorized individuals as long as there is no reason to believe they will use the data in harmful ways.\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures maintains a list of enacted and proposed security breach notification laws.Some of the state differences in data breach notification laws include thresholds of harm suffered from data breaches, the need to notify certain law enforcement or consumer credit agencies, broader definitions of personal information, and differences in penalties for non-compliance.\n\n\n*** Federal Data Breach Notification Law History ***\nAs of August 2021, there is no federal data breach notification law. The first proposed federal data breach notification law was introduced to Congress in 2003, but it never exited the Judiciary Committee. Similarly, a number of bills that would establish a national standard for data security breach notification have been introduced in the U.S. Congress, but none passed in the 109th Congress. In fact, in 2007, three federal data breach notification laws were proposed, but none passed Congress. In his 2015 State of the Union speech, President Obama proposed new legislation to create a national data breach standard that would establish a 30-day notification requirement from the discovery of a breach. This led to President Obama's 2015 Personal Data Notification & Protection Act (PDNPA) proposal. This would have created federal notification guidelines and standards, but it never came out of committee.Chlotia Garrison and Clovia Hamilton theorized that a potential reason for the inability to pass a federal law on data breach notifications is states' rights. As of now, all 50 states have varying data breach notification laws. Some are restrictive, while others are broad. While there is not a comprehensive federal law on data breach notifications, some federal laws require notifications of data breaches in certain circumstances. Some notable examples include: the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), the Financial Services Modernization Act (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\n\n\n*** Debate over federal or state data breach notification laws ***\nMost scholars, like Angela Daly, advocate for federal data breach notification laws emphasize the problem with having varying forms of data breach notification laws. That is, companies are forced to comply with multiple state data breach notification laws. This creates increased difficulty to comply with the laws and the costs. In addition, scholars have argued that a state-by-state approach has created the problem of uncompensated victims and inadequate incentives to persuade companies and governments to invest in data security.Advocates of a state-by-state approach to data breach notification laws emphasize increased efficiency, increased incentives to have the local governments increase data security, limited federal funding available due to multiple projects, and lastly states are able to quickly adapt and pass laws to constantly evolving data breach technologies. In 2018, a majority of state attorneys general opposed a proposed federal data breach notification law that would preempt state laws.\n\n== Impact ==\nData breaches occur because of technical issues like bad code to economic issues causing competing firm to not cooperate with each other to tackle data security. In response, data breach notification laws attempt to prevent harm to companies and the public.\n\n\n*** Criminal impact ***\nA serious harm of data breaches is identity theft. Identity theft can harm individuals when their personal data is stolen and is used by another party to create financial harm such as withdrawing their money, non financially such as fraudulently claiming their health benefits, and pretending to be them and committing crimes. Based on data collected from 2002 to 2009 from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the use of data breach notification has helped to decrease identity theft by 6.1 percent.\n\n\n*** Economic impact ***\nOverall, data breach notifications leads to decreasing market value, evident in publicly traded companies experiencing a decrease in market valuation. Other costs include loss of consumer confidence and trust in the company, loss of business, decreased productivity, and exposure to third-party liability.

      "answer": "The two laws that have been implemented by the European Union regarding data breach notification are the Data Protection Directive (DPD) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).",
      "context": "Security breach notification laws\n\n==Introduction==\nSecurity breach notification laws or data breach notification laws are laws that require individuals or entities affected by a data breach, unauthorized access to data, to notify their customers and other parties about the breach, as well as take specific steps to remedy the situation based on state legislature. Data breach notification laws have two main goals. The first goal is to allow individuals a chance to mitigate risks against data breaches. The second goal is to promote company incentive to strengthen data security.Together, these goals work to minimize consumer harm from data breaches, including impersonation, fraud, and identity theft.Such laws have been irregularly enacted in all 50 U.S. states since 2002. Currently, all 50 states have enacted forms of data breach notification laws. There is no federal data breach notification law, despite previous legislative attempts. These laws were enacted in response to an escalating number of breaches of consumer databases containing personally identifiable information. Similarly, multiple other countries, like the European Unions's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Australia's Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 (Cth), have added data breach notification laws to combat the increasing occurrences of data breaches.The rise in data breaches conducted by both countries and individuals is evident and alarming, as the number of reported data breaches has increased from 421 in 2011, to 1,091 in 2016, and 1,579 in 2017 according to the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC). It has also impacted millions of people and gained increasing public awareness due to large data breaches such as the October 2017 Equifax breach that exposed almost 146 million individual's personal information.\n\n== Australia ==\nOn February 22, 2018, Australia passed the Privacy Amendment (Notifiable Data Breaches) Act 2017 (Cth), which went into action in 2018. This amended the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), which had established a notification system for data breaches involving personal information that lead to harm. Now, entities with existing personal information security obligations under the Australian Privacy Act are required to notify the Office of Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and affected individuals of all \u201celigible data breaches.\u201d The amendment is coming off large data breaches experiences in Australia, such as the Yahoo hack in 2013 involving thousands of government officials and the data breach of NGO Australian Red Cross releasing 550,000 blood donor's personal information.\nCriticism of the data breach notification include: the unjustified exemption of certain entities such as small businesses and the Privacy Commissioner not required to post data breaches in one permanent place to be used as data for future research. In addition, notification obligations are not consistent at a state level.\n\n== China ==\nIn mid-2017, China adopted a new Cyber security Law, which included data breach notification requirements.\n\n== European Union ==\nIn 1995, the EU passed the Data Protection Directive (DPD), which has recently been replaced with the 2016 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a comprehensive federal data breach notification law. The GDPR offers stronger data protection laws, broader data breach notification laws, and new factors such as the right to data portability. However, certain areas of the data breach notification laws are supplemented by other data security laws.Examples of this include, the European Union implemented a breach notification law in the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (E-Privacy Directive) in 2009, specific to personal data held by telecoms and Internet service providers. This law contains some of the notification obligations for data breaches.The traffic data of the subscribers, who use voice and data via a network company, is saved from the company only for operational reasons. However, the traffic data must be deleted when they aren\u2019t necessary anymore, in order to avoid the breaches.\nHowever, the traffic data is necessary for the creation and treatment of subscriber billing. The use of these data is available only up to the end of the period that the bill can be repaid based on the law of European Union (Article 6 - paragraphs 1-6 ).\nRegarding the marketing usage of the traffic data for the sale of additional chargeable services, they can be used from the company only if the subscriber gives his/her consent (but, the consent can be withdrawn at every time). Also, the service provider must inform the subscriber or user of the types of traffic data which are processed and of the duration of that based on the above assumptions. Processing of traffic data, in accordance with the above details, must be restricted to persons acting under the authority of providers of the public communications networks and publicly available electronic communications services handling billing or traffic management, customer enquiries, fraud detection, marketing electronic communications services or providing a value added service, and must be restricted to what is necessary for the purposes of such activities.\nData breach notification obligations are included in the new Directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive). This creates notification requirements on essential services and digital service providers. Among these include immediately notifying the authorities or computer security incident response teams (CSIRTS) if they experience a significant data breach.\nSimilar to US concerns for a state-by-state approach creating increased costs and difficulty complying with all the state laws, the EU's various breach notification requirements in different laws creates concern.\n\n== Japan ==\nIn 2015, Japan amended the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) to combat massive data leaks. Specifically, the massive Benesse Corporation data leak in 2014 where nearly 29 million pieces of private customer information was leaked and sold. This includes new penal sanctions on illegal transaction, however, there is no specific provision dealing with data breach notification in the APPI. Instead, the Policies Concerning the Protection of Personal Information, in accordance with the APPI, creates a policy that encourages business operators to disclose data breaches voluntarily.Kaori Ishii and Taro Komukai have theorized that the Japanese culture offers a potential explanation for why there is no specific data breach notification law to encourage companies to strengthen data security. The Japanese general public and mass media, in particularly, condemn leaks. Consequently, data leaks quickly result in losing customer trust, brand value, and ultimately profits. An example of this include, after a 2004 data leak, Softbank swiftly lost 107 billion yen and Benesse Corporation lost 940,000 customers after the data leak. This has resulted in compliance with disclosing data leaks in accordance with the policy.While proving the Japanese culture makes specific data breach notification laws necessary is difficult to objectively prove, what has been shown is that companies that experience data breach do experience both financial and reputation harm.\n\n== New Zealand ==\nNew Zealand\u2019s Privacy Act 2020 came into force on December 1, 2020, replacing the 1993 act. The act makes notification of privacy breaches mandatory. Organisations receiving and collecting data will now have to report any privacy breach they believe has caused, or is likely to cause, serious harm.\n\n== United States ==\nData Breach Notification Laws have been enacted in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. As of August 2021, attempts to pass a federal data breach notification law have been unsuccessful.\n\n\n*** The 50 States ***\nThe first such law, the California data security breach notification law, was enacted in 2002 and became effective on July 1, 2003. The bill was enacted in reaction to the fear of identity theft and fraud. As related in the bill statement, law requires \"a state agency, or a person or business that conducts business in California, that owns or licenses computerized data that includes personal information, as defined, to disclose in specified ways, any breach of the security of the data, as defined, to any resident of California whose unencrypted personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person.\" In addition, the law permits delayed notification \"if a law enforcement agency determines that it would impede a criminal investigation.\" The law also requires any entity that licenses such information to notify the owner or licensee of the information of any breach of the security of the data.\nIn general, most state laws follow the basic tenets of California's original law: Companies must immediately disclose a data breach to customers, usually in writing. California has since broadened its law to include compromised medical and health insurance information. Where bills differ most is at what level the breach must be reported to the state Attorney General (usually when it affects 500 or 1000 individuals or more). Some states like California publish these data breach notifications on their oag.gov websites. Breaches must be reported if \"sensitive personally identifying information\nhas been acquired or is reasonably believed to have been acquired by an unauthorized person, and is reasonably likely to cause substantial harm to the individuals to whom the information relates.\" This leaves room for some interpretation (will it cause substantial harm?); but breaches of encrypted data need not be reported. Nor must it be reported if data has been obtained or viewed by unauthorized individuals as long as there is no reason to believe they will use the data in harmful ways.\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures maintains a list of enacted and proposed security breach notification laws.Some of the state differences in data breach notification laws include thresholds of harm suffered from data breaches, the need to notify certain law enforcement or consumer credit agencies, broader definitions of personal information, and differences in penalties for non-compliance.\n\n\n*** Federal Data Breach Notification Law History ***\nAs of August 2021, there is no federal data breach notification law. The first proposed federal data breach notification law was introduced to Congress in 2003, but it never exited the Judiciary Committee. Similarly, a number of bills that would establish a national standard for data security breach notification have been introduced in the U.S. Congress, but none passed in the 109th Congress. In fact, in 2007, three federal data breach notification laws were proposed, but none passed Congress. In his 2015 State of the Union speech, President Obama proposed new legislation to create a national data breach standard that would establish a 30-day notification requirement from the discovery of a breach. This led to President Obama's 2015 Personal Data Notification & Protection Act (PDNPA) proposal. This would have created federal notification guidelines and standards, but it never came out of committee.Chlotia Garrison and Clovia Hamilton theorized that a potential reason for the inability to pass a federal law on data breach notifications is states' rights. As of now, all 50 states have varying data breach notification laws. Some are restrictive, while others are broad. While there is not a comprehensive federal law on data breach notifications, some federal laws require notifications of data breaches in certain circumstances. Some notable examples include: the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act), the Financial Services Modernization Act (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\n\n\n*** Debate over federal or state data breach notification laws ***\nMost scholars, like Angela Daly, advocate for federal data breach notification laws emphasize the problem with having varying forms of data breach notification laws. That is, companies are forced to comply with multiple state data breach notification laws. This creates increased difficulty to comply with the laws and the costs. In addition, scholars have argued that a state-by-state approach has created the problem of uncompensated victims and inadequate incentives to persuade companies and governments to invest in data security.Advocates of a state-by-state approach to data breach notification laws emphasize increased efficiency, increased incentives to have the local governments increase data security, limited federal funding available due to multiple projects, and lastly states are able to quickly adapt and pass laws to constantly evolving data breach technologies. In 2018, a majority of state attorneys general opposed a proposed federal data breach notification law that would preempt state laws.\n\n== Impact ==\nData breaches occur because of technical issues like bad code to economic issues causing competing firm to not cooperate with each other to tackle data security. In response, data breach notification laws attempt to prevent harm to companies and the public.\n\n\n*** Criminal impact ***\nA serious harm of data breaches is identity theft. Identity theft can harm individuals when their personal data is stolen and is used by another party to create financial harm such as withdrawing their money, non financially such as fraudulently claiming their health benefits, and pretending to be them and committing crimes. Based on data collected from 2002 to 2009 from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the use of data breach notification has helped to decrease identity theft by 6.1 percent.\n\n\n*** Economic impact ***\nOverall, data breach notifications leads to decreasing market value, evident in publicly traded companies experiencing a decrease in market valuation. Other costs include loss of consumer confidence and trust in the company, loss of business, decreased productivity, and exposure to third-party liability. Notably, the type of data that is leaked from the breach has varying economic impact. A data breach that leaks sensitive data experiences harsher economic repercussions.\n\n\n*** Victim response ***\nMost federal data breach lawsuits share certain characteristics. These include a plaintiff seeking relief from the loss of an identity theft, emotional distress, future losses, and increased risk of future harm; the majority of litigation are private class actions; the defendants are usually large firms or businesses; a mix of common law and statutory causes of action; and lastly most cases settle or are dismissed."

    "instruction": "Hacker culture\n\n==Introduction==\nThe hacker culture is a subculture of individuals who enjoy\u2014often in collective effort\u2014the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming the limitations of software systems or electronic hardware (mostly digital electronics), to achieve novel and clever outcomes. The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed hacking. However, the defining characteristic of a hacker is not the activities performed themselves (e.g. programming), but how it is done and whether it is exciting and meaningful. Activities of playful cleverness can be said to have \"hack value\" and therefore the term \"hacks\" came about, with early examples including pranks at MIT done by students to demonstrate their technical aptitude and cleverness. The hacker culture originally emerged in academia in the 1960s around the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) and MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Hacking originally involved entering restricted areas in a clever way without causing any major damage. Some famous hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were placing of a campus police cruiser on the roof of the Great Dome and converting the Great Dome into R2-D2.Richard Stallman explains about hackers who program:\n\nWhat they had in common was mainly love of excellence and programming. They wanted to make their programs that they used be as good as they could. They also wanted to make them do neat things. They wanted to be able to do something in a more exciting way than anyone believed possible and show \"Look how wonderful this is. I bet you didn't believe this could be done.\"\nHackers from this subculture tend to emphatically differentiate themselves from what they pejoratively call \"crackers\"; those who are generally referred to by media and members of the general public using the term \"hacker\", and whose primary focus\u200d\u2014\u200cbe it to malign or for malevolent purposes\u200d\u2014\u200clies in exploiting weaknesses in computer security.\n\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThe Jargon File, an influential but not universally accepted compendium of hacker slang, defines hacker as \"A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and stretching their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.\" The Request for Comments (RFC) 1392, the Internet Users' Glossary, amplifies this meaning as \"A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.\"As documented in the Jargon File, these hackers are disappointed by the mass media and general public's usage of the word hacker to refer to security breakers, calling them \"crackers\" instead. This includes both \"good\" crackers (\"white hat hackers\"), who use their computer security-related skills and knowledge to learn more about how systems and networks work and to help to discover and fix security holes, as well as those more \"evil\" crackers (\"black hat hackers\"), who use the same skills to author harmful software (such as viruses or trojans) and illegally infiltrate secure systems with the intention of doing harm to the system. The programmer subculture of hackers, in contrast to the cracker community, generally sees computer security-related activities as contrary to the ideals of the original and true meaning of the hacker term, that instead related to playful cleverness.\n\n== Ethics and principles ==\n\nMany of the values and tenets of the free and open source software movement stem from the hacker ethics that originated at MIT and at the Homebrew Computer Club. The hacker ethics were chronicled by Steven Levy in Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution and in other texts in which Levy formulates and summarizes general hacker attitudes:\n\nAccess to computers-and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works-should be unlimited and total.\nAll information should be free.\nHackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.\nYou can create art and beauty on a computer.\nComputers can change your life for the better.Hacker ethics are concerned primarily with sharing, openness, collaboration, and engaging in the hands-on imperative.Linus Torvalds, one of the leaders of the open source movement (known primarily for developing the Linux kernel), has noted in the book The Hacker Ethic that these principles have evolved from the known Protestant ethics and incorporates the spirits of capitalism, as introduced in the early 20th century by Max Weber.\nHack value is the notion used by hackers to express that something is worth doing or is interesting. This is something that hackers often feel intuitively about a problem or solution.\nAn aspect of hack value is performing feats for the sake of showing that they can be done, even if others think it is difficult. Using things in a unique way outside their intended purpose is often perceived as having hack value. Examples are using a dot matrix impact printer to produce musical notes, using a flatbed scanner to take ultra-high-resolution photographs or using an optical mouse as barcode reader.\nA solution or feat has \"hack value\" if it is done in a way that has finesse, cleverness or brilliance, which makes creativity an essential part of the meaning. For example, picking a difficult lock has hack value; smashing it does not. As another example, proving Fermat's Last Theorem by linking together most of modern mathematics has hack value; solving a combinatorial problem by exhaustively trying all possibilities does not. Hacking is not using process of elimination to find a solution; it's the process of finding a clever solution to a problem.\n\n== Uses ==\nWhile using hacker to refer to someone who enjoys playful cleverness is most often applied to computer programmers, it is sometimes used for people who apply the same attitude to other fields. For example, Richard Stallman describes the silent composition 4\u203233\u2033 by John Cage and the 14th-century palindromic three-part piece \"Ma Fin Est Mon Commencement\" by Guillaume de Machaut as hacks. According to the Jargon File, the word hacker was used in a similar sense among radio amateurs in the 1950s, predating the software hacking community.\n\n\n*** Programming ***\nThe Boston Globe in 1984 defined \"hackers\" as \"computer nuts\". In their programmer subculture, a hacker is a person who follows a spirit of playful cleverness and loves programming. It is found in an originally academic movement unrelated to computer security and most visibly associated with free software, open source and demoscene. It also has a hacker ethic, based on the idea that writing software and sharing the result on a voluntary basis is a good idea, and that information should be free, but that it's not up to the hacker to make it free by breaking into private computer systems. This hacker ethic was publicized and perhaps originated in Steven Levy's Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution (1984). It contains a codification of its principles.\nThe programmer subculture of hackers disassociates from the mass media's pejorative use of the word 'hacker' referring to computer security, and usually prefer the term 'cracker' for that meaning. Complaints about supposed mainstream misuse started as early as 1983, when media used \"hacker\" to refer to the computer criminals involved in The 414s case.In the programmer subculture of hackers, a computer hacker is a person who enjoys designing software and building programs with a sense for aesthetics and playful cleverness. The term hack in this sense can be traced back to \"describe the elaborate college pranks that...students would regularly devise\" (Levy, 1984 p. 10). To be considered a 'hack' was an honor among like-minded peers as \"to qualify as a hack, the feat must be imbued with innovation, style and technical virtuosity\" (Levy, 1984 p. 10) The MIT Tech Model Railroad Club Dictionary defined hack in 1959 (not yet in a computer context) as \"1) an article or project without constructive end; 2) a project undertaken on bad self-advice; 3) an entropy booster; 4) to produce, or attempt to produce, a hack(3)\", and \"hacker\" was defined as \"one who hacks, or makes them\". Much of TMRC's jargon was later imported into early computing culture, because the club started using a DEC PDP-1 and applied its local model railroad slang in this computing context. Initially incomprehensible to outsiders, the slang also became popular in MIT's computing environments beyond the club. Other examples of jargon imported from the club are 'losing' (\"when a piece of equipment is not working\") and 'munged' (\"when a piece of equipment is ruined\").Others did not always view hackers with approval. MIT living groups in 1989 avoided advertising their sophisticated Project Athena workstations to prospective members because they wanted residents who were interested in people, not computers, with one fraternity member stating that \"We were worried about the hacker subculture\".According to Eric S. Raymond, the Open Source and Free Software hacker subculture developed in the 1960s among 'academic hackers' working on early minicomputers in computer science environments in the United States.\nHackers were influenced by and absorbed many ideas of key technological developments and the people associated with them. Most notable is the technical culture of the pioneers of the ARPANET, starting in 1969. The PDP-10 AI machine at MIT, running the ITS operating system and connected to the ARPANET, provided an early hacker meeting point. After 1980 the subculture coalesced with the culture of Unix. Since the mid-1990s, it has been largely coincident with what is now called the free software and open source movement.\nMany programmers have been labeled \"great hackers\", but the specifics of who that label applies to is a matter of opinion. Certainly major contributors to computer science such as Edsger Dijkstra and Donald Knuth, as well as the inventors of popular software such as Linus Torvalds (Linux), and Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (Unix and C programming language) are likely to be included in any such list; see also List of programmers. People primarily known for their contributions to the consciousness of the programmer subculture of hackers include Richard Stallman, the founder of the free software movement and the GNU project, president of the Free Software Foundation and author of the famous Emacs text editor as well as the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), and Eric S. Raymond, one of the founders of the Open Source Initiative and writer of the famous text The Cathedral and the Bazaar and many other essays, maintainer of the Jargon File (which was previously maintained by Guy L. Steele, Jr.).\nWithin the computer programmer subculture of hackers, the term hacker is also used for a programmer who reaches a goal by employing a series of modifications to extend existing code or resources. In this sense, it can have a negative connotation of using inelegant kludges to accomplish programming tasks that are quick, but ugly, inelegant, difficult to extend, hard to maintain and inefficient. This derogatory form of the noun \"hack\" derives from the everyday English sense \"to cut or shape by or as if by crude or ruthless strokes\" [Merriam-Webster] and is even used among users of the positive sense of \"hacker\" who produces \"cool\" or \"neat\" hacks. In other words, to \"hack\" at an original creation, as if with an axe, is to force-fit it into being usable for a task not intended by the original creator, and a \"hacker\" would be someone who does this habitually. (The original creator and the hacker may be the same person.) This usage is common in both programming, engineering and building. In programming, hacking in this sense appears to be tolerated and seen as a necessary compromise in many situations. Some argue that it should not be, due to this negative meaning; others argue that some kludges can, for all their ugliness and imperfection, still have \"hack value\".\nIn non-software engineering, the culture is less tolerant of unmaintainable solutions, even when intended to be temporary, and describing someone as a \"hacker\" might imply that they lack professionalism. In this sense, the term has no real positive connotations, except for the idea that the hacker is capable of doing modifications that allow a system to work in the short term, and so has some sort of marketable skills. However, there is always the understanding that a more skillful or technical logician could have produced successful modifications that would not be considered a \"hack-job\". The definition is similar to other, non-computer based uses of the term \"hack-job\". For instance, a professional modification of a production sports car into a racing machine would not be considered a hack-job, but a cobbled together backyard mechanic's result could be. Even though the outcome of a race of the two machines could not be assumed, a quick inspection would instantly reveal the difference in the level of professionalism of the designers. The adjective associated with hacker is \"hackish\" (see the Jargon file).\nIn a very universal sense, hacker also means someone who makes things work beyond perceived limits in a clever way in general, without necessarily referring to computers, especially at MIT. That is, people who apply the creative attitude of software hackers in fields other than computing. This includes even activities that predate computer hacking, for example reality hackers or urban spelunkers (exploring undocumented or unauthorized areas in buildings). One specific example is clever pranks traditionally perpetrated by MIT students, with the perpetrator being called hacker. For example, when MIT students surreptitiously put a fake police car atop the dome on MIT's Building 10, that was a hack in this sense, and the students involved were therefore hackers. Other types of hacking are reality hackers, wetware hackers (\"hack your brain\"), and media hackers (\"hack your reputation\"). In a similar vein, a \"hack\" may refer to a math hack, that is, a clever solution to a mathematical problem. All of these uses have spread beyond MIT.\n\n\n*** Home computing enthusiasts ***\n\nIn yet another context, a hacker is a computer hobbyist who pushes the limits of software or hardware. The home computer hacking subculture relates to the hobbyist home computing of the late 1970s, beginning with the availability of MITS Altair. An influential organization was the Homebrew Computer Club. However, its roots go back further to amateur radio enthusiasts. The amateur radio slang referred to creatively tinkering to improve performance as \"hacking\" already in the 1950s.A large overlaps between hobbyist hackers and the programmer subculture hackers existed during the Homebrew Club's days, but the interests and values of both communities somewhat diverged. Today, the hobbyists focus on commercial computer and video games, software cracking and exceptional computer programming (demo scene). Also of interest to some members of this group is the modification of computer hardware and other electronic devices, see modding.\n\nElectronics hobbyists working on machines other than computers also fall into this category. This includes people who do simple modifications to graphing calculators, video game consoles, electronic musical keyboards or other device (see CueCat for a notorious example) to expose or add functionality to a device that was unintended for use by end users by the company who created it. A number of techno musicians have modified 1980s-era Casio SK-1 sampling keyboards to create unusual sounds by doing circuit bending: connecting wires to different leads of the integrated circuit chips. The results of these DIY experiments range from opening up previously inaccessible features that were part of the chip design to producing the strange, dis-harmonic digital tones that became part of the techno music style.\nCompanies take different attitudes towards such practices, ranging from open acceptance (such as Texas Instruments for its graphing calculators and Lego for its Lego Mindstorms robotics gear) to outright hostility (such as Microsoft's attempts to lock out Xbox hackers or the DRM routines on Blu-ray Disc players designed to sabotage compromised players.)\nIn this context, a \"hack\" refers to a program that (sometimes illegally) modifies another program, often a video game, giving the user access to features otherwise inaccessible to them. As an example of this use, for Palm OS users (until the 4th iteration of this operating system), a \"hack\" refers to an extension of the operating system which provides additional functionality. Term also refers to those people who cheat on video games using special software. This can also refer to the jailbreaking of iPhones.\n\n\n*** Hacker artists ***\n\nHacker artists create art by hacking on technology as an artistic medium. This has extended the definition of the term and what it means to be a hacker. Such artists may work with graphics, computer hardware, sculpture, music and other audio, animation, video, software, simulations, mathematics, reactive sensory systems, text, poetry, literature, or any combination thereof.\nDartmouth College musician Larry Polansky states:\n\nTechnology and art are inextricably related. Many musicians, video artists, graphic artists, and even poets who work with technology\u2014whether designing it or using it\u2014consider themselves to be part of the 'hacker community.' Computer artists, like non-art hackers, often find themselves on society's fringes, developing strange, innovative uses of existing technology. There is an empathetic relationship between those, for example, who design experimental music software and hackers who write communications freeware.\nAnother description is offered by Jenny Marketou: \n\nHacker artists operate as culture hackers who manipulate existing techno-semiotic structures towards a different end, to get inside cultural systems on the net and make them do things they were never intended to do.\nA successful software and hardware hacker artist is Mark Lottor (mkl), who has created the 3-D light art projects entitled the Cubatron, and the Big Round Cubatron. This art is made using custom computer technology, with specially designed circuit boards and programming for microprocessor chips to manipulate the LED lights.\n\nDon Hopkins is a software hacker artist well known for his artistic cellular automata. This art, created by a cellular automata computer program, generates objects which randomly bump into each other and in turn create more objects and designs, similar to a lava lamp, except that the parts change color and form through interaction. Hopkins Says: Cellular automata are simple rules that are applied to a grid of cells, or the pixel values of an image. The same rule is applied to every cell, to determine its next state, based on the previous state of that cell and its neighboring cells. There are many interesting cellular automata rules, and they all look very different, with amazing animated dynamic effects. 'Life' is a widely known cellular automata rule, but many other lesser known rules are much more interesting.\nSome hacker artists create art by writing computer code, and others, by developing hardware. Some create with existing software tools such as Adobe Photoshop or GIMP.\nThe creative process of hacker artists can be more abstract than artists using non-technological media. For example, mathematicians have produced visually stunning graphic presentations of fractals, which hackers have further enhanced, often producing detailed and intricate graphics and animations from simple mathematical formulas.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n**** Art ****\n\n\n**** Hacker art mentions ****\n\"Vector in Open Space\" by Gerfried Stocker 1996.\nSwitch|Journal Jun 14 1998.\nEye Weekly \"Tag \u2013 who's it?\" by Ingrid Hein, July 16, 1998.\nLinux Today Archived 2011-07-09 at the Wayback Machine \"Playing the Open Source Game\" by Shawn Hargreaves, Jul 5, 1999.\nCanterbury Christ Church University Library Resources by Subject \u2013 Art & Design, 2001.\nSuperCollider Workshop / Seminar Joel Ryan describes collaboration with hacker artists of Silicon Valley. 21 March 2002\nAnthony Barker's Weblog on Linux, Technology and the Economy \"Why Geeks Love Linux\", Sept 2003.\nLive Art Research Gesture and Response in Field-Based Performance by Sha Xin Wei & Satinder Gill, 2005.\nHackers, Who Are They \"The Hackers Identity\", October 2014.\nRead the text above and answer this question: What is the origin of the term \"hackers\" in the context of computer security?",

      "answer": "The term \"hackers\" in the context of computer security was originally used in the mass media to refer to the computer criminals involved in The 414s case in 1983.",
      "context": "Hacker culture\n\n==Introduction==\nThe hacker culture is a subculture of individuals who enjoy\u2014often in collective effort\u2014the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming the limitations of software systems or electronic hardware (mostly digital electronics), to achieve novel and clever outcomes. The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed hacking. However, the defining characteristic of a hacker is not the activities performed themselves (e.g. programming), but how it is done and whether it is exciting and meaningful. Activities of playful cleverness can be said to have \"hack value\" and therefore the term \"hacks\" came about, with early examples including pranks at MIT done by students to demonstrate their technical aptitude and cleverness. The hacker culture originally emerged in academia in the 1960s around the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) and MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Hacking originally involved entering restricted areas in a clever way without causing any major damage. Some famous hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were placing of a campus police cruiser on the roof of the Great Dome and converting the Great Dome into R2-D2.Richard Stallman explains about hackers who program:\n\nWhat they had in common was mainly love of excellence and programming. They wanted to make their programs that they used be as good as they could. They also wanted to make them do neat things. They wanted to be able to do something in a more exciting way than anyone believed possible and show \"Look how wonderful this is. I bet you didn't believe this could be done.\"\nHackers from this subculture tend to emphatically differentiate themselves from what they pejoratively call \"crackers\"; those who are generally referred to by media and members of the general public using the term \"hacker\", and whose primary focus\u200d\u2014\u200cbe it to malign or for malevolent purposes\u200d\u2014\u200clies in exploiting weaknesses in computer security.\n\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThe Jargon File, an influential but not universally accepted compendium of hacker slang, defines hacker as \"A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and stretching their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.\" The Request for Comments (RFC) 1392, the Internet Users' Glossary, amplifies this meaning as \"A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.\"As documented in the Jargon File, these hackers are disappointed by the mass media and general public's usage of the word hacker to refer to security breakers, calling them \"crackers\" instead. This includes both \"good\" crackers (\"white hat hackers\"), who use their computer security-related skills and knowledge to learn more about how systems and networks work and to help to discover and fix security holes, as well as those more \"evil\" crackers (\"black hat hackers\"), who use the same skills to author harmful software (such as viruses or trojans) and illegally infiltrate secure systems with the intention of doing harm to the system. The programmer subculture of hackers, in contrast to the cracker community, generally sees computer security-related activities as contrary to the ideals of the original and true meaning of the hacker term, that instead related to playful cleverness.\n\n== Ethics and principles ==\n\nMany of the values and tenets of the free and open source software movement stem from the hacker ethics that originated at MIT and at the Homebrew Computer Club. The hacker ethics were chronicled by Steven Levy in Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution and in other texts in which Levy formulates and summarizes general hacker attitudes:\n\nAccess to computers-and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works-should be unlimited and total.\nAll information should be free.\nHackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.\nYou can create art and beauty on a computer.\nComputers can change your life for the better.Hacker ethics are concerned primarily with sharing, openness, collaboration, and engaging in the hands-on imperative.Linus Torvalds, one of the leaders of the open source movement (known primarily for developing the Linux kernel), has noted in the book The Hacker Ethic that these principles have evolved from the known Protestant ethics and incorporates the spirits of capitalism, as introduced in the early 20th century by Max Weber.\nHack value is the notion used by hackers to express that something is worth doing or is interesting. This is something that hackers often feel intuitively about a problem or solution.\nAn aspect of hack value is performing feats for the sake of showing that they can be done, even if others think it is difficult. Using things in a unique way outside their intended purpose is often perceived as having hack value. Examples are using a dot matrix impact printer to produce musical notes, using a flatbed scanner to take ultra-high-resolution photographs or using an optical mouse as barcode reader.\nA solution or feat has \"hack value\" if it is done in a way that has finesse, cleverness or brilliance, which makes creativity an essential part of the meaning. For example, picking a difficult lock has hack value; smashing it does not. As another example, proving Fermat's Last Theorem by linking together most of modern mathematics has hack value; solving a combinatorial problem by exhaustively trying all possibilities does not. Hacking is not using process of elimination to find a solution; it's the process of finding a clever solution to a problem.\n\n== Uses ==\nWhile using hacker to refer to someone who enjoys playful cleverness is most often applied to computer programmers, it is sometimes used for people who apply the same attitude to other fields. For example, Richard Stallman describes the silent composition 4\u203233\u2033 by John Cage and the 14th-century palindromic three-part piece \"Ma Fin Est Mon Commencement\" by Guillaume de Machaut as hacks. According to the Jargon File, the word hacker was used in a similar sense among radio amateurs in the 1950s, predating the software hacking community.\n\n\n*** Programming ***\nThe Boston Globe in 1984 defined \"hackers\" as \"computer nuts\".

    "instruction": "Interlock protocol\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, the interlock protocol, as described by Ron Rivest and Adi Shamir, is a protocol designed to frustrate eavesdropper attack against two parties that use an anonymous key exchange protocol to secure their conversation. A further paper proposed using it as an authentication protocol, which was subsequently broken.\n\n\n\n== Brief history ==\nMost cryptographic protocols rely on the prior establishment of secret or public keys or passwords.  However, the Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange protocol introduced the concept of two parties establishing a secure channel (that is, with at least some desirable security properties) without any such prior agreement.  Unauthenticated Diffie\u2013Hellman, as an anonymous key agreement protocol, has long been known to be subject to man in the middle attack. However, the dream of a \"zipless\" mutually authenticated secure channel remained.\nThe Interlock Protocol was described as a method to expose a middle-man who might try to compromise two parties that use anonymous key agreement to secure their conversation.\n\n== How it works ==\nThe Interlock protocol works roughly as follows:                                                                                                     \n\nAlice encrypts her message with Bob's key, then sends half her encrypted message to Bob.\nBob encrypts his message with Alice's key and sends half of his encrypted message to Alice.\nAlice then sends the other half of her message to Bob, who sends the other half of his.The strength of the protocol lies in the fact that half of an encrypted message cannot be decrypted. Thus, if Mallory begins her attack and intercepts Bob and Alice's keys, Mallory will be unable to decrypt Alice's half-message (encrypted using her key) and re-encrypt it using Bob's key. She must wait until both halves of the message have been received to read it, and can only succeed in duping one of the parties if she composes a completely new message.\n\n== The Bellovin/Merritt Attack ==\nDavies and Price proposed the use of the Interlock Protocol for authentication in a book titled Security for Computer Networks. But an attack on this was described by Steven M. Bellovin & Michael Merritt. A subsequent refinement was proposed by Ellison.The Bellovin/Merritt attack entails composing a fake message to send to the first party. Passwords may be sent using the Interlock Protocol between A and B as follows:\n\n A               B\nEa,b(Pa)<1>------->\n<-------Ea,b(Pb)<1>\nEa,b(Pa)<2>------->\n<-------Ea,b(Pb)<2>\n\nwhere Ea,b(M) is message M encrypted with the key derived from the Diffie\u2013Hellman exchange between A and B, <1>/<2> denote first and second halves, and Pa/Pb are the passwords of A and B.\nAn attacker, Z, could send half of a bogus message\u2014P?--to elicit Pa from A:\n\nA                Z                B\nEa,z(Pa)<1>------>\n<------Ea,z(P?)<1>\nEa,z(Pa)<2>------>\n                 Ez,b(Pa)<1>------>\n                 <------Ez,b(Pb)<1>\n                 Ez,b(Pa)<2>------>\n                 <------Ez,b(Pb)<2>\n\nAt this point, Z has compromised both Pa and Pb. The attack can be defeated by verifying the passwords in parts, so that when Ea,z(P?)<1> is sent, it is known to be invalid and Ea,z(Pa)<2> is never sent (suggested by Davies). However, this does not work when the passwords are hashed, since half of a hash is useless, according to Bellovin. There are also several other methods proposed in, including using a shared secret in addition to the password. The forced-latency enhancement can also prevent certain attacks.\n\n== Forced-Latency Interlock Protocol ==\nA modified Interlock Protocol can require B (the server) to delay all responses for a known duration:\n\nA              B\nKa------------->\n<-------------Kb\nEa,b(Ma)<1>---->\n<----Ea,b(Mb)<1> (B delays response a fixed time, T)\nEa,b(Ma)<2>---->\n<----Ea,b(Mb)<2> (delay again)\n<----------data\n\nWhere \"data\" is the encrypted data that immediately follows the Interlock Protocol exchange (it could be anything), encoded using an all-or-nothing transform to prevent in-transit modification of the message.  Ma<1> could contain an encrypted request and a copy of Ka.  Ma<2> could contain the decryption key for Ma<1>.  Mb<1> could contain an encrypted copy of Kb, and Mb<2> could contain the decryption key for Mb<1> and the response, such as OK, or NOT FOUND, and the hash digest of the data.\nMITM can be attempted using the attack described in the Bellovin paper (Z being the man-in-the-middle):\n\nA              Z               B\nKa------------->Kz------------->\n<---------------Kz<-----------Kb\nEa,z(Ma)<1>---->\n<----Ea,z(Mz)<1>                 (delayed response)\nEa,z(Ma)<2>---->\n               Ez,b(Ma)<1>----->\n               <-----Ez,b(Mb)<1> (delayed response)\n<----Ea,z(Mz)<2>\n               Ez,b(Ma)<2>----->\n               <-----Ez,b(Mb)<2> (delayed response)\n               <------------data\n<----------data\n\nIn this case, A receives the data approximately after 3*T, since Z has to perform the interlocking exchange with B. Hence, the attempted MITM attack can be detected and the session aborted.\nOf course, Z could choose to not perform the Interlock Protocol with B (opting to instead send his own Mb) but then the session would be between A and Z, not A, Z, and B: Z wouldn't be in the middle. For this reason, the interlock protocol cannot be effectively used to provide authentication, although it can ensure that no third party can modify the messages in transit without detection.\nQ: What is the dream of a \"zipless\" mutually authenticated secure channel?",

    "instruction": "Genode\n\n==Introduction==\nGenode is a free and open-source software operating system (OS) framework consisting of a microkernel abstraction layer and a set of user space components. The framework is notable as one of the few open-source operating systems not derived from a proprietary OS, such as Unix. The characteristic design philosophy is that a small trusted computing base is of primary concern in a security-oriented OS.\nGenode can be used as a basis for a desktop computer or tablet OS or as a virtual machine monitor for guest operating systems. The framework has been used as a trusted component of secure virtualization systems for both x86 and ARM.The small codebase of Genode makes it a flexible alternative to more complex Unix-derived operating systems. For this reason the framework has been used as a base system for research in such fields as virtualization, inter-process communication, IP stack isolation, monitoring, and software development.\n\n== Architectural features ==\nGenode builds on the general philosophy of microkernels: the smaller and simpler the code, the easier it is to verify for trustworthiness and correctness. Genode extends this philosophy to user space by composing complex applications from small components. Each component exists in a strict hierarchy of parent-child relationships. Any component acting as a parent may apply resource and inter-process communication (IPC) access policies to its children. This hierarchical system layout yields intuitive partitioning and privilege deescalation as specialized subsystems are nested within more general subsystems, mitigating the confused deputy problem endemic to centralized or superuser system policy.\nThe framework is designed to be hosted by microkernels, however the features of any given microkernel fall mostly within a common set, and monolithic kernels implement a superset of those features. Abstracting these features allows Genode to act as user space for a variety of L4 microkernels, and Linux.\n\n== Criticism ==\n\n\n*** C++ ***\nGenode is often criticized for the choice of its implementation language, C++ (a few other operating systems implemented in C++ include BeOS, Fuchsia, Ghost, Haiku, IncludeOS, OSv, Palm OS, ReactOS, Syllable, and Symbian). This critique usually asserts that C++ is a poor choice for implementing system libraries and APIs because of the inherent complexity of C++ and the difficulty in analyzing code for correct behavior. While Genode does make use of multiple inheritance and templates in its system library, the use of the C++ Standard Library is not allowed and language features that rely on implicit global state, such as thread-local storage and the global allocator, have been removed from the language runtime. Comprehensive static analysis of C++ is not possible. However, the Genode project publishes unit tests for empirical analysis.\n\n\n*** XML ***\nGenode components consume and publish state using structured data serialized in XML, in contrast to the plain text model of Unix derivatives. The Genode framework makes use of XML in effectively all of its components because XML is easily parsed and generated programmatically while still being possible to understand and edit manually.\n\n\n*** Local namespacing ***\nGenode lacks any practical global namespace; there is no global file system or registry of processes or IPC endpoints. This is in contrast to systems such as Unix which feature a ubiquitous file system and allow a superuser context to arbitrarily manage any process within the system. Explicitly declaring the permissions and routing of components may be perceived as labor-intensive relative to Unix. However, compartmentalizing administration allows subsystems to be managed by mutually untrusted system administrators on the same machine without resorting to virtualizing, a common isolation method.\n\n== Sculpt ==\nThe Genode project publishes a desktop operating system named Sculpt that targets contemporary consumer laptops. Sculpt is a small base system with automatic device detection and configuration, some GUI control interfaces, and frontends to the Genode package manager. The system does not feature a full desktop environment, but requires users to deploy virtual machines hosting traditional OSes for a fully featured desktop.

    "instruction": "Context: Thunderspy\n\n==Introduction==\nThunderspy is a type of security vulnerability, based on the Intel Thunderbolt port, first reported publicly on 10 May 2020, that can result in an evil maid (ie, attacker of an unattended device) attack gaining full access to a computer's information in about five minutes, and may affect millions of Apple, Linux and Windows computers, as well as any computers manufactured before 2019, and some after that. According to Bj\u00f6rn Ruytenberg, the discoverer of the vulnerability, \"All the evil maid needs to do is unscrew the backplate, attach a device momentarily, reprogram the firmware, reattach the backplate, and the evil maid gets full access to the laptop. All of this can be done in under five minutes.\"\n\n\n\n== Impact ==\nThe security vulnerability affects millions of Apple, Linux and Windows computers, as well as all computers manufactured before 2019, and some after that. However, this impact is restricted mainly to how precise a bad actor would have to be to execute the attack. Physical access to a machine with a vulnerable Thunderbolt controller is necessary, as well as a writable ROM chip for the Thunderbolt controller's firmware. Additionally, part of Thunderspy, specifically the portion involving re-writing the firmware of the controller, requires the device to be in sleep, or at least in some sort of powered-on state, to be effective. Machines that force power-off when the case is open may assist in resisting this attack to the extent that the feature (switch) itself resists tampering.\nDue to the nature of attacks that require extended physical access to hardware, it's unlikely the attack will affect users outside of a business or government environment.\n\n== Mitigation ==\nThe researchers claim there is no easy software solution, and may only be mitigated by disabling the Thunderbolt port altogether. However, the impacts of this attack (reading kernel level memory without the machine needing to be powered off) are largely mitigated by anti-intrusion features provided by many business machines. Intel claims enabling such features would substantially restrict the effectiveness of the attack. Microsoft's official security recommendations recommend disabling sleep mode while using BitLocker. Using hibernation in place of sleep mode turns the device off, mitigating potential risks of attack on encrypted data.\nAnswer this question: Can Thunderspy affect users outside of a business or government environment?",

    "instruction": "Context: Vault 7\n\n==Introduction==\nVault 7 is a series of documents that WikiLeaks began to publish on 7 March 2017, detailing the activities and capabilities of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare. The files, dating from 2013 to 2016, include details on the agency's software capabilities, such as the ability to compromise cars, smart TVs, web browsers (including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera), and the operating systems of most smartphones (including Apple's iOS and Google's Android), as well as other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. A CIA internal audit identified 91 malware tools out of more than 500 tools in use in 2016 being compromised by the release. The tools were developed by the Operations Support Branch of the C.I.A.The release of Vault 7 led the CIA to redefine WikiLeaks as a \u201cnon-state hostile intelligence service.\u201d In July 2022 former CIA software engineer Joshua Schulte was convicted of leaking the documents to WikiLeaks.\n\n== Publications ==\n\n\n*** Part 1 \u2013 \"Year Zero\" ***\nThe first batch of documents named \"Year Zero\" was published by WikiLeaks on 7 March 2017, consisting of 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments, purportedly from the Center for Cyber Intelligence, which contained more pages than former NSA contractor and leaker, Edward Snowden's NSA release at the time. WikiLeaks had released Year Zero online in a locked archive earlier that week, and revealing the passphrase on the 7th. The passphrase referred to a President Kennedy quote that he wanted \u201cto splinter the CIA in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds\u201d.WikiLeaks did not name the source, but said that the files had \"circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.\" According to WikiLeaks, the source \"wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons\" since these tools raise questions that \"urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the C.I.A.'s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency.\"WikiLeaks attempted to redact names and other identifying information from the documents before their release, but faced criticism for leaving some key details unredacted. WikiLeaks also attempted to allow for connections between people to be drawn via unique identifiers generated by WikiLeaks. It also said that it would postpone releasing the source code for the cyber weapons, which is reportedly several hundred million lines long, \"until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the C.I.A.'s program and how such 'weapons' should be analyzed, disarmed and published.\" WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange claimed this was only part of a larger series.The CIA released a statement saying, \"The American public should be deeply troubled by any WikiLeaks disclosure designed to damage the Intelligence Community's ability to protect America against terrorists or other adversaries. Such disclosures not only jeopardize US personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm.\"In a statement issued on 19 March 2017, Assange said the technology companies who had been contacted had not agreed to, disagreed with, or questioned what he termed as WikiLeaks' standard industry disclosure plan. The standard disclosure time for a vulnerability is 90 days after the company responsible for patching the software is given full details of the flaw. According to WikiLeaks, only Mozilla had been provided with information on the vulnerabilities, while \"Google and some other companies\" only confirmed receiving the initial notification. WikiLeaks stated: \"Most of these lagging companies have conflicts of interest due to their classified work with US government agencies. In practice such associations limit industry staff with US security clearances from fixing holes based on leaked information from the CIA. Should such companies choose to not secure their users against CIA or NSA attacks users may prefer organizations such as Mozilla or European companies that prioritize their users over government contracts\".\n\n\n*** Part 2 \u2013 \"Dark Matter\" ***\nOn 23 March 2017 WikiLeaks published the second release of Vault 7 material, entitled \"Dark Matter\". The publication included documentation for several CIA efforts to hack Apple's iPhones and Macs. These included the Sonic Screwdriver malware that could use the Thunderbolt interface to bypass Apple's password firmware protection.\n\n\n*** Part 3 \u2013 \"Marble\" ***\nOn 31 March 2017, WikiLeaks published the third part of its Vault 7 documents, entitled \"Marble\". It contained 676 source code files for the CIA's Marble Framework. It is used to obfuscate, or scramble, malware code in an attempt to make it so that anti-virus firms or investigators cannot understand the code or attribute its source. According to WikiLeaks, the code also included a de-obfuscator to reverse the obfuscation effects.\n\n\n*** Part 4 \u2013 \"Grasshopper\" ***\nOn 7 April 2017, WikiLeaks published the fourth set of its Vault 7 documents, dubbed \"Grasshopper\". The publication contains 27 documents from the CIA's Grasshopper framework, which is used by the CIA to build customized and persistent malware payloads for the Microsoft Windows operating systems. Grasshopper focused on Personal Security Product (PSP) avoidance. PSPs are antivirus software such as MS Security Essentials, Symantec Endpoint or Kaspersky IS.\n\n\n*** Part 5 \u2013 \"HIVE\" ***\nOn 14 April 2017, WikiLeaks published the fifth part of its Vault 7 documents, titled \"HIVE\". Based on the CIA top-secret virus program created by its \"Embedded Development Branch\" (EDB). The six documents published by WikiLeaks are related to the HIVE multi-platform CIA malware suite. A CIA back-end infrastructure with a public-facing HTTPS interface used by CIA to transfer information from target desktop computers and smartphones to the CIA, and open those devices to receive further commands from CIA operators to execute specific tasks, all the while hiding its presence behind unsuspicious-looking public domains through a masking interface known as \"Switchblade\" (also known as Listening Post (LP) and Command and Control (C2)).\n\n\n*** Part 6 \u2013 \"Weeping Angel\" ***\nOn 21 April 2017, WikiLeaks published the sixth part of its Vault 7 material, code-named \"Weeping Angel\", a hacking tool co-developed by the CIA and MI5 used to exploit a series of early smart TVs for the purpose of covert intelligence gathering. Once installed in suitable televisions with a USB stick, the hacking tool enables those televisions' built-in microphones and possibly video cameras to record their surroundings, while the televisions falsely appear to be turned off. The recorded data is then either stored locally into the television's memory or sent over the internet to the CIA. Allegedly both the CIA and MI5 agencies collaborated to develop that malware in Joint Development Workshops. Security expert Sarah Zatko said about the data \"nothing in this suggests it would be used for mass surveillance,\" and Consumer Reports said that only some of the earliest smart TVs with built-in microphones and cameras were effected.As of this part 6 publication, \"Weeping Angel\" is the second major CIA hacking tool which notably references the British television show, Doctor Who, alongside \"Sonic Screwdriver\" in \"Dark Matter\".\n\n\n*** Part 7 \u2013 \"Scribbles\" ***\nOn 28 April 2017, WikiLeaks published the seventh part of its Vault 7 materials, dubbed \"Scribbles\". The leak includes documentation and source code of a tool intended to track documents leaked to whistleblowers and journalists by embedding web beacon tags into classified documents to trace who leaked them. The tool affects Microsoft Office documents, specifically \"Microsoft Office 2013 (on Windows 8.1 x64), documents from Office versions 97-2016 (Office 95 documents will not work) and documents that are not locked, encrypted, or password-protected\". When a CIA watermarked document is opened, an invisible image within the document that is hosted on the agency's server is loaded, generating a HTTP request. The request is then logged on the server, giving the intelligence agency information about who is opening it and where it is being opened. However, if a watermarked document is opened in an alternative word processor the image may be visible to the viewer. The documentation also states that if the document is viewed offline or in protected view, the watermarked image will not be able to contact its home server. This is overridden only when a user enables editing.\n\n\n*** Part 8 \u2013 \"Archimedes\" ***\nOn 5 May 2017, WikiLeaks published the eighth part of its Vault 7 documents, titled \"Archimedes\". According to U.S. SANS Institute instructor Jake Williams, who analyzed the published documents, Archimedes is a virus previously codenamed \"Fulcrum\". According to cyber security expert and ENISA member Pierluigi Paganini, the CIA operators use Archimedes to redirect local area network (LAN) web browser sessions from a targeted computer through a computer controlled by the CIA before the sessions are routed to the users. This type of attack is known as man-in-the-middle (MitM). With their publication WikiLeaks included a number of hashes that they claim can be used to potentially identify the Archimedes virus and guard against it in the future. Paganini stated that potential targeted computers can search for those hashes on their systems to check if their systems had been attacked by the CIA.\n\n\n*** Part 9 \u2013 \"AfterMidnight\" and \"Assassin\" ***\nOn 12 May 2017, WikiLeaks published part nine of its Vault 7 materials, \"AfterMidnight\" and \"Assassin\". AfterMidnight is a malware installed on a target personal computer and disguises as a DLL file, which is executed while the user's computer reboots. It then triggers a connection to the CIA's Command and Control (C2) computer, from which it downloads various modules to run. As for Assassin, it is very similar to its AfterMidnight counterpart, but deceptively runs inside a Windows service process. CIA operators reportedly use Assassin as a C2 to execute a series of tasks, collect, and then periodically send user data to the CIA Listening Post(s) (LP). Similar to backdoor Trojan behavior. Both AfterMidnight and Assassin run on Windows operating system, are persistent, and periodically beacon to their configured LP to either request tasks or send private information to the CIA, as well as automatically uninstall themselves on a set date and time.\n\n\n*** Part 10 \u2013 \"Athena\" ***\nOn 19 May 2017, WikiLeaks published the tenth part of its Vault 7 documents, titled \"Athena\". The published user guide, demo, and related documents were created between September 2015 and February 2016. They are all about a malware allegedly developed for the CIA in August 2015, roughly one month after Microsoft released Windows 10 with their firm statements about how difficult it was to compromise. Both the primary \"Athena\" malware and its secondary malware named \"Hera\" are similar in theory to Grasshopper and AfterMidnight malware but with some significant differences. One of those differences is that Athena and Hera were developed by the CIA with a New Hampshire private corporation called Siege Technologies. During a Bloomberg 2014 interview the founder of Siege Technologies confirmed and justified their development of such malware. Athena malware completely hijacks Windows' Remote Access services, while Hera hijacks Windows Dnscache service. Both Athena and Hera also affect all current versions of Windows including, but not limited to, Windows Server 2012 and Windows 10. Another difference is in the types of encryption used between the infected computers and the CIA Listening Posts (LP). As for the similarities, they exploit persistent DLL files to create a backdoor to communicate with CIA's LP, steal private data, then send it to CIA servers, or delete private data on the target computer, as well as Command and Control (C2) for CIA operatives to send additional malicious software to further run specific tasks on the attacked computer. All of the above designed to deceive computer security software. Beside the published detailed documents, WikiLeaks did not provide any evidence suggesting the CIA used Athena or not.\n\n\n*** Part 11 \u2013 \"Pandemic\" ***\nOn 1 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 11 of its Vault 7 materials, \"Pandemic\". This tool serves as a persistent implant affecting Windows machines with shared folders. It functions as a file system filter driver on an infected computer, and listens for Server Message Block traffic while detecting download attempts from other computers on a local network. \"Pandemic\" will answer a download request on behalf of the infected computer. However, it will replace the legitimate file with malware. In order to obfuscate its activities, \"Pandemic\" only modifies or replaces the legitimate file in transit, leaving the original on the server unchanged. The implant allows 20 files to be modified at a time, with a maximum individual file size of 800MB. While not stated in the leaked documentation, it is possible that newly infected computers could themselves become \"Pandemic\" file servers, allowing the implant to reach new targets on a local network.\n\n\n*** Part 12 \u2013 \"Cherry Blossom\" ***\nOn 15 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 12 of its Vault 7 materials, entitled \"Cherry Blossom\". Cherry Blossom used a command and control server called Cherry Tree and custom router firmware called FlyTrap to monitor internet activity of targets, scan for \u201cemail addresses, chat usernames, MAC addresses and VoIP numbers\" and redirect traffic.\n\n\n*** Part 13 \u2013 \"Brutal Kangaroo\" ***\nOn 22 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 13 of its Vault 7 materials, the manuals for \"Brutal Kangaroo\". Brutal Kangaroo was a project focused on CIA malware designed to compromise air-gapped computer networks with infected USB drives. Brutal Kangaroo included the tools Drifting Deadline, the main tool, Shattered Assurance, a server that automates thumb drive infection, Shadow, a tool to coordinate compromised machines, and Broken Promise, a tool for exfiltrating data from the air-gapped networks.\n\n\n*** Part 14 \u2013 \"Elsa\" ***\nOn 28 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 14 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project entitled \"Elsa\". Elsa was a tool used for tracking Windows devices on nearby WiFi networks.\n\n\n*** Part 15 \u2013 \"OutlawCountry\" ***\nOn 29 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 15 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project entitled \"OutlawCountry\". OutlawCountry was a kernel module for Linux 2.6 that let CIA agents spy on Linux servers and redirect outgoing traffic from a Linux computer to a chosen site.\n\n\n*** Part 16 \u2013 \"BothanSpy\" ***\nOn 6 July 2017, WikiLeaks published part 16 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project entitled \"BothanSpy\". BothanSpy was a CIA hacking tool made to steal SSH credentials from Windows computers.\n\n\n*** Part 17 \u2013 \"Highrise\" ***\nOn 13 July 2017, WikiLeaks published part 17 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project entitled \"Highrise\". The Highrise hacking tool, also known as Tidecheck, was used to intercept and redirect SMS messages to Android phones using versions 4.0 through 4.3. Highrise could also be used as an encrypted communications channel between CIA agents and supervisors.\n\n\n*** Part 18 \u2013 \"UCL / Raytheon\" ***\nOn 19 July 2017, WikiLeaks published part 18 of the Vault 7 materials, documents from Raytheon Blackbird Technologies for the \"UMBRAGE Component Library\" (UCL) project reports on malware and their attack vectors. According to WikiLeaks, it analysed malware attacks in the wild and gave \"recommendations to the CIA development teams for further investigation and PoC development for their own malware projects.\" It mostly contained Proof-of-Concept ideas partly based on public documents.\n\n\n*** Part 19 \u2013 \"Imperial\" ***\nOn 27 July 2017, WikiLeaks published part 19 of its Vault 7 materials, manuals for the project entitled \"Imperial\". Imperial included three tools named Achilles, Aeris and SeaPea. Achilles was a tool for turning MacOS DMG install files into trojan malware. Aeris was a malware implant for POSIX systems, and SeaPea was an OS X rootkit.\n\n\n*** Part 20 \u2013 \"Dumbo\" ***\nOn 3 August 2017, WikiLeaks published part 20 of its Vault 7 materials, manuals for the project entitled \"Dumbo\". Dumbo was a tool that the Agency used to disable webcams, microphones, and other surveillance tools over WiFi and bluetooth to allow field agents to perform their missions.\n\n\n*** Part 21 \u2013 \"CouchPotato\" ***\nOn 10 August 2017, WikiLeaks published part 21 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project CouchPotato. CouchPotato was a tool for intercepting and saving remote video streams, which let the CIA tap into other people's surveillance systems.\n\n\n*** Part 22 \u2013 \"ExpressLane\" ***\nOn 24 August 2017, WikiLeaks published part 22 of its Vault 7 materials from the CIA's \"ExpressLane\" project. These documents highlighted one of the cyber operations the CIA conducts against other services it liaises with, including the National Security Agency (NSA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\nExpressLane, a covert information collection tool, was used by the CIA to exfiltrate the biometric data collection systems of services it liaises with. ExpressLane was installed and run under the cover of upgrading the biometric software of liaison services by the CIA's Office of Technical Services (OTS) agents without their knowledge.\n\n\n*** Part 23 \u2013 \"Angelfire\" ***\nOn 31 August 2017, WikiLeaks published part 23 of the Vault 7 documents, the manual for the project Angelfire. Angelfire was a malware framework made to infect computers running Windows XP and Windows 7, made of five parts. Solartime was the malware that modified the boot sector to load Wolfcreek, which was a self-loading driver that loaded other drivers. Keystone was responsible for loading other malware. BadMFS was a covert file system that hid the malware, and Windows Transitory File System was a newer alternative to BadMFS. The manual included a long list of problems with the tools.\n\n\n*** Part 24 \u2013 \"Protego\" ***\nProtego, part 24 of the Vault 7 documents, was published on 7 September 2017. According to WikiLeaks, Protego \"is a PIC-based missile control system that was developed by Raytheon.\"\n\n== Vault 8 ==\nOn 9 November, 2017, WikiLeaks began publishing Vault 8, which it described as \"source code and analysis for CIA software projects including those described in the Vault7 series.\" The stated intention of the Vault 8 publication was to \"enable investigative journalists, forensic experts and the general public to better identify and understand covert CIA infrastructure components.\" The only Vault 8 release has been the source code and development logs for Hive, a covert communications platform for CIA malware. WikiLeaks published the Hive documentation as part of Vault 7 on 14 April 2017.\nIn October 2021, a new backdoor based on the Hive source code was discovered being used \"to collect sensitive information and provide a foothold for subsequent intrusions.\" Researchers called it xdr33 and released a report on it in January 2022. The malware targets an unspecified F5 appliance and allowed hackers to upload and download files. It also allowed network traffic spying and execute commands on the appliance.\n\n== Organization of cyber warfare ==\nWikiLeaks said that the documents came from \"an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI) in Langley, Virginia.\" The documents allowed WikiLeaks to partially determine the structure and organization of the CCI. The CCI reportedly has an entire unit devoted to compromising Apple products.The cybersecurity firm Symantec analyzed Vault 7 documents and found some of the described software closely matched cyberattacks by \"Longhorn,\" which it had monitored since 2014. Symantec had previously suspected that \"Longhorn\" was government-sponsored and had tracked its usage against 40 targets in 16 countries.\n\n\n*** Frankfurt base ***\nThe first portion of the documents made public on 7 March 2017, Vault 7 \"Year Zero\", revealed that a top secret CIA unit used the German city of Frankfurt as the starting point for hacking attacks on Europe, China and the Middle East. According to the documents, the U.S. government uses its Consulate General Office in Frankfurt as a hacker base for cyber operations. WikiLeaks documents reveal the Frankfurt hackers, part of the Center for Cyber Intelligence Europe (CCIE), were given cover identities and diplomatic passports to obfuscate customs officers to gain entry to Germany.The chief Public Prosecutor General of the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe Peter Frank announced on 8 March 2017 that the government was conducting a preliminary investigation to see if it will launch a major probe into the activities being conducted out of the consulate and also more broadly whether people in Germany were being attacked by the CIA. Germany's foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel from the Social Democratic Party responded to the documents of Vault 7 \"Year Zero\" that the CIA used Frankfurt as a base for its digital espionage operations, saying that Germany did not have any information about the cyber attacks.\n\n== UMBRAGE ==\nThe documents reportedly revealed that the agency had amassed a large collection of cyberattack techniques and malware produced by other hackers. This library was reportedly maintained by the CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group, with examples of using these techniques and source code contained in the \"Umbrage Component Library\" git repository. According to WikiLeaks, by recycling the techniques of third-parties through UMBRAGE, the CIA can not only increase its total number of attacks, but can also mislead forensic investigators by disguising these attacks as the work of other groups and nations. Among the techniques borrowed by UMBRAGE was the file wiping implementation used by Shamoon. According to PC World, some of the techniques and code snippets have been used by CIA in its internal projects, whose end result cannot be inferred from the leaks. PC World commented that the practice of planting \"false flags\" to deter attribution was not a new development in cyberattacks: Russian, North Korean and Israeli hacker groups are among those suspected of using false flags.According to a study by Kim Zetter in The Intercept, UMBRAGE was probably much more focused on speeding up development by repurposing existing tools, rather than on planting false flags. Robert Graham, CEO of Errata Security told The Intercept that the source code referenced in the UMBRAGE documents is \"extremely public\", and is likely used by a multitude of groups and state actors. Graham added: \"What we can conclusively say from the evidence in the documents is that they're creating snippets of code for use in other projects and they're reusing methods in code that they find on the internet. ... Elsewhere they talk about obscuring attacks so you can't see where it's coming from, but there's no concrete plan to do a false flag operation. They're not trying to say 'We're going to make this look like Russia'.\"\n\n\n*** False flag conspiracy theories ***\nOn the day the Vault 7 documents were first released, WikiLeaks described UMBRAGE as \"a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation,\" and tweeted, \"CIA steals other groups virus and malware facilitating false flag attacks.\" A conspiracy theory soon emerged alleging that the CIA framed the Russian government for interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections. Conservative commentators such as Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter speculated about this possibility on Twitter, and Rush Limbaugh discussed it on his radio show. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said that Vault 7 showed that \"the CIA could get access to such 'fingerprints' and then use them.\"Cybersecurity writers and experts, such as Ben Buchanan and Kevin Poulsen, were skeptical of those theories. Poulsen said the theories were \"disinformation\" being taken advantage of by Russia and spread by bots. He also wrote, \"The leaked catalog isn't organized by country of origin, and the specific malware used by the Russian DNC hackers is nowhere on the list.\" Robert M. Lee, who founded the cybersecurity firm Dragos, said the \"narrative emerged far too quickly to have been organic.\"\n\n== Marble framework ==\nThe documents describe the Marble framework, a string obfuscator used to hide text fragments in malware from visual inspection. Some outlets reported that foreign languages were used to cover up the source of CIA hacks, but technical analysis refuted the idea. According to WikiLeaks, it reached 1.0 in 2015 and was used by the CIA throughout 2016.In its release, WikiLeaks said \"Marble\" was used to insert foreign language text into the malware to mask viruses, trojans and hacking attacks, making it more difficult for them to be tracked to the CIA and to cause forensic investigators to falsely attribute code to the wrong nation. The source code revealed that Marble had examples in Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and Persian.Analysts called WikiLeaks' description of Marble's main purpose inaccurate, telling The Hill its main purpose was probably to avoid detection by antivirus programs.Marble also contained a deobfuscator tool with which the CIA could reverse text obfuscation.Security researcher Nicholas Weaver from International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley told the Washington Post: \"This appears to be one of the most technically damaging leaks ever done by WikiLeaks, as it seems designed to directly disrupt ongoing CIA operations.\"\n\n== Compromised technology and software ==\n\n\n*** CDs/DVDs ***\nHammerDrill is a CD/DVD collection tool that collects directory walks and files to a configured directory and filename pattern as well as logging CD/DVD insertion and removal events. v2.0 adds a gap jumping capability that injects a trojan into 32-bit executables as they are being burned to disc by Nero. Additionally, v2.0 adds a status, termination and an on-demand collection feature controlled by HammerDrillStatus.dll, HammerDrillKiller.dll and HammerDrillCollector.dll. The logging now also fingerprints discs by hashing the first two blocks of the ISO image, which enables unique identification of multi-sessions discs even as data is added and removed. The log also logs anytime a HammerDrill trojaned binary is seen on a disc.\n\n\n*** Apple products ***\nAfter WikiLeaks released the first installment of Vault 7, \"Year Zero\", Apple stated that \"many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS,\" and that the company will \"continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities.\"On 23 March 2017, WikiLeaks released \"Dark Matter\", the second batch of documents in its Vault 7 series, detailing the hacking techniques and tools all focusing on Apple products developed by the Embedded Development Branch (EDB) of the CIA. The leak also revealed the CIA had been targeting the iPhone since 2008, a year after the device was released. These EDB projects attacked Apple's firmware, meaning that the attack code would persist even if the device was rebooted. The \"Dark Matter\" archive included documents from 2009 and 2013. Apple issued a second statement assuring that based on an \"initial analysis, the alleged iPhone vulnerability affected iPhone 3G only and was fixed in 2009 when iPhone 3GS was released.\" Additionally, a preliminary assessment showed \"the alleged Mac vulnerabilities were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013\".\n\n\n*** Cisco ***\nWikiLeaks said on 19 March 2017 on Twitter that the \"CIA was secretly exploiting\" a vulnerability in a huge range of Cisco router models discovered thanks to the Vault 7 documents. The CIA had learned more than a year ago how to exploit flaws in Cisco's widely used internet switches, which direct electronic traffic, to enable eavesdropping. Cisco quickly reassigned staff from other projects to turn their focus solely on analyzing the attack and to figure out how the CIA hacking worked, so they could help customers patch their systems and prevent criminal hackers or spies from using similar methods.On 20 March, Cisco researchers confirmed that their study of the Vault 7 documents showed the CIA had developed malware which could exploit a flaw found in 318 of Cisco's switch models and alter or take control of the network.Cisco issued a warning on security risks, patches were not available, but Cisco provided mitigation advice.\n\n\n*** Smartphones/tablets ***\nThe electronic tools can reportedly compromise both Apple's iOS and Google's Android operating systems. By adding malware to the Android operating system, the tools could gain access to secure communications made on a device.\n\n\n**** Messaging services ****\nAccording to WikiLeaks, once an Android smartphone is penetrated the agency can collect \"audio and message traffic before encryption is applied\". Some of the agency's software is reportedly able to gain access to messages sent by instant messaging services. This method of accessing messages differs from obtaining access by decrypting an already encrypted message. While the encryption of messengers that offer end-to-end encryption, such as Telegram, WhatsApp and Signal, wasn't reported to be cracked, their encryption can be bypassed by capturing input before their encryption is applied, by methods such as keylogging and recording the touch input from the user. Commentators, among them Snowden and cryptographer and security pundit Bruce Schneier, observed that Wikileaks incorrectly implied that the messaging apps themselves, and their underlying encryption, had been compromised - an implication which was in turn reported for a period by the New York Times and other mainstream outlets.\n\n\n*** Vehicle control systems ***\n\nOne document reportedly showed that the CIA was researching ways to infect vehicle control systems. WikiLeaks stated, \"The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations.\" This statement brought renewed attention to conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Michael Hastings.\n\n\n*** Windows ***\nThe documents refer to a \"Windows FAX DLL injection\" exploit in Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 operating systems. This would allow a user with malicious intents to hide its own malware under the DLL of another application. However, a computer must have already been compromised through another method for the injection to take place.\n\n== Commentary ==\nOn 7 March 2017, Edward Snowden commented on the importance of the release, stating that it reveals the United States Government to be \"developing vulnerabilities in US products\" and \"then intentionally keeping the holes open\", which he considers highly reckless.On 7 March 2017, Nathan White, Senior Legislative Manager at the Internet advocacy group Access Now, writes:\nToday, our digital security has been compromised because the CIA has been stockpiling vulnerabilities rather than working with companies to patch them. The United States is supposed to have a process that helps secure our digital devices and services \u2014 the 'Vulnerabilities Equities Process.' Many of these vulnerabilities could have been responsibly disclosed and patched. This leak proves the inherent digital risk of stockpiling vulnerabilities rather than fixing them.\nOn 8 March 2017, Lee Mathews, a contributor to Forbes, wrote that most of the hacking techniques described in Vault 7 were already known to many cybersecurity experts.On 8 March 2017, some note that the revealed techniques and tools are most likely to be used for more targeted surveillance revealed by Edward Snowden.On 8 April 2017, Ashley Gorski, an American Civil Liberties Union staff attorney called it \"critical\" to understand that \"these vulnerabilities can be exploited not just by our government but by foreign governments and cyber criminals around the world.\" Justin Cappos, professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at New York University asks \"if the government knows of a problem in your phone that bad guys could use to hack your phone and have the ability to spy on you, is that a weakness that they themselves should use for counterterrorism, or for their own spying capabilities, or is it a problem they should fix for everyone?\".On 8 April 2017, Cindy Cohn, executive director of the San Francisco-based international nonprofit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, said: \"If the C.I.A. was walking past your front door and saw that your lock was broken, they should at least tell you and maybe even help you get it fixed.\" \"And worse, they then lost track of the information they had kept from you so that now criminals and hostile foreign governments know about your broken lock.\" Furthermore, she stated that the CIA had \"failed to accurately assess the risk of not disclosing vulnerabilities. Even spy agencies like the CIA have a responsibility to protect the security and privacy of Americans.\" \"The freedom to have a private conversation \u2013 free from the worry that a hostile government, a rogue government agent or a competitor or a criminal are listening \u2013 is central to a free society\". While not as strict as privacy laws in Europe, the Fourth Amendment to the US constitution does guarantee the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.On 12 May 2017 Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith wrote \"This is an emerging pattern in 2017. We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks,\" In other words, Smith expressed concern about the fact that the CIA have stockpiled such computer vulnerabilities, which in turn were stolen from them, as a result the privacy and security of their customers around the world were potentially negatively affected for an extended period.\n\nQuestion: How does the HammerDrill tool collect data from CDs/DVDs?\n\nAnswer:",

      "context": "Vault 7\n\n==Introduction==\nVault 7 is a series of documents that WikiLeaks began to publish on 7 March 2017, detailing the activities and capabilities of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare. The files, dating from 2013 to 2016, include details on the agency's software capabilities, such as the ability to compromise cars, smart TVs, web browsers (including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera), and the operating systems of most smartphones (including Apple's iOS and Google's Android), as well as other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. A CIA internal audit identified 91 malware tools out of more than 500 tools in use in 2016 being compromised by the release. The tools were developed by the Operations Support Branch of the C.I.A.The release of Vault 7 led the CIA to redefine WikiLeaks as a \u201cnon-state hostile intelligence service.\u201d In July 2022 former CIA software engineer Joshua Schulte was convicted of leaking the documents to WikiLeaks.\n\n== Publications ==\n\n\n*** Part 1 \u2013 \"Year Zero\" ***\nThe first batch of documents named \"Year Zero\" was published by WikiLeaks on 7 March 2017, consisting of 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments, purportedly from the Center for Cyber Intelligence, which contained more pages than former NSA contractor and leaker, Edward Snowden's NSA release at the time. WikiLeaks had released Year Zero online in a locked archive earlier that week, and revealing the passphrase on the 7th. The passphrase referred to a President Kennedy quote that he wanted \u201cto splinter the CIA in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds\u201d.WikiLeaks did not name the source, but said that the files had \"circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.\" According to WikiLeaks, the source \"wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons\" since these tools raise questions that \"urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the C.I.A.'s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency.\"WikiLeaks attempted to redact names and other identifying information from the documents before their release, but faced criticism for leaving some key details unredacted. WikiLeaks also attempted to allow for connections between people to be drawn via unique identifiers generated by WikiLeaks. It also said that it would postpone releasing the source code for the cyber weapons, which is reportedly several hundred million lines long, \"until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the C.I.A.'s program and how such 'weapons' should be analyzed, disarmed and published.\" WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange claimed this was only part of a larger series.The CIA released a statement saying, \"The American public should be deeply troubled by any WikiLeaks disclosure designed to damage the Intelligence Community's ability to protect America against terrorists or other adversaries. Such disclosures not only jeopardize US personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm.\"In a statement issued on 19 March 2017, Assange said the technology companies who had been contacted had not agreed to, disagreed with, or questioned what he termed as WikiLeaks' standard industry disclosure plan. The standard disclosure time for a vulnerability is 90 days after the company responsible for patching the software is given full details of the flaw. According to WikiLeaks, only Mozilla had been provided with information on the vulnerabilities, while \"Google and some other companies\" only confirmed receiving the initial notification. WikiLeaks stated: \"Most of these lagging companies have conflicts of interest due to their classified work with US government agencies. In practice such associations limit industry staff with US security clearances from fixing holes based on leaked information from the CIA. Should such companies choose to not secure their users against CIA or NSA attacks users may prefer organizations such as Mozilla or European companies that prioritize their users over government contracts\".\n\n\n*** Part 2 \u2013 \"Dark Matter\" ***\nOn 23 March 2017 WikiLeaks published the second release of Vault 7 material, entitled \"Dark Matter\". The publication included documentation for several CIA efforts to hack Apple's iPhones and Macs. These included the Sonic Screwdriver malware that could use the Thunderbolt interface to bypass Apple's password firmware protection.\n\n\n*** Part 3 \u2013 \"Marble\" ***\nOn 31 March 2017, WikiLeaks published the third part of its Vault 7 documents, entitled \"Marble\". It contained 676 source code files for the CIA's Marble Framework. It is used to obfuscate, or scramble, malware code in an attempt to make it so that anti-virus firms or investigators cannot understand the code or attribute its source. According to WikiLeaks, the code also included a de-obfuscator to reverse the obfuscation effects.\n\n\n*** Part 4 \u2013 \"Grasshopper\" ***\nOn 7 April 2017, WikiLeaks published the fourth set of its Vault 7 documents, dubbed \"Grasshopper\". The publication contains 27 documents from the CIA's Grasshopper framework, which is used by the CIA to build customized and persistent malware payloads for the Microsoft Windows operating systems. Grasshopper focused on Personal Security Product (PSP) avoidance. PSPs are antivirus software such as MS Security Essentials, Symantec Endpoint or Kaspersky IS.\n\n\n*** Part 5 \u2013 \"HIVE\" ***\nOn 14 April 2017, WikiLeaks published the fifth part of its Vault 7 documents, titled \"HIVE\". Based on the CIA top-secret virus program created by its \"Embedded Development Branch\" (EDB). The six documents published by WikiLeaks are related to the HIVE multi-platform CIA malware suite. A CIA back-end infrastructure with a public-facing HTTPS interface used by CIA to transfer information from target desktop computers and smartphones to the CIA, and open those devices to receive further commands from CIA operators to execute specific tasks, all the while hiding its presence behind unsuspicious-looking public domains through a masking interface known as \"Switchblade\" (also known as Listening Post (LP) and Command and Control (C2)).\n\n\n*** Part 6 \u2013 \"Weeping Angel\" ***\nOn 21 April 2017, WikiLeaks published the sixth part of its Vault 7 material, code-named \"Weeping Angel\", a hacking tool co-developed by the CIA and MI5 used to exploit a series of early smart TVs for the purpose of covert intelligence gathering. Once installed in suitable televisions with a USB stick, the hacking tool enables those televisions' built-in microphones and possibly video cameras to record their surroundings, while the televisions falsely appear to be turned off. The recorded data is then either stored locally into the television's memory or sent over the internet to the CIA. Allegedly both the CIA and MI5 agencies collaborated to develop that malware in Joint Development Workshops. Security expert Sarah Zatko said about the data \"nothing in this suggests it would be used for mass surveillance,\" and Consumer Reports said that only some of the earliest smart TVs with built-in microphones and cameras were effected.As of this part 6 publication, \"Weeping Angel\" is the second major CIA hacking tool which notably references the British television show, Doctor Who, alongside \"Sonic Screwdriver\" in \"Dark Matter\".\n\n\n*** Part 7 \u2013 \"Scribbles\" ***\nOn 28 April 2017, WikiLeaks published the seventh part of its Vault 7 materials, dubbed \"Scribbles\". The leak includes documentation and source code of a tool intended to track documents leaked to whistleblowers and journalists by embedding web beacon tags into classified documents to trace who leaked them. The tool affects Microsoft Office documents, specifically \"Microsoft Office 2013 (on Windows 8.1 x64), documents from Office versions 97-2016 (Office 95 documents will not work) and documents that are not locked, encrypted, or password-protected\". When a CIA watermarked document is opened, an invisible image within the document that is hosted on the agency's server is loaded, generating a HTTP request. The request is then logged on the server, giving the intelligence agency information about who is opening it and where it is being opened. However, if a watermarked document is opened in an alternative word processor the image may be visible to the viewer. The documentation also states that if the document is viewed offline or in protected view, the watermarked image will not be able to contact its home server. This is overridden only when a user enables editing.\n\n\n*** Part 8 \u2013 \"Archimedes\" ***\nOn 5 May 2017, WikiLeaks published the eighth part of its Vault 7 documents, titled \"Archimedes\". According to U.S. SANS Institute instructor Jake Williams, who analyzed the published documents, Archimedes is a virus previously codenamed \"Fulcrum\". According to cyber security expert and ENISA member Pierluigi Paganini, the CIA operators use Archimedes to redirect local area network (LAN) web browser sessions from a targeted computer through a computer controlled by the CIA before the sessions are routed to the users. This type of attack is known as man-in-the-middle (MitM). With their publication WikiLeaks included a number of hashes that they claim can be used to potentially identify the Archimedes virus and guard against it in the future. Paganini stated that potential targeted computers can search for those hashes on their systems to check if their systems had been attacked by the CIA.\n\n\n*** Part 9 \u2013 \"AfterMidnight\" and \"Assassin\" ***\nOn 12 May 2017, WikiLeaks published part nine of its Vault 7 materials, \"AfterMidnight\" and \"Assassin\". AfterMidnight is a malware installed on a target personal computer and disguises as a DLL file, which is executed while the user's computer reboots. It then triggers a connection to the CIA's Command and Control (C2) computer, from which it downloads various modules to run. As for Assassin, it is very similar to its AfterMidnight counterpart, but deceptively runs inside a Windows service process. CIA operators reportedly use Assassin as a C2 to execute a series of tasks, collect, and then periodically send user data to the CIA Listening Post(s) (LP). Similar to backdoor Trojan behavior. Both AfterMidnight and Assassin run on Windows operating system, are persistent, and periodically beacon to their configured LP to either request tasks or send private information to the CIA, as well as automatically uninstall themselves on a set date and time.\n\n\n*** Part 10 \u2013 \"Athena\" ***\nOn 19 May 2017, WikiLeaks published the tenth part of its Vault 7 documents, titled \"Athena\". The published user guide, demo, and related documents were created between September 2015 and February 2016. They are all about a malware allegedly developed for the CIA in August 2015, roughly one month after Microsoft released Windows 10 with their firm statements about how difficult it was to compromise. Both the primary \"Athena\" malware and its secondary malware named \"Hera\" are similar in theory to Grasshopper and AfterMidnight malware but with some significant differences. One of those differences is that Athena and Hera were developed by the CIA with a New Hampshire private corporation called Siege Technologies. During a Bloomberg 2014 interview the founder of Siege Technologies confirmed and justified their development of such malware. Athena malware completely hijacks Windows' Remote Access services, while Hera hijacks Windows Dnscache service. Both Athena and Hera also affect all current versions of Windows including, but not limited to, Windows Server 2012 and Windows 10. Another difference is in the types of encryption used between the infected computers and the CIA Listening Posts (LP). As for the similarities, they exploit persistent DLL files to create a backdoor to communicate with CIA's LP, steal private data, then send it to CIA servers, or delete private data on the target computer, as well as Command and Control (C2) for CIA operatives to send additional malicious software to further run specific tasks on the attacked computer. All of the above designed to deceive computer security software. Beside the published detailed documents, WikiLeaks did not provide any evidence suggesting the CIA used Athena or not.\n\n\n*** Part 11 \u2013 \"Pandemic\" ***\nOn 1 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 11 of its Vault 7 materials, \"Pandemic\". This tool serves as a persistent implant affecting Windows machines with shared folders. It functions as a file system filter driver on an infected computer, and listens for Server Message Block traffic while detecting download attempts from other computers on a local network. \"Pandemic\" will answer a download request on behalf of the infected computer. However, it will replace the legitimate file with malware. In order to obfuscate its activities, \"Pandemic\" only modifies or replaces the legitimate file in transit, leaving the original on the server unchanged. The implant allows 20 files to be modified at a time, with a maximum individual file size of 800MB. While not stated in the leaked documentation, it is possible that newly infected computers could themselves become \"Pandemic\" file servers, allowing the implant to reach new targets on a local network.\n\n\n*** Part 12 \u2013 \"Cherry Blossom\" ***\nOn 15 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 12 of its Vault 7 materials, entitled \"Cherry Blossom\". Cherry Blossom used a command and control server called Cherry Tree and custom router firmware called FlyTrap to monitor internet activity of targets, scan for \u201cemail addresses, chat usernames, MAC addresses and VoIP numbers\" and redirect traffic.\n\n\n*** Part 13 \u2013 \"Brutal Kangaroo\" ***\nOn 22 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 13 of its Vault 7 materials, the manuals for \"Brutal Kangaroo\". Brutal Kangaroo was a project focused on CIA malware designed to compromise air-gapped computer networks with infected USB drives. Brutal Kangaroo included the tools Drifting Deadline, the main tool, Shattered Assurance, a server that automates thumb drive infection, Shadow, a tool to coordinate compromised machines, and Broken Promise, a tool for exfiltrating data from the air-gapped networks.\n\n\n*** Part 14 \u2013 \"Elsa\" ***\nOn 28 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 14 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project entitled \"Elsa\". Elsa was a tool used for tracking Windows devices on nearby WiFi networks.\n\n\n*** Part 15 \u2013 \"OutlawCountry\" ***\nOn 29 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 15 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project entitled \"OutlawCountry\". OutlawCountry was a kernel module for Linux 2.6 that let CIA agents spy on Linux servers and redirect outgoing traffic from a Linux computer to a chosen site.\n\n\n*** Part 16 \u2013 \"BothanSpy\" ***\nOn 6 July 2017, WikiLeaks published part 16 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project entitled \"BothanSpy\". BothanSpy was a CIA hacking tool made to steal SSH credentials from Windows computers.\n\n\n*** Part 17 \u2013 \"Highrise\" ***\nOn 13 July 2017, WikiLeaks published part 17 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project entitled \"Highrise\". The Highrise hacking tool, also known as Tidecheck, was used to intercept and redirect SMS messages to Android phones using versions 4.0 through 4.3. Highrise could also be used as an encrypted communications channel between CIA agents and supervisors.\n\n\n*** Part 18 \u2013 \"UCL / Raytheon\" ***\nOn 19 July 2017, WikiLeaks published part 18 of the Vault 7 materials, documents from Raytheon Blackbird Technologies for the \"UMBRAGE Component Library\" (UCL) project reports on malware and their attack vectors. According to WikiLeaks, it analysed malware attacks in the wild and gave \"recommendations to the CIA development teams for further investigation and PoC development for their own malware projects.\" It mostly contained Proof-of-Concept ideas partly based on public documents.\n\n\n*** Part 19 \u2013 \"Imperial\" ***\nOn 27 July 2017, WikiLeaks published part 19 of its Vault 7 materials, manuals for the project entitled \"Imperial\". Imperial included three tools named Achilles, Aeris and SeaPea. Achilles was a tool for turning MacOS DMG install files into trojan malware. Aeris was a malware implant for POSIX systems, and SeaPea was an OS X rootkit.\n\n\n*** Part 20 \u2013 \"Dumbo\" ***\nOn 3 August 2017, WikiLeaks published part 20 of its Vault 7 materials, manuals for the project entitled \"Dumbo\". Dumbo was a tool that the Agency used to disable webcams, microphones, and other surveillance tools over WiFi and bluetooth to allow field agents to perform their missions.\n\n\n*** Part 21 \u2013 \"CouchPotato\" ***\nOn 10 August 2017, WikiLeaks published part 21 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project CouchPotato. CouchPotato was a tool for intercepting and saving remote video streams, which let the CIA tap into other people's surveillance systems.\n\n\n*** Part 22 \u2013 \"ExpressLane\" ***\nOn 24 August 2017, WikiLeaks published part 22 of its Vault 7 materials from the CIA's \"ExpressLane\" project. These documents highlighted one of the cyber operations the CIA conducts against other services it liaises with, including the National Security Agency (NSA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\nExpressLane, a covert information collection tool, was used by the CIA to exfiltrate the biometric data collection systems of services it liaises with. ExpressLane was installed and run under the cover of upgrading the biometric software of liaison services by the CIA's Office of Technical Services (OTS) agents without their knowledge.\n\n\n*** Part 23 \u2013 \"Angelfire\" ***\nOn 31 August 2017, WikiLeaks published part 23 of the Vault 7 documents, the manual for the project Angelfire. Angelfire was a malware framework made to infect computers running Windows XP and Windows 7, made of five parts. Solartime was the malware that modified the boot sector to load Wolfcreek, which was a self-loading driver that loaded other drivers. Keystone was responsible for loading other malware. BadMFS was a covert file system that hid the malware, and Windows Transitory File System was a newer alternative to BadMFS. The manual included a long list of problems with the tools.\n\n\n*** Part 24 \u2013 \"Protego\" ***\nProtego, part 24 of the Vault 7 documents, was published on 7 September 2017. According to WikiLeaks, Protego \"is a PIC-based missile control system that was developed by Raytheon.\"\n\n== Vault 8 ==\nOn 9 November, 2017, WikiLeaks began publishing Vault 8, which it described as \"source code and analysis for CIA software projects including those described in the Vault7 series.\" The stated intention of the Vault 8 publication was to \"enable investigative journalists, forensic experts and the general public to better identify and understand covert CIA infrastructure components.\" The only Vault 8 release has been the source code and development logs for Hive, a covert communications platform for CIA malware. WikiLeaks published the Hive documentation as part of Vault 7 on 14 April 2017.\nIn October 2021, a new backdoor based on the Hive source code was discovered being used \"to collect sensitive information and provide a foothold for subsequent intrusions.\" Researchers called it xdr33 and released a report on it in January 2022. The malware targets an unspecified F5 appliance and allowed hackers to upload and download files. It also allowed network traffic spying and execute commands on the appliance.\n\n== Organization of cyber warfare ==\nWikiLeaks said that the documents came from \"an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI) in Langley, Virginia.\" The documents allowed WikiLeaks to partially determine the structure and organization of the CCI. The CCI reportedly has an entire unit devoted to compromising Apple products.The cybersecurity firm Symantec analyzed Vault 7 documents and found some of the described software closely matched cyberattacks by \"Longhorn,\" which it had monitored since 2014. Symantec had previously suspected that \"Longhorn\" was government-sponsored and had tracked its usage against 40 targets in 16 countries.\n\n\n*** Frankfurt base ***\nThe first portion of the documents made public on 7 March 2017, Vault 7 \"Year Zero\", revealed that a top secret CIA unit used the German city of Frankfurt as the starting point for hacking attacks on Europe, China and the Middle East. According to the documents, the U.S. government uses its Consulate General Office in Frankfurt as a hacker base for cyber operations. WikiLeaks documents reveal the Frankfurt hackers, part of the Center for Cyber Intelligence Europe (CCIE), were given cover identities and diplomatic passports to obfuscate customs officers to gain entry to Germany.The chief Public Prosecutor General of the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe Peter Frank announced on 8 March 2017 that the government was conducting a preliminary investigation to see if it will launch a major probe into the activities being conducted out of the consulate and also more broadly whether people in Germany were being attacked by the CIA. Germany's foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel from the Social Democratic Party responded to the documents of Vault 7 \"Year Zero\" that the CIA used Frankfurt as a base for its digital espionage operations, saying that Germany did not have any information about the cyber attacks.\n\n== UMBRAGE ==\nThe documents reportedly revealed that the agency had amassed a large collection of cyberattack techniques and malware produced by other hackers. This library was reportedly maintained by the CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group, with examples of using these techniques and source code contained in the \"Umbrage Component Library\" git repository. According to WikiLeaks, by recycling the techniques of third-parties through UMBRAGE, the CIA can not only increase its total number of attacks, but can also mislead forensic investigators by disguising these attacks as the work of other groups and nations. Among the techniques borrowed by UMBRAGE was the file wiping implementation used by Shamoon. According to PC World, some of the techniques and code snippets have been used by CIA in its internal projects, whose end result cannot be inferred from the leaks. PC World commented that the practice of planting \"false flags\" to deter attribution was not a new development in cyberattacks: Russian, North Korean and Israeli hacker groups are among those suspected of using false flags.According to a study by Kim Zetter in The Intercept, UMBRAGE was probably much more focused on speeding up development by repurposing existing tools, rather than on planting false flags. Robert Graham, CEO of Errata Security told The Intercept that the source code referenced in the UMBRAGE documents is \"extremely public\", and is likely used by a multitude of groups and state actors. Graham added: \"What we can conclusively say from the evidence in the documents is that they're creating snippets of code for use in other projects and they're reusing methods in code that they find on the internet. ... Elsewhere they talk about obscuring attacks so you can't see where it's coming from, but there's no concrete plan to do a false flag operation. They're not trying to say 'We're going to make this look like Russia'.\"\n\n\n*** False flag conspiracy theories ***\nOn the day the Vault 7 documents were first released, WikiLeaks described UMBRAGE as \"a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation,\" and tweeted, \"CIA steals other groups virus and malware facilitating false flag attacks.\" A conspiracy theory soon emerged alleging that the CIA framed the Russian government for interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections. Conservative commentators such as Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter speculated about this possibility on Twitter, and Rush Limbaugh discussed it on his radio show. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said that Vault 7 showed that \"the CIA could get access to such 'fingerprints' and then use them.\"Cybersecurity writers and experts, such as Ben Buchanan and Kevin Poulsen, were skeptical of those theories. Poulsen said the theories were \"disinformation\" being taken advantage of by Russia and spread by bots. He also wrote, \"The leaked catalog isn't organized by country of origin, and the specific malware used by the Russian DNC hackers is nowhere on the list.\" Robert M. Lee, who founded the cybersecurity firm Dragos, said the \"narrative emerged far too quickly to have been organic.\"\n\n== Marble framework ==\nThe documents describe the Marble framework, a string obfuscator used to hide text fragments in malware from visual inspection. Some outlets reported that foreign languages were used to cover up the source of CIA hacks, but technical analysis refuted the idea. According to WikiLeaks, it reached 1.0 in 2015 and was used by the CIA throughout 2016.In its release, WikiLeaks said \"Marble\" was used to insert foreign language text into the malware to mask viruses, trojans and hacking attacks, making it more difficult for them to be tracked to the CIA and to cause forensic investigators to falsely attribute code to the wrong nation. The source code revealed that Marble had examples in Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and Persian.Analysts called WikiLeaks' description of Marble's main purpose inaccurate, telling The Hill its main purpose was probably to avoid detection by antivirus programs.Marble also contained a deobfuscator tool with which the CIA could reverse text obfuscation.Security researcher Nicholas Weaver from International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley told the Washington Post: \"This appears to be one of the most technically damaging leaks ever done by WikiLeaks, as it seems designed to directly disrupt ongoing CIA operations.\"\n\n== Compromised technology and software ==\n\n\n*** CDs/DVDs ***\nHammerDrill is a CD/DVD collection tool that collects directory walks and files to a configured directory and filename pattern as well as logging CD/DVD insertion and removal events. v2.0 adds a gap jumping capability that injects a trojan into 32-bit executables as they are being burned to disc by Nero. Additionally, v2.0 adds a status, termination and an on-demand collection feature controlled by HammerDrillStatus.dll, HammerDrillKiller.dll and HammerDrillCollector.dll. The logging now also fingerprints discs by hashing the first two blocks of the ISO image, which enables unique identification of multi-sessions discs even as data is added and removed. The log also logs anytime a HammerDrill trojaned binary is seen on a disc.\n\n\n*** Apple products ***\nAfter WikiLeaks released the first installment of Vault 7, \"Year Zero\", Apple stated that \"many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS,\" and that the company will \"continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities.\"On 23 March 2017, WikiLeaks released \"Dark Matter\", the second batch of documents in its Vault 7 series, detailing the hacking techniques and tools all focusing on Apple products developed by the Embedded Development Branch (EDB) of the CIA. The leak also revealed the CIA had been targeting the iPhone since 2008, a year after the device was released. These EDB projects attacked Apple's firmware, meaning that the attack code would persist even if the device was rebooted. The \"Dark Matter\" archive included documents from 2009 and 2013. Apple issued a second statement assuring that based on an \"initial analysis, the alleged iPhone vulnerability affected iPhone 3G only and was fixed in 2009 when iPhone 3GS was released.\" Additionally, a preliminary assessment showed \"the alleged Mac vulnerabilities were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013\".\n\n\n*** Cisco ***\nWikiLeaks said on 19 March 2017 on Twitter that the \"CIA was secretly exploiting\" a vulnerability in a huge range of Cisco router models discovered thanks to the Vault 7 documents. The CIA had learned more than a year ago how to exploit flaws in Cisco's widely used internet switches, which direct electronic traffic, to enable eavesdropping. Cisco quickly reassigned staff from other projects to turn their focus solely on analyzing the attack and to figure out how the CIA hacking worked, so they could help customers patch their systems and prevent criminal hackers or spies from using similar methods.On 20 March, Cisco researchers confirmed that their study of the Vault 7 documents showed the CIA had developed malware which could exploit a flaw found in 318 of Cisco's switch models and alter or take control of the network.Cisco issued a warning on security risks, patches were not available, but Cisco provided mitigation advice.\n\n\n*** Smartphones/tablets ***\nThe electronic tools can reportedly compromise both Apple's iOS and Google's Android operating systems. By adding malware to the Android operating system, the tools could gain access to secure communications made on a device.\n\n\n**** Messaging services ****\nAccording to WikiLeaks, once an Android smartphone is penetrated the agency can collect \"audio and message traffic before encryption is applied\". Some of the agency's software is reportedly able to gain access to messages sent by instant messaging services. This method of accessing messages differs from obtaining access by decrypting an already encrypted message. While the encryption of messengers that offer end-to-end encryption, such as Telegram, WhatsApp and Signal, wasn't reported to be cracked, their encryption can be bypassed by capturing input before their encryption is applied, by methods such as keylogging and recording the touch input from the user. Commentators, among them Snowden and cryptographer and security pundit Bruce Schneier, observed that Wikileaks incorrectly implied that the messaging apps themselves, and their underlying encryption, had been compromised - an implication which was in turn reported for a period by the New York Times and other mainstream outlets.\n\n\n*** Vehicle control systems ***\n\nOne document reportedly showed that the CIA was researching ways to infect vehicle control systems. WikiLeaks stated, \"The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations.\" This statement brought renewed attention to conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Michael Hastings.\n\n\n*** Windows ***\nThe documents refer to a \"Windows FAX DLL injection\" exploit in Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 operating systems. This would allow a user with malicious intents to hide its own malware under the DLL of another application. However, a computer must have already been compromised through another method for the injection to take place.\n\n== Commentary ==\nOn 7 March 2017, Edward Snowden commented on the importance of the release, stating that it reveals the United States Government to be \"developing vulnerabilities in US products\" and \"then intentionally keeping the holes open\", which he considers highly reckless.On 7 March 2017, Nathan White, Senior Legislative Manager at the Internet advocacy group Access Now, writes:\nToday, our digital security has been compromised because the CIA has been stockpiling vulnerabilities rather than working with companies to patch them. The United States is supposed to have a process that helps secure our digital devices and services \u2014 the 'Vulnerabilities Equities Process.' Many of these vulnerabilities could have been responsibly disclosed and patched. This leak proves the inherent digital risk of stockpiling vulnerabilities rather than fixing them.\nOn 8 March 2017, Lee Mathews, a contributor to Forbes, wrote that most of the hacking techniques described in Vault 7 were already known to many cybersecurity experts.On 8 March 2017, some note that the revealed techniques and tools are most likely to be used for more targeted surveillance revealed by Edward Snowden.On 8 April 2017, Ashley Gorski, an American Civil Liberties Union staff attorney called it \"critical\" to understand that \"these vulnerabilities can be exploited not just by our government but by foreign governments and cyber criminals around the world.\" Justin Cappos, professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at New York University asks \"if the government knows of a problem in your phone that bad guys could use to hack your phone and have the ability to spy on you, is that a weakness that they themselves should use for counterterrorism, or for their own spying capabilities, or is it a problem they should fix for everyone?\".On 8 April 2017, Cindy Cohn, executive director of the San Francisco-based international nonprofit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, said: \"If the C.I.A. was walking past your front door and saw that your lock was broken, they should at least tell you and maybe even help you get it fixed.\" \"And worse, they then lost track of the information they had kept from you so that now criminals and hostile foreign governments know about your broken lock.\" Furthermore, she stated that the CIA had \"failed to accurately assess the risk of not disclosing vulnerabilities. Even spy agencies like the CIA have a responsibility to protect the security and privacy of Americans.\" \"The freedom to have a private conversation \u2013 free from the worry that a hostile government, a rogue government agent or a competitor or a criminal are listening \u2013 is central to a free society\". While not as strict as privacy laws in Europe, the Fourth Amendment to the US constitution does guarantee the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.On 12 May 2017 Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith wrote \"This is an emerging pattern in 2017. We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks,\" In other words, Smith expressed concern about the fact that the CIA have stockpiled such computer vulnerabilities, which in turn were stolen from them, as a result the privacy and security of their customers around the world were potentially negatively affected for an extended period."

    "instruction": "Security token\n\n==Introduction==\nA security token is a peripheral device used to gain access to an electronically restricted resource. The token is used in addition to, or in place, of a password. It acts like an electronic key to access something. Examples of security tokens include wireless keycards used to open locked doors, or a banking token used as a digital authenticator for signing in to online banking, or signing a transaction such as a wire transfer.\nSecurity tokens can be used to store information such as passwords, cryptographic keys used to generate digital signatures, or biometric data (such as fingerprints). Some designs incorporate tamper resistant packaging, while others may include small keypads to allow entry of a PIN or a simple button to start a generating routine with some display capability to show a generated key number. Connected tokens utilize a variety of interfaces including USB, near-field communication (NFC), radio-frequency identification (RFID), or Bluetooth. Some tokens have audio capabilities designed for those who are vision-impaired.\n\n== Password types ==\nAll tokens contain some secret information that is used to prove identity. There are four different ways in which this information can be used:\n\nStatic password token\nThe device contains a password which is physically hidden (not visible to the possessor), but which is transmitted for each authentication. This type is vulnerable to replay attacks.Synchronous dynamic password token\nA timer is used to rotate through various combinations produced by a cryptographic algorithm. The token and the authentication server must have synchronized clocks.Asynchronous password token\nA one-time password is generated without the use of a clock, either from a one-time pad or cryptographic algorithm.Challenge\u2013response token\nUsing public key cryptography, it is possible to prove possession of a private key without revealing that key. The authentication server encrypts a challenge (typically a random number, or at least data with some random parts) with a public key; the device proves it possesses a copy of the matching private key by providing the decrypted challenge.Time-synchronized, one-time passwords change constantly at a set time interval; e.g., once per minute. To do this, some sort of synchronization must exist between the client's token and the authentication server. For disconnected tokens, this time-synchronization is done before the token is distributed to the client. Other token types do the synchronization when the token is inserted into an input device. The main problem with time-synchronized tokens is that they can, over time, become unsynchronized. However, some such systems, such as RSA's SecurID, allow the user to re-synchronize the server with the token, sometimes by entering several consecutive passcodes. Most also cannot have replaceable batteries and only last up to 5 years before having to be replaced \u2013 so there is an additional cost.\nAnother type of one-time password uses a complex mathematical algorithm, such as a hash chain, to generate a series of one-time passwords from a secret shared key. Each password is unique, even when previous passwords are known. The open-source OATH algorithm is standardized; other algorithms are covered by US patents. Each password is observably unpredictable and independent of previous ones, whereby an adversary would be unable to guess what the next password may be, even with knowledge of all previous passwords.\n\n== Physical types ==\nTokens can contain chips with functions varying from very simple to very complex, including multiple authentication methods.\nThe simplest security tokens do not need any connection to a computer. The tokens have a physical display; the authenticating user simply enters the displayed number to log in. Other tokens connect to the computer using wireless techniques, such as Bluetooth. These tokens transfer a key sequence to the local client or to a nearby access point.Alternatively, another form of token that has been widely available for many years is a mobile device which communicates using an out-of-band channel (like voice, SMS, or USSD).\nStill other tokens plug into the computer and may require a PIN. Depending on the type of the token, the computer OS will then either read the key from the token and perform a cryptographic operation on it, or ask the token's firmware to perform this operation.A related application is the hardware dongle required by some computer programs to prove ownership of the software. The dongle is placed in an input device and the software accesses the I/O device in question to authorize the use of the software in question.\nCommercial solutions are provided by a variety of vendors, each with their own proprietary (and often patented) implementation of variously used security features. Token designs meeting certain security standards are certified in the United States as compliant with FIPS 140, a federal security standard. Tokens without any kind of certification are sometimes viewed as suspect, as they often do not meet accepted government or industry security standards, have not been put through rigorous testing, and likely cannot provide the same level of cryptographic security as token solutions which have had their designs independently audited by third-party agencies.\n\n\n*** Disconnected tokens ***\n\nDisconnected tokens have neither a physical nor logical connection to the client computer. They typically do not require a special input device, and instead use a built-in screen to display the generated authentication data, which the user enters manually themselves via a keyboard or keypad. Disconnected tokens are the most common type of security token used (usually in combination with a password) in two-factor authentication for online identification.\n\n\n*** Connected tokens ***\nConnected tokens are tokens that must be physically connected to the computer with which the user is authenticating. Tokens in this category automatically transmit the authentication information to the client computer once a physical connection is made, eliminating the need for the user to manually enter the authentication information. However, in order to use a connected token, the appropriate input device must be installed. The most common types of physical tokens are smart cards and USB tokens (also called security keys), which require a smart card reader and a USB port respectively. Increasingly, FIDO2 tokens, supported by the open specification group FIDO Alliance have become popular for consumers with mainstream browser support beginning in 2015 and supported by popular websites and social media sites.Older PC card tokens are made to work primarily with laptops. Type II PC Cards are preferred as a token as they are half as thick as Type III.\nThe audio jack port is a relatively practical method to establish connection between mobile devices, such as iPhone, iPad and Android, and other accessories. The most well known device is called Square, a credit card reader for iOS and Android devices.\nSome use a special purpose interface (e.g. the crypto ignition key deployed by the United States National Security Agency). Tokens can also be used as a photo ID card. Cell phones and PDAs can also serve as security tokens with proper programming.\n\n\n**** Smart cards ****\n\nMany connected tokens use smart card technology. Smart cards can be very cheap (around ten cents) and contain proven security mechanisms (as used by financial institutions, like cash cards). However, computational performance of smart cards is often rather limited because of extreme low power consumption and ultra-thin form-factor requirements.\nSmart-card-based USB tokens which contain a smart card chip inside provide the functionality of both USB tokens and smart cards. They enable a broad range of security solutions and provide the abilities and security of a traditional smart card without requiring a unique input device. From the computer operating system's point of view such a token is a USB-connected smart card reader with one non-removable smart card present.\n\n\n*** Contactless tokens ***\nUnlike connected tokens, contactless tokens form a logical connection to the client computer but do not require a physical connection. The absence of the need for physical contact makes them more convenient than both connected and disconnected tokens. As a result, contactless tokens are a popular choice for keyless entry systems and electronic payment solutions such as Mobil Speedpass, which uses RFID to transmit authentication info from a keychain token. However, there have been various security concerns raised about RFID tokens after researchers at Johns Hopkins University and RSA Laboratories discovered that RFID tags could be easily cracked and cloned.Another downside is that contactless tokens have relatively short battery lives; usually only 5\u20136 years, which is low compared to USB tokens which may last more than 10 years. Some tokens however do allow the batteries to be changed, thus reducing costs.\n\n\n**** Bluetooth tokens ****\nThe Bluetooth Low Energy protocols provide long lasting battery lifecycle of wireless transmission.\n\nThe transmission of inherent Bluetooth identity data is the lowest quality for supporting authentication.\nA bidirectional connection for transactional data interchange serves for the most sophisticated authentication procedures.Although, the automatic transmission power control attempts for radial distance estimates. The escape is available apart from the standardised Bluetooth power control algorithm to provide a calibration on minimally required transmission power.Bluetooth tokens are often combined with a USB token, thus working in both a connected and a disconnected state. Bluetooth authentication works when closer than 32 feet (9.8 meters). When the Bluetooth link is not properly operable, the token may be inserted into a USB input device to function.\nAnother combination is with a smart card to store locally larger amounts of identity data and process information as well. Another is a contactless BLE token that combines secure storage and tokenized release of fingerprint credentials.In the USB mode of operation sign-off requires care for the token while mechanically coupled to the USB plug. The advantage with the Bluetooth mode of operation is the option of combining sign-off with distance metrics. Respective products are in preparation, following the concepts of electronic leash.\n\n\n**** NFC tokens ****\nNear-field communication (NFC) tokens combined with a Bluetooth token may operate in several modes, thus working in both a connected and a disconnected state. NFC authentication works when closer than 1 foot (0.3 meters). The NFC protocol bridges short distances to the reader while the Bluetooth connection serves for data provision with the token to enable authentication. Also when the Bluetooth link is not connected, the token may serve the locally stored authentication information in coarse positioning to the NFC reader and relieves from exact positioning to a connector.\n\n\n*** Single sign-on software tokens ***\nSome types of single sign-on (SSO) solutions, like enterprise single sign-on, use the token to store software that allows for seamless authentication and password filling. As the passwords are stored on the token, users need not remember their passwords and therefore can select more secure passwords, or have more secure passwords assigned. Usually most tokens store a cryptographic hash of the password so that if the token is compromised, the password is still protected.\n\n\n*** Programmable tokens ***\nProgrammable tokens are marketed as \"drop-in\" replacement of mobile applications such as Google Authenticator (miniOTP). They can be used as mobile app replacement, as well as in parallel as a backup.\n\n== Vulnerabilities ==\n\n\n*** Loss and theft ***\nThe simplest vulnerability with any password container is theft or loss of the device. The chances of this happening, or happening unaware, can be reduced with physical security measures such as locks, electronic leash, or body sensor and alarm. Stolen tokens can be made useless by using two factor authentication. Commonly, in order to authenticate, a personal identification number (PIN) must be entered along with the information provided by the token the same time as the output of the token.\n\n\n*** Attacking ***\nAny system which allows users to authenticate via an untrusted network (such as the Internet) is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. In this type of attack, an attacker acts as the \"go-between\" of the user and the legitimate system, soliciting the token output from the legitimate user and then supplying it to the authentication system themselves. Since the token value is mathematically correct, the authentication succeeds and the fraudster is granted access. In 2006, Citibank was the victim of an attack when its hardware-token-equipped business users became the victims of a large Ukrainian-based man-in-the-middle phishing operation.\n\n\n*** Breach of codes ***\nIn 2012, the Prosecco research team at INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt developed an efficient method of extracting the secret key from several PKCS #11 cryptographic devices. These findings were documented in INRIA Technical Report RR-7944, ID hal-00691958, and published at CRYPTO 2012.\n\n== Digital signature ==\nTrusted as a regular hand-written signature, the digital signature must be made with a private key known only to the person authorized to make the signature. Tokens that allow secure on-board generation and storage of private keys enable secure digital signatures, and can also be used for user authentication, as the private key also serves as a proof of the user's identity.\nFor tokens to identify the user, all tokens must have some kind of number that is unique. Not all approaches fully qualify as digital signatures according to some national laws. Tokens with no on-board keyboard or another user interface cannot be used in some signing scenarios, such as confirming a bank transaction based on the bank account number that the funds are to be transferred to.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question.

    "instruction": "Context: One-way compression function\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, a one-way compression function is a function that transforms two fixed-length inputs into a fixed-length output. The transformation is \"one-way\", meaning that it is difficult given a particular output to compute inputs which compress to that output. One-way compression functions are not related to conventional data compression algorithms, which instead can be inverted exactly (lossless compression) or approximately (lossy compression) to the original data.\n\nOne-way compression functions are for instance used in the Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction inside cryptographic hash functions.\nOne-way compression functions are often built from block ciphers.\nSome methods to turn any normal block cipher into a one-way compression function are Davies\u2013Meyer, Matyas\u2013Meyer\u2013Oseas, Miyaguchi\u2013Preneel (single-block-length compression functions) and MDC-2/Meyer\u2013Schilling, MDC-4, Hirose (double-block-length compression functions). These methods are described in detail further down. (MDC-2 is also the name of a hash function patented by IBM.)\n\n\n\n== Compression ==\nA compression function mixes two fixed length inputs and produces a single fixed length output of the same size as one of the inputs. This can also be seen as that the compression function transforms one large fixed-length input into a shorter, fixed-length output.\nFor instance, input A might be 128 bits, input B 128 bits and they are compressed together to a single output of 128 bits. This is equivalent to having a single 256-bit input compressed to a single output of 128 bits.\nSome compression functions do not compress by half, but instead by some other factor. For example, input A might be 256 bits, and input B 128 bits, which are compressed to a single output of 128 bits. That is, a total of 384 input bits are compressed together to 128 output bits.\nThe mixing is done in such a way that full avalanche effect is achieved. That is, every output bit depends on every input bit.\n\n== One-way ==\n\nA one-way function is a function that is easy to compute but hard to invert. A one-way compression function (also called hash function) should have the following properties:\n\nEasy to compute: If you have some input(s), it is easy to calculate the output.\nPreimage-resistance: If an attacker only knows the output it should be infeasible to calculate an input. In other words, given an output \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h}\n  , it should be unfeasible to calculate an input \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m}\n   such that \n  \n    \n      \n        hash\n        \u2061\n        (\n        m\n        )\n\n== The Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction ==\n\nA common use of one-way compression functions is in the Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction inside cryptographic hash functions. Most widely used hash functions, including MD5, SHA-1 (which is deprecated) and SHA-2 use this construction.\nA hash function must be able to process an arbitrary-length message into a fixed-length output. This can be achieved by breaking the input up into a series of equal-sized blocks, and operating on them in sequence using a one-way compression function. The compression function can either be specially designed for hashing or be built from a block cipher. The last block processed should also be length padded, which is crucial to the security of this construction.\nWhen length padding (also called MD-strengthening) is applied, attacks cannot find collisions faster than the birthday paradox (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            n\n            \n              /\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{n/2}}\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   being the block size in bits) if the used function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n   is collision-resistant.

That is, given a plaintext and a ciphertext it is infeasible to find a key that encrypts the plaintext to the ciphertext. But, given a ciphertext and a key a matching plaintext can be found simply by using the block cipher's decryption function. Thus, to turn a block cipher into a one-way compression function some extra operations have to be added.\nSome methods to turn any normal block cipher into a one-way compression function are Davies\u2013Meyer, Matyas\u2013Meyer\u2013Oseas, Miyaguchi\u2013Preneel (single-block-length compression functions) and MDC-2, MDC-4, Hirose (double-block-length compressions functions).\nSingle-block-length compression functions output the same number of bits as processed by the underlying block cipher. Consequently, double-block-length compression functions output twice the number of bits.\nIf a block cipher has a block size of say 128 bits single-block-length methods create a hash function that has the block size of 128 bits and produces a hash of 128 bits. Double-block-length methods make hashes with double the hash size compared to the block size of the block cipher used. So a 128-bit block cipher can be turned into a 256-bit hash function.\nThese methods are then used inside the Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction to build the actual hash function. These methods are described in detail further down.\nUsing a block cipher to build the one-way compression function for a hash function is usually somewhat slower than using a specially designed one-way compression function in the hash function. This is because all known secure constructions do the key scheduling for each block of the message. Black, Cochran and Shrimpton have shown that it is impossible to construct a one-way compression function that makes only one call to a block cipher with a fixed key. In practice reasonable speeds are achieved provided the key scheduling of the selected block cipher is not a too heavy operation.\nBut, in some cases it is easier because a single implementation of a block cipher can be used for both a block cipher and a hash function. It can also save code space in very tiny embedded systems like for instance smart cards or nodes in cars or other machines.\nTherefore, the hash-rate or rate gives a glimpse of the efficiency of a hash function based on a certain compression function. The rate of an iterated hash function outlines the ratio between the number of block cipher operations and the output. More precisely, the rate represents the ratio between the number of processed bits of input \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m}\n  , the output bit-length \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   of the block cipher, and the necessary block cipher operations \n  \n    \n      \n        s\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle s}\n   to produce these \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   output bits. Generally, the usage of fewer block cipher operations results in a better overall performance of the entire hash function, but it also leads to a smaller hash-value which could be undesirable. The rate is expressed by the formula:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n          \n            h\n\n== Davies\u2013Meyer ==\n\nThe Davies\u2013Meyer single-block-length compression function feeds each block of the message (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          m\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m_{i}}\n  ) as the key to a block cipher.

The transformation is \"one-way\", meaning that it is difficult given a particular output to compute inputs which compress to that output. One-way compression functions are not related to conventional data compression algorithms, which instead can be inverted exactly (lossless compression) or approximately (lossy compression) to the original data.\n\nOne-way compression functions are for instance used in the Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction inside cryptographic hash functions.\nOne-way compression functions are often built from block ciphers.\nSome methods to turn any normal block cipher into a one-way compression function are Davies\u2013Meyer, Matyas\u2013Meyer\u2013Oseas, Miyaguchi\u2013Preneel (single-block-length compression functions) and MDC-2/Meyer\u2013Schilling, MDC-4, Hirose (double-block-length compression functions). These methods are described in detail further down. (MDC-2 is also the name of a hash function patented by IBM.)\n\n\n\n== Compression ==\nA compression function mixes two fixed length inputs and produces a single fixed length output of the same size as one of the inputs. This can also be seen as that the compression function transforms one large fixed-length input into a shorter, fixed-length output.\nFor instance, input A might be 128 bits, input B 128 bits and they are compressed together to a single output of 128 bits. This is equivalent to having a single 256-bit input compressed to a single output of 128 bits.\nSome compression functions do not compress by half, but instead by some other factor. For example, input A might be 256 bits, and input B 128 bits, which are compressed to a single output of 128 bits. That is, a total of 384 input bits are compressed together to 128 output bits.\nThe mixing is done in such a way that full avalanche effect is achieved. That is, every output bit depends on every input bit.\n\n== One-way ==\n\nA one-way function is a function that is easy to compute but hard to invert. A one-way compression function (also called hash function) should have the following properties:\n\nEasy to compute: If you have some input(s), it is easy to calculate the output.\nPreimage-resistance: If an attacker only knows the output it should be infeasible to calculate an input. In other words, given an output \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h}\n  , it should be unfeasible to calculate an input \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m}\n   such that \n  \n    \n      \n        hash\n        \u2061\n        (\n        m\n        )\n\n== The Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction ==\n\nA common use of one-way compression functions is in the Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction inside cryptographic hash functions. Most widely used hash functions, including MD5, SHA-1 (which is deprecated) and SHA-2 use this construction.\nA hash function must be able to process an arbitrary-length message into a fixed-length output. This can be achieved by breaking the input up into a series of equal-sized blocks, and operating on them in sequence using a one-way compression function. The compression function can either be specially designed for hashing or be built from a block cipher. The last block processed should also be length padded, which is crucial to the security of this construction.\nWhen length padding (also called MD-strengthening) is applied, attacks cannot find collisions faster than the birthday paradox (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            n\n            \n              /\n            \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{n/2}}\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   being the block size in bits) if the used function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n   is collision-resistant.

That is, given a plaintext and a ciphertext it is infeasible to find a key that encrypts the plaintext to the ciphertext. But, given a ciphertext and a key a matching plaintext can be found simply by using the block cipher's decryption function. Thus, to turn a block cipher into a one-way compression function some extra operations have to be added.\nSome methods to turn any normal block cipher into a one-way compression function are Davies\u2013Meyer, Matyas\u2013Meyer\u2013Oseas, Miyaguchi\u2013Preneel (single-block-length compression functions) and MDC-2, MDC-4, Hirose (double-block-length compressions functions).\nSingle-block-length compression functions output the same number of bits as processed by the underlying block cipher. Consequently, double-block-length compression functions output twice the number of bits.\nIf a block cipher has a block size of say 128 bits single-block-length methods create a hash function that has the block size of 128 bits and produces a hash of 128 bits. Double-block-length methods make hashes with double the hash size compared to the block size of the block cipher used. So a 128-bit block cipher can be turned into a 256-bit hash function.\nThese methods are then used inside the Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction to build the actual hash function. These methods are described in detail further down.\nUsing a block cipher to build the one-way compression function for a hash function is usually somewhat slower than using a specially designed one-way compression function in the hash function. This is because all known secure constructions do the key scheduling for each block of the message. Black, Cochran and Shrimpton have shown that it is impossible to construct a one-way compression function that makes only one call to a block cipher with a fixed key. In practice reasonable speeds are achieved provided the key scheduling of the selected block cipher is not a too heavy operation.\nBut, in some cases it is easier because a single implementation of a block cipher can be used for both a block cipher and a hash function. It can also save code space in very tiny embedded systems like for instance smart cards or nodes in cars or other machines.\nTherefore, the hash-rate or rate gives a glimpse of the efficiency of a hash function based on a certain compression function. The rate of an iterated hash function outlines the ratio between the number of block cipher operations and the output. More precisely, the rate represents the ratio between the number of processed bits of input \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m}\n  , the output bit-length \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   of the block cipher, and the necessary block cipher operations \n  \n    \n      \n        s\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle s}\n   to produce these \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   output bits. Generally, the usage of fewer block cipher operations results in a better overall performance of the entire hash function, but it also leads to a smaller hash-value which could be undesirable. The rate is expressed by the formula:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n          \n            h\n\n== Davies\u2013Meyer ==\n\nThe Davies\u2013Meyer single-block-length compression function feeds each block of the message (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          m\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m_{i}}\n  ) as the key to a block cipher.

    "instruction": "Norton 360\n\n==Introduction==\nNorton 360, developed by Gen Digital Inc. (formerly Symantec), is an \u201call-in-one\u201d security suite for the consumer market. Originally released in 2007, it was discontinued in 2014; its features were carried over to its successor, Norton Security.In 2019, Symantec (under former corporate name NortonLifeLock) released a \"NEW Norton 360\", as a product replacement for Norton Security.\n\n== Version history ==\n\n\n*** Project Genesis ***\nSymantec announced Project Genesis on February 7, 2006. Genesis would differ from Symantec's other consumer security products by incorporating file backup and performance optimization tools with antivirus capabilities and a firewall. Phishing protection and real-time heuristics were also planned. Windows Vista compatibility was a major aspect of Genesis. Genesis was slated for release in September. In May 2005, Microsoft announced Windows Live OneCare, a security suite with similar functionalities, slated for release in 2006.\nGenesis was renamed Norton 360 on May 31, 2006. Its feature set was confirmed\u2014it would have the same functionalities as Norton Internet Security\u2014with file backup, performance tools, phishing protection, and real-time heuristics. A public beta test was planned for summer 2006. The final release date was set at the end of 2006. The same day, McAfee announced Falcon, a security suite with similar functionalities as Norton 360 and OneCare. However, those dates were delayed. OneCare was launched in summer 2006 while Falcon entered public beta testing.\nSome viewed Norton 360 as a response to Microsoft's antivirus software, OneCare. However, with the release of OneCare, some saw Symantec as lagging behind its rivals. Mark Bregman, Symantec's vice president, claimed the upcoming Norton 360 was not intended to compete with OneCare, stating \"We somehow left the wrong impression in the market place that there's Windows Live OneCare from Microsoft, there's Falcon from McAfee, and there's nothing from Symantec.\"The first public beta was delivered in November 2006, compatible with Windows XP. A second beta was subsequently released December 20, 2006, adding compatibility for Windows Vista build 6000. After 100,000 people tested the software, Symantec began distribution to retailers in February 2007.\n\n\n*** Version 1.0 ***\n\nVersion 1.0 was released on February 26, 2007. This version was the first Symantec product to use SONAR to detect zero-day viruses. It monitors applications for malicious behavior, taking action as needed. The backup and restore functionality allowed users to back up files online or to a hard drive, CD, or DVD. Performance optimization tools allowed users to clear web browser history and temporary files. A disk defragmenter was bundled as part of the optimization tools. Phishing protection integrates with Internet Explorer, warning users of fraudulent sites.\nIn Windows XP, a 300 megahertz processor, 256 megabytes of RAM, and 300 MB of hard disk space is required. Under Vista, an 800 MHz processor, 512 MB of RAM, and 300 MB of hard disk space is required.\nReviews cited Norton 360's low resource usage, relative to Norton Internet Security 2007, and phishing protection. PC Magazine found the phishing protection feature to be more effective at blocking access to fraudulent sites than Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 2. However, reviewers highlighted the lack of manual control for advanced users. CNET noted the lack of phishing protection for browsers other than Internet Explorer, such as Mozilla Firefox. CNET also highlighted the lack of wireless network tools, such as notifying users when someone uninvited joins the network or help encrypting wireless signals. PC Magazine criticized the antispam filter of Version 1.0, finding it blocked only half of the spam mail, and with five percent false positive rate.\n\n\n*** Version 2.0 ***\nVersion 2.0 was released March 3, 2008. The backup feature can now inscribe data to Blu-ray and HD DVD discs. Multiple installations of Norton 360 can also be managed from a centralized location. When backing up files online, the user can control the amount of bandwidth Norton uses. A registry cleaner is bundled with the performance tools, allowing the user to remove invalid entries. Phishing protection for Firefox was added. Supplementing the phishing protection is the Norton Identity Safe, which stores login credentials to websites. A network map allows users to view the status of other Norton installations on networked computers and view basic information about each computer. System requirements remain the same as version 1.0.\nPC Magazine found the spam filter to be inaccurate, with a 25 percent false positive rate. CNET encountered problems when installing version 2.0 on legacy machines.\n\n\n*** Version 3.0 ***\n\nVersion 3.0 was released on March 4, 2009. This version uses the same codebase as Norton Internet Security 2009. For earlier versions, Symantec rewrote code specifically for Norton 360.Version 3.0 incorporates Norton Safe Web, offered as a standalone service earlier. Safe Web integrates with Firefox and Internet Explorer as a toolbar, blocking access to fraudulent and malware hosting sites. This toolbar also includes a search box, routing search queries typed in the box through the Ask.com search engine. The toolbar does not share code with the Ask.com toolbar, which was classified as spyware by McAfee, Trend Micro, and other antivirus vendors. Due to criticism of the search functionality, Symantec announced the Ask.com search box would be hidden in future releases of version 3.0.The capability to back up files to a flash drive was introduced in this release. Files stored on a flash drive can be copied to another computer without Norton 360 installed. Norton also creates a virtual drive in Windows Explorer, allowing users to browse their backup files, stored locally or online. Users can restore individual files using the drag-and-drop technique. Version 3.0 does not retain previous versions of files and skips files which are open by another program. A startup application manager was included in this release, allowing users to control which programs start at login. To complement the application manager, Norton can measure the impact programs have on login time.PC Magazine highlighted version 3.0's inaccurate spam filter, misfiling half of valid mail as spam. PC Magazine also noted a support session with a Symantec technician who used the shareware application Malwarebytes Anti-Malware to remove malware from a computer, referring to it as an \"online Norton program\". Controversy was raised over the fact the technician misleadingly referred to the program as a Symantec product.\n\n\n*** Version 4.0 ***\nVersion 4.0 was released on February 17, 2010. This version adds many new security features found in Norton Internet Security 2010. Version 4 also features a GUI change. The prominent colors now match the gold and black sunburst of Norton Internet Security. The widely criticized antispam has been replaced with the far more effective Brightmail, which according to Symantec gives 20% better results and require no training.\n\n\n*** Version 5.0 ***\nVersion 5.0 was released in February 2011 and offers improved performance and virus detection. It also provides updated versions of SONAR (version 3) and System insight. Download Insight now not only supports Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers only, but also supports the following clients: QQ (Chat), MSN Messenger (Chat), Limewire (P2P), MSN Explorer (Browser, E-mail & Chat), Opera (Browser), Outlook (E-mail), Thunderbird (E-mail), Windows Mail (E-mail), Chrome (Browser), BitTorrent (P2P), AOL (Browser), Yahoo Messenger (Chat), Safari (Browser), FileZilla (File Manager), Outlook Express (E-mail).\nIt features a new and enhanced interface with more realistic icons and animations and it also includes Norton Widgets - a platform that integrates other Symantec online services directly in the UI. Also new for this version are Reputation scan, that gives the user clear insight of the loaded applications and files and the Safeweb for Facebook, which scans the links on the wall to verify their safety. Links to Norton Recovery Tools have been added in the scanner's interface and in the start menu folder to help in restoring a highly infected system. The backup and restore functionality has also been improved. Passmark performance test 011 rated Norton 360 5.0 as the fastest and lightest all-in-one suite.\n\n\n*** Version 6.0 ***\nFeatured Metered Broadband modes, and easily remembers logins and other personal info while protecting against online identity theft.\n\n\n*** Version-Less (unofficially 7.0 or 2013) 20.0 ***\nThis version of Norton was released on September 5, 2012, together with the newest Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security products. It was described as Version-Less in Symantec's press release alluding to automatic updates that always keep the software to its latest version. There is no specific version reference anywhere in the description of the software. The software is compatible with Windows 8. This version of Norton 360 features enhancements in social networking protection, anti-scam capabilities, and stronger networking defenses. Norton also introduced the extra tune up disk optimizer.\n\n\n*** Version 21 (2014) ***\nVersion 21 of Norton's security suite was released on September 4, 2013, together with the newest Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security products. Norton 360 is an antivirus solution developed on SONAR technology, which claims to be able to detect any threat, block it, and remove it, thanks to three out of five layers of shields: Threat Monitoring, Threat Removal, and Network Defense, the last one dealing with online threats before they can actually reach the user\u2019s computer. Protection is also granted through analyzing the behavior of known menaces.\n\n\n*** Version 22 (2015) ***\nVersion 22 was released on September 22, 2014. This release was marketed as Norton Security 2015, however Norton 360 users are able to update to v22, even when Norton is retiring the Norton 360 brand. The appearance of the software is identical to Norton Security 2015, except for the product name in the top-left corner.\n\n\n*** Norton 360 (2019) ***\nIn April 2019, the Norton 360 brand was revived to replace Norton Security, adding Norton Secure VPN, 10 GB of online backup per-user, as well as premium plans incorporating LifeLock identity theft protection.Additional features have been added to the Norton 360 product line, including a specific suite of tools for gaming in 2021, and social media monitoring services in February 2022.Norton 360 won three categories in AV-TEST Institute's 2021 Awards, for Best Protection and Best Performance for Windows Home, MacOS security, and Android security for consumer use. In January 2022, Norton installed a cryptominer that would mine Ethereum once activated by the user; the feature was permanently disabled in September of that year.\n\n== Norton 360 Editions ==\nNorton 360 is available as Norton 360 (standard), Norton 360 Premier Edition, and Norton 360 Multi-Device. The Premier Edition has all the functions of the standard edition, with the difference that it comes with 25 GB of online storage versus 2 GB which is included with the standard edition. Norton 360 Multi-Device is actually three products in one subscription: Norton 360 Premier Edition, Norton Internet Security for Mac\u00ae, and Norton Mobile Security. The comparison between Norton 360 editions and Norton One shows all of the features and OS coverage.\nNorton 360- Gold Edition credit card type with 5 unique sets of alpha-numeric key data on reverse is sold with the instructions to go online and install on the installation page.\nNorton 360 software is not sold; it is a purchased subscription for a stated period (e.g. one year). The software (e.g. firewall, antivirus) is automatically disabled at the end of the subscription period, unless a new subscription is purchased.\nA special edition of Norton 360 Premier Edition, branded Norton Security Suite, used to be available for free to PC and Mac customers of Comcast Xfinity internet service until 1/1/2021. Comcast Norton Security Subscriptions ended 1/1/2021. The only difference between Norton 360 Premier Edition and Norton Security Suite is the latter does not include any online storage feature. Major version updates to Norton Security Suite typically occur about 1 month or more after Norton 360.\n\n\n*** Mobile version ***\nGen Digital Inc. released a mobile Norton 360 application in 2021 on the App Store for iOS devices, and Google Play for Android devices.\n\n== Disadvantages of older versions before 3.0 ==\n\n\n*** FBI cooperation ***\nSymantec, in compliance with the FBI, whitelisted Magic Lantern, a keylogger developed by the FBI. The purpose of Magic Lantern is to obtain passwords to encrypted e-mail as part of a criminal investigation. Magic Lantern was first reported in the media by Bob Sullivan of MSNBC on November 20, 2001, and by Ted Bridis of the Associated Press. Magic Lantern is deployed as an e-mail attachment. When the attachment is opened, a trojan horse is installed on the suspect's computer. The trojan horse is activated when the suspect uses PGP encryption, often used to increase the security of sent e-mail messages. When activated, the trojan horse will log the PGP password, which allows the FBI to decrypt user communications. Symantec and other major antivirus vendors have whitelisted Magic Lantern, rendering their antivirus products, including Norton Internet Security, incapable of detecting Magic Lantern. Concerns include uncertainties about Magic Lantern's full potential and whether hackers could subvert it for purposes outside the jurisdiction of the law.Graham Cluley, a technology consultant from Sophos, said \"We have no way of knowing if it was written by the FBI, and even if we did, we wouldn\u2019t know whether it was being used by the FBI or if it had been commandeered by a third party\". Another reaction came from Marc Maiffret, chief technical officer and cofounder of eEye Digital Security, \"Our customers are paying us for a service, to protect them from all forms of malicious code. It is not up to us to do law enforcement's job for them so we do not, and will not, make any exceptions for law enforcement malware or other tools.\"FBI spokesman Paul Bresson, in response if Magic Lantern needed a court order to deploy, \"Like all technology projects or tools deployed by the FBI it would be used pursuant to the appropriate legal process.\" Proponents of Magic Lantern argue the technology would allow law enforcement to efficiently and quickly decrypt messages protected by encryption schemes. Implementing Magic Lantern does not require physical access to a suspect's computer, unlike Carnivore, a predecessor to Magic Lantern, since physical access to a computer would require a court order.\n\n\n*** Uninstallation ***\nNorton Internet Security (Windows versions) is criticized for not uninstalling completely, leaving unnecessary files and registry entries. Versions prior to 3.0 also installed a separate LiveUpdate program, which updates Norton-branded software. The user must uninstall both Norton Internet Security and the LiveUpdate component manually. The LiveUpdate component is purposely left behind to update other Norton-branded products, if present. Symantec has developed the Norton Removal Tool to remove registry keys and values along with files and folders. The uninstaller must be run twice: initially, then again after a computer restart, requiring a second restart. Uninstallation will not remove subscription data, which is preserved to prevent users from installing multiple trial copies.\n\n\n*** Windows Service Packs ***\nWhen Norton 360 version 2.0 is installed, users have encountered incompatibilities upgrading to Windows XP Service Pack 3 or Windows Vista Service Pack 1. Users report numerous invalid Windows Registry keys being added by a tool named fixcss.exe, resulting in an empty Device Manager and missing devices such as wireless network adapters. Symantec initially blamed Microsoft for the incompatibilities but has since accepted partial responsibility.\nDave Cole, senior director of product management, acknowledged that users running Norton products were experiencing problems, but said the numbers are small. Cole also said that Symantec had done \"extensive testing\" of its products with Windows XP SP3, but this issue was not encountered. Cole blamed Microsoft \"This is related to XP SP3.\" Microsoft recommended for users to contact Windows customer support. To resolve the problem, Symantec has issued a fix intended for users before upgrading. Symantec also recommends disabling the tamper protection component in the 2008 release, dubbed SymProtect. A tool to remove the added registry entries is available from Symantec.\n\n\n*** Windows Vista ***\nSarah Hicks, Symantec's vice president of consumer product management, voiced concern over Windows Vista 64-bit's PatchGuard feature. PatchGuard was designed by Microsoft to ensure the integrity of the kernel, a part of an operating system which interacts with the hardware. Rootkits may hide in an operating system's kernel, complicating removal. Mike Dalton, European president of McAfee said, \"The decision to build a wall around the kernel with the assumption it can't be breached is ridiculous\", claiming Microsoft was preventing security vendors from effectively protecting the kernel while promoting its own security product, Windows Live OneCare. Hicks said Symantec did not mind the competition from OneCare. Symantec later published a white paper detailing PatchGuard with instructions to obtain a PatchGuard exploit. After negotiations and investigations from antitrust regulators, Microsoft decided to allow security vendors access to the kernel by creating special API instructions.\n\n\n*** Subscription expiration ***\nNorton 360 comes with a one-year subscription which is activated upon installation, and is valid for three home computers. Expiration of the subscription not only blocks access to program updates but shuts down the antivirus and the firewall as well. Other tools, such as the bundled password manager with user saved passwords are also inaccessible. Users are sometimes unaware that their subscription has expired and they can no longer access the tools .\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: What is Magic Lantern, how does it work, and what are the concerns surrounding its use by the FBI?",

      "context": "Norton 360\n\n==Introduction==\nNorton 360, developed by Gen Digital Inc. (formerly Symantec), is an \u201call-in-one\u201d security suite for the consumer market. Originally released in 2007, it was discontinued in 2014; its features were carried over to its successor, Norton Security.In 2019, Symantec (under former corporate name NortonLifeLock) released a \"NEW Norton 360\", as a product replacement for Norton Security.\n\n== Version history ==\n\n\n*** Project Genesis ***\nSymantec announced Project Genesis on February 7, 2006. Genesis would differ from Symantec's other consumer security products by incorporating file backup and performance optimization tools with antivirus capabilities and a firewall. Phishing protection and real-time heuristics were also planned. Windows Vista compatibility was a major aspect of Genesis. Genesis was slated for release in September. In May 2005, Microsoft announced Windows Live OneCare, a security suite with similar functionalities, slated for release in 2006.\nGenesis was renamed Norton 360 on May 31, 2006. Its feature set was confirmed\u2014it would have the same functionalities as Norton Internet Security\u2014with file backup, performance tools, phishing protection, and real-time heuristics. A public beta test was planned for summer 2006. The final release date was set at the end of 2006. The same day, McAfee announced Falcon, a security suite with similar functionalities as Norton 360 and OneCare. However, those dates were delayed. OneCare was launched in summer 2006 while Falcon entered public beta testing.\nSome viewed Norton 360 as a response to Microsoft's antivirus software, OneCare. However, with the release of OneCare, some saw Symantec as lagging behind its rivals. Mark Bregman, Symantec's vice president, claimed the upcoming Norton 360 was not intended to compete with OneCare, stating \"We somehow left the wrong impression in the market place that there's Windows Live OneCare from Microsoft, there's Falcon from McAfee, and there's nothing from Symantec.\"The first public beta was delivered in November 2006, compatible with Windows XP. A second beta was subsequently released December 20, 2006, adding compatibility for Windows Vista build 6000. After 100,000 people tested the software, Symantec began distribution to retailers in February 2007.\n\n\n*** Version 1.0 ***\n\nVersion 1.0 was released on February 26, 2007. This version was the first Symantec product to use SONAR to detect zero-day viruses. It monitors applications for malicious behavior, taking action as needed. The backup and restore functionality allowed users to back up files online or to a hard drive, CD, or DVD. Performance optimization tools allowed users to clear web browser history and temporary files. A disk defragmenter was bundled as part of the optimization tools. Phishing protection integrates with Internet Explorer, warning users of fraudulent sites.\nIn Windows XP, a 300 megahertz processor, 256 megabytes of RAM, and 300 MB of hard disk space is required. Under Vista, an 800 MHz processor, 512 MB of RAM, and 300 MB of hard disk space is required.\nReviews cited Norton 360's low resource usage, relative to Norton Internet Security 2007, and phishing protection. PC Magazine found the phishing protection feature to be more effective at blocking access to fraudulent sites than Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 2. However, reviewers highlighted the lack of manual control for advanced users. CNET noted the lack of phishing protection for browsers other than Internet Explorer, such as Mozilla Firefox. CNET also highlighted the lack of wireless network tools, such as notifying users when someone uninvited joins the network or help encrypting wireless signals. PC Magazine criticized the antispam filter of Version 1.0, finding it blocked only half of the spam mail, and with five percent false positive rate.\n\n\n*** Version 2.0 ***\nVersion 2.0 was released March 3, 2008. The backup feature can now inscribe data to Blu-ray and HD DVD discs. Multiple installations of Norton 360 can also be managed from a centralized location. When backing up files online, the user can control the amount of bandwidth Norton uses. A registry cleaner is bundled with the performance tools, allowing the user to remove invalid entries. Phishing protection for Firefox was added. Supplementing the phishing protection is the Norton Identity Safe, which stores login credentials to websites. A network map allows users to view the status of other Norton installations on networked computers and view basic information about each computer. System requirements remain the same as version 1.0.\nPC Magazine found the spam filter to be inaccurate, with a 25 percent false positive rate. CNET encountered problems when installing version 2.0 on legacy machines.\n\n\n*** Version 3.0 ***\n\nVersion 3.0 was released on March 4, 2009. This version uses the same codebase as Norton Internet Security 2009. For earlier versions, Symantec rewrote code specifically for Norton 360.Version 3.0 incorporates Norton Safe Web, offered as a standalone service earlier. Safe Web integrates with Firefox and Internet Explorer as a toolbar, blocking access to fraudulent and malware hosting sites. This toolbar also includes a search box, routing search queries typed in the box through the Ask.com search engine. The toolbar does not share code with the Ask.com toolbar, which was classified as spyware by McAfee, Trend Micro, and other antivirus vendors. Due to criticism of the search functionality, Symantec announced the Ask.com search box would be hidden in future releases of version 3.0.The capability to back up files to a flash drive was introduced in this release. Files stored on a flash drive can be copied to another computer without Norton 360 installed. Norton also creates a virtual drive in Windows Explorer, allowing users to browse their backup files, stored locally or online. Users can restore individual files using the drag-and-drop technique. Version 3.0 does not retain previous versions of files and skips files which are open by another program. A startup application manager was included in this release, allowing users to control which programs start at login. To complement the application manager, Norton can measure the impact programs have on login time.PC Magazine highlighted version 3.0's inaccurate spam filter, misfiling half of valid mail as spam. PC Magazine also noted a support session with a Symantec technician who used the shareware application Malwarebytes Anti-Malware to remove malware from a computer, referring to it as an \"online Norton program\".

The prominent colors now match the gold and black sunburst of Norton Internet Security. The widely criticized antispam has been replaced with the far more effective Brightmail, which according to Symantec gives 20% better results and require no training.\n\n\n*** Version 5.0 ***\nVersion 5.0 was released in February 2011 and offers improved performance and virus detection. It also provides updated versions of SONAR (version 3) and System insight. Download Insight now not only supports Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers only, but also supports the following clients: QQ (Chat), MSN Messenger (Chat), Limewire (P2P), MSN Explorer (Browser, E-mail & Chat), Opera (Browser), Outlook (E-mail), Thunderbird (E-mail), Windows Mail (E-mail), Chrome (Browser), BitTorrent (P2P), AOL (Browser), Yahoo Messenger (Chat), Safari (Browser), FileZilla (File Manager), Outlook Express (E-mail).\nIt features a new and enhanced interface with more realistic icons and animations and it also includes Norton Widgets - a platform that integrates other Symantec online services directly in the UI. Also new for this version are Reputation scan, that gives the user clear insight of the loaded applications and files and the Safeweb for Facebook, which scans the links on the wall to verify their safety. Links to Norton Recovery Tools have been added in the scanner's interface and in the start menu folder to help in restoring a highly infected system. The backup and restore functionality has also been improved. Passmark performance test 011 rated Norton 360 5.0 as the fastest and lightest all-in-one suite.\n\n\n*** Version 6.0 ***\nFeatured Metered Broadband modes, and easily remembers logins and other personal info while protecting against online identity theft.\n\n\n*** Version-Less (unofficially 7.0 or 2013) 20.0 ***\nThis version of Norton was released on September 5, 2012, together with the newest Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security products.

In January 2022, Norton installed a cryptominer that would mine Ethereum once activated by the user; the feature was permanently disabled in September of that year.\n\n== Norton 360 Editions ==\nNorton 360 is available as Norton 360 (standard), Norton 360 Premier Edition, and Norton 360 Multi-Device. The Premier Edition has all the functions of the standard edition, with the difference that it comes with 25 GB of online storage versus 2 GB which is included with the standard edition. Norton 360 Multi-Device is actually three products in one subscription: Norton 360 Premier Edition, Norton Internet Security for Mac\u00ae, and Norton Mobile Security.

    "instruction": "Context: Digital evidence\n\n==Introduction==\nIn evidence law, digital evidence or electronic evidence is any probative information stored or transmitted in digital form that a party to a court case may use at trial. Before accepting digital evidence a court will determine if the evidence is relevant, whether it is authentic, if it is hearsay and whether a copy is acceptable or the original is required.The use of digital evidence has increased in the past few decades as courts have allowed the use of e-mails, digital photographs, ATM transaction logs, word processing documents, instant message histories, files saved from accounting programs, spreadsheets, internet browser histories, databases, the contents of computer memory, computer backups, computer printouts, Global Positioning System tracks, logs from a hotel\u2019s electronic door locks, and digital video or audio files.Many courts in the United States have applied the Federal Rules of Evidence to digital evidence in a similar way to traditional documents, although important differences such as the lack of established standards and procedures have been noted. In addition, digital evidence tends to be more voluminous, more difficult to destroy, easily modified, easily duplicated, potentially more expressive, and more readily available. As such, some courts have sometimes treated digital evidence differently for purposes of authentication, hearsay, the best evidence rule, and privilege. In December 2006, strict new rules were enacted within the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requiring the preservation and disclosure of electronically stored evidence. Digital evidence is often attacked for its authenticity due to the ease with which it can be modified, although courts are beginning to reject this argument without proof of tampering.\n\n\n\n== Admissibility ==\nDigital evidence is often ruled inadmissible by courts because it was obtained without authorization. In most jurisdictions a warrant is required to seize and investigate digital devices. In a digital investigation this can present problems where, for example, evidence of other crimes are identified while investigating another. During a 1999 investigation into online harassment by Keith Schroeder investigators found pornographic images of children on his computer. A second warrant had to be obtained before the evidence could be used to charge Schroeder.\n\n== Authentication ==\nAs with any evidence, the proponent of digital evidence must lay the proper foundation.  Courts largely concerned themselves with the reliability of such digital evidence.  As such, early court decisions required that authentication called \"for a more comprehensive foundation.\" US v. Scholle, 553 F.2d 1109 (8th Cir. 1976). As courts became more familiar with digital documents, they backed away from the higher standard and have since held that \"computer data compilations\u2026 should be treated as any other record.\" US v. Vela, 673 F.2d 86, 90 (5th Cir. 1982).\nA common attack on digital evidence is that digital media can be easily altered. However, in 2002 a US court ruled that \"the fact that it is possible to alter data contained in a computer is plainly insufficient to establish untrustworthiness\" (US v. Bonallo, 858 F. 2d 1427\u20131988 \u2013 Court of Appeals, 9th).Nevertheless, the \"more comprehensive\" foundation required by Scholle remains good practice. The American Law Reports lists a number of ways to establish the comprehensive foundation. It suggests that the proponent demonstrate \"the reliability of the computer equipment\", \"the manner in which the basic data was initially entered\", \"the measures taken to ensure the accuracy of the data as entered\", \"the method of storing the data and the precautions taken to prevent its loss\", \"the reliability of the computer programs used to process the data\", and \"the measures taken to verify the accuracy of the program\".In its turn it gave rise to a breed of commercial software technology solutions designed to preserve digital evidence in its original form and to authenticate it for admissibility in disputes and in court.\n\n\n*** UK ACPO guidelines ***\nIn the United Kingdom, examiners usually follow guidelines issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) for the authentication and integrity of evidence. They were updated to Version 5 in October 2011 when computer based evidence was replaced with digital evidence reflecting the development of investigating information security incidents in a wider context. The guidelines consist of four principles:\nPrinciple 1: No action taken by law enforcement agencies, persons employed within those agencies  or their agents should change data which may subsequently be relied upon in court. \nPrinciple 2: In circumstances where a person finds it necessary to access original data, that person  must be competent to do so and be able to give evidence explaining the relevance and the  implications of their actions. \nPrinciple 3: An audit trail or other record of all processes applied to digital evidence should be  created and preserved. An independent third party should be able to examine those processes and  achieve the same result. \nPrinciple 4: The person in charge of the investigation has overall responsibility for ensuring that  the law and these principles are adhered to.\nThese guidelines are widely accepted in courts of England and Scotland, but they do not constitute a legal requirement and their use is voluntary. It is arguable that whilst voluntary, non adherence is almost certain to lead to the exclusion of evidence that does not comply subject to the provisions of s 78 Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Power to exclude evidence obtained unfairly)\n\n\n*** ADAM Principles ***\nBuilding on the ACPO Guidelines with a more generic application outside of law enforcement, a doctoral thesis proposed the following overriding principles to be followed by digital forensic practitioners:\nThe activities of the digital forensic practitioner should not alter the original data. If the requirements of the work mean that this is not possible then the effect of the practitioner\u2019s actions on the original data should be clearly identified and the process that caused any changes justified.\nA complete record of all activities associated with the acquisition and handling of the original data and any copies of the original data must be maintained. This includes compliance with the appropriate rules of evidence, such as maintaining a chain of custody record, and verification processes such as hashing.\nThe digital forensic practitioner must not undertake any activities which are beyond their ability or knowledge.\nThe digital forensic practitioner must take into consideration all aspects of personal and equipment safety whilst undertaking their work.\nAt all times the legal rights of anyone affected by your actions should be considered.\nThe practitioner must be aware of all organizational policies and procedures relating to their activities\nCommunication must be maintained as appropriate with the client, legal practitioners, supervisors and other team members\n\n== Best evidence rule ==\nDigital evidence is almost never in a format readable by humans, requiring additional steps to include digital documents as evidence (i.e. printing out the material). It has been argued that this change of format may mean digital evidence does not qualify under the \"best evidence rule\". However, the \"Federal Rules of Evidence\" rule 1001(3) states \"if data are stored in a computer\u2026, any printout or other output readable by sight, shown to reflect the data accurately, is an \u2018original.\u2019\"Commonly courts do not bar printouts under the best evidence rule. In Aguimatang v. California State Lottery, the court gave near per se treatment to the admissibility of digital evidence stating \"the computer printout does not violate the best evidence rule, because a computer printout is considered an \u2018original.\u2019\" 234 Cal. App. 3d 769, 798.\n\n== Video evidence ==\nVideo evidence is a video clip that may be used in a court case at trial.\nExamples include:\nGeorge Holliday's video of Rodney King's beating by the LAPD\nThe shooting of Neda Agha-Soltan\nBART Police shooting of Oscar Grant\nDeath of Ian Tomlinson\nRobert Dzieka\u0144ski Taser incident\nDeath of Eric Garner\nAnswer this question: How do the UK ACPO guidelines address the competence of individuals accessing original digital evidence?",

    "instruction": "Backdoor (computing)\n\n==Introduction==\nA backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment (e.g. part of a cryptosystem, algorithm, chipset, or even a \"homunculus computer\" \u2014a tiny computer-within-a-computer such as that found in Intel's AMT technology). Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptosystems. From there it may be used to gain access to privileged information like passwords, corrupt or delete data on hard drives, or transfer information within autoschediastic networks.\nA backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program, a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), code in the firmware of the hardware, or parts of an operating system such as Windows. Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. A Trojan horse may appear to be an entirely legitimate program, but when executed, it triggers an activity that may install a backdoor. Although some are secretly installed, other backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors have \"legitimate\" uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords.\nMany systems that store information within the cloud fail to create accurate security measures. If many systems are connected within the cloud, hackers can gain access to all other platforms through the most vulnerable system. Default passwords (or other default credentials) can function as backdoors if they are not changed by the user. Some debugging features can also act as backdoors if they are not removed in the release version. In 1993, the United States government attempted to deploy an encryption system, the Clipper chip, with an explicit backdoor for law enforcement and national security access. The chip was unsuccessful.\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe threat of backdoors surfaced when multiuser and networked operating systems became widely adopted. Petersen and Turn discussed computer subversion in a paper published in the proceedings of the 1967 AFIPS Conference. They noted a class of active infiltration attacks that use \"trapdoor\" entry points into the system to bypass security facilities and permit direct access to data. The use of the word trapdoor here clearly coincides with more recent definitions of a backdoor. However, since the advent of public key cryptography the term trapdoor has acquired a different meaning (see trapdoor function), and thus the term \"backdoor\" is now preferred, only after the term trapdoor went out of use. More generally, such security breaches were discussed at length in a RAND Corporation task force report published under ARPA sponsorship by J.P. Anderson and D.J. Edwards in 1970.A backdoor in a login system might take the form of a hard coded user and password combination which gives access to the system. An example of this sort of backdoor was used as a plot device in the 1983 film WarGames, in which the architect of the \"WOPR\" computer system had inserted a hardcoded password-less account which gave the user access to the system, and to undocumented parts of the system (in particular, a video game-like simulation mode and direct interaction with the artificial intelligence).\nAlthough the number of backdoors in systems using proprietary software (software whose source code is not publicly available) is not widely credited, they are nevertheless frequently exposed. Programmers have even succeeded in secretly installing large amounts of benign code as Easter eggs in programs, although such cases may involve official forbearance, if not actual permission.\n\n== Politics and attribution ==\nThere are a number of cloak and dagger considerations that come into play when apportioning responsibility.\nCovert backdoors sometimes masquerade as inadvertent defects (bugs) for reasons of plausible deniability. In some cases, these might begin life as an actual bug (inadvertent error), which, once discovered are then deliberately left unfixed and undisclosed, whether by a rogue employee for personal advantage, or with C-level executive awareness and oversight.\nIt is also possible for an entirely above-board corporation's technology base to be covertly and untraceably tainted by external agents (hackers), though this level of sophistication is thought to exist mainly at the level of nation state actors. For example, if a photomask obtained from a photomask supplier differs in a few gates from its photomask specification, a chip manufacturer would be hard-pressed to detect this if otherwise functionally silent; a covert rootkit running in the photomask etching equipment could enact this discrepancy unbeknown to the photomask manufacturer, either, and by such means, one backdoor potentially leads to another. (This hypothetical scenario is essentially a silicon version of the undetectable compiler backdoor, discussed below.)\nIn general terms, the long dependency-chains in the modern, highly specialized technological economy and innumerable human-elements process control-points make it difficult to conclusively pinpoint responsibility at such time as a covert backdoor becomes unveiled.\nEven direct admissions of responsibility must be scrutinized carefully if the confessing party is beholden to other powerful interests.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n\n*** Worms ***\nMany computer worms, such as Sobig and Mydoom, install a backdoor on the affected computer (generally a PC on broadband running Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Outlook). Such backdoors appear to be installed so that spammers can send junk e-mail from the infected machines. Others, such as the Sony/BMG rootkit, placed secretly on millions of music CDs through late 2005, are intended as DRM measures\u2014and, in that case, as data-gathering agents, since both surreptitious programs they installed routinely contacted central servers.\nA sophisticated attempt to plant a backdoor in the Linux kernel, exposed in November 2003, added a small and subtle code change by subverting the revision control system. In this case, a two-line change appeared to check root access permissions of a caller to the sys_wait4 function, but because it used assignment\n\n==, it actually granted permissions to the system. This difference is easily overlooked, and could even be interpreted as an accidental typographical error, rather than an intentional attack.\n\nIn January 2014, a backdoor was discovered in certain Samsung Android products, like the Galaxy devices. The Samsung proprietary Android versions are fitted with a backdoor that provides remote access to the data stored on the device. In particular, the Samsung Android software that is in charge of handling the communications with the modem, using the Samsung IPC protocol, implements a class of requests known as remote file server (RFS) commands, that allows the backdoor operator to perform via modem remote I/O operations on the device hard disk or other storage. As the modem is running Samsung proprietary Android software, it is likely that it offers over-the-air remote control that could then be used to issue the RFS commands and thus to access the file system on the device.\n\n\n*** Object code backdoors ***\nHarder to detect backdoors involve modifying object code, rather than source code \u2013 object code is much harder to inspect, as it is designed to be machine-readable, not human-readable. These backdoors can be inserted either directly in the on-disk object code, or inserted at some point during compilation, assembly linking, or loading \u2013 in the latter case the backdoor never appears on disk, only in memory. Object code backdoors are difficult to detect by inspection of the object code, but are easily detected by simply checking for changes (differences), notably in length or in checksum, and in some cases can be detected or analyzed by disassembling the object code. Further, object code backdoors can be removed (assuming source code is available) by simply recompiling from source on a trusted system.\nThus for such backdoors to avoid detection, all extant copies of a binary must be subverted, and any validation checksums must also be compromised, and source must be unavailable, to prevent recompilation. Alternatively, these other tools (length checks, diff, checksumming, disassemblers) can themselves be compromised to conceal the backdoor, for example detecting that the subverted binary is being checksummed and returning the expected value, not the actual value. To conceal these further subversions, the tools must also conceal the changes in themselves \u2013 for example, a subverted checksummer must also detect if it is checksumming itself (or other subverted tools) and return false values. This leads to extensive changes in the system and tools being needed to conceal a single change.\nBecause object code can be regenerated by recompiling (reassembling, relinking) the original source code, making a persistent object code backdoor (without modifying source code) requires subverting the compiler itself \u2013 so that when it detects that it is compiling the program under attack it inserts the backdoor \u2013 or alternatively the assembler, linker, or loader. As this requires subverting the compiler, this in turn can be fixed by recompiling the compiler, removing the backdoor insertion code. This defense can in turn be subverted by putting a source meta-backdoor in the compiler, so that when it detects that it is compiling itself it then inserts this meta-backdoor generator, together with the original backdoor generator for the original program under attack. After this is done, the source meta-backdoor can be removed, and the compiler recompiled from original source with the compromised compiler executable: the backdoor has been bootstrapped. This attack dates to Karger & Schell (1974), and was popularized in Thompson's 1984 article, entitled \"Reflections on Trusting Trust\"; it is hence colloquially known as the \"Trusting Trust\" attack. See compiler backdoors, below, for details. Analogous attacks can target lower levels of the system,\nsuch as the operating system, and can be inserted during the system booting process; these are also mentioned in Karger & Schell (1974), and now exist in the form of boot sector viruses.\n\n\n*** Asymmetric backdoors ***\nA traditional backdoor is a symmetric backdoor: anyone that finds the backdoor can in turn use it. The notion of an asymmetric backdoor was introduced by Adam Young and Moti Yung in the Proceedings of Advances in Cryptology: Crypto '96. An asymmetric backdoor can only be used by the attacker who plants it, even if the full implementation of the backdoor becomes public (e.g., via publishing, being discovered and disclosed by reverse engineering, etc.). Also, it is computationally intractable to detect the presence of an asymmetric backdoor under black-box queries. This class of attacks have been termed kleptography; they can be carried out in software, hardware (for example, smartcards), or a combination of the two. The theory of asymmetric backdoors is part of a larger field now called cryptovirology. Notably, NSA inserted a kleptographic backdoor into the Dual EC DRBG standard.There exists an experimental asymmetric backdoor in RSA key generation. This OpenSSL RSA backdoor, designed by Young and Yung, utilizes a twisted pair of elliptic curves, and has been made available.\n\n\n== Compiler backdoors\n\n==\nA sophisticated form of black box backdoor is a compiler backdoor, where not only is a compiler subverted (to insert a backdoor in some other program, such as a login program), but it is further modified to detect when it is compiling itself and then inserts both the backdoor insertion code (targeting the other program) and the code-modifying self-compilation, like the mechanism through which retroviruses infect their host. This can be done by modifying the source code, and the resulting compromised compiler (object code) can compile the original (unmodified) source code and insert itself: the exploit has been boot-strapped.\nThis attack was originally presented in Karger & Schell (1974, p. 52, section 3.4.5: \"Trap Door Insertion\"), which was a United States Air Force security analysis of Multics, where they described such an attack on a PL/I compiler, and call it a \"compiler trap door\"; they also mention a variant where the system initialization code is modified to insert a backdoor during booting, as this is complex and poorly understood, and call it an \"initialization trapdoor\"; this is now known as a boot sector virus.This attack was then actually implemented by Ken Thompson, and popularized in his Turing Award acceptance speech in 1983 (published 1984), \"Reflections on Trusting Trust\", which points out that trust is relative, and the only software one can truly trust is code where every step of the bootstrapping has been inspected. This backdoor mechanism is based on the fact that people only review source (human-written) code, and not compiled machine code (object code). A program called a compiler is used to create the second from the first, and the compiler is usually trusted to do an honest job.\nThompson's paper describes a modified version of the Unix C compiler that would put an invisible backdoor in the Unix login command when it noticed that the login program was being compiled, and would also add this feature undetectably to future compiler versions upon their compilation as well.\nBecause the compiler itself was a compiled program, users would be extremely unlikely to notice the machine code instructions that performed these tasks. (Because of the second task, the compiler's source code would appear \"clean\".) What's worse, in Thompson's proof of concept implementation, the subverted compiler also subverted the analysis program (the disassembler), so that anyone who examined the binaries in the usual way would not actually see the real code that was running, but something else instead.\nAn updated analysis of the original exploit is given in Karger & Schell (2002, Section 3.2.4: Compiler trap doors), and a historical overview and survey of the literature is given in Wheeler (2009, Section 2: Background and related work).\n\n\n*** Occurrences ***\nThompson's version was, officially, never released into the wild. It is believed, however, that a version was distributed to BBN and at least one use of the backdoor was recorded. There are scattered anecdotal reports of such backdoors in subsequent years.\nIn August 2009, an attack of this kind was discovered by Sophos labs. The W32/Induc-A virus infected the program compiler for Delphi, a Windows programming language. The virus introduced its own code to the compilation of new Delphi programs, allowing it to infect and propagate to many systems, without the knowledge of the software programmer. The virus looks for a Delphi installation, modifies the SysConst.pas file, which is the source code of a part of the standard library and compiles it. After that, every program compiled by that Delphi installation will contain the virus. An attack that propagates by building its own Trojan horse can be especially hard to discover. It resulted in many software vendors releasing infected executables without realizing it, sometimes claiming false positives. After all, the executable was not tampered with, the compiler was. It is believed that the Induc-A virus had been propagating for at least a year before it was discovered.In 2015, a malicious copy of Xcode, XcodeGhost, also performed a similar attack and infected iOS apps from a dozen of software companies in China. Globally, 4000 apps were found to be affected. It was not a true Thompson Trojan, as it does not infect development tools themselves, but it did show toolchain poisoning can indeed cause substantial damages.\n\n\n*** Countermeasures ***\nOnce a system has been compromised with a backdoor or Trojan horse, such as the Trusting Trust compiler, it is very hard for the \"rightful\" user to regain control of the system \u2013 typically one should rebuild a clean system and transfer data (but not executables) over. However, several practical weaknesses in the Trusting Trust scheme have been suggested.  For example, a sufficiently motivated user could painstakingly review the machine code of the untrusted compiler before using it. As mentioned above, there are ways to hide the Trojan horse, such as subverting the disassembler; but there are ways to counter that defense, too, such as writing a disassembler from scratch.A generic method to counter trusting trust attacks is called diverse double-compiling. The method requires a different compiler and the source code of the compiler-under-test. That source, compiled with both compilers, results in two different stage-1 compilers, which however should have the same behavior. Thus the same source compiled with both stage-1 compilers must then result in two identical stage-2 compilers. A formal proof is given that the latter comparison guarantees that the purported source code and executable of the compiler-under-test correspond, under some assumptions. This method was applied by its author to verify that the C compiler of the GCC suite (v. 3.0.4) contained no trojan, using icc (v. 11.0) as the different compiler.In practice such verifications are not done by end users, except in extreme circumstances of intrusion detection and analysis, due to the rarity of such sophisticated attacks, and because programs are typically distributed in binary form. Removing backdoors (including compiler backdoors) is typically done by simply rebuilding a clean system. However, the sophisticated verifications are of interest to operating system vendors, to ensure that they are not distributing a compromised system, and in high-security settings, where such attacks are a realistic concern.\n\n\n== List of known backdoors\n\n==\nBack Orifice was created in 1998 by hackers from Cult of the Dead Cow group as a remote administration tool. It allowed Windows computers to be remotely controlled over a network and parodied the name of Microsoft's BackOffice.\nThe Dual EC DRBG cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator was revealed in 2013 to possibly have a kleptographic backdoor deliberately inserted by NSA, who also had the private key to the backdoor.\nSeveral backdoors in the unlicensed copies of WordPress plug-ins were discovered in March 2014. They were inserted as obfuscated JavaScript code and silently created, for example, an admin account in the website database. A similar scheme was later exposed in the Joomla plugin.\nBorland Interbase versions 4.0 through 6.0 had a hard-coded backdoor, put there by the developers. The server code contains a compiled-in backdoor account (username: politically, password: correct), which could be accessed over a network connection; a user logging in with this backdoor account could take full control over all Interbase databases. The backdoor was detected in 2001 and a patch was released.\nJuniper Networks backdoor inserted in the year 2008 into the versions of firmware ScreenOS from 6.2.0r15 to 6.2.0r18 and from 6.3.0r12 to 6.3.0r20 that gives any user administrative access when using a special master password.\nSeveral backdoors were discovered in C-DATA Optical Line Termination (OLT) devices. Researchers released the findings without notifying C-DATA because they believe the backdoors were intentionally placed by the vendor.\n\n\n== See also\n\n==\nBackdoor:Win32.Hupigon\nBackdoor.Win32.Seed\nHardware backdoor\nTitanium (malware)\n\n\n== References\n\n==\n\n\n== Further reading\n\n==\n\n\n== External links\n\nWhat is the difference between a symmetric and an asymmetric backdoor?",

(This hypothetical scenario is essentially a silicon version of the undetectable compiler backdoor, discussed below.)\nIn general terms, the long dependency-chains in the modern, highly specialized technological economy and innumerable human-elements process control-points make it difficult to conclusively pinpoint responsibility at such time as a covert backdoor becomes unveiled.\nEven direct admissions of responsibility must be scrutinized carefully if the confessing party is beholden to other powerful interests.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n\n*** Worms ***\nMany computer worms, such as Sobig and Mydoom, install a backdoor on the affected computer (generally a PC on broadband running Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Outlook). Such backdoors appear to be installed so that spammers can send junk e-mail from the infected machines. Others, such as the Sony/BMG rootkit, placed secretly on millions of music CDs through late 2005, are intended as DRM measures\u2014and, in that case, as data-gathering agents, since both surreptitious programs they installed routinely contacted central servers.\nA sophisticated attempt to plant a backdoor in the Linux kernel, exposed in November 2003, added a small and subtle code change by subverting the revision control system. In this case, a two-line change appeared to check root access permissions of a caller to the sys_wait4 function, but because it used assignment\n\n==, it actually granted permissions to the system. This difference is easily overlooked, and could even be interpreted as an accidental typographical error, rather than an intentional attack.\n\nIn January 2014, a backdoor was discovered in certain Samsung Android products, like the Galaxy devices. The Samsung proprietary Android versions are fitted with a backdoor that provides remote access to the data stored on the device. In particular, the Samsung Android software that is in charge of handling the communications with the modem, using the Samsung IPC protocol, implements a class of requests known as remote file server (RFS) commands, that allows the backdoor operator to perform via modem remote I/O operations on the device hard disk or other storage. As the modem is running Samsung proprietary Android software, it is likely that it offers over-the-air remote control that could then be used to issue the RFS commands and thus to access the file system on the device.\n\n\n*** Object code backdoors ***\nHarder to detect backdoors involve modifying object code, rather than source code \u2013 object code is much harder to inspect, as it is designed to be machine-readable, not human-readable. These backdoors can be inserted either directly in the on-disk object code, or inserted at some point during compilation, assembly linking, or loading \u2013 in the latter case the backdoor never appears on disk, only in memory. Object code backdoors are difficult to detect by inspection of the object code, but are easily detected by simply checking for changes (differences), notably in length or in checksum, and in some cases can be detected or analyzed by disassembling the object code. Further, object code backdoors can be removed (assuming source code is available) by simply recompiling from source on a trusted system.\nThus for such backdoors to avoid detection, all extant copies of a binary must be subverted, and any validation checksums must also be compromised, and source must be unavailable, to prevent recompilation. Alternatively, these other tools (length checks, diff, checksumming, disassemblers) can themselves be compromised to conceal the backdoor, for example detecting that the subverted binary is being checksummed and returning the expected value, not the actual value. To conceal these further subversions, the tools must also conceal the changes in themselves \u2013 for example, a subverted checksummer must also detect if it is checksumming itself (or other subverted tools) and return false values. This leads to extensive changes in the system and tools being needed to conceal a single change.\nBecause object code can be regenerated by recompiling (reassembling, relinking) the original source code, making a persistent object code backdoor (without modifying source code) requires subverting the compiler itself \u2013 so that when it detects that it is compiling the program under attack it inserts the backdoor \u2013 or alternatively the assembler, linker, or loader. As this requires subverting the compiler, this in turn can be fixed by recompiling the compiler, removing the backdoor insertion code. This defense can in turn be subverted by putting a source meta-backdoor in the compiler, so that when it detects that it is compiling itself it then inserts this meta-backdoor generator, together with the original backdoor generator for the original program under attack. After this is done, the source meta-backdoor can be removed, and the compiler recompiled from original source with the compromised compiler executable: the backdoor has been bootstrapped. This attack dates to Karger & Schell (1974), and was popularized in Thompson's 1984 article, entitled \"Reflections on Trusting Trust\"; it is hence colloquially known as the \"Trusting Trust\" attack. See compiler backdoors, below, for details. Analogous attacks can target lower levels of the system,\nsuch as the operating system, and can be inserted during the system booting process; these are also mentioned in Karger & Schell (1974), and now exist in the form of boot sector viruses.\n\n\n*** Asymmetric backdoors ***\nA traditional backdoor is a symmetric backdoor: anyone that finds the backdoor can in turn use it. The notion of an asymmetric backdoor was introduced by Adam Young and Moti Yung in the Proceedings of Advances in Cryptology: Crypto '96. An asymmetric backdoor can only be used by the attacker who plants it, even if the full implementation of the backdoor becomes public (e.g., via publishing, being discovered and disclosed by reverse engineering, etc.). Also, it is computationally intractable to detect the presence of an asymmetric backdoor under black-box queries. This class of attacks have been termed kleptography; they can be carried out in software, hardware (for example, smartcards), or a combination of the two. The theory of asymmetric backdoors is part of a larger field now called cryptovirology. Notably, NSA inserted a kleptographic backdoor into the Dual EC DRBG standard.There exists an experimental asymmetric backdoor in RSA key generation. This OpenSSL RSA backdoor, designed by Young and Yung, utilizes a twisted pair of elliptic curves, and has been made available.\n\n\n== Compiler backdoors\n\n==\nA sophisticated form of black box backdoor is a compiler backdoor, where not only is a compiler subverted (to insert a backdoor in some other program, such as a login program), but it is further modified to detect when it is compiling itself and then inserts both the backdoor insertion code (targeting the other program) and the code-modifying self-compilation, like the mechanism through which retroviruses infect their host. This can be done by modifying the source code, and the resulting compromised compiler (object code) can compile the original (unmodified) source code and insert itself: the exploit has been boot-strapped.\nThis attack was originally presented in Karger & Schell (1974, p. 52, section 3.4.5: \"Trap Door Insertion\"), which was a United States Air Force security analysis of Multics, where they described such an attack on a PL/I compiler, and call it a \"compiler trap door\"; they also mention a variant where the system initialization code is modified to insert a backdoor during booting, as this is complex and poorly understood, and call it an \"initialization trapdoor\"; this is now known as a boot sector virus.This attack was then actually implemented by Ken Thompson, and popularized in his Turing Award acceptance speech in 1983 (published 1984), \"Reflections on Trusting Trust\", which points out that trust is relative, and the only software one can truly trust is code where every step of the bootstrapping has been inspected. This backdoor mechanism is based on the fact that people only review source (human-written) code, and not compiled machine code (object code). A program called a compiler is used to create the second from the first, and the compiler is usually trusted to do an honest job.\nThompson's paper describes a modified version of the Unix C compiler that would put an invisible backdoor in the Unix login command when it noticed that the login program was being compiled, and would also add this feature undetectably to future compiler versions upon their compilation as well.\nBecause the compiler itself was a compiled program, users would be extremely unlikely to notice the machine code instructions that performed these tasks. (Because of the second task, the compiler's source code would appear \"clean\".) What's worse, in Thompson's proof of concept implementation, the subverted compiler also subverted the analysis program (the disassembler), so that anyone who examined the binaries in the usual way would not actually see the real code that was running, but something else instead.\nAn updated analysis of the original exploit is given in Karger & Schell (2002, Section 3.2.4: Compiler trap doors), and a historical overview and survey of the literature is given in Wheeler (2009, Section 2: Background and related work).\n\n\n*** Occurrences ***\nThompson's version was, officially, never released into the wild. It is believed, however, that a version was distributed to BBN and at least one use of the backdoor was recorded. There are scattered anecdotal reports of such backdoors in subsequent years.\nIn August 2009, an attack of this kind was discovered by Sophos labs. The W32/Induc-A virus infected the program compiler for Delphi, a Windows programming language. The virus introduced its own code to the compilation of new Delphi programs, allowing it to infect and propagate to many systems, without the knowledge of the software programmer. The virus looks for a Delphi installation, modifies the SysConst.pas file, which is the source code of a part of the standard library and compiles it. After that, every program compiled by that Delphi installation will contain the virus. An attack that propagates by building its own Trojan horse can be especially hard to discover. It resulted in many software vendors releasing infected executables without realizing it, sometimes claiming false positives. After all, the executable was not tampered with, the compiler was. It is believed that the Induc-A virus had been propagating for at least a year before it was discovered.In 2015, a malicious copy of Xcode, XcodeGhost, also performed a similar attack and infected iOS apps from a dozen of software companies in China. Globally, 4000 apps were found to be affected. It was not a true Thompson Trojan, as it does not infect development tools themselves, but it did show toolchain poisoning can indeed cause substantial damages.\n\n\n*** Countermeasures ***\nOnce a system has been compromised with a backdoor or Trojan horse, such as the Trusting Trust compiler, it is very hard for the \"rightful\" user to regain control of the system \u2013 typically one should rebuild a clean system and transfer data (but not executables) over. However, several practical weaknesses in the Trusting Trust scheme have been suggested.  For example, a sufficiently motivated user could painstakingly review the machine code of the untrusted compiler before using it. As mentioned above, there are ways to hide the Trojan horse, such as subverting the disassembler; but there are ways to counter that defense, too, such as writing a disassembler from scratch.A generic method to counter trusting trust attacks is called diverse double-compiling. The method requires a different compiler and the source code of the compiler-under-test. That source, compiled with both compilers, results in two different stage-1 compilers, which however should have the same behavior. Thus the same source compiled with both stage-1 compilers must then result in two identical stage-2 compilers. A formal proof is given that the latter comparison guarantees that the purported source code and executable of the compiler-under-test correspond, under some assumptions. This method was applied by its author to verify that the C compiler of the GCC suite (v. 3.0.4) contained no trojan, using icc (v. 11.0) as the different compiler.In practice such verifications are not done by end users, except in extreme circumstances of intrusion detection and analysis, due to the rarity of such sophisticated attacks, and because programs are typically distributed in binary form. Removing backdoors (including compiler backdoors) is typically done by simply rebuilding a clean system. However, the sophisticated verifications are of interest to operating system vendors, to ensure that they are not distributing a compromised system, and in high-security settings, where such attacks are a realistic concern.\n\n\n== List of known backdoors\n\n==\nBack Orifice was created in 1998 by hackers from Cult of the Dead Cow group as a remote administration tool. It allowed Windows computers to be remotely controlled over a network and parodied the name of Microsoft's BackOffice.\nThe Dual EC DRBG cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator was revealed in 2013 to possibly have a kleptographic backdoor deliberately inserted by NSA, who also had the private key to the backdoor.\nSeveral backdoors in the unlicensed copies of WordPress plug-ins were discovered in March 2014. They were inserted as obfuscated JavaScript code and silently created, for example, an admin account in the website database. A similar scheme was later exposed in the Joomla plugin.\nBorland Interbase versions 4.0 through 6.0 had a hard-coded backdoor, put there by the developers. The server code contains a compiled-in backdoor account (username: politically, password: correct), which could be accessed over a network connection; a user logging in with this backdoor account could take full control over all Interbase databases. The backdoor was detected in 2001 and a patch was released.\nJuniper Networks backdoor inserted in the year 2008 into the versions of firmware ScreenOS from 6.2.0r15 to 6.2.0r18 and from 6.3.0r12 to 6.3.0r20 that gives any user administrative access when using a special master password.\nSeveral backdoors were discovered in C-DATA Optical Line Termination (OLT) devices. Researchers released the findings without notifying C-DATA because they believe the backdoors were intentionally placed by the vendor.\n\n\n== See also\n\n==\nBackdoor:Win32.Hupigon\nBackdoor.Win32.Seed\nHardware backdoor\nTitanium (malware)\n\n\n== References\n\n==\n\n\n== Further reading\n\n==\n\n\n== External links"

    "instruction": "Context: Anti-spam techniques\n\n==Introduction==\nVarious anti-spam techniques are used to prevent email spam (unsolicited bulk email).\nNo technique is a complete solution to the spam problem, and each has trade-offs between incorrectly rejecting legitimate email (false positives) as opposed to not rejecting all spam email (false negatives) \u2013 and the associated costs in time, effort, and cost of wrongfully obstructing good mail.Anti-spam techniques can be broken into four broad categories: those that require actions by individuals, those that can be automated by email administrators, those that can be automated by email senders and those employed by researchers and law enforcement officials.\n\n\n\n== End-user techniques ==\nThere are a number of techniques that individuals can use to restrict the availability of their email addresses, with the goal of reducing their chance of receiving spam.\n\n\n*** Discretion ***\nSharing an email address only among a  limited group of correspondents is one way to limit the chance that the address will be \"harvested\" and targeted by spam. Similarly, when forwarding messages to a number of recipients who don't know one another, recipient addresses can be put in the  \"bcc: field\" so that each recipient does not get a list of the other recipients' email addresses.\n\n\n*** Address munging ***\n\nEmail addresses posted on webpages, Usenet or chat rooms are vulnerable to e-mail address harvesting. Address munging is the practice of disguising an e-mail address to prevent it from being automatically collected in this way, but still allow a human reader to reconstruct the original: an email address such as, \"no-one@example.com\", might be written as \"no-one at example dot com\", for instance. A related technique is to display all or part of the email address as an image, or as jumbled text with the order of characters restored using CSS.\n\n\n*** Avoid responding to spam ***\nA common piece of advice is to not to reply to spam messages as spammers may simply regard responses as confirmation that an email address is valid. Similarly, many spam messages contain web links or addresses which the user is directed to follow to be removed from the spammer's mailing list \u2013 and these should be treated as dangerous. In any case, sender addresses are often forged in spam messages, so that responding to spam may result in failed deliveries \u2013 or may reach completely innocent third parties.\n\n\n*** Contact forms ***\nBusinesses and individuals sometimes avoid publicising an email address by asking for contact to come via a \"contact form\" on a webpage \u2013 which then typically forwards the information via email. Such forms, however, are sometimes inconvenient to users, as they are not able to use their preferred email client, risk entering a faulty reply address, and are typically not notified about delivery problems. Further, contact forms have the drawback that they require a website with the appropriate technology.\nIn some cases contact forms also send the message to the email address given by the user. This allows the contact form to be used for sending spam, which may incur email deliverability problems from the site once the spam is reported and the sending IP is blacklisted.\n\n\n*** Disable HTML in email ***\n\nMany modern mail programs incorporate web browser functionality, such as the display of HTML, URLs, and images.\nAvoiding or disabling this feature does not help avoid spam. It may, however, be useful to avoid some problems if a user opens a spam message: offensive images, obfuscated hyperlinks, being tracked by web bugs,  being targeted by JavaScript or attacks upon security vulnerabilities in the HTML renderer. Mail clients which do not automatically download and display HTML, images or attachments have fewer risks, as do clients who have been configured to not display these by default.\n\n\n*** Disposable email addresses ***\n\nAn email user may sometimes need to give an address to a site without complete assurance that the site owner will not use it for sending spam. One way to mitigate the risk is to provide a disposable email address \u2014 an address which the user can disable or abandon which forwards email to a real account. A number of services provide disposable address forwarding. Addresses can be manually disabled, can expire after a given time interval, or can expire after a certain number of messages have been forwarded.\nDisposable email addresses can be used by users to track whether a site owner has disclosed an address, or had a security breach.\n\n\n*** Ham passwords ***\nSystems that use \"ham passwords\" ask unrecognised senders to include in their email a password that demonstrates that the email message is a \"ham\" (not spam) message. Typically the email address and ham password would be described on a web page, and the ham password would be included in the subject line of an email message (or appended to the \"username\" part of the email address using the \"plus addressing\" technique). Ham passwords are often combined with filtering systems which let through only those messages that have identified themselves as \"ham\".\n\n\n*** Reporting spam ***\n\nTracking down a spammer's ISP and reporting the offense can lead to the spammer's service being terminated and criminal prosecution.  Unfortunately, it can be difficult to track down the spammer, and while there are some online tools such as SpamCop and Network Abuse Clearinghouse to assist, they are not always accurate. Historically, reporting spam in this way has not played a large part in abating spam, since the spammers simply move their operation to another URL, ISP or network of IP addresses.\nIn many countries consumers may also report unwanted and deceptive commercial email to the authorities, e.g. in the US to the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), or similar agencies in other countries.\n\n== Automated techniques for email administrators ==\nThere are now a large number of applications, appliances, services, and software systems that email administrators can use to reduce the load of spam on their systems and mailboxes. In general these attempt to reject (or \"block\"), the majority of spam email outright at the SMTP connection stage. If they do accept a message, they will typically then analyze the content further \u2013 and may decide to  \"quarantine\" any categorised as spam.\n\n\n*** Authentication ***\n\nA number of systems have been developed that allow domain name owners to identify email as authorized. Many of these systems use the DNS to list sites authorized to send email on their behalf. After many other proposals, SPF, DKIM and DMARC are all now widely supported with growing adoption. While not directly attacking spam, these systems make it much harder to spoof addresses, a common technique of spammers - but also used in phishing, and other types of fraud via email.\n\n\n*** Challenge/response systems ***\n\nA method which may be used by internet service providers, by specialized services or enterprises to combat spam is to require unknown senders to pass various tests before their messages are delivered. These strategies are termed \"challenge/response systems\".\n\n\n*** Checksum-based filtering ***\nChecksum-based filter exploits the fact that the messages are sent in bulk, that is that they will be identical with small variations. Checksum-based filters strip out everything that might vary between messages, reduce what remains to a checksum, and look that checksum up in a database such as the  Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse which collects the checksums of messages that email recipients consider to be spam (some people have a button on their email client which they can click to nominate a message as being spam); if the checksum is in the database, the message is likely to be spam. To avoid being detected in this way, spammers will sometimes insert unique invisible gibberish known as hashbusters into the middle of each of their messages, to make each message have a unique checksum.\n\n\n*** Country-based filtering ***\nSome email servers expect to never communicate with particular countries from which they receive a great deal of spam.  Therefore, they use country-based filtering \u2013 a technique that blocks email from certain countries.  This technique is based on country of origin determined by the sender's IP address rather than any trait of the sender.\n\n\n*** DNS-based blacklists ***\n\nThere are large number of free and commercial DNS-based Blacklists, or DNSBLs which allow a mail server to quickly look up the IP of an incoming mail connection - and reject it if it is listed there. Administrators can choose from scores of DNSBLs, each of which reflects different policies: some list sites known to emit spam; others list open mail relays or proxies; others list ISPs known to support spam.\n\n\n*** URL filtering ***\n\nMost spam/phishing messages contain an URL that they entice victims into clicking on.  Thus, a popular technique since the early 2000s consists of extracting URLs from messages and looking them up in databases such as Spamhaus' Domain Block List (DBL), SURBL, and URIBL.\n\n\n*** Strict enforcement of RFC standards ***\n\nMany spammers use poorly written software or are unable to comply with the standards because they do not have legitimate control of the computer they are using to send spam (zombie computer).  By setting tighter limits on the deviation from RFC standards that the MTA will accept, a mail administrator can reduce spam significantly - but this also runs the risk of rejecting mail from older or poorly written or configured servers.\nGreeting delay \u2013 A sending server is required to wait until it has received the SMTP greeting banner before it sends any data. A deliberate pause can be introduced by receiving servers to allow them to detect and deny any spam-sending applications that do not wait to receive this banner.\nTemporary rejection \u2013 The greylisting technique is built on the fact that the SMTP protocol allows for temporary rejection of incoming messages. Greylisting temporarily rejects all messages from unknown senders or mail servers \u2013 using the standard 4xx error codes. All compliant MTAs will proceed to retry delivery later, but many spammers and spambots will not. The downside is that all legitimate messages from first-time senders will experience a delay in delivery.\nHELO/EHLO checking \u2013 RFC 5321 says that an SMTP server \"MAY verify that the domain name argument in the EHLO command actually corresponds to the IP address of the client. However, if the verification fails, the server MUST NOT refuse to accept a message on that basis.\" Systems can, however, be configured to \n\nRefuse connections from hosts that give an invalid HELO \u2013 for example, a HELO that is not an FQDN or is an IP address not surrounded by square brackets.\nRefusing connections from hosts that give an obviously fraudulent HELO\nRefusing to accept email whose HELO/EHLO argument does not resolve in DNSInvalid pipelining \u2013 Several SMTP commands are allowed to be placed in one network packet and \"pipelined\".  For example, if an email is sent with a CC: header, several SMTP \"RCPT TO\" commands might be placed in a single packet instead of one packet per \"RCPT TO\" command.  The SMTP protocol, however, requires that errors be checked and everything is synchronized at certain points.  Many spammers will send everything in a single packet since they do not care about errors and it is more efficient.  Some MTAs will detect this invalid pipelining and reject email sent this way.\nNolisting \u2013 The email servers for any given domain are specified in a prioritized list, via the MX records. The nolisting technique is simply the adding of an MX record pointing to a non-existent server as the \"primary\" (i.e. that with the lowest preference value) \u2013 which means that an initial mail contact will always fail. Many spam sources do not retry on failure, so the spammer will move on to the next victim; legitimate email servers should retry the next higher numbered MX, and normal email will be delivered with only a brief delay.\nQuit detection \u2013 An SMTP connection should always be closed with a QUIT command. Many spammers skip this step because their spam has already been sent and taking the time to properly close the connection takes time and bandwidth. Some MTAs are capable of detecting whether or not the connection is closed correctly and use this as a measure of how trustworthy the other system is.\n\n\n*** Honeypots ***\n\nAnother approach is simply creating an imitation MTA that gives the appearance of being an open mail relay, or an imitation TCP/IP proxy server that gives the appearance of being an open proxy. Spammers who probe systems for open relays and proxies will find such a host and attempt to send mail through it, wasting their time and resources, and potentially, revealing information about themselves and the origin of the spam they are sending to the entity that operates the honeypot. Such a system may simply discard the spam attempts, submit them to DNSBLs, or store them for analysis by the entity operating the honeypot that may enable identification of the spammer for blocking.\n\n\n*** Hybrid filtering ***\nSpamAssassin, Policyd-weight and others use some or all of the various tests for spam, and assign a numerical score to each test.  Each message is scanned for these patterns, and the applicable scores tallied up. If the total is above a fixed value, the message is rejected or flagged as spam. By ensuring that no single spam test by itself can flag a message as spam, the false positive rate can be greatly reduced.\n\n\n*** Outbound spam protection ***\nOutbound spam protection involves scanning email traffic as it exits a network, identifying spam messages and then taking an action such as blocking the message or shutting off the source of the traffic. While the primary impact of spam is on spam recipients, sending networks also experience financial costs, such as wasted bandwidth, and the risk of having their IP addresses blocked by receiving networks.\nOutbound spam protection not only stops spam, but also lets system administrators track down spam sources on their network and remediate them \u2013 for example, clearing malware from machines which have become infected with a virus or are participating in a botnet.\n\n\n*** PTR/reverse DNS checks ***\n\nThe PTR DNS records in the reverse DNS can be used for a number of things, including:\n\nMost email mail transfer agents (mail servers) use a forward-confirmed reverse DNS (FCrDNS) verification and if there is a valid domain name, put it into the \"Received:\" trace header field.\nSome email mail transfer agents will perform FCrDNS verification on the domain name given in the SMTP HELO and EHLO commands. See #Strict enforcement of RFC standards \u00a7 HELO/EHLO .\nTo check the domain names in the rDNS to see if they are likely from dial-up users, dynamically assigned addresses, or home-based broadband customers.  Since the vast majority of email that originates from these computers is spam, many mail servers also refuse email with missing or \"generic\" rDNS names.\nA Forward Confirmed reverse DNS verification can create a form of authentication that there is a valid relationship between the owner of a domain name and the owner of the network that has been given an IP address.  While reliant on the DNS infrastructure, which has known vulnerabilities, this authentication is strong enough that it can be used for whitelisting purposes because spammers and phishers cannot usually bypass this verification when they use zombie computers to forge the domains.\n\n\n*** Rule-based filtering ***\n\nContent filtering techniques rely on the specification of lists of words or regular expressions disallowed in mail messages. Thus, if a site receives spam advertising \"herbal Viagra\", the administrator might place this phrase in the filter configuration. The mail server would then reject any message containing the phrase.\nHeader filtering looks at the header of the email which contains information about the origin, destination and content of the message. Although spammers will often spoof fields in the header in order to hide their identity, or to try to make the email look more legitimate than it is many of these spoofing methods can be detected, and any violation of the RFC 5322 standard on how the header is to be formed can also serve as a basis for rejecting the message.\n\n\n*** SMTP callback verification ***\n\nSince a large percentage of spam has forged and invalid sender (\"from\") addresses, some spam can be detected by checking that this \"from\" address is valid.  A mail server can try to verify the sender address by making an SMTP connection back to the mail exchanger for the address, as if it were creating a bounce, but stopping just before any email is sent.\nCallback verification has various drawbacks:  (1) Since nearly all spam has forged return addresses, nearly all callbacks are to innocent third party mail servers that are unrelated to the spam; (2) When the spammer uses a trap address as his sender's address. If the receiving MTA tries to make the callback using the trap address in a MAIL FROM command, the receiving MTA's IP address will be blacklisted; (3) Finally, the standard VRFY and EXPN commands used to verify an address have been so exploited by spammers that few mail administrators enable them, leaving the receiving SMTP server no effective way to validate the sender's email address.\n\n\n*** SMTP proxy ***\n\nSMTP proxies allow combating spam in real time, combining sender's behavior controls, providing legitimate users immediate feedback, eliminating a need for quarantine.\n\n\n*** Spamtrapping ***\n\nSpamtrapping is the seeding of an email address so that spammers can find it, but normal users can not. If the email address is used then the sender must be a spammer and they are black listed.\nAs an example, if the email address \"spamtrap@example.org\" is placed in the source HTML of a web site in a way that it isn't displayed on the web page, human visitors to the website would not see it. Spammers, on the other hand, use web page scrapers and bots to harvest email addresses from HTML source code - so they would find this address. When the spammer later sends to the address the spamtrap knows this is highly likely to be a spammer and can take appropriate action.\n\n\n*** Statistical content filtering ***\n\nStatistical, or Bayesian, filtering once set up requires no administrative maintenance per se: instead, users mark messages as spam or nonspam and the filtering software learns from these judgements. Thus, it is matched to the end user's needs, and as long as users consistently mark/tag the emails, can respond quickly to changes in spam content. Statistical filters typically also look at message headers, considering not just the content but also peculiarities of the transport mechanism of the email.\nSoftware programs that implement statistical filtering include Bogofilter, DSPAM, SpamBayes, ASSP, CRM114, the email programs Mozilla and Mozilla Thunderbird, Mailwasher, and later revisions of SpamAssassin.\n\n\n*** Tarpits ***\n\nA tarpit is any server software which intentionally responds extremely slowly to client commands. By running a tarpit which treats acceptable mail normally and known spam slowly or which appears to be an open mail relay, a site can slow down the rate at which spammers can inject messages into the mail facility. Depending on the server and internet speed, a tarpit can slow an attack by a factor of around 500. Many systems will simply disconnect if the server doesn't respond quickly, which will eliminate the spam.  However, a few legitimate email systems will also not deal correctly with these delays. The fundamental idea is to slow the attack so that the perpetrator has to waste time without any significant success.An organization can successfully deploy a tarpit if it is able to define the range of addresses, protocols, and ports for deception. The process involves a router passing the supported traffic to the appropriate server while those sent by other contacts are sent to the tarpit. Examples of tarpits include the Labrea tarpit, Honeyd, SMTP tarpits, and IP-level tarpits.\n\n\n*** Collateral damage ***\nMeasures to protect against spam can cause collateral damage. This includes:\n\nThe measures may consume resources, both in the server and on the network.When a mail server rejects legitimate messages, the sender needs to contact the recipient out of channel.When legitimate messages are relegated to a spam folder, the sender is not notified of this.If a recipient periodically checks his spam folder, that will cost him time and if there is a lot of spam it is easy to overlook the few legitimate messages.Measures that imposes costs on a third party server may be considered to be abuse and result in deliverability problems.\n\n== Automated techniques for email senders ==\nThere are a variety of techniques that email senders use to try to make sure that they do not send spam.  Failure to control the amount of spam sent, as judged by email receivers, can often cause even legitimate email to be blocked and for the sender to be put on DNSBLs.\n\n\n*** Background checks on new users and customers ***\nSince spammer's accounts are frequently disabled due to violations of abuse policies, they are constantly trying to create new accounts.  Due to the damage done to an ISP's reputation when it is the source of spam, many ISPs and web email providers use CAPTCHAs on new accounts to verify that it is a real human registering the account, and not an automated spamming system.  They can also verify that credit cards are not stolen before accepting new customers, check the Spamhaus Project ROKSO list, and do other background checks.\n\n\n*** Confirmed opt-in for mailing lists ***\n\nA malicious person can easily attempt to subscribe another user to a mailing list \u2014 to harass them, or to make the company or organisation appear to be spamming. To prevent this, all modern mailing list management programs (such as GNU Mailman, LISTSERV, Majordomo, and qmail's ezmlm) support \"confirmed opt-in\" by default. Whenever an email address is presented for subscription to the list, the software will send a confirmation message to that address. The confirmation message contains no advertising content, so it is not construed to be spam itself, and the address is not added to the live mail list unless the recipient responds to the confirmation message.\n\n\n*** Egress spam filtering ***\n\nEmail senders typically now do the same type of anti-spam checks on email coming from their users and customers as for inward email coming from the rest of the Internet. This protects their reputation, which could otherwise be harmed in the case of infection by spam-sending malware.\n\n\n*** Limit email backscatter ***\n\nIf a receiving server initially fully accepts an email, and only later determines that the message is spam or to a non-existent recipient, it will generate a bounce message back to the supposed sender. However, if (as is often the case with spam), the sender information on the incoming email was forged to be that of an unrelated third party then this bounce message is backscatter spam. For this reason it is generally preferable for most rejection of incoming email to happen during the SMTP connection stage, with a 5xx error code, while the sending server is still connected. In this case then the sending server will report the problem to the real sender cleanly.\n\n\n*** Port 25 blocking ***\nFirewalls and routers can be programmed to not allow SMTP traffic (TCP port 25) from machines on the network that are not supposed to run Mail Transfer Agents or send email.  This practice is somewhat controversial when ISPs block home users, especially if the ISPs do not allow the blocking to be turned off upon request.  Email can still be sent from these computers to designated smart hosts via port 25 and to other smart hosts via the email submission port 587.\n\n\n*** Port 25 interception ***\nNetwork address translation can be used to intercept all port 25 (SMTP) traffic and direct it to a mail server that enforces rate limiting and egress spam filtering.  This is commonly done in hotels, but it can cause email privacy problems, as well making it impossible to use STARTTLS and SMTP-AUTH if the port 587 submission port isn't used.\n\n\n*** Rate limiting ***\nMachines that suddenly start sending lots of email may well have become zombie computers.  By limiting the rate that email can be sent around what is typical for the computer in question, legitimate email can still be sent, but large spam runs can be slowed down until manual investigation can be done.\n\n\n*** Spam report feedback loops ***\n\nBy monitoring spam reports from places such as spamcop, AOL's feedback loop, and Network Abuse Clearinghouse, the domain's abuse@ mailbox, etc., ISPs can often learn of problems before they seriously damage the ISP's reputation and have their mail servers blacklisted.\n\n\n*** FROM field control ***\nBoth malicious software and human spam senders often use forged FROM addresses when sending spam messages. Control may be enforced on SMTP servers to ensure senders can only use their correct email address in the FROM field of outgoing messages. In an email users database each user has a record with an email address. The SMTP server must check if the email address in the FROM field of an outgoing message is the same address that belongs to the user's credentials, supplied for SMTP authentication. If the FROM field is forged, an SMTP error will be returned to the email client (e.g. \"You do not own the email address you are trying to send from\").\n\n\n*** Strong AUP and TOS agreements ***\nMost ISPs and webmail providers have either an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) or a Terms of Service (TOS) agreement that discourages spammers from using their system and allows the spammer to be terminated quickly for violations.\n\n== Legal measures ==\n\nFrom 2000 onwards, many countries enacted specific legislation to criminalize spamming, and appropriate legislation and enforcement can have a significant impact on spamming activity. Where legislation provides specific text that bulk emailers must include, this also makes \"legitimate\" bulk email easier to identify.\nIncreasingly, anti-spam efforts have led to co-ordination between law enforcement, researchers, major consumer financial service companies and Internet service providers in monitoring and tracking email spam, identity theft and phishing activities and gathering evidence for criminal cases.Analysis of the sites being spamvertised by a given piece of spam can often be followed up with domain registrars with good results.\n\n== New solutions and ongoing research ==\nSeveral approaches have been proposed to improve the email system.\n\n\n*** Cost-based systems ***\n\nSince spamming is facilitated by the fact that large volumes of email are very inexpensive to send, one proposed set of solutions would require that senders pay some cost in order to send email, making it prohibitively expensive for spammers. Anti-spam activist  Daniel Balsam attempts to make spamming less profitable by bringing lawsuits against spammers.\n\n\n*** Machine-learning-based systems ***\nArtificial intelligence techniques can be deployed for filtering spam emails, such as artificial neural networks algorithms and Bayesian filters. These methods use probabilistic methods to train the networks, such as examination of the concentration or frequency of words seen in the spam versus legitimate email contents.\n\n\n*** Other techniques ***\nChannel email is a new proposal for sending email that attempts to distribute anti-spam activities by forcing verification (probably using bounce messages so back-scatter does not occur) when the first email is sent for new contacts.\n\n\n*** Research conferences ***\nSpam is the subject of several research conferences, including:\n\nTREC\n\nQuestion: What is outbound spam protection and how does it help prevent spam?\n\nAnswer:",

This helps prevent spam by stopping spam sources on the network and remediating them, such as clearing malware from machines that have become infected with a virus or are participating in a botnet.",
      "context": "Anti-spam techniques\n\n==Introduction==\nVarious anti-spam techniques are used to prevent email spam (unsolicited bulk email).\nNo technique is a complete solution to the spam problem, and each has trade-offs between incorrectly rejecting legitimate email (false positives) as opposed to not rejecting all spam email (false negatives) \u2013 and the associated costs in time, effort, and cost of wrongfully obstructing good mail.Anti-spam techniques can be broken into four broad categories: those that require actions by individuals, those that can be automated by email administrators, those that can be automated by email senders and those employed by researchers and law enforcement officials.\n\n\n\n== End-user techniques ==\nThere are a number of techniques that individuals can use to restrict the availability of their email addresses, with the goal of reducing their chance of receiving spam.\n\n\n*** Discretion ***\nSharing an email address only among a  limited group of correspondents is one way to limit the chance that the address will be \"harvested\" and targeted by spam. Similarly, when forwarding messages to a number of recipients who don't know one another, recipient addresses can be put in the  \"bcc: field\" so that each recipient does not get a list of the other recipients' email addresses.\n\n\n*** Address munging ***\n\nEmail addresses posted on webpages, Usenet or chat rooms are vulnerable to e-mail address harvesting. Address munging is the practice of disguising an e-mail address to prevent it from being automatically collected in this way, but still allow a human reader to reconstruct the original: an email address such as, \"no-one@example.com\", might be written as \"no-one at example dot com\", for instance. A related technique is to display all or part of the email address as an image, or as jumbled text with the order of characters restored using CSS.\n\n\n*** Avoid responding to spam ***\nA common piece of advice is to not to reply to spam messages as spammers may simply regard responses as confirmation that an email address is valid. Similarly, many spam messages contain web links or addresses which the user is directed to follow to be removed from the spammer's mailing list \u2013 and these should be treated as dangerous. In any case, sender addresses are often forged in spam messages, so that responding to spam may result in failed deliveries \u2013 or may reach completely innocent third parties.\n\n\n*** Contact forms ***\nBusinesses and individuals sometimes avoid publicising an email address by asking for contact to come via a \"contact form\" on a webpage \u2013 which then typically forwards the information via email. Such forms, however, are sometimes inconvenient to users, as they are not able to use their preferred email client, risk entering a faulty reply address, and are typically not notified about delivery problems. Further, contact forms have the drawback that they require a website with the appropriate technology.\nIn some cases contact forms also send the message to the email address given by the user. This allows the contact form to be used for sending spam, which may incur email deliverability problems from the site once the spam is reported and the sending IP is blacklisted.\n\n\n*** Disable HTML in email ***\n\nMany modern mail programs incorporate web browser functionality, such as the display of HTML, URLs, and images.\nAvoiding or disabling this feature does not help avoid spam. It may, however, be useful to avoid some problems if a user opens a spam message: offensive images, obfuscated hyperlinks, being tracked by web bugs,  being targeted by JavaScript or attacks upon security vulnerabilities in the HTML renderer. Mail clients which do not automatically download and display HTML, images or attachments have fewer risks, as do clients who have been configured to not display these by default.\n\n\n*** Disposable email addresses ***\n\nAn email user may sometimes need to give an address to a site without complete assurance that the site owner will not use it for sending spam. One way to mitigate the risk is to provide a disposable email address \u2014 an address which the user can disable or abandon which forwards email to a real account. A number of services provide disposable address forwarding. Addresses can be manually disabled, can expire after a given time interval, or can expire after a certain number of messages have been forwarded.\nDisposable email addresses can be used by users to track whether a site owner has disclosed an address, or had a security breach.\n\n\n*** Ham passwords ***\nSystems that use \"ham passwords\" ask unrecognised senders to include in their email a password that demonstrates that the email message is a \"ham\" (not spam) message. Typically the email address and ham password would be described on a web page, and the ham password would be included in the subject line of an email message (or appended to the \"username\" part of the email address using the \"plus addressing\" technique). Ham passwords are often combined with filtering systems which let through only those messages that have identified themselves as \"ham\".\n\n\n*** Reporting spam ***\n\nTracking down a spammer's ISP and reporting the offense can lead to the spammer's service being terminated and criminal prosecution.  Unfortunately, it can be difficult to track down the spammer, and while there are some online tools such as SpamCop and Network Abuse Clearinghouse to assist, they are not always accurate. Historically, reporting spam in this way has not played a large part in abating spam, since the spammers simply move their operation to another URL, ISP or network of IP addresses.\nIn many countries consumers may also report unwanted and deceptive commercial email to the authorities, e.g. in the US to the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), or similar agencies in other countries.\n\n== Automated techniques for email administrators ==\nThere are now a large number of applications, appliances, services, and software systems that email administrators can use to reduce the load of spam on their systems and mailboxes. In general these attempt to reject (or \"block\"), the majority of spam email outright at the SMTP connection stage. If they do accept a message, they will typically then analyze the content further \u2013 and may decide to  \"quarantine\" any categorised as spam.\n\n\n*** Authentication ***\n\nA number of systems have been developed that allow domain name owners to identify email as authorized. Many of these systems use the DNS to list sites authorized to send email on their behalf. After many other proposals, SPF, DKIM and DMARC are all now widely supported with growing adoption. While not directly attacking spam, these systems make it much harder to spoof addresses, a common technique of spammers - but also used in phishing, and other types of fraud via email.\n\n\n*** Challenge/response systems ***\n\nA method which may be used by internet service providers, by specialized services or enterprises to combat spam is to require unknown senders to pass various tests before their messages are delivered. These strategies are termed \"challenge/response systems\".\n\n\n*** Checksum-based filtering ***\nChecksum-based filter exploits the fact that the messages are sent in bulk, that is that they will be identical with small variations. Checksum-based filters strip out everything that might vary between messages, reduce what remains to a checksum, and look that checksum up in a database such as the  Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse which collects the checksums of messages that email recipients consider to be spam (some people have a button on their email client which they can click to nominate a message as being spam); if the checksum is in the database, the message is likely to be spam. To avoid being detected in this way, spammers will sometimes insert unique invisible gibberish known as hashbusters into the middle of each of their messages, to make each message have a unique checksum.\n\n\n*** Country-based filtering ***\nSome email servers expect to never communicate with particular countries from which they receive a great deal of spam.  Therefore, they use country-based filtering \u2013 a technique that blocks email from certain countries.  This technique is based on country of origin determined by the sender's IP address rather than any trait of the sender.\n\n\n*** DNS-based blacklists ***\n\nThere are large number of free and commercial DNS-based Blacklists, or DNSBLs which allow a mail server to quickly look up the IP of an incoming mail connection - and reject it if it is listed there. Administrators can choose from scores of DNSBLs, each of which reflects different policies: some list sites known to emit spam; others list open mail relays or proxies; others list ISPs known to support spam.\n\n\n*** URL filtering ***\n\nMost spam/phishing messages contain an URL that they entice victims into clicking on.  Thus, a popular technique since the early 2000s consists of extracting URLs from messages and looking them up in databases such as Spamhaus' Domain Block List (DBL), SURBL, and URIBL.\n\n\n*** Strict enforcement of RFC standards ***\n\nMany spammers use poorly written software or are unable to comply with the standards because they do not have legitimate control of the computer they are using to send spam (zombie computer).  By setting tighter limits on the deviation from RFC standards that the MTA will accept, a mail administrator can reduce spam significantly - but this also runs the risk of rejecting mail from older or poorly written or configured servers.\nGreeting delay \u2013 A sending server is required to wait until it has received the SMTP greeting banner before it sends any data. A deliberate pause can be introduced by receiving servers to allow them to detect and deny any spam-sending applications that do not wait to receive this banner.\nTemporary rejection \u2013 The greylisting technique is built on the fact that the SMTP protocol allows for temporary rejection of incoming messages. Greylisting temporarily rejects all messages from unknown senders or mail servers \u2013 using the standard 4xx error codes. All compliant MTAs will proceed to retry delivery later, but many spammers and spambots will not. The downside is that all legitimate messages from first-time senders will experience a delay in delivery.\nHELO/EHLO checking \u2013 RFC 5321 says that an SMTP server \"MAY verify that the domain name argument in the EHLO command actually corresponds to the IP address of the client. However, if the verification fails, the server MUST NOT refuse to accept a message on that basis.\" Systems can, however, be configured to \n\nRefuse connections from hosts that give an invalid HELO \u2013 for example, a HELO that is not an FQDN or is an IP address not surrounded by square brackets.\nRefusing connections from hosts that give an obviously fraudulent HELO\nRefusing to accept email whose HELO/EHLO argument does not resolve in DNSInvalid pipelining \u2013 Several SMTP commands are allowed to be placed in one network packet and \"pipelined\".  For example, if an email is sent with a CC: header, several SMTP \"RCPT TO\" commands might be placed in a single packet instead of one packet per \"RCPT TO\" command.  The SMTP protocol, however, requires that errors be checked and everything is synchronized at certain points.  Many spammers will send everything in a single packet since they do not care about errors and it is more efficient.  Some MTAs will detect this invalid pipelining and reject email sent this way.\nNolisting \u2013 The email servers for any given domain are specified in a prioritized list, via the MX records. The nolisting technique is simply the adding of an MX record pointing to a non-existent server as the \"primary\" (i.e. that with the lowest preference value) \u2013 which means that an initial mail contact will always fail. Many spam sources do not retry on failure, so the spammer will move on to the next victim; legitimate email servers should retry the next higher numbered MX, and normal email will be delivered with only a brief delay.\nQuit detection \u2013 An SMTP connection should always be closed with a QUIT command. Many spammers skip this step because their spam has already been sent and taking the time to properly close the connection takes time and bandwidth. Some MTAs are capable of detecting whether or not the connection is closed correctly and use this as a measure of how trustworthy the other system is.\n\n\n*** Honeypots ***\n\nAnother approach is simply creating an imitation MTA that gives the appearance of being an open mail relay, or an imitation TCP/IP proxy server that gives the appearance of being an open proxy. Spammers who probe systems for open relays and proxies will find such a host and attempt to send mail through it, wasting their time and resources, and potentially, revealing information about themselves and the origin of the spam they are sending to the entity that operates the honeypot. Such a system may simply discard the spam attempts, submit them to DNSBLs, or store them for analysis by the entity operating the honeypot that may enable identification of the spammer for blocking.\n\n\n*** Hybrid filtering ***\nSpamAssassin, Policyd-weight and others use some or all of the various tests for spam, and assign a numerical score to each test.  Each message is scanned for these patterns, and the applicable scores tallied up. If the total is above a fixed value, the message is rejected or flagged as spam. By ensuring that no single spam test by itself can flag a message as spam, the false positive rate can be greatly reduced.\n\n\n*** Outbound spam protection ***\nOutbound spam protection involves scanning email traffic as it exits a network, identifying spam messages and then taking an action such as blocking the message or shutting off the source of the traffic. While the primary impact of spam is on spam recipients, sending networks also experience financial costs, such as wasted bandwidth, and the risk of having their IP addresses blocked by receiving networks.\nOutbound spam protection not only stops spam, but also lets system administrators track down spam sources on their network and remediate them \u2013 for example, clearing malware from machines which have become infected with a virus or are participating in a botnet.\n\n\n*** PTR/reverse DNS checks ***\n\nThe PTR DNS records in the reverse DNS can be used for a number of things, including:\n\nMost email mail transfer agents (mail servers) use a forward-confirmed reverse DNS (FCrDNS) verification and if there is a valid domain name, put it into the \"Received:\" trace header field.\nSome email mail transfer agents will perform FCrDNS verification on the domain name given in the SMTP HELO and EHLO commands. See #Strict enforcement of RFC standards \u00a7 HELO/EHLO .\nTo check the domain names in the rDNS to see if they are likely from dial-up users, dynamically assigned addresses, or home-based broadband customers.  Since the vast majority of email that originates from these computers is spam, many mail servers also refuse email with missing or \"generic\" rDNS names.\nA Forward Confirmed reverse DNS verification can create a form of authentication that there is a valid relationship between the owner of a domain name and the owner of the network that has been given an IP address.

Thus, if a site receives spam advertising \"herbal Viagra\", the administrator might place this phrase in the filter configuration. The mail server would then reject any message containing the phrase.\nHeader filtering looks at the header of the email which contains information about the origin, destination and content of the message. Although spammers will often spoof fields in the header in order to hide their identity, or to try to make the email look more legitimate than it is many of these spoofing methods can be detected, and any violation of the RFC 5322 standard on how the header is to be formed can also serve as a basis for rejecting the message.\n\n\n*** SMTP callback verification ***\n\nSince a large percentage of spam has forged and invalid sender (\"from\") addresses, some spam can be detected by checking that this \"from\" address is valid.  A mail server can try to verify the sender address by making an SMTP connection back to the mail exchanger for the address, as if it were creating a bounce, but stopping just before any email is sent.\nCallback verification has various drawbacks:  (1) Since nearly all spam has forged return addresses, nearly all callbacks are to innocent third party mail servers that are unrelated to the spam; (2) When the spammer uses a trap address as his sender's address. If the receiving MTA tries to make the callback using the trap address in a MAIL FROM command, the receiving MTA's IP address will be blacklisted; (3) Finally, the standard VRFY and EXPN commands used to verify an address have been so exploited by spammers that few mail administrators enable them, leaving the receiving SMTP server no effective way to validate the sender's email address.\n\n\n*** SMTP proxy ***\n\nSMTP proxies allow combating spam in real time, combining sender's behavior controls, providing legitimate users immediate feedback, eliminating a need for quarantine.\n\n\n*** Spamtrapping ***\n\nSpamtrapping is the seeding of an email address so that spammers can find it, but normal users can not. If the email address is used then the sender must be a spammer and they are black listed.\nAs an example, if the email address \"spamtrap@example.org\" is placed in the source HTML of a web site in a way that it isn't displayed on the web page, human visitors to the website would not see it. Spammers, on the other hand, use web page scrapers and bots to harvest email addresses from HTML source code - so they would find this address. When the spammer later sends to the address the spamtrap knows this is highly likely to be a spammer and can take appropriate action.\n\n\n*** Statistical content filtering ***\n\nStatistical, or Bayesian, filtering once set up requires no administrative maintenance per se: instead, users mark messages as spam or nonspam and the filtering software learns from these judgements. Thus, it is matched to the end user's needs, and as long as users consistently mark/tag the emails, can respond quickly to changes in spam content. Statistical filters typically also look at message headers, considering not just the content but also peculiarities of the transport mechanism of the email.\nSoftware programs that implement statistical filtering include Bogofilter, DSPAM, SpamBayes, ASSP, CRM114, the email programs Mozilla and Mozilla Thunderbird, Mailwasher, and later revisions of SpamAssassin.\n\n\n*** Tarpits ***\n\nA tarpit is any server software which intentionally responds extremely slowly to client commands. By running a tarpit which treats acceptable mail normally and known spam slowly or which appears to be an open mail relay, a site can slow down the rate at which spammers can inject messages into the mail facility. Depending on the server and internet speed, a tarpit can slow an attack by a factor of around 500. Many systems will simply disconnect if the server doesn't respond quickly, which will eliminate the spam.  However, a few legitimate email systems will also not deal correctly with these delays. The fundamental idea is to slow the attack so that the perpetrator has to waste time without any significant success.An organization can successfully deploy a tarpit if it is able to define the range of addresses, protocols, and ports for deception. The process involves a router passing the supported traffic to the appropriate server while those sent by other contacts are sent to the tarpit. Examples of tarpits include the Labrea tarpit, Honeyd, SMTP tarpits, and IP-level tarpits.\n\n\n*** Collateral damage ***\nMeasures to protect against spam can cause collateral damage. This includes:\n\nThe measures may consume resources, both in the server and on the network.When a mail server rejects legitimate messages, the sender needs to contact the recipient out of channel.When legitimate messages are relegated to a spam folder, the sender is not notified of this.If a recipient periodically checks his spam folder, that will cost him time and if there is a lot of spam it is easy to overlook the few legitimate messages.Measures that imposes costs on a third party server may be considered to be abuse and result in deliverability problems.\n\n== Automated techniques for email senders ==\nThere are a variety of techniques that email senders use to try to make sure that they do not send spam.  Failure to control the amount of spam sent, as judged by email receivers, can often cause even legitimate email to be blocked and for the sender to be put on DNSBLs.\n\n\n*** Background checks on new users and customers ***\nSince spammer's accounts are frequently disabled due to violations of abuse policies, they are constantly trying to create new accounts.  Due to the damage done to an ISP's reputation when it is the source of spam, many ISPs and web email providers use CAPTCHAs on new accounts to verify that it is a real human registering the account, and not an automated spamming system.  They can also verify that credit cards are not stolen before accepting new customers, check the Spamhaus Project ROKSO list, and do other background checks.\n\n\n*** Confirmed opt-in for mailing lists ***\n\nA malicious person can easily attempt to subscribe another user to a mailing list \u2014 to harass them, or to make the company or organisation appear to be spamming. To prevent this, all modern mailing list management programs (such as GNU Mailman, LISTSERV, Majordomo, and qmail's ezmlm) support \"confirmed opt-in\" by default. Whenever an email address is presented for subscription to the list, the software will send a confirmation message to that address. The confirmation message contains no advertising content, so it is not construed to be spam itself, and the address is not added to the live mail list unless the recipient responds to the confirmation message.\n\n\n*** Egress spam filtering ***\n\nEmail senders typically now do the same type of anti-spam checks on email coming from their users and customers as for inward email coming from the rest of the Internet. This protects their reputation, which could otherwise be harmed in the case of infection by spam-sending malware.\n\n\n*** Limit email backscatter ***\n\nIf a receiving server initially fully accepts an email, and only later determines that the message is spam or to a non-existent recipient, it will generate a bounce message back to the supposed sender. However, if (as is often the case with spam), the sender information on the incoming email was forged to be that of an unrelated third party then this bounce message is backscatter spam. For this reason it is generally preferable for most rejection of incoming email to happen during the SMTP connection stage, with a 5xx error code, while the sending server is still connected. In this case then the sending server will report the problem to the real sender cleanly.\n\n\n*** Port 25 blocking ***\nFirewalls and routers can be programmed to not allow SMTP traffic (TCP port 25) from machines on the network that are not supposed to run Mail Transfer Agents or send email.  This practice is somewhat controversial when ISPs block home users, especially if the ISPs do not allow the blocking to be turned off upon request.  Email can still be sent from these computers to designated smart hosts via port 25 and to other smart hosts via the email submission port 587.\n\n\n*** Port 25 interception ***\nNetwork address translation can be used to intercept all port 25 (SMTP) traffic and direct it to a mail server that enforces rate limiting and egress spam filtering.  This is commonly done in hotels, but it can cause email privacy problems, as well making it impossible to use STARTTLS and SMTP-AUTH if the port 587 submission port isn't used.\n\n\n*** Rate limiting ***\nMachines that suddenly start sending lots of email may well have become zombie computers.  By limiting the rate that email can be sent around what is typical for the computer in question, legitimate email can still be sent, but large spam runs can be slowed down until manual investigation can be done.\n\n\n*** Spam report feedback loops ***\n\nBy monitoring spam reports from places such as spamcop, AOL's feedback loop, and Network Abuse Clearinghouse, the domain's abuse@ mailbox, etc., ISPs can often learn of problems before they seriously damage the ISP's reputation and have their mail servers blacklisted.\n\n\n*** FROM field control ***\nBoth malicious software and human spam senders often use forged FROM addresses when sending spam messages. Control may be enforced on SMTP servers to ensure senders can only use their correct email address in the FROM field of outgoing messages. In an email users database each user has a record with an email address. The SMTP server must check if the email address in the FROM field of an outgoing message is the same address that belongs to the user's credentials, supplied for SMTP authentication. If the FROM field is forged, an SMTP error will be returned to the email client (e.g. \"You do not own the email address you are trying to send from\").\n\n\n*** Strong AUP and TOS agreements ***\nMost ISPs and webmail providers have either an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) or a Terms of Service (TOS) agreement that discourages spammers from using their system and allows the spammer to be terminated quickly for violations.\n\n== Legal measures ==\n\nFrom 2000 onwards, many countries enacted specific legislation to criminalize spamming, and appropriate legislation and enforcement can have a significant impact on spamming activity. Where legislation provides specific text that bulk emailers must include, this also makes \"legitimate\" bulk email easier to identify.\nIncreasingly, anti-spam efforts have led to co-ordination between law enforcement, researchers, major consumer financial service companies and Internet service providers in monitoring and tracking email spam, identity theft and phishing activities and gathering evidence for criminal cases.Analysis of the sites being spamvertised by a given piece of spam can often be followed up with domain registrars with good results.\n\n== New solutions and ongoing research ==\nSeveral approaches have been proposed to improve the email system.\n\n\n*** Cost-based systems ***\n\nSince spamming is facilitated by the fact that large volumes of email are very inexpensive to send, one proposed set of solutions would require that senders pay some cost in order to send email, making it prohibitively expensive for spammers. Anti-spam activist  Daniel Balsam attempts to make spamming less profitable by bringing lawsuits against spammers.\n\n\n*** Machine-learning-based systems ***\nArtificial intelligence techniques can be deployed for filtering spam emails, such as artificial neural networks algorithms and Bayesian filters. These methods use probabilistic methods to train the networks, such as examination of the concentration or frequency of words seen in the spam versus legitimate email contents.\n\n\n*** Other techniques ***\nChannel email is a new proposal for sending email that attempts to distribute anti-spam activities by forcing verification (probably using bounce messages so back-scatter does not occur) when the first email is sent for new contacts.\n\n\n*** Research conferences ***\nSpam is the subject of several research conferences, including:\n\nTREC"

By contrast, parts of a computer system that lie outside the TCB must not be able to misbehave in a way that would leak any more privileges than are granted to them in accordance to the system's security policy.\nThe careful design and implementation of a system's trusted computing base is paramount to its overall security. Modern operating systems strive to reduce the size of the TCB so that an exhaustive examination of its code base (by means of manual or computer-assisted software audit or program verification) becomes feasible.\n\n== Definition and characterization ==\nThe term trusted computing base goes back to John Rushby, who defined it as the combination of operating system kernel and trusted processes. The latter refers to processes which are allowed to violate the system's access-control rules.\nIn the classic paper Authentication in Distributed Systems: Theory and Practice Lampson et al. define the TCB of a computer system as simply\n\na small amount of software and hardware that security depends on and that we distinguish from a much larger amount that can misbehave without affecting security.Both definitions, while clear and convenient, are neither theoretically exact nor intended to be, as e.g. a network server process under a UNIX-like operating system might fall victim to a security breach and compromise an important part of the system's security, yet is not part of the operating system's TCB. The Orange Book, another classic computer security literature reference, therefore provides a more formal definition of the TCB of a computer system, as\n\nthe totality of protection mechanisms within it, including hardware, firmware, and software, the combination of which is responsible for enforcing a computer security policy.In other words, trusted computing base (TCB) is a combination of hardware, software, and controls that work together to form a trusted base to enforce your security policy.\nThe Orange Book further explains that\n\n[t]he ability of a trusted computing base to enforce correctly a unified security policy depends on the correctness of the mechanisms within the trusted computing base, the protection of those mechanisms to ensure their correctness, and the correct input of parameters related to the security policy.In other words, a given piece of hardware or software is a part of the TCB if and only if it has been designed to be a part of the mechanism that provides its security to the computer system. In operating systems, this typically consists of the kernel (or microkernel) and a select set of system utilities (for example, setuid programs and daemons in UNIX systems). In programming languages designed with built-in security features, such as Java and E, the TCB is formed of the language runtime and standard library.\n\n== Properties ==\n\n\n*** Predicated upon the security policy ***\nAs a consequence of the above Orange Book definition, the boundaries of the TCB depend closely upon the specifics of how the security policy is fleshed out. In the network server example above, even though, say, a Web server that serves a multi-user application is not part of the operating system's TCB, it has the responsibility of performing access control so that the users cannot usurp the identity and privileges of each other. In this sense, it definitely is part of the TCB of the larger computer system that comprises the UNIX server, the user's browsers and the Web application; in other words, breaching into the Web server through e.g. a buffer overflow may not be regarded as a compromise of the operating system proper, but it certainly constitutes a damaging exploit on the Web application.\nThis fundamental relativity of the boundary of the TCB is exemplified by the concept of the 'target of evaluation' ('TOE') in the Common Criteria security process: in the course of a Common Criteria security evaluation, one of the first decisions that must be made is the boundary of the audit in terms of the list of system components that will come under scrutiny.\n\n\n*** A prerequisite to security ***\nSystems that don't have a trusted computing base as part of their design do not provide security of their own: they are only secure insofar as security is provided to them by external means (e.g. a computer sitting in a locked room without a network connection may be considered secure depending on the policy, regardless of the software it runs). This is because, as David J. Farber et al. put it, [i]n a computer system, the integrity of lower layers is typically treated as axiomatic by higher layers. As far as computer security is concerned, reasoning about the security properties of a computer system requires being able to make sound assumptions about what it can, and more importantly, cannot do; however, barring any reason to believe otherwise, a computer is able to do everything that a general Von Neumann machine can. This obviously includes operations that would be deemed contrary to all but the simplest security policies, such as divulging an email or password that should be kept secret; however, barring special provisions in the architecture of the system, there is no denying that the computer could be programmed to perform these undesirable tasks.\nThese special provisions that aim at preventing certain kinds of actions from being executed, in essence, constitute the trusted computing base. For this reason, the Orange Book (still a reference on the design of secure operating systems as of 2007) characterizes the various security assurance levels that it defines mainly in terms of the structure and security features of the TCB.\n\n\n*** Software parts of the TCB need to protect themselves ***\nAs outlined by the aforementioned Orange Book, software portions of the trusted computing base need to protect themselves against tampering to be of any effect.

This can be prevented by special memory management provisions that subsequently have to be treated as part of the TCB. Specifically, the trusted computing base must at least prevent its own software from being written to.\nIn many modern CPUs, the protection of the memory that hosts the TCB is achieved by adding in a specialized piece of hardware called the memory management unit (MMU), which is programmable by the operating system to allow and deny a running program's access to specific ranges of the system memory. Of course, the operating system is also able to disallow such programming to the other programs.

    "instruction": "Remote SIM provisioning\n\n==Introduction==\nRemote SIM provisioning is a specification realized by GSMA that allows consumers to remotely activate the subscriber identity module (SIM) embedded in a portable device such as a smart phone, smart watch, fitness band or tablet computer. The specification was originally part of the GSMA's work on eSIM and it is important to note that remote SIM provisioning is just one of the aspects that this eSIM specification includes. The other aspects being that the SIM is now structured into \"domains\" that separate the operator profile from the security and application \"domains\". In practise \"eSIM upgrade\" in the form of a normal SIM card is possible (using the Android 9 eSIM APIs) or eSIM can be included into an SOC. The requirement of GSMA certification is that personalisation packet is decoded inside the chip and so there is no way to dump Ki, OPc and 5G keys. Another important aspect is that the eSIM is owned by the enterprise, and this means that the enterprise now has full control of the security and applications in the eSIM, and which operators profiles are to be used.\n\n== Background to the specification ==\nIn the background of the technology looked to address the following issues:\n\nThe development of non-removable SIM technology - a new generation of SIM-cards like MFF which are soldered into the device.\nThe appearance and support by mobile operators of the concept of ABC (always best connected) \u2013 the opportunity get quality connections from any mobile operator at any point in time.\nThe explosive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) - according to Gartner about 8.4 billion connections in 2017 (up 31% from 2016).\nThe cost and effort required to swap a SIM in a device that has been deployed in the field.\n\n== Origin ==\nThe GSM Association (GSMA) which brings together about 800 operators and 250 mobile ecosystem companies became the first to come up with the Consumer Remote SIM Provisioning initiative. The beginning of creation the technology was announced in the summer 2014. The complete version of the specification was realized in February, 2016.\nInitially, the specification was supposed to be used just by M2M devices, but since December, 2015 it has begun being spread over various custom wearable devices, and into enterprise applications like authentication and identity management.\n\"This new specification gives consumers the freedom to remotely connect devices, such as wearables, to a mobile network of their choice and continues to evolve the process of connecting new and innovative devices,\" Alex Sinclair, Chief Technology Officer, GSMA.\nBesides, the right of independent service providers to transmit commands of loading profiles to SIM-cards in the device has been amended and the possibility to store arrays of profiles in independent certified data centers (Subscriptions manager) has appeared.\n\n== Functions and benefits ==\nThe specification that covers the carrier selection aspects aims to allow consumers to choose a mobile network operator from a wide range to activate the SIM embedded in a device via a subscription. It aims to simplify the users\u2019 life by connecting their multiple devices through the same subscription. It should also motivate mobile device manufacturers to develop the next generation of the mobile-connected devices that will suit better the wearable technology applications.

      "context": "Remote SIM provisioning\n\n==Introduction==\nRemote SIM provisioning is a specification realized by GSMA that allows consumers to remotely activate the subscriber identity module (SIM) embedded in a portable device such as a smart phone, smart watch, fitness band or tablet computer. The specification was originally part of the GSMA's work on eSIM and it is important to note that remote SIM provisioning is just one of the aspects that this eSIM specification includes. The other aspects being that the SIM is now structured into \"domains\" that separate the operator profile from the security and application \"domains\". In practise \"eSIM upgrade\" in the form of a normal SIM card is possible (using the Android 9 eSIM APIs) or eSIM can be included into an SOC. The requirement of GSMA certification is that personalisation packet is decoded inside the chip and so there is no way to dump Ki, OPc and 5G keys. Another important aspect is that the eSIM is owned by the enterprise, and this means that the enterprise now has full control of the security and applications in the eSIM, and which operators profiles are to be used.\n\n== Background to the specification ==\nIn the background of the technology looked to address the following issues:\n\nThe development of non-removable SIM technology - a new generation of SIM-cards like MFF which are soldered into the device.\nThe appearance and support by mobile operators of the concept of ABC (always best connected) \u2013 the opportunity get quality connections from any mobile operator at any point in time.\nThe explosive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) - according to Gartner about 8.4 billion connections in 2017 (up 31% from 2016).\nThe cost and effort required to swap a SIM in a device that has been deployed in the field.\n\n== Origin ==\nThe GSM Association (GSMA) which brings together about 800 operators and 250 mobile ecosystem companies became the first to come up with the Consumer Remote SIM Provisioning initiative. The beginning of creation the technology was announced in the summer 2014. The complete version of the specification was realized in February, 2016.\nInitially, the specification was supposed to be used just by M2M devices, but since December, 2015 it has begun being spread over various custom wearable devices, and into enterprise applications like authentication and identity management.\n\"This new specification gives consumers the freedom to remotely connect devices, such as wearables, to a mobile network of their choice and continues to evolve the process of connecting new and innovative devices,\" Alex Sinclair, Chief Technology Officer, GSMA.\nBesides, the right of independent service providers to transmit commands of loading profiles to SIM-cards in the device has been amended and the possibility to store arrays of profiles in independent certified data centers (Subscriptions manager) has appeared.\n\n== Functions and benefits ==\nThe specification that covers the carrier selection aspects aims to allow consumers to choose a mobile network operator from a wide range to activate the SIM embedded in a device via a subscription. It aims to simplify the users\u2019 life by connecting their multiple devices through the same subscription. It should also motivate mobile device manufacturers to develop the next generation of the mobile-connected devices that will suit better the wearable technology applications.

    "instruction": "Trusted computing base\n\n==Introduction==\nThe trusted computing base (TCB) of a computer system is the set of all hardware, firmware, and/or software components that are critical to its security, in the sense that bugs or vulnerabilities occurring inside the TCB might jeopardize the security properties of the entire system. By contrast, parts of a computer system that lie outside the TCB must not be able to misbehave in a way that would leak any more privileges than are granted to them in accordance to the system's security policy.\nThe careful design and implementation of a system's trusted computing base is paramount to its overall security. Modern operating systems strive to reduce the size of the TCB so that an exhaustive examination of its code base (by means of manual or computer-assisted software audit or program verification) becomes feasible.\n\n== Definition and characterization ==\nThe term trusted computing base goes back to John Rushby, who defined it as the combination of operating system kernel and trusted processes. The latter refers to processes which are allowed to violate the system's access-control rules.\nIn the classic paper Authentication in Distributed Systems: Theory and Practice Lampson et al. define the TCB of a computer system as simply\n\na small amount of software and hardware that security depends on and that we distinguish from a much larger amount that can misbehave without affecting security.Both definitions, while clear and convenient, are neither theoretically exact nor intended to be, as e.g. a network server process under a UNIX-like operating system might fall victim to a security breach and compromise an important part of the system's security, yet is not part of the operating system's TCB. The Orange Book, another classic computer security literature reference, therefore provides a more formal definition of the TCB of a computer system, as\n\nthe totality of protection mechanisms within it, including hardware, firmware, and software, the combination of which is responsible for enforcing a computer security policy.In other words, trusted computing base (TCB) is a combination of hardware, software, and controls that work together to form a trusted base to enforce your security policy.\nThe Orange Book further explains that\n\n[t]he ability of a trusted computing base to enforce correctly a unified security policy depends on the correctness of the mechanisms within the trusted computing base, the protection of those mechanisms to ensure their correctness, and the correct input of parameters related to the security policy.In other words, a given piece of hardware or software is a part of the TCB if and only if it has been designed to be a part of the mechanism that provides its security to the computer system. In operating systems, this typically consists of the kernel (or microkernel) and a select set of system utilities (for example, setuid programs and daemons in UNIX systems). In programming languages designed with built-in security features, such as Java and E, the TCB is formed of the language runtime and standard library.\n\n== Properties ==\n\n\n*** Predicated upon the security policy ***\nAs a consequence of the above Orange Book definition, the boundaries of the TCB depend closely upon the specifics of how the security policy is fleshed out. In the network server example above, even though, say, a Web server that serves a multi-user application is not part of the operating system's TCB, it has the responsibility of performing access control so that the users cannot usurp the identity and privileges of each other. In this sense, it definitely is part of the TCB of the larger computer system that comprises the UNIX server, the user's browsers and the Web application; in other words, breaching into the Web server through e.g. a buffer overflow may not be regarded as a compromise of the operating system proper, but it certainly constitutes a damaging exploit on the Web application.\nThis fundamental relativity of the boundary of the TCB is exemplified by the concept of the 'target of evaluation' ('TOE') in the Common Criteria security process: in the course of a Common Criteria security evaluation, one of the first decisions that must be made is the boundary of the audit in terms of the list of system components that will come under scrutiny.\n\n\n*** A prerequisite to security ***\nSystems that don't have a trusted computing base as part of their design do not provide security of their own: they are only secure insofar as security is provided to them by external means (e.g. a computer sitting in a locked room without a network connection may be considered secure depending on the policy, regardless of the software it runs). This is because, as David J. Farber et al. put it, [i]n a computer system, the integrity of lower layers is typically treated as axiomatic by higher layers. As far as computer security is concerned, reasoning about the security properties of a computer system requires being able to make sound assumptions about what it can, and more importantly, cannot do; however, barring any reason to believe otherwise, a computer is able to do everything that a general Von Neumann machine can. This obviously includes operations that would be deemed contrary to all but the simplest security policies, such as divulging an email or password that should be kept secret; however, barring special provisions in the architecture of the system, there is no denying that the computer could be programmed to perform these undesirable tasks.\nThese special provisions that aim at preventing certain kinds of actions from being executed, in essence, constitute the trusted computing base. For this reason, the Orange Book (still a reference on the design of secure operating systems as of 2007) characterizes the various security assurance levels that it defines mainly in terms of the structure and security features of the TCB.\n\n\n*** Software parts of the TCB need to protect themselves ***\nAs outlined by the aforementioned Orange Book, software portions of the trusted computing base need to protect themselves against tampering to be of any effect. This is due to the von Neumann architecture implemented by virtually all modern computers: since machine code can be processed as just another kind of data, it can be read and overwritten by any program. This can be prevented by special memory management provisions that subsequently have to be treated as part of the TCB. Specifically, the trusted computing base must at least prevent its own software from being written to.\nIn many modern CPUs, the protection of the memory that hosts the TCB is achieved by adding in a specialized piece of hardware called the memory management unit (MMU), which is programmable by the operating system to allow and deny a running program's access to specific ranges of the system memory. Of course, the operating system is also able to disallow such programming to the other programs. This technique is called supervisor mode; compared to more crude approaches (such as storing the TCB in ROM, or equivalently, using the Harvard architecture), it has the advantage of allowing security-critical software to be upgraded in the field, although allowing secure upgrades of the trusted computing base poses bootstrap problems of its own.\n\n\n*** Trusted vs. trustworthy ***\nAs stated above, trust in the trusted computing base is required to make any progress in ascertaining the security of the computer system. In other words, the trusted computing base is \u201ctrusted\u201d first and foremost in the sense that it has to be trusted, and not necessarily that it is trustworthy. Real-world operating systems routinely have security-critical bugs discovered in them, which attests to the practical limits of such trust.The alternative is formal software verification, which uses mathematical proof techniques to show the absence of bugs. Researchers at NICTA and its spinout Open Kernel Labs have recently performed such a formal verification of seL4, a member of the L4 microkernel family, proving functional correctness of the C implementation of the kernel.\nThis makes seL4 the first operating-system kernel which closes the gap between trust and trustworthiness, assuming the mathematical proof is free from error.\n\n\n*** TCB size ***\nDue to the aforementioned need to apply costly techniques such as formal verification or manual review, the size of the TCB has immediate consequences on the economics of the TCB assurance process, and the trustworthiness of the resulting product (in terms of the mathematical expectation of the number of bugs not found during the verification or review). In order to reduce costs and security risks, the TCB should therefore be kept as small as possible.

    "instruction": "Chaffing and winnowing\n\n==Introduction==\nChaffing and winnowing is a cryptographic technique to achieve confidentiality without using encryption when sending data over an insecure channel. The name is derived from agriculture: after grain has been harvested and threshed, it remains mixed together with inedible fibrous chaff.  The chaff and grain are then separated by winnowing, and the chaff is discarded. The cryptographic technique was conceived by Ron Rivest and published in an on-line article on 18 March 1998. Although it bears similarities to both traditional encryption and steganography, it cannot be classified under either category.\nThis technique allows the sender to deny responsibility for encrypting their message. When using chaffing and winnowing, the sender transmits the message unencrypted, in clear text. Although the sender and the receiver share a secret key, they use it only for authentication. However, a third party can make their communication confidential by simultaneously sending specially crafted messages through the same channel.\n\n== How it works ==\nThe sender (Alice) wants to send a message to the receiver (Bob). In the simplest setup, Alice enumerates the symbols (usually bits) in her message and sends out each in a separate packet. In general the method requires each symbol to arrive in-order and to be authenticated by the receiver. When implemented over networks that may change the order of packets, the sender places the symbol's serial number in the packet, the symbol itself (both unencrypted), and a message authentication code (MAC). Many MACs use a secret key Alice shares with Bob, but it is sufficient that the receiver has a method to authenticate the packets. Charles, who transmits Alice's packets to Bob, interleaves the packets with corresponding bogus packets (called \"chaff\") with corresponding serial numbers, arbitrary symbols, and a random number in place of the MAC. Charles does not need to know the key to do that (real MACs are large enough that it is extremely unlikely to generate a valid one by chance, unlike in the example). Bob uses the MAC to find the authentic messages and drops the \"chaff\" messages. This process is called \"winnowing\".\nAn eavesdropper located between Alice and Charles can easily read Alice's message. But an eavesdropper between Charles and Bob would have to tell which packets are bogus and which are real (i.e. to winnow, or \"separate the wheat from the chaff\"). That is infeasible if the MAC used is secure and Charles does not leak any information on packet authenticity (e.g. via timing).\nIf a fourth party joins the example (named Darth) who wants to send counterfeit messages to impersonate Alice, it would require Alice to disclose her secret key. If Darth cannot force Alice to disclose an authentication key (the knowledge of which would enable him to forge messages from Alice), then her messages will remain confidential. Charles, on the other hand, is no target of Darth's at all, since Charles does not even possess any secret keys that could be disclosed.\n\n== Variations ==\nThe simple variant of the chaffing and winnowing technique described above adds many bits of overhead per bit of original message. To make the transmission more efficient, Alice can process her message with an all-or-nothing transform and then send it out in much larger chunks. The chaff packets will have to be modified accordingly. Because the original message can be reconstructed only by knowing all of its chunks, Charles needs to send only enough chaff packets to make finding the correct combination of packets computationally infeasible.\nChaffing and winnowing lends itself especially well to use in packet-switched network environments such as the Internet, where each message (whose payload is typically small) is sent in a separate network packet. In another variant of the technique, Charles carefully interleaves packets coming from multiple senders. That eliminates the need for Charles to generate and inject bogus packets in the communication. However, the text of Alice's message cannot be well protected from other parties who are communicating via Charles at the same time. This variant also helps protect against information leakage and traffic analysis.\n\n== Implications for law enforcement ==\nRon Rivest suggests that laws related to cryptography, including export controls, would not apply to chaffing and winnowing because it does not employ any encryption at all.\nThe power to authenticate is in many cases the power to control, and handing all authentication power to the government is beyond all reason\nThe author of the paper proposes that the security implications of handing everyone's authentication keys to the government for law-enforcement purposes would be far too risky, since possession of the key would enable someone to masquerade and communicate as another entity, such as an airline controller.  Furthermore, Ron Rivest contemplates the possibility of rogue law enforcement officials framing up innocent parties by introducing the chaff into their communications, concluding that drafting a law restricting chaffing and winnowing would be far too difficult.\n\n== Trivia ==\nThe term winnowing was suggested by Ronald Rivest's father.  Before the publication of Rivest's paper in 1998 other people brought to his attention a 1965 novel,  Rex Stout's The Doorbell Rang, which describes the same concept and was thus included in the paper's references.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question.

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nBrute-force attack\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found. Alternatively, the attacker can attempt to guess the key which is typically created from the password using a key derivation function. This is known as an exhaustive key search.\nA brute-force attack is a cryptanalytic attack that can, in theory, be used to attempt to decrypt any encrypted data (except for data encrypted in an information-theoretically secure manner).  Such an attack might be used when it is not possible to take advantage of other weaknesses in an encryption system (if any exist) that would make the task easier.\nWhen password-guessing, this method is very fast when used to check all short passwords, but for longer passwords other methods such as the dictionary attack are used because a brute-force search takes too long. Longer passwords, passphrases and keys have more possible values, making them exponentially more difficult to crack than shorter ones.Brute-force attacks can be made less effective by obfuscating the data to be encoded making it more difficult for an attacker to recognize when the code has been cracked or by making the attacker do more work to test each guess. One of the measures of the strength of an encryption system is how long it would theoretically take an attacker to mount a successful brute-force attack against it.Brute-force attacks are an application of brute-force search, the general problem-solving technique of enumerating all candidates and checking each one. The word 'hammering' is sometimes used to describe a brute-force attack, with 'anti-hammering' for countermeasures.\n\n\n\n== Basic concept ==\nBrute-force attacks work by calculating every possible combination that could make up a password and testing it to see if it is the correct password. As the password's length increases, the amount of time, on average, to find the correct password increases exponentially.\n\n== Theoretical limits ==\nThe resources required for a brute-force attack grow exponentially with increasing key size, not linearly. Although U.S. export regulations historically restricted key lengths to 56-bit symmetric keys (e.g. Data Encryption Standard), these restrictions are no longer in place, so modern symmetric algorithms typically use computationally stronger 128- to 256-bit keys.\nThere is a physical argument that a 128-bit symmetric key is computationally secure against brute-force attack. The Landauer limit implied by the laws of physics sets a lower limit on the energy required to perform a computation of kT  \u00b7  ln 2 per bit erased in a computation, where T is the temperature of the computing device in kelvins, k is the Boltzmann constant, and the natural logarithm of 2 is about 0.693 (0.6931471805599453). No irreversible computing device can use less energy than this, even in principle.  Thus, in order to simply flip through the possible values for a 128-bit symmetric key (ignoring doing the actual computing to check it) would, theoretically, require 2128 \u2212 1 bit flips on a conventional processor.  If it is assumed that the calculation occurs near room temperature (\u2248300 K), the Von Neumann-Landauer Limit can be applied to estimate the energy required as \u22481018 joules, which is equivalent to consuming 30 gigawatts of power for one year. This is equal to 30\u00d7109 W\u00d7365\u00d724\u00d73600 s\n\n== Credential recycling ==\nCredential recycling is the hacking practice of re-using username and password combinations gathered in previous brute-force attacks. A special form of credential recycling is pass the hash, where unsalted hashed credentials are stolen and re-used without first being brute forced.\n\n== Unbreakable codes ==\nCertain types of encryption, by their mathematical properties, cannot be defeated by brute force. An example of this is one-time pad cryptography, where every cleartext bit has a corresponding key from a truly random sequence of key bits. A 140 character one-time-pad-encoded string subjected to a brute-force attack would eventually reveal every 140 character string possible, including the correct answer \u2013 but of all the answers given, there would be no way of knowing which was the correct one. Defeating such a system, as was done by the Venona project, generally relies not on pure cryptography, but upon mistakes in its implementation, such as the key pads not being truly random, intercepted keypads, or operators making mistakes.\n\n== Countermeasures ==\nIn case of an offline attack where the attacker has gained access to the encrypted material, one can try key combinations without the risk of discovery or interference. In case of online attacks, database and directory administrators can deploy countermeasures such as limiting the number of attempts that a password can be tried, introducing time delays between successive attempts, increasing the answer's complexity (e.g., requiring a CAPTCHA answer or employing multi-factor authentication), and/or locking accounts out after unsuccessful login attempts.  Website administrators may prevent a particular IP address from trying more than a predetermined number of password attempts against any account on the site.\n\n== Reverse brute-force attack ==\nIn a reverse brute-force attack, a single (usually common) password is tested against multiple usernames or encrypted files. The process may be repeated for a select few passwords. In such a strategy, the attacker is not targeting a specific user.\n\nCan certain types of encryption be defeated by a brute-force attack?",

    "instruction": "Aurora Generator Test\n\n==Introduction==\nIdaho National Laboratory ran the Aurora Generator Test in 2007 to demonstrate how a cyberattack could destroy physical components of the electric grid. The experiment used a computer program to rapidly open and close a diesel generator's circuit breakers out of phase from the rest of the grid, thereby subjecting the engine to abnormal torques and ultimately causing it to explode. This vulnerability is referred to as the Aurora Vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability is especially a concern because most grid equipment supports using Modbus and other legacy communications protocols that were designed without security in mind. As such, they do not support authentication, confidentiality, or replay protection.  This means that any attacker that can communicate with the device can control it and use the Aurora Vulnerability to destroy it.\n\n\n\n== Experiment ==\nTo prepare for the experiment, the researchers procured and installed a 2.25 MW (3000 horsepower) generator and connected it to the substation. They also needed access to a programmable digital relay or another device capable of controlling the breaker. Although such access can be through a mechanical or digital interface, in this case the latter was used.A generator unit consists of a diesel engine mechanically linked to an alternator.  In many commercial-industrial settings, multiple generators need to operate together in tandem, in order to provide power to the desired load.  A generator that is operating normally is synchronized with either the power grid or with one or more additional generators (for example in an \"islanded\" independent power network as might be used in a remote location or for emergency backup power).  When generators are operating in synchronicity, effectively their alternators are magnetically locked together.In the Aurora experiment, the researchers used a cyberattack to open and close the breakers out of sync, in order to deliberately maximize the stress. Each time the breakers were closed, the torque induced in the alternator (as a result of the out-of-synchrony connection) caused the entire generator to bounce and shake.  The generator used in the experiment was equipped with a resilient rubber rotating coupling (located between the diesel engine and the alternator, thus indirectly connecting the engine's steel crankshaft to the alternator's steel shaft).During the initial steps of the attack, black rubber pieces were ejected as the rotating coupling was incrementally destroyed (as a result of the extremely abnormal torques induced by the out-of-synchronization alternator on the diesel engine's crankshaft).  The rotating rubber coupling was soon destroyed outright, whereupon the diesel engine itself was then quickly ripped apart, with parts sent flying off. Some parts of the generator landed as far as 80 feet away from the generator. In addition to the massive and obvious mechanical damage to the diesel engine itself, evidence of overheating of the alternator was later observed (upon subsequent disassembly of the unit).In this attack, the generator unit was destroyed in roughly three minutes. However, this process took three minutes only because the researchers assessed the damage from each iteration of the attack. A real attack could have destroyed the unit much more quickly.  For example, a generator built without a rotating rubber coupling between the diesel engine and the alternator would experience the crankshaft-destroying abnormal forces in its diesel engine immediately, given the absence of a shock-absorbing material between these two rotating components.  A generator unit assembled in this way could see its diesel engine ruined by a single out-of-synchrony connection of the alternator.The Aurora experiment was designated as unclassified, for official use only. On September 27, 2007, CNN published an article based on the information and video DHS released to them, and on July 3, 2014, DHS released many of the documents related to the experiment as part of an unrelated FOIA request.\n\n== Vulnerability ==\nThe Aurora vulnerability is caused by the out-of-sync closing of the protective relays.\"A close, but imperfect, analogy would be to imagine the effect of shifting a car into Reverse while it is being driven on a highway, or the effect of revving the engine up while the car is in neutral and then shifting it into Drive.\"\"The Aurora attack is designed to open a circuit breaker, wait for the system or generator to slip out of synchronism, and reclose the breaker, all before the protection system recognizes and responds to the attack...

It is possible to design such a sensor to immediately trigger a complete shutdown of the generator upon detection of a single major excursion from the vibration signature of a normally operating engine.

      "context": "Aurora Generator Test\n\n==Introduction==\nIdaho National Laboratory ran the Aurora Generator Test in 2007 to demonstrate how a cyberattack could destroy physical components of the electric grid. The experiment used a computer program to rapidly open and close a diesel generator's circuit breakers out of phase from the rest of the grid, thereby subjecting the engine to abnormal torques and ultimately causing it to explode. This vulnerability is referred to as the Aurora Vulnerability.\nThis vulnerability is especially a concern because most grid equipment supports using Modbus and other legacy communications protocols that were designed without security in mind. As such, they do not support authentication, confidentiality, or replay protection.  This means that any attacker that can communicate with the device can control it and use the Aurora Vulnerability to destroy it.\n\n\n\n== Experiment ==\nTo prepare for the experiment, the researchers procured and installed a 2.25 MW (3000 horsepower) generator and connected it to the substation. They also needed access to a programmable digital relay or another device capable of controlling the breaker. Although such access can be through a mechanical or digital interface, in this case the latter was used.A generator unit consists of a diesel engine mechanically linked to an alternator.  In many commercial-industrial settings, multiple generators need to operate together in tandem, in order to provide power to the desired load.

    "instruction": "Storm botnet\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Storm botnet or Storm worm botnet (also known as Dorf botnet and Ecard malware) was a remotely controlled network of \"zombie\" computers (or \"botnet\") that had been linked by the Storm Worm, a Trojan horse spread through e-mail spam. At its height in September 2007, the Storm botnet was running on anywhere from 1 million to 50 million computer systems, and accounted for 8% of all malware on Microsoft Windows computers. It was first identified around January 2007, having been distributed by email with subjects such as \"230 dead as storm batters Europe,\" giving it its well-known name. The botnet began to decline in late 2007, and by mid-2008 had been reduced to infecting about 85,000 computers, far less than it had infected a year earlier.As of December 2012, the original creators of Storm have not been found. The Storm botnet has displayed defensive behaviors that indicated that its controllers were actively protecting the botnet against attempts at tracking and disabling it, by specifically attacking the online operations of some security vendors and researchers who had attempted to investigate it. Security expert Joe Stewart revealed that in late 2007, the operators of the botnet began to further decentralize their operations, in possible plans to sell portions of the Storm botnet to other operators. It was reportedly powerful enough to force entire countries off the Internet, and was estimated to be capable of executing more instructions per second than some of the world's top supercomputers. The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation considered the botnet a major risk to increased bank fraud, identity theft, and other cybercrimes.\n\n== Origins ==\nFirst detected on the Internet in January 2007, the Storm botnet and worm are so-called because of the storm-related subject lines its infectious e-mail employed initially, such as \"230 dead as storm batters Europe.\" Later provocative subjects included \"Chinese missile shot down USA aircraft,\" and \"U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has kicked German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\" It is suspected by some information security professionals that well-known fugitive spammers, including Leo Kuvayev, may have been involved in the operation and control of the Storm botnet. According to technology journalist Daniel Tynan, writing under his \"Robert X. Cringely\" pseudonym, a great portion of the fault for the existence of the Storm botnet lay with Microsoft and Adobe Systems. Other sources state that Storm Worm's primary method of victim acquisition was through enticing users via frequently changing social engineering (confidence trickery) schemes. According to Patrick Runald, the Storm botnet had a strong American focus, and likely had agents working to support it within the United States. Some experts, however, believe the Storm botnet controllers were Russian, some pointing specifically at the Russian Business Network, citing that the Storm software mentions a hatred of the Moscow-based security firm Kaspersky Lab, and includes the Russian word \"buldozhka,\" which means \"bulldog.\"\n\n== Composition ==\nThe botnet, or zombie network, comprises computers running Microsoft Windows as their operating system. Once infected, a computer becomes known as a bot. This bot then performs automated tasks\u2014anything from gathering data on the user, to attacking web sites, to forwarding infected e-mail\u2014without its owner's knowledge or permission. Estimates indicate that 5,000 to 6,000 computers are dedicated to propagating the spread of the worm through the use of e-mails with infected attachments; 1.2 billion virus messages have been sent by the botnet through September 2007, including a record 57 million on August 22, 2007 alone. Lawrence Baldwin, a computer forensics specialist, was quoted as saying, \"Cumulatively, Storm is sending billions of messages a day. It could be double digits in the billions, easily.\" One of the methods used to entice victims to infection-hosting web sites are offers of free music, from artists such as Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, Kelly Clarkson, Rihanna, The Eagles, Foo Fighters, R. Kelly, and Velvet Revolver.  Signature-based detection, the main defense of most computer systems against virus and malware infections, is hampered by the large number of Storm variants.Back-end servers that control the spread of the botnet and Storm worm automatically re-encode their distributed infection software twice an hour, for new transmissions, making it difficult for anti-virus vendors to stop the virus and infection spread. Additionally, the location of the remote servers which control the botnet are hidden behind a constantly changing DNS technique called 'fast flux', making it difficult to find and stop virus hosting sites and mail servers. In short, the name and location of such machines are frequently changed and rotated, often on a minute by minute basis. The Storm botnet's operators control the system via peer-to-peer techniques, making external monitoring and disabling of the system more difficult. There is no central \"command-and-control point\" in the Storm botnet that can be shut down. The botnet also makes use of encrypted traffic. Efforts to infect computers usually revolve around convincing people to download e-mail attachments which contain the virus through subtle manipulation. In one instance, the botnet's controllers took advantage of the National Football League's opening weekend, sending out mail offering \"football tracking programs\" which did nothing more than infect a user's computer. According to Matt Sergeant, chief anti-spam technologist at MessageLabs, \"In terms of power, [the botnet] utterly blows the supercomputers away. If you add up all 500 of the top supercomputers, it blows them all away with just 2 million of its machines. It's very frightening that criminals have access to that much computing power, but there's not much we can do about it.\" It is estimated that only 10\u200a\u201320% of the total capacity and power of the Storm botnet is currently being used.Computer security expert Joe Stewart detailed the process by which compromised machines join the botnet: attempts to join the botnet are made by launching a series of EXE files on the compromised machine, in stages. Usually, they are named in a sequence from game0.exe through game5.exe, or similar. It will then continue launching executables in turn. They typically perform the following:\ngame0.exe \u2013 Backdoor/downloader\ngame1.exe \u2013 SMTP relay\ngame2.exe \u2013 E-mail address stealer\ngame3.exe \u2013 E-mail virus spreader\ngame4.exe \u2013 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack tool\ngame5.exe \u2013 Updated copy of Storm Worm dropperAt each stage the compromised system will connect into the botnet; fast flux DNS makes tracking this process exceptionally difficult.\nThis code is run from %windir%\\system32\\wincom32.sys on a Windows system, via a kernel rootkit, and all connections back to the botnet are sent through a modified version of the eDonkey/Overnet communications protocol.\n\n== Method ==\nThe Storm botnet and its variants employ a variety of attack vectors, and a variety of defensive steps exist as well. The Storm botnet was observed to be defending itself, and attacking computer systems that scanned for Storm virus-infected computer systems online. The botnet will defend itself with DDoS counter-attacks, to maintain its own internal integrity. At certain points in time, the Storm worm used to spread the botnet has attempted to release hundreds or thousands of versions of itself onto the Internet, in a concentrated attempt to overwhelm the defenses of anti-virus and malware security firms. According to Joshua Corman, an IBM security researcher, \"This is the first time that I can remember ever seeing researchers who were actually afraid of investigating an exploit.\" Researchers are still unsure if the botnet's defenses and counterattacks are a form of automation, or manually executed by the system's operators. \"If you try to attach a debugger, or query sites it's reporting into, it knows and punishes you instantaneously. [Over at] SecureWorks, a chunk of it DDoS-ed [distributed-denial-of-service attacked] a researcher off the network. Every time I hear of an investigator trying to investigate, they're automatically punished. It knows it's being investigated, and it punishes them. It fights back\", Corman said.Spameater.com as well as other sites such as 419eater.com and Artists Against 419, both of which deal with 419 spam e-mail fraud, have experienced DDoS attacks, temporarily rendering them completely inoperable. The DDoS attacks consist of making massed parallel network calls to those and other target IP addresses, overloading the servers' capacities and preventing them from responding to requests. Other anti-spam and anti-fraud groups, such as the Spamhaus Project, were also attacked. The webmaster of Artists Against 419 said that the website's server succumbed after the attack increased to over 100Mbit.  Similar attacks were perpetrated against over a dozen anti-fraud site hosts. Jeff Chan, a spam researcher, stated, \"In terms of mitigating Storm, it's challenging at best and impossible at worst since the bad guys control many hundreds of megabits of traffic. There's some evidence that they may control hundreds of Gigabits of traffic, which is enough to force some countries off the Internet.\"The Storm botnet's systems also take steps to defend itself locally, on victims' computer systems. The botnet, on some compromised systems, creates a computer process on the Windows machine that notifies the Storm systems whenever a new program or other processes begin. Previously, the Storm worms locally would tell the other programs\u2014such as anti-virus, or anti-malware software, to simply not run. However, according to IBM security research, versions of Storm also now simply \"fool\" the local computer system into thinking it has run the hostile program successfully, but in fact, they are not doing anything. \"Programs, including not just AV exes, dlls and sys files, but also software such as the P2P applications BearShare and eDonkey, will appear to run successfully, even though they didn't actually do anything, which is far less suspicious than a process that gets terminated suddenly from the outside\", said Richard Cohen of Sophos. Compromised users, and related security systems, will assume that security software is running successfully when it in fact is not.On September 17, 2007, a Republican Party website in the United States was compromised, and used to propagate the Storm worm and botnet. In October 2007, the botnet took advantage of flaws in YouTube's captcha application on its mail systems, to send targeted spam e-mails to Xbox owners with a scam involving winning a special version of the video game Halo 3. Other attack methods include using appealing animated images of laughing cats to get people to click on a trojan software download, and tricking users of Yahoo!'s GeoCities service to download software that was claimed to be needed to use GeoCities itself. The GeoCities attack in particular was called a \"full-fledged attack vector\" by Paul Ferguson of Trend Micro, and implicated members of the Russian Business Network, a well-known spam and malware service. On Christmas Eve in 2007, the Storm botnet began sending out holiday-themed messages revolving around male interest in women, with such titles as \"Find Some Christmas Tail\", \"The Twelve Girls of Christmas\", and \"Mrs. Claus Is Out Tonight!\" and photos of attractive women. It was described as an attempt to draw more unprotected systems into the botnet and boost its size over the holidays, when security updates from protection vendors may take longer to be distributed. A day after the e-mails with Christmas strippers were distributed, the Storm botnet operators immediately began sending new infected e-mails that claimed to wish their recipients a \"Happy New Year 2008!\"In January 2008, the botnet was detected for the first time to be involved in phishing attacks against major financial institutions, targeting both Barclays and Halifax.\n\n== Encryption and sales ==\nAround October 15, 2007, it was uncovered that portions of the Storm botnet and its variants could be for sale. This is being done by using unique security keys in the encryption of the botnet's Internet traffic and information. The unique keys will allow each segment, or sub-section of the Storm botnet, to communicate with a section that has a matching security key. However, this may also allow people to detect, track, and block Storm botnet traffic in the future, if the security keys have unique lengths and signatures. Computer security vendor Sophos has agreed with the assessment that the partitioning of the Storm botnet indicated likely resale of its services. Graham Cluley of Sophos said, \"Storm's use of encrypted traffic is an interesting feature which has raised eyebrows in our lab. Its most likely use is for the cybercriminals to lease out portions of the network for misuse. It wouldn't be a surprise if the network was used for spamming, distributed denial-of-service attacks, and other malicious activities.\" Security experts reported that if Storm is broken up for the malware market, in the form of a \"ready-to-use botnet-making spam kit\", the world could see a sharp rise in the number of Storm related infections and compromised computer systems. The encryption only seems to affect systems compromised by Storm from the second week of October 2007 onwards, meaning that any of the computer systems compromised after that time frame will remain difficult to track and block.Within days of the discovery of this segmenting of the Storm botnet, spam e-mail from the new subsection was uncovered by major security vendors. On the evening of October 17, security vendors began seeing new spam with embedded MP3 sound files, which attempted to trick victims into investing in a penny stock, as part of an illegal pump-and-dump stock scam. It was believed that this was the first-ever spam e-mail scam that made use of audio to fool victims. Unlike nearly all other Storm-related e-mails, however, these new audio stock scam messages did not include any sort of virus or Storm malware payload; they were simply part of the stock scam.In January 2008, the botnet was detected for the first time to be involved in phishing attacks against the customers of major financial institutions, targeting banking establishments in Europe including Barclays, Halifax and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The unique security keys used indicated to F-Secure that segments of the botnet were being leased.\n\n== Claimed decline of the botnet ==\nOn September 25, 2007, it was estimated that a Microsoft update to the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) may have helped reduce the size of the botnet by up to 20%. The new patch, as claimed by Microsoft, removed Storm from approximately 274,372 infected systems out of 2.6 million scanned Windows systems. However, according to senior security staff at Microsoft, \"the 180,000+ additional machines that have been cleaned by MSRT since the first day are likely to be home user machines that were not notably incorporated into the daily operation of the 'Storm' botnet,\" indicating that the MSRT cleaning may have been symbolic at best.As of late October 2007, some reports indicated that the Storm botnet was losing the size of its Internet footprint, and was significantly reduced in size. Brandon Enright, a University of California at San Diego security analyst, estimated that the botnet had by late October fallen to a size of approximately 160,000 compromised systems, from Enright's previous estimated high in July 2007 of 1,500,000 systems. Enright noted, however, that the botnet's composition was constantly changing, and that it was still actively defending itself against attacks and observation. \"If you're a researcher and you hit the pages hosting the malware too much\u2026 there is an automated process that automatically launches a denial of service [attack] against you\", he said, and added that his research caused a Storm botnet attack that knocked part of the UC San Diego network offline.The computer security company McAfee is reported as saying that the Storm Worm would be the basis of future attacks. Craig Schmugar, a noted security expert who discovered the Mydoom worm, called the Storm botnet a trend-setter, which has led to more usage of similar tactics by criminals. One such derivative botnet has been dubbed the \"Celebrity Spam Gang\", due to their use of similar technical tools as the Storm botnet controllers. Unlike the sophisticated social engineering that the Storm operators use to entice victims, however, the Celebrity spammers make use of offers of nude images of celebrities such as Angelina Jolie and Britney Spears. Cisco Systems security experts stated in a report that they believe the Storm botnet would remain a critical threat in 2008, and said they estimated that its size remained in the \"millions\".As of early 2008, the Storm botnet also found business competition in its black hat economy, in the form of Nugache, another similar botnet which was first identified in 2006. Reports have indicated a price war may be underway between the operators of both botnets, for the sale of their spam E-mail delivery. Following the Christmas and New Year's holidays bridging 2007\u20132008, the researchers of the German Honeynet Project reported that the Storm botnet may have increased in size by up to 20% over the holidays. The MessageLabs Intelligence report dated March 2008 estimates that over 20% of all spam on the Internet originates from Storm.\n\n== Present state of the botnet ==\nThe Storm botnet was sending out spam for more than two years until its decline in late 2008. One factor in this\u2014on account of making it less interesting for the creators to maintain the botnet\u2014may have been the Stormfucker tool, which made it possible to take control over parts of the botnet.\n\n== Stormbot 2 ==\nOn April 28, 2010, McAfee made an announcement that the so-called \"rumors\" of a Stormbot 2 were verified. Mark Schloesser, Tillmann Werner, and Felix Leder, the German researchers who did a lot of work in analyzing the original Storm, found that around two-thirds of the \"new\" functions are a copy and paste from the last Storm code base. The only thing missing is the P2P infrastructure, perhaps because of the tool which used P2P to bring down the original Storm.

      "context": "Storm botnet\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Storm botnet or Storm worm botnet (also known as Dorf botnet and Ecard malware) was a remotely controlled network of \"zombie\" computers (or \"botnet\") that had been linked by the Storm Worm, a Trojan horse spread through e-mail spam. At its height in September 2007, the Storm botnet was running on anywhere from 1 million to 50 million computer systems, and accounted for 8% of all malware on Microsoft Windows computers. It was first identified around January 2007, having been distributed by email with subjects such as \"230 dead as storm batters Europe,\" giving it its well-known name. The botnet began to decline in late 2007, and by mid-2008 had been reduced to infecting about 85,000 computers, far less than it had infected a year earlier.As of December 2012, the original creators of Storm have not been found. The Storm botnet has displayed defensive behaviors that indicated that its controllers were actively protecting the botnet against attempts at tracking and disabling it, by specifically attacking the online operations of some security vendors and researchers who had attempted to investigate it. Security expert Joe Stewart revealed that in late 2007, the operators of the botnet began to further decentralize their operations, in possible plans to sell portions of the Storm botnet to other operators. It was reportedly powerful enough to force entire countries off the Internet, and was estimated to be capable of executing more instructions per second than some of the world's top supercomputers. The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation considered the botnet a major risk to increased bank fraud, identity theft, and other cybercrimes.\n\n== Origins ==\nFirst detected on the Internet in January 2007, the Storm botnet and worm are so-called because of the storm-related subject lines its infectious e-mail employed initially, such as \"230 dead as storm batters Europe.\" Later provocative subjects included \"Chinese missile shot down USA aircraft,\" and \"U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has kicked German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\" It is suspected by some information security professionals that well-known fugitive spammers, including Leo Kuvayev, may have been involved in the operation and control of the Storm botnet. According to technology journalist Daniel Tynan, writing under his \"Robert X. Cringely\" pseudonym, a great portion of the fault for the existence of the Storm botnet lay with Microsoft and Adobe Systems. Other sources state that Storm Worm's primary method of victim acquisition was through enticing users via frequently changing social engineering (confidence trickery) schemes. According to Patrick Runald, the Storm botnet had a strong American focus, and likely had agents working to support it within the United States. Some experts, however, believe the Storm botnet controllers were Russian, some pointing specifically at the Russian Business Network, citing that the Storm software mentions a hatred of the Moscow-based security firm Kaspersky Lab, and includes the Russian word \"buldozhka,\" which means \"bulldog.\"\n\n== Composition ==\nThe botnet, or zombie network, comprises computers running Microsoft Windows as their operating system. Once infected, a computer becomes known as a bot. This bot then performs automated tasks\u2014anything from gathering data on the user, to attacking web sites, to forwarding infected e-mail\u2014without its owner's knowledge or permission. Estimates indicate that 5,000 to 6,000 computers are dedicated to propagating the spread of the worm through the use of e-mails with infected attachments; 1.2 billion virus messages have been sent by the botnet through September 2007, including a record 57 million on August 22, 2007 alone. Lawrence Baldwin, a computer forensics specialist, was quoted as saying, \"Cumulatively, Storm is sending billions of messages a day. It could be double digits in the billions, easily.\" One of the methods used to entice victims to infection-hosting web sites are offers of free music, from artists such as Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles, Kelly Clarkson, Rihanna, The Eagles, Foo Fighters, R. Kelly, and Velvet Revolver.  Signature-based detection, the main defense of most computer systems against virus and malware infections, is hampered by the large number of Storm variants.Back-end servers that control the spread of the botnet and Storm worm automatically re-encode their distributed infection software twice an hour, for new transmissions, making it difficult for anti-virus vendors to stop the virus and infection spread. Additionally, the location of the remote servers which control the botnet are hidden behind a constantly changing DNS technique called 'fast flux', making it difficult to find and stop virus hosting sites and mail servers. In short, the name and location of such machines are frequently changed and rotated, often on a minute by minute basis. The Storm botnet's operators control the system via peer-to-peer techniques, making external monitoring and disabling of the system more difficult. There is no central \"command-and-control point\" in the Storm botnet that can be shut down. The botnet also makes use of encrypted traffic. Efforts to infect computers usually revolve around convincing people to download e-mail attachments which contain the virus through subtle manipulation. In one instance, the botnet's controllers took advantage of the National Football League's opening weekend, sending out mail offering \"football tracking programs\" which did nothing more than infect a user's computer. According to Matt Sergeant, chief anti-spam technologist at MessageLabs, \"In terms of power, [the botnet] utterly blows the supercomputers away. If you add up all 500 of the top supercomputers, it blows them all away with just 2 million of its machines. It's very frightening that criminals have access to that much computing power, but there's not much we can do about it.\" It is estimated that only 10\u200a\u201320% of the total capacity and power of the Storm botnet is currently being used.Computer security expert Joe Stewart detailed the process by which compromised machines join the botnet: attempts to join the botnet are made by launching a series of EXE files on the compromised machine, in stages. Usually, they are named in a sequence from game0.exe through game5.exe, or similar. It will then continue launching executables in turn. They typically perform the following:\ngame0.exe \u2013 Backdoor/downloader\ngame1.exe \u2013 SMTP relay\ngame2.exe \u2013 E-mail address stealer\ngame3.exe \u2013 E-mail virus spreader\ngame4.exe \u2013 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack tool\ngame5.exe \u2013 Updated copy of Storm Worm dropperAt each stage the compromised system will connect into the botnet; fast flux DNS makes tracking this process exceptionally difficult.\nThis code is run from %windir%\\system32\\wincom32.sys on a Windows system, via a kernel rootkit, and all connections back to the botnet are sent through a modified version of the eDonkey/Overnet communications protocol.\n\n== Method ==\nThe Storm botnet and its variants employ a variety of attack vectors, and a variety of defensive steps exist as well. The Storm botnet was observed to be defending itself, and attacking computer systems that scanned for Storm virus-infected computer systems online. The botnet will defend itself with DDoS counter-attacks, to maintain its own internal integrity. At certain points in time, the Storm worm used to spread the botnet has attempted to release hundreds or thousands of versions of itself onto the Internet, in a concentrated attempt to overwhelm the defenses of anti-virus and malware security firms. According to Joshua Corman, an IBM security researcher, \"This is the first time that I can remember ever seeing researchers who were actually afraid of investigating an exploit.\" Researchers are still unsure if the botnet's defenses and counterattacks are a form of automation, or manually executed by the system's operators. \"If you try to attach a debugger, or query sites it's reporting into, it knows and punishes you instantaneously. [Over at] SecureWorks, a chunk of it DDoS-ed [distributed-denial-of-service attacked] a researcher off the network. Every time I hear of an investigator trying to investigate, they're automatically punished. It knows it's being investigated, and it punishes them. It fights back\", Corman said.Spameater.com as well as other sites such as 419eater.com and Artists Against 419, both of which deal with 419 spam e-mail fraud, have experienced DDoS attacks, temporarily rendering them completely inoperable. The DDoS attacks consist of making massed parallel network calls to those and other target IP addresses, overloading the servers' capacities and preventing them from responding to requests. Other anti-spam and anti-fraud groups, such as the Spamhaus Project, were also attacked. The webmaster of Artists Against 419 said that the website's server succumbed after the attack increased to over 100Mbit.  Similar attacks were perpetrated against over a dozen anti-fraud site hosts. Jeff Chan, a spam researcher, stated, \"In terms of mitigating Storm, it's challenging at best and impossible at worst since the bad guys control many hundreds of megabits of traffic. There's some evidence that they may control hundreds of Gigabits of traffic, which is enough to force some countries off the Internet.\"The Storm botnet's systems also take steps to defend itself locally, on victims' computer systems. The botnet, on some compromised systems, creates a computer process on the Windows machine that notifies the Storm systems whenever a new program or other processes begin. Previously, the Storm worms locally would tell the other programs\u2014such as anti-virus, or anti-malware software, to simply not run. However, according to IBM security research, versions of Storm also now simply \"fool\" the local computer system into thinking it has run the hostile program successfully, but in fact, they are not doing anything. \"Programs, including not just AV exes, dlls and sys files, but also software such as the P2P applications BearShare and eDonkey, will appear to run successfully, even though they didn't actually do anything, which is far less suspicious than a process that gets terminated suddenly from the outside\", said Richard Cohen of Sophos. Compromised users, and related security systems, will assume that security software is running successfully when it in fact is not.On September 17, 2007, a Republican Party website in the United States was compromised, and used to propagate the Storm worm and botnet. In October 2007, the botnet took advantage of flaws in YouTube's captcha application on its mail systems, to send targeted spam e-mails to Xbox owners with a scam involving winning a special version of the video game Halo 3. Other attack methods include using appealing animated images of laughing cats to get people to click on a trojan software download, and tricking users of Yahoo!'s GeoCities service to download software that was claimed to be needed to use GeoCities itself. The GeoCities attack in particular was called a \"full-fledged attack vector\" by Paul Ferguson of Trend Micro, and implicated members of the Russian Business Network, a well-known spam and malware service. On Christmas Eve in 2007, the Storm botnet began sending out holiday-themed messages revolving around male interest in women, with such titles as \"Find Some Christmas Tail\", \"The Twelve Girls of Christmas\", and \"Mrs. Claus Is Out Tonight!\" and photos of attractive women. It was described as an attempt to draw more unprotected systems into the botnet and boost its size over the holidays, when security updates from protection vendors may take longer to be distributed. A day after the e-mails with Christmas strippers were distributed, the Storm botnet operators immediately began sending new infected e-mails that claimed to wish their recipients a \"Happy New Year 2008!\"In January 2008, the botnet was detected for the first time to be involved in phishing attacks against major financial institutions, targeting both Barclays and Halifax.\n\n== Encryption and sales ==\nAround October 15, 2007, it was uncovered that portions of the Storm botnet and its variants could be for sale. This is being done by using unique security keys in the encryption of the botnet's Internet traffic and information. The unique keys will allow each segment, or sub-section of the Storm botnet, to communicate with a section that has a matching security key. However, this may also allow people to detect, track, and block Storm botnet traffic in the future, if the security keys have unique lengths and signatures. Computer security vendor Sophos has agreed with the assessment that the partitioning of the Storm botnet indicated likely resale of its services. Graham Cluley of Sophos said, \"Storm's use of encrypted traffic is an interesting feature which has raised eyebrows in our lab. Its most likely use is for the cybercriminals to lease out portions of the network for misuse. It wouldn't be a surprise if the network was used for spamming, distributed denial-of-service attacks, and other malicious activities.\" Security experts reported that if Storm is broken up for the malware market, in the form of a \"ready-to-use botnet-making spam kit\", the world could see a sharp rise in the number of Storm related infections and compromised computer systems. The encryption only seems to affect systems compromised by Storm from the second week of October 2007 onwards, meaning that any of the computer systems compromised after that time frame will remain difficult to track and block.Within days of the discovery of this segmenting of the Storm botnet, spam e-mail from the new subsection was uncovered by major security vendors. On the evening of October 17, security vendors began seeing new spam with embedded MP3 sound files, which attempted to trick victims into investing in a penny stock, as part of an illegal pump-and-dump stock scam. It was believed that this was the first-ever spam e-mail scam that made use of audio to fool victims. Unlike nearly all other Storm-related e-mails, however, these new audio stock scam messages did not include any sort of virus or Storm malware payload; they were simply part of the stock scam.In January 2008, the botnet was detected for the first time to be involved in phishing attacks against the customers of major financial institutions, targeting banking establishments in Europe including Barclays, Halifax and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The unique security keys used indicated to F-Secure that segments of the botnet were being leased.\n\n== Claimed decline of the botnet ==\nOn September 25, 2007, it was estimated that a Microsoft update to the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) may have helped reduce the size of the botnet by up to 20%. The new patch, as claimed by Microsoft, removed Storm from approximately 274,372 infected systems out of 2.6 million scanned Windows systems. However, according to senior security staff at Microsoft, \"the 180,000+ additional machines that have been cleaned by MSRT since the first day are likely to be home user machines that were not notably incorporated into the daily operation of the 'Storm' botnet,\" indicating that the MSRT cleaning may have been symbolic at best.As of late October 2007, some reports indicated that the Storm botnet was losing the size of its Internet footprint, and was significantly reduced in size. Brandon Enright, a University of California at San Diego security analyst, estimated that the botnet had by late October fallen to a size of approximately 160,000 compromised systems, from Enright's previous estimated high in July 2007 of 1,500,000 systems. Enright noted, however, that the botnet's composition was constantly changing, and that it was still actively defending itself against attacks and observation. \"If you're a researcher and you hit the pages hosting the malware too much\u2026 there is an automated process that automatically launches a denial of service [attack] against you\", he said, and added that his research caused a Storm botnet attack that knocked part of the UC San Diego network offline.The computer security company McAfee is reported as saying that the Storm Worm would be the basis of future attacks. Craig Schmugar, a noted security expert who discovered the Mydoom worm, called the Storm botnet a trend-setter, which has led to more usage of similar tactics by criminals. One such derivative botnet has been dubbed the \"Celebrity Spam Gang\", due to their use of similar technical tools as the Storm botnet controllers. Unlike the sophisticated social engineering that the Storm operators use to entice victims, however, the Celebrity spammers make use of offers of nude images of celebrities such as Angelina Jolie and Britney Spears. Cisco Systems security experts stated in a report that they believe the Storm botnet would remain a critical threat in 2008, and said they estimated that its size remained in the \"millions\".As of early 2008, the Storm botnet also found business competition in its black hat economy, in the form of Nugache, another similar botnet which was first identified in 2006.

    "instruction": "ProtonMail\n\n==Introduction==\nProton Mail (previously written as ProtonMail) is an end-to-end encrypted email service founded in 2013 in Geneva, Switzerland. It uses client-side encryption to protect email content and user data before they are sent to Proton Mail servers, unlike other common email providers such as Gmail and Outlook.com. The service can be accessed through a webmail client, the Tor network, or dedicated iOS and Android apps.Proton Mail is run by Proton AG (formerly Proton Technologies), which is based in the Canton of Geneva. The company also operates Proton VPN, Proton Drive and Proton Calendar. Proton Mail received initial funding through a crowdfunding campaign. Although the default account setup is free, the service is sustained by optional paid services. Initial membership was by invitation only; however, beginning in March 2016, Proton Mail was opened to the public. Acquiring no fewer than 2 million users by 2017, membership grew to almost 70 million by 2022.\n\n\n\n== Encryption ==\nProton Mail uses a combination of public-key cryptography and symmetric encryption protocols to offer end-to-end encryption. When a user creates a Proton Mail account, their browser generates a pair of public and private RSA keys:\n\nThe public key is used to encrypt the user's emails and other user data.\nThe private key capable of decrypting the user's data is symmetrically encrypted with the user's mailbox password.This symmetrical encryption happens in the user's web browser using AES-256. Upon account registration, the user is asked to provide a login password for their account.\nProton Mail also offers users an option to log in with a two-password mode that requires a login password and a mailbox password.\n\nThe login password is used for authentication.\nThe mailbox password encrypts the user's mailbox that contains received emails, contacts, and user information as well as a private encryption key.Upon logging in, the user has to provide both passwords. This is to access the account and the encrypted mailbox and its private encryption key. The decryption takes place client-side either in a web browser or in one of the apps. The public key and the encrypted private key are both stored on Proton Mail servers. Thus Proton Mail stores decryption keys only in their encrypted form so Proton Mail developers are unable to retrieve user emails or reset user mailbox passwords. This system absolves Proton Mail from:\n\nStoring either the unencrypted data or the mailbox password.\nDivulging the contents of past emails but not future emails.\nDecrypting the mailbox if requested or compelled by a court order.Proton Mail exclusively supports HTTPS and uses TLS with ephemeral key exchange to encrypt all Internet traffic between users and Proton Mail servers. Proton Mail holds an \"A+\" rating from Qualys SSL Labs.In September 2015, Proton Mail added native support to their web interface and mobile app for PGP. This allows a user to export their Proton Mail PGP-encoded public key to others outside of Proton Mail, enabling them to use the key for email encryption. The Proton Mail also supports PGP encryption from Proton Mail to outside users. Proton Mail also has support for searching within encrypted message content.\n\n\n*** Email sending ***\nAn email message sent from one Proton Mail account to another is automatically encrypted with the public key of the recipient. Once encrypted, only the private key of the recipient can decrypt the message. When the recipient logs in, their mailbox password decrypts their private key and unlocks their inbox.\nEmail messages sent from Proton Mail to non-Proton Mail email addresses may optionally be sent in plain text or with end-to-end encryption. With encryption, the message is encrypted with AES under a user-supplied password. The recipient receives a link to the Proton Mail website on which they can enter the password and read the decrypted message. Proton Mail assumes that the sender and the recipient have exchanged this password through a backchannel. Such email messages can be set to self-destruct after a period of time.\n\n== Location and security ==\nBoth Proton Mail and Proton VPN are located in Switzerland to avoid any surveillance or information requests from countries under the Fourteen Eyes, and/or under government surveillance laws such as the United States' Patriot Act or outside the bounds of law. The company claims that it is also located in Switzerland because of its strict privacy laws.As of October 2022 Proton Mail currently supports two-factor authentication with TOTP tokens or U2F for its login process.In 2018 Nadim Kobeissi published an article arguing that as Proton Mail was generally accessed through a web client, \"no end-to-end encryption guarantees have ever been provided by the Proton Mail service.\"In 2021, Proton Mail's security and cryptographic architecture were both independently audited by Securitum, a leading European security auditing company, who uncovered no major issues or security vulnerabilities, and the audit results were publicly published.\n\n== Data portability ==\nProton Mail limits data portability by locking support for external email client software through IMAP and POP3 protocols behind a paywall. As of 2021, users are unable to back up their email account locally without paying.\n\n== Data centers ==\nProton Mail maintains and owns its own server hardware and network in order to avoid utilizing a third party. It maintains two data centers, one in Lausanne and another in Attinghausen (in the former K7 military bunker under 1,000 meters (3,300 ft) of granite) as a backup. Since the servers are located in Switzerland, they are legally outside of the jurisdiction of the European Union, United States, and other countries. Under Swiss law, all surveillance requests from foreign countries must go through a Swiss court and are subject to international treaties. Prospective surveillance targets are promptly notified and can appeal the request in court.Each data center uses load balancing across web, mail, and SQL servers, redundant power supply, hard drives with full disk encryption, and exclusive use of Linux and other open-source software. In December 2014, Proton Mail joined the RIPE NCC in an effort to have more direct control over the surrounding Internet infrastructure.\n\n== DDoS attacks ==\nFrom November 3-7, 2015, Proton Mail was under several DDoS attacks that made the service largely unavailable to users. During the attacks, the company stated on Twitter that it was looking for a new data center in Switzerland, saying, \"many are afraid due to the magnitude of the attack against us\".In July 2018, Proton Mail reported it was once more suffering from DDoS attacks. CEO Andy Yen claimed that the attackers had been paid by an unknown party to launch the attacks. In September 2018, one of the suspected Proton Mail attackers was arrested by British law enforcement and charged in connection with a series of other high-profile cyberattacks against schools and airlines.\n\n== Blocks ==\n\n\n*** Belarus ***\nOn November 15, 2019, Proton confirmed that the government of the Republic of Belarus had issued a block across the country of Proton Mail and Proton VPN IP addresses. The block was no longer in place four days later. No explanation was given to Proton Mail for the block, nor for the block being lifted.\n\n\n*** Russia ***\nOn January 29, 2020, the Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media reported that it had implemented a complete block of Proton Mail services within the Russian Federation. As a reason for the block, it cited Proton Mail's refusal to give up information relating to accounts that allegedly sent out spam with terror threats. However, Proton Mail claimed that it did not receive any requests from Russian authorities regarding any such accounts. In response to the block, the Proton Mail Twitter account recommended legitimate users circumvent the block via VPNs or Tor.\nIn March 2020, the company announced that even though the Russia ban was not particularly successful, and the service continues to be largely available in Russia without using a VPN, Proton Mail will be releasing new anti-censorship features in both Proton Mail and Proton VPN desktop and mobile apps which will allow more block attempts to be automatically circumvented.\n\n== Compliance with Swiss court orders ==\nAccording to Proton Mail's transparency report, it is legally obligated to follow Swiss court orders if Swiss law is broken, and in 2020 Proton Mail received 3,572 orders from Swiss authorities and contested 750 of them. Due to the encryption utilized, Proton Mail is unable to hand over the contents of encrypted emails under any circumstances, but according to Proton's privacy policy, Proton Mail can be legally compelled to log IP addresses as part of a Swiss criminal investigation. For this reason, the company strongly suggests that users who need to hide their identity from the Swiss government use their Tor hidden service/onion site. In May 2022, Proton updated its privacy policy and made explicit a separate privacy policy for its Proton VPN service, which has a different treatment under Swiss law and has a strict no-logs policy which was also confirmed by an external audit.Notable cases involving Swiss court orders include a case involving death threats made against well-known immunologist Anthony Fauci and a case against French citizens charged with theft and destruction of property. After these cases, in October 2021, Proton Mail won an important Swiss court victory that confirmed that email services cannot be considered telecommunications providers, and consequently are not subject to the data retention requirements imposed on telecommunications providers.\n\n== Account types ==\nAs of February 20, 2023, Proton Mail offers the following account types for individuals:\nAs of February 20, 2023, Proton Mail offers the following account types for businesses:\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question.

Acquiring no fewer than 2 million users by 2017, membership grew to almost 70 million by 2022.\n\n\n\n== Encryption ==\nProton Mail uses a combination of public-key cryptography and symmetric encryption protocols to offer end-to-end encryption. When a user creates a Proton Mail account, their browser generates a pair of public and private RSA keys:\n\nThe public key is used to encrypt the user's emails and other user data.\nThe private key capable of decrypting the user's data is symmetrically encrypted with the user's mailbox password.This symmetrical encryption happens in the user's web browser using AES-256. Upon account registration, the user is asked to provide a login password for their account.\nProton Mail also offers users an option to log in with a two-password mode that requires a login password and a mailbox password.\n\nThe login password is used for authentication.\nThe mailbox password encrypts the user's mailbox that contains received emails, contacts, and user information as well as a private encryption key.Upon logging in, the user has to provide both passwords. This is to access the account and the encrypted mailbox and its private encryption key. The decryption takes place client-side either in a web browser or in one of the apps. The public key and the encrypted private key are both stored on Proton Mail servers. Thus Proton Mail stores decryption keys only in their encrypted form so Proton Mail developers are unable to retrieve user emails or reset user mailbox passwords. This system absolves Proton Mail from:\n\nStoring either the unencrypted data or the mailbox password.\nDivulging the contents of past emails but not future emails.\nDecrypting the mailbox if requested or compelled by a court order.Proton Mail exclusively supports HTTPS and uses TLS with ephemeral key exchange to encrypt all Internet traffic between users and Proton Mail servers. Proton Mail holds an \"A+\" rating from Qualys SSL Labs.In September 2015, Proton Mail added native support to their web interface and mobile app for PGP. This allows a user to export their Proton Mail PGP-encoded public key to others outside of Proton Mail, enabling them to use the key for email encryption. The Proton Mail also supports PGP encryption from Proton Mail to outside users. Proton Mail also has support for searching within encrypted message content.\n\n\n*** Email sending ***\nAn email message sent from one Proton Mail account to another is automatically encrypted with the public key of the recipient. Once encrypted, only the private key of the recipient can decrypt the message. When the recipient logs in, their mailbox password decrypts their private key and unlocks their inbox.\nEmail messages sent from Proton Mail to non-Proton Mail email addresses may optionally be sent in plain text or with end-to-end encryption. With encryption, the message is encrypted with AES under a user-supplied password. The recipient receives a link to the Proton Mail website on which they can enter the password and read the decrypted message. Proton Mail assumes that the sender and the recipient have exchanged this password through a backchannel. Such email messages can be set to self-destruct after a period of time.\n\n== Location and security ==\nBoth Proton Mail and Proton VPN are located in Switzerland to avoid any surveillance or information requests from countries under the Fourteen Eyes, and/or under government surveillance laws such as the United States' Patriot Act or outside the bounds of law. The company claims that it is also located in Switzerland because of its strict privacy laws.As of October 2022 Proton Mail currently supports two-factor authentication with TOTP tokens or U2F for its login process.In 2018 Nadim Kobeissi published an article arguing that as Proton Mail was generally accessed through a web client, \"no end-to-end encryption guarantees have ever been provided by the Proton Mail service.\"In 2021, Proton Mail's security and cryptographic architecture were both independently audited by Securitum, a leading European security auditing company, who uncovered no major issues or security vulnerabilities, and the audit results were publicly published.\n\n== Data portability ==\nProton Mail limits data portability by locking support for external email client software through IMAP and POP3 protocols behind a paywall. As of 2021, users are unable to back up their email account locally without paying.\n\n== Data centers ==\nProton Mail maintains and owns its own server hardware and network in order to avoid utilizing a third party. It maintains two data centers, one in Lausanne and another in Attinghausen (in the former K7 military bunker under 1,000 meters (3,300 ft) of granite) as a backup. Since the servers are located in Switzerland, they are legally outside of the jurisdiction of the European Union, United States, and other countries. Under Swiss law, all surveillance requests from foreign countries must go through a Swiss court and are subject to international treaties. Prospective surveillance targets are promptly notified and can appeal the request in court.Each data center uses load balancing across web, mail, and SQL servers, redundant power supply, hard drives with full disk encryption, and exclusive use of Linux and other open-source software. In December 2014, Proton Mail joined the RIPE NCC in an effort to have more direct control over the surrounding Internet infrastructure.\n\n== DDoS attacks ==\nFrom November 3-7, 2015, Proton Mail was under several DDoS attacks that made the service largely unavailable to users. During the attacks, the company stated on Twitter that it was looking for a new data center in Switzerland, saying, \"many are afraid due to the magnitude of the attack against us\".In July 2018, Proton Mail reported it was once more suffering from DDoS attacks. CEO Andy Yen claimed that the attackers had been paid by an unknown party to launch the attacks. In September 2018, one of the suspected Proton Mail attackers was arrested by British law enforcement and charged in connection with a series of other high-profile cyberattacks against schools and airlines.\n\n== Blocks ==\n\n\n*** Belarus ***\nOn November 15, 2019, Proton confirmed that the government of the Republic of Belarus had issued a block across the country of Proton Mail and Proton VPN IP addresses. The block was no longer in place four days later. No explanation was given to Proton Mail for the block, nor for the block being lifted.\n\n\n*** Russia ***\nOn January 29, 2020, the Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media reported that it had implemented a complete block of Proton Mail services within the Russian Federation. As a reason for the block, it cited Proton Mail's refusal to give up information relating to accounts that allegedly sent out spam with terror threats. However, Proton Mail claimed that it did not receive any requests from Russian authorities regarding any such accounts. In response to the block, the Proton Mail Twitter account recommended legitimate users circumvent the block via VPNs or Tor.\nIn March 2020, the company announced that even though the Russia ban was not particularly successful, and the service continues to be largely available in Russia without using a VPN, Proton Mail will be releasing new anti-censorship features in both Proton Mail and Proton VPN desktop and mobile apps which will allow more block attempts to be automatically circumvented.\n\n== Compliance with Swiss court orders ==\nAccording to Proton Mail's transparency report, it is legally obligated to follow Swiss court orders if Swiss law is broken, and in 2020 Proton Mail received 3,572 orders from Swiss authorities and contested 750 of them. Due to the encryption utilized, Proton Mail is unable to hand over the contents of encrypted emails under any circumstances, but according to Proton's privacy policy, Proton Mail can be legally compelled to log IP addresses as part of a Swiss criminal investigation. For this reason, the company strongly suggests that users who need to hide their identity from the Swiss government use their Tor hidden service/onion site. In May 2022, Proton updated its privacy policy and made explicit a separate privacy policy for its Proton VPN service, which has a different treatment under Swiss law and has a strict no-logs policy which was also confirmed by an external audit.Notable cases involving Swiss court orders include a case involving death threats made against well-known immunologist Anthony Fauci and a case against French citizens charged with theft and destruction of property. After these cases, in October 2021, Proton Mail won an important Swiss court victory that confirmed that email services cannot be considered telecommunications providers, and consequently are not subject to the data retention requirements imposed on telecommunications providers.\n\n== Account types ==\nAs of February 20, 2023, Proton Mail offers the following account types for individuals:\nAs of February 20, 2023, Proton Mail offers the following account types for businesses:"

    "instruction": "NSO Group\n\n==Introduction==\nNSO Group Technologies (NSO standing for Niv, Shalev and Omri, the names of the company's founders) is an Israeli cyber-intelligence firm primarily known for its proprietary spyware Pegasus, which is capable of remote zero-click surveillance of smartphones. It employed almost 500 people as of 2017.NSO claims that it provides authorized governments with technology that helps them combat terror and crime. The company says that it deals with government clients only. Pegasus spyware is classified as a weapon by Israel and any export of the technology must be approved by the government.According to several reports, NSO Group spyware has been used to target human rights activists and journalists in various countries, was used for state espionage against Pakistan, for warrantless domestic surveillance of Israeli citizens by Israeli police, and played a role in the murder of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi by agents of the Saudi government.In 2019, instant messaging company WhatsApp and its parent company Meta Platforms (then known as Facebook) sued NSO under the United States Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. In 2021, Apple filed a lawsuit against NSO in the U.S., and the US included NSO Group in its Entity List for acting against U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, effectively banning U.S. companies from supplying NSO.\n\n\n\n== Corporate profile ==\n\n\n*** Overview ***\nNSO Group is a subsidiary of the Q Cyber Technologies group of companies. Q Cyber Technologies is the name the NSO Group uses in Israel, but the company goes by OSY Technologies in Luxembourg, and in North America, a subsidiary formerly known as Westbridge. It has operated through various other companies around the world.\n\n\n**** Founding ****\nNSO Group was founded in 2010 by Niv Karmi, Omri Lavie, and Shalev Hulio. Hulio and Lavie were school friends who went into the technology start-up sector during the mid-2000s. The pair founded a company - CommuniTake - which offered a tool that let cellphone tech support workers access the customers' devices (but necessitating that the customer grant permission to enable access). After a European intelligence agency expressed interest in the product, the pair realised they could instead develop a tool that could gain access to phones without user authorisation, and market it to security and intelligence agencies. Karmi, who served in military intelligence and the Mossad, was brought on board to help market the tool with the help of his contacts. The first iteration of NSO's Pegasus spyware was finalised in 2011.\n\n\n**** Operations ****\nNSO Group has come to employ over 700 personnel globally. Almost all of NSO's research team is made up of former Israeli military intelligence personnel, most of them having served in Israel's Military Intelligence Directorate, and many of these in its Unit 8200. The company's most valuable staff are graduates of the military intelligence's highly selective advanced cyberweapons training programs. NSO seeks to uncover a surfeit of zero-day exploits in target devices to ensure smooth continuous access even as some of the security vulnerabilities exploited by NSO are inevitably discovered and patched, with labs in the company's Herzliya headquarters featuring racks stacked with phones being tested against new exploits.\n\n\n**** Relationship with the Israeli state ****\nPegasus spyware is classified as a military export by Israel and its sale is controlled by the government. According to The New York Times, \"Israel\u2019s government has long seen Pegasus as a critical tool for its foreign policy.\" and that it \"[...] has treated NSO as a de facto arm of the state, granting licenses for Pegasus to numerous countries [...] with which the Israeli government hoped to nurture stronger security and diplomatic ties.\" Israel has used the sale of NSO products as a diplomatic bargaining chip to advance its foreign policy interests as well as limiting its sale to or its use against certain states to maintain good relations with certain states. Israel has faced criticism for approving the sale of NSO technologies to countries with poor human rights records. U.S. intelligence officials have also said the Israeli state presumably has backdoor access to data obtained by Pegasus. NSO denies being \"a tool of Israeli diplomacy\", and denies the presence of a backdoor in its spyware tools.Israel, wary of angering the U.S. in the wake of the Snowden revelations, required NSO to prevent Pegasus from targeting American phone numbers. Israel has used Pegasus to advance its interests in the region, with Pegasus playing a role in negotiating the Abraham Accords. A New York Times investigation highlighted several instances in which the sale of Pegasus to a particular government coincided with that government's increased support of Israel. Israel has used Pegasus sales in its diplomatic efforts to forge a united front against Israel, thus clearing the sale of the spyware to Azerbaijan, Morocco, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. The Israeli government also blocked the sale of Pegasus to Estonia and Ukraine for fear that Israel's relations with Russia would be damaged if the spyware was used against Russia. Israel initially authorised the export of Pegasus to Estonia (which made a $30 million down payment to obtain the system), but after a senior Russian official approached Israeli security agencies and informed them that Russia had learned of Estonia's attempts to obtain Pegasus, the Israeli Ministry of Defense decided to disallow Estonia from using Pegasus against any Russian phone numbers following a heated debate on the issue among Israeli officials, and subsequently blocked the sale.\n\n\n*** Corporate history ***\nThe company's start-up funding came from a group of investors headed by Eddy Shalev, a partner in venture capital fund Genesis Partners which invested a total of $1.8 million for a 30% stake.In 2013, NSO's annual revenues were around US$40 million.In 2014, the U.S.-based private equity firm Francisco Partners bought the company for $130 million.In 2014, the surveillance firm Circles (which produces is a phone geolocation tool) was acquired by Francisco Parterns for $130 million, and thus became a corporate affiliate of NSO's.In 2015 Francisco was seeking to sell the company for up to $1 billion.Annual revenues were around $150 million in 2015.In June 2017, the company was put up for sale for more than $1 billion by Francisco Partners (roughly ten times what Francisco originally paid to acquire it in 2014). At the time it was put up for sale, NSO had almost 500 employees (up from around 50 in 2014).On February 14, 2019, Francisco Partners sold a majority (60%) stake of NSO back to co-founders Shalev Hulio and Omri Lavie, who were supported in the purchase by European private equity fund Novalpina Capital which specialises in investments in controversial companies. Hulio and Lavie invested $100 million, with Novalpina acquiring the remaining portion of the majority stake, thus valuing the company at approximately $1 billion. The day after the acquisition, Novalpina attempted to address the concerns raised by Citizen Lab with a letter, stating their belief that NSO operates with sufficient integrity and caution.In July 2021, investors in Novalpina Capital stripped Novalpina Capital of control over its assets (including NSO) after an unresolved personal dispute amongst the co-founders of Novalpina Capital. Berkeley Research Group (BRG), a California-based consultancy firm, was subsequently handed control over the assets (including NSO).By the time of BRG's takeover, NSO Group was in perilous financial straits, having gone months without a new sale and in risk of missing its debt payments and its November 2021 payroll payments. NSO CEO Shalev Hulio suggested to BRG that the company should improve its financial standing by starting to sell its products to high-risk customers previously deemed unacceptable, responding to objections by joking that missing debt payments was risky too. BRG was categorically opposed to the suggestion despite acknowledging that selling to high-risk customers was the only realistic way of maintaining NSO's business operations. Hulio proposed increasing sales to Israel's western allies (including U.S. law enforcement, the most lucrative prospective market), but the November 2021 U.S. blacklisting of NSO subsequently ended the company's prospects of breaking into the U.S. market (Hulio then devised a plan to split up the company in order to circumvent the U.S. sanctions). According to the Financial Times, NSO also seemed to have been abandoned by the previously doting Israeli government due to a proliferation of Israeli companies offering comparable technologies (including some established by former NSO employees). In a court filing, BRG described NSO as \"valueless\" to its private equity backers; in December 2021, a group of NSO creditors described NSO as insolvent in a letter to NSO's majority shareholders.Two of the ousted co-founders attempted to reclaim control over Novalpina Capital's assets by filing a lawsuit in Luxemburg, with a U.K. court allowing the case to proceed to trial in April 2022. In an April 2022 letter, BRG told an EU committee investigating abuse of NSO's products that NSO's management has not been forthcoming in providing information about its business operations, including on the issue of the company's blacklisting in the U.S.In the months after the November 2021 blacklisting of NSO by the U.S. Department of Commerce that resulted in an U.S. export ban for the company, and amid a campaign by the Israeli government to find a way to prevent the floundering NSO from going under, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a list of questions to NSO about how its spyware products operate. In 2022, L3Harris Technologies, a U.S. military contractor with experience in the spyware technology sector, was conducting talks on the possibility of acquiring NSO. L3Harris sought to acquire NSO's technology and code with the acquisition of the company's employees discussed as well. L3Harris executives travelled to Israel to conduct the talks which were not disclosed to the public. L3Harris reportedly told their NSO counterparts that they had the blessing and backing of the U.S. government and U.S. intelligence in pursuing the acquisition as long as the Pegasus source code and the cache of zero-day vulnerabilities uncovered by NSO could be passed on to the other intelligence agencies of the Five Eyes. The Israeli authorities were reportedly willing to fulfill the latter and reluctant to comply with the former, and also insisted that Israel ultimately retain control over issuing export licences for NSO's products. The Israeli authorities were also opposed to allowing L3Harris' employees to join NSO's development team in NSO's Israeli headquarters. The talks were revealed to the public by the press in June 2022, resulting in a scramble by the parties involved, with White House officials publicly condemning the negotiation in harsh terms, and L3Harris (which is heavily reliant on government contracts) reportedly notifying the U.S. government that they had abandoned the acquisition attempt. There were reportedly attempts to revive the negotiations in the weeks after the preceding negotiations were revealed by the press. An acquisition by a U.S.-based corporation could have lifted the blacklisting of NSO by the U.S. which had barred NSO from receiving exports from U.S. companies, hindering NSO's operations. Experts consulted by The Guardian said that due to the blacklisting of NSO Group, a new corporate entity would likely have had to be created before the U.S. government would allow the acquisition. A senior White House official commented anonymously for the article that made the secret acquisition negotiations public, stating that the White House had not been in any way involved in the deal, further stating that the U.S. government \"opposes efforts by foreign companies to circumvent US export control measures or sanctions [...]\".In August 2022, Hulio stepped down from his post as CEO, with the company's COO Yaron Shohat temporarily assuming the role until a full-time replacement was to be named. Hulio's resignation from his post as CEO came amid a restructuring of the company as it attempted to focus on pursuing clients among NATO member countries. The reorganisation also entailed a downsizing NSO's workforce, with 100 employees (out of a total of 750 employees) being let go.In March 2023, it was reported that Omrie Lavie had emerged in control of the company after multiple legal fights between NSO and a US financial firm called Treo, which previously controlled the equity fund that held a majority stake in the Israeli firm.\n\n\n*** Foreign offices and export controls ***\nIn late 2020, Vice Media published an article in which it reported that NSO Group had closed the Cyprus-based offices of Circles, the company it had acquired in 2014. The article, based on interviews with two former employees, described the integration between the two companies as \"awful\" and stated that NSO would rely on Circles' Bulgarian office instead. According to Vice, this came just over a year after an activist group known as Access Now wrote to authorities in both Cyprus and Bulgaria, asking them to further scrutinise NSO exports. Access now had stated that they had received denials from both the Bulgarian and Cypriot authorities, with both countries stating that they had not provided export licenses to the NSO group. Despite this, an article written by The Guardian during the 2021 Pegasus scandal quoted NSO Group as saying that it had been \"regulated by the export control regimes of Israel, Cyprus and Bulgaria\". NSO's own \"Transparency and Responsibility Report 2021\", published about a month before the scandal, makes the same statement, adding that those were the three countries through which NSO exported its products. Circles' Bulgarian office, in particular, was stated to have been founded as a \"bogus phone company\" in 2015 by Citizen Lab citing IntelligenceOnline, a part of Indigo Publications. This report was reprinted by the Bulgarian investigation publication Bivol in December 2020, which appended it with public registry documents which indicated that the company's Bulgarian office had grown to employ up to 150 people and had received two loans worth about 275 million American dollars in 2017 from two offshore companies and a Swiss bank registered in the Cayman Islands.\n\n== Products and services ==\n\n\n*** Pegasus ***\n\nNSO Groups offers the smartphone spyware tool Pegasus to government clients for the exclusive intended purpose of combating crime and terrorism. The first version of Pegasus was finalised in 2011. Pegasus spyware is classified as a weapon by Israel and any export of the technology must be approved by the government. The Israeli Ministry of Defense licenses the export of Pegasus to foreign governments, but not to private entities.Pegasus is compatible with iPhone and Android devices. It can be deployed remotely. Once deployed, it allows the client to access the target phone's data and sensors, including: location data, texts, emails, social media messages, files, camera, and microphone. The client-facing side of the tool is user friendly, and all that may be required (depending upon the case) of the client to begin deployment of Pegasus is to enter the target's phone number into the tool.\n\n\n**** Phantom ****\nPhantom is a phone hacking product marketed by Westbridge, the United States branch of NSO Group. According to a former NSO employee, \"Phantom\" is the brand name for the Pegasus in the U.S., but the two tools are otherwise identical. Israel required NSO Group to program Pegasus so as not to be able to target US phone numbers. NSO then launched Phantom for the U.S. market for use on U.S. targets, receiving permission from Israel to develop it as a specialty tool for exclusive use by U.S. governmental agencies.\n\n\n*** Circles ***\nIn 2014, the surveillance firm Circles was acquired by Francisco Partners, becoming a corporate affiliate of NSO Group. Circles' product is a phone geolocation tool. The firm has two systems. One operates by connecting to the purchasing country's local telecommunications companies\u2019 infrastructure. The other separate system, known as the \u201cCircles Cloud\u201d, is capable of interconnecting with telecommunications companies across the globe.In December 2020, the Citizen Lab reported that Supreme Council on National Security (SCNS) of the United Arab Emirates was set to receive both these systems. In a lawsuit filed against the NSO group in Israel, emails revealed links between Circles and several customers in the United Arab Emirates. Documents also revealed that Circles sent targets\u2019 locations and phone records to the UAE SCNS. Aside from Israel and the UAE, the report named the governments of Australia, Belgium, Botswana, Chile, Denmark, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Equatorial Guinea, Guatemala, Honduras, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, Serbia, Vietnam, Zambia, and Zimbabwe as likely customers of Circles surveillance technology.In September 2021, Forensic News published shipping records showing that in 2020 Circles supplied equipment to Uzbekistan's State Security Service (SGB).\n\n== Criticism and controversies ==\n\n\n*** Use of undercover private investigators to pursue critics ***\nIn October 2018, Associated Press reported that two Citizen Lab researchers were being pursued by undercover operatives with false identities. The undercover agents had been inquiring about their work involving NSO Group, and also appeared to be trying to goad the researchers into making anti-Semitic or otherwise damaging remarks. After growing suspicious, one researcher contacted AP reporters. Together, they managed to arrange a sting during a meeting with a suspected undercover operative at a hotel luncheon with AP journalists secretly awaiting nearby; after the journalists approached the operative to question him, the operative fled, bumping into chairs and circling the room as he tried to get away. There also appeared to be two additional undercover operatives in the room. The operative that met the researcher appeared to be filming the researcher with a hidden camera during the meeting, and one of the operatives standing nearby appeared to be recording the meeting as well. The operative was later identified as a former Israeli security official. Responding to the AP report, NSO denied any involvement. It was later also uncovered that the identified undercover agent had previously worked on a case linked to the Israeli private intelligence agency Black Cube; NSO Group subsequently denied contracting Black Cube, and Black Cube denied involvement as well.In February 2019, Associated Press reported that at least four more individuals - three lawyers involved in lawsuits against NSO Group for alleged sales of NSO spyware to governments with poor human rights records, and one journalist who had been covering said litigation - were being pursued by undercover operatives for their work on NSO. Undercover agents again tried to goad the individuals into making racist or anti-Israel remarks. Two of the individuals were surreptitiously recorded by the undercover operatives. Channel 12, an Israeli television channel, obtained and aired the secret recordings made by the undercover operatives shortly before the AP published the revelations. Channel 12 claimed the two individuals were attempting to smear NSO Group on behalf of Qatar. Channel 12 also confirmed that Black Cube undercover investigators were involved.\n\n\n*** WhatsApp lawsuit ***\nIn May 2019, messaging service WhatsApp alleged that a spyware injection exploit targeting its calling feature was developed by NSO. Victims were exposed to the spyware payload even if they did not answer the call. WhatsApp told the Financial Times that \"the attack has all the hallmarks of a private company known to work with governments to deliver spyware that reportedly takes over the functions of mobile phone operating systems.\" NSO denied involvement in selecting or targeting victims, but did not explicitly deny creating the exploit. In response to the alleged cyberattack, WhatsApp sued NSO under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and other US laws in a San Francisco court on October 29. WhatsApp stated that the exploit targeted 1,400 users in 20 countries, including \"at least 100 human-rights defenders, journalists and other members of civil society\". WhatsApp alerted the 1,400 targeted users. In at least one case, the surveillance was authorized by a judge.NSO employees had complained to WhatsApp about improved security, according to the court filings by WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook:\nOn or about May 13, 2019, Facebook publicly announced that it had investigated and identified a vulnerability involving the WhatsApp Service (CVE-2019-3568). WhatsApp and Facebook closed the vulnerability, contacted law enforcement, and advised users to update the WhatsApp app. Defendants subsequently complained that WhatsApp had closed the vulnerability. Specifically, NSO Employee 1 stated, \"You just closed our biggest remote for cellular ... It's on the news all over the world.\"\nIn April 2020, NSO group blamed its government clients for the hacking of 1,400 WhatsApp users, including journalists and human rights activists. However, the firm did not disclose the names of the clients which, as Citizen Lab stated, include authorities in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Morocco, and Mexico. In court filings WhatsApp alleged that its investigation showed that the hacks originated from NSO Group servers rather than its clients'. WhatsApp said \"NSO used a network of computers to monitor and update Pegasus after it was implanted on users' devices. These NSO-controlled computers served as the nerve centre through which NSO controlled its customers' operation and use of Pegasus.\" WhatsApp said that NSO gained \"unauthorised access\" to WhatsApp servers by reverse-engineering the WhatsApp app to be able to evade security features. NSO responded \"NSO Group does not operate the Pegasus software for its clients\".\n\n\n*** Apple lawsuit ***\nIn November 2021, Apple Inc. filed a complaint against NSO Group and its parent company Q Cyber Technologies in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California about the FORCEDENTRY exploit used to deploy the Pegasus spyware package, requesting injunctive relief, compensatory damages, punitive damages, and disgorgement of profits. The \"zero-click\" exploit was discovered by the Canadian Citizen Lab after Saudi activist Loujain al-Hathloul's iPhone was hacked. Technical information uncovered by Bill Marczak's team at the lab allowed Apple to warn thousands of its users, including U.S. State Department employees in Uganda. Researchers also discovered that spyware from QuaDream, another Israeli vendor, took advantage of the same vulnerability in iPhones.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: How has NSO Group's financial situation evolved, and what are the implications for the future of the company and its technologies?",

The pair founded a company - CommuniTake - which offered a tool that let cellphone tech support workers access the customers' devices (but necessitating that the customer grant permission to enable access). After a European intelligence agency expressed interest in the product, the pair realised they could instead develop a tool that could gain access to phones without user authorisation, and market it to security and intelligence agencies. Karmi, who served in military intelligence and the Mossad, was brought on board to help market the tool with the help of his contacts. The first iteration of NSO's Pegasus spyware was finalised in 2011.\n\n\n**** Operations ****\nNSO Group has come to employ over 700 personnel globally. Almost all of NSO's research team is made up of former Israeli military intelligence personnel, most of them having served in Israel's Military Intelligence Directorate, and many of these in its Unit 8200. The company's most valuable staff are graduates of the military intelligence's highly selective advanced cyberweapons training programs. NSO seeks to uncover a surfeit of zero-day exploits in target devices to ensure smooth continuous access even as some of the security vulnerabilities exploited by NSO are inevitably discovered and patched, with labs in the company's Herzliya headquarters featuring racks stacked with phones being tested against new exploits.\n\n\n**** Relationship with the Israeli state ****\nPegasus spyware is classified as a military export by Israel and its sale is controlled by the government. According to The New York Times, \"Israel\u2019s government has long seen Pegasus as a critical tool for its foreign policy.\" and that it \"[...] has treated NSO as a de facto arm of the state, granting licenses for Pegasus to numerous countries [...] with which the Israeli government hoped to nurture stronger security and diplomatic ties.\" Israel has used the sale of NSO products as a diplomatic bargaining chip to advance its foreign policy interests as well as limiting its sale to or its use against certain states to maintain good relations with certain states. Israel has faced criticism for approving the sale of NSO technologies to countries with poor human rights records. U.S. intelligence officials have also said the Israeli state presumably has backdoor access to data obtained by Pegasus. NSO denies being \"a tool of Israeli diplomacy\", and denies the presence of a backdoor in its spyware tools.Israel, wary of angering the U.S. in the wake of the Snowden revelations, required NSO to prevent Pegasus from targeting American phone numbers. Israel has used Pegasus to advance its interests in the region, with Pegasus playing a role in negotiating the Abraham Accords. A New York Times investigation highlighted several instances in which the sale of Pegasus to a particular government coincided with that government's increased support of Israel. Israel has used Pegasus sales in its diplomatic efforts to forge a united front against Israel, thus clearing the sale of the spyware to Azerbaijan, Morocco, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. The Israeli government also blocked the sale of Pegasus to Estonia and Ukraine for fear that Israel's relations with Russia would be damaged if the spyware was used against Russia. Israel initially authorised the export of Pegasus to Estonia (which made a $30 million down payment to obtain the system), but after a senior Russian official approached Israeli security agencies and informed them that Russia had learned of Estonia's attempts to obtain Pegasus, the Israeli Ministry of Defense decided to disallow Estonia from using Pegasus against any Russian phone numbers following a heated debate on the issue among Israeli officials, and subsequently blocked the sale.\n\n\n*** Corporate history ***\nThe company's start-up funding came from a group of investors headed by Eddy Shalev, a partner in venture capital fund Genesis Partners which invested a total of $1.8 million for a 30% stake.In 2013, NSO's annual revenues were around US$40 million.In 2014, the U.S.-based private equity firm Francisco Partners bought the company for $130 million.In 2014, the surveillance firm Circles (which produces is a phone geolocation tool) was acquired by Francisco Parterns for $130 million, and thus became a corporate affiliate of NSO's.In 2015 Francisco was seeking to sell the company for up to $1 billion.Annual revenues were around $150 million in 2015.In June 2017, the company was put up for sale for more than $1 billion by Francisco Partners (roughly ten times what Francisco originally paid to acquire it in 2014). At the time it was put up for sale, NSO had almost 500 employees (up from around 50 in 2014).On February 14, 2019, Francisco Partners sold a majority (60%) stake of NSO back to co-founders Shalev Hulio and Omri Lavie, who were supported in the purchase by European private equity fund Novalpina Capital which specialises in investments in controversial companies. Hulio and Lavie invested $100 million, with Novalpina acquiring the remaining portion of the majority stake, thus valuing the company at approximately $1 billion. The day after the acquisition, Novalpina attempted to address the concerns raised by Citizen Lab with a letter, stating their belief that NSO operates with sufficient integrity and caution.In July 2021, investors in Novalpina Capital stripped Novalpina Capital of control over its assets (including NSO) after an unresolved personal dispute amongst the co-founders of Novalpina Capital. Berkeley Research Group (BRG), a California-based consultancy firm, was subsequently handed control over the assets (including NSO).By the time of BRG's takeover, NSO Group was in perilous financial straits, having gone months without a new sale and in risk of missing its debt payments and its November 2021 payroll payments. NSO CEO Shalev Hulio suggested to BRG that the company should improve its financial standing by starting to sell its products to high-risk customers previously deemed unacceptable, responding to objections by joking that missing debt payments was risky too. BRG was categorically opposed to the suggestion despite acknowledging that selling to high-risk customers was the only realistic way of maintaining NSO's business operations. Hulio proposed increasing sales to Israel's western allies (including U.S. law enforcement, the most lucrative prospective market), but the November 2021 U.S. blacklisting of NSO subsequently ended the company's prospects of breaking into the U.S. market (Hulio then devised a plan to split up the company in order to circumvent the U.S. sanctions). According to the Financial Times, NSO also seemed to have been abandoned by the previously doting Israeli government due to a proliferation of Israeli companies offering comparable technologies (including some established by former NSO employees). In a court filing, BRG described NSO as \"valueless\" to its private equity backers; in December 2021, a group of NSO creditors described NSO as insolvent in a letter to NSO's majority shareholders.Two of the ousted co-founders attempted to reclaim control over Novalpina Capital's assets by filing a lawsuit in Luxemburg, with a U.K. court allowing the case to proceed to trial in April 2022. In an April 2022 letter, BRG told an EU committee investigating abuse of NSO's products that NSO's management has not been forthcoming in providing information about its business operations, including on the issue of the company's blacklisting in the U.S.In the months after the November 2021 blacklisting of NSO by the U.S. Department of Commerce that resulted in an U.S. export ban for the company, and amid a campaign by the Israeli government to find a way to prevent the floundering NSO from going under, the U.S. Commerce Department sent a list of questions to NSO about how its spyware products operate. In 2022, L3Harris Technologies, a U.S. military contractor with experience in the spyware technology sector, was conducting talks on the possibility of acquiring NSO. L3Harris sought to acquire NSO's technology and code with the acquisition of the company's employees discussed as well. L3Harris executives travelled to Israel to conduct the talks which were not disclosed to the public. L3Harris reportedly told their NSO counterparts that they had the blessing and backing of the U.S. government and U.S. intelligence in pursuing the acquisition as long as the Pegasus source code and the cache of zero-day vulnerabilities uncovered by NSO could be passed on to the other intelligence agencies of the Five Eyes. The Israeli authorities were reportedly willing to fulfill the latter and reluctant to comply with the former, and also insisted that Israel ultimately retain control over issuing export licences for NSO's products. The Israeli authorities were also opposed to allowing L3Harris' employees to join NSO's development team in NSO's Israeli headquarters. The talks were revealed to the public by the press in June 2022, resulting in a scramble by the parties involved, with White House officials publicly condemning the negotiation in harsh terms, and L3Harris (which is heavily reliant on government contracts) reportedly notifying the U.S. government that they had abandoned the acquisition attempt. There were reportedly attempts to revive the negotiations in the weeks after the preceding negotiations were revealed by the press. An acquisition by a U.S.-based corporation could have lifted the blacklisting of NSO by the U.S. which had barred NSO from receiving exports from U.S. companies, hindering NSO's operations. Experts consulted by The Guardian said that due to the blacklisting of NSO Group, a new corporate entity would likely have had to be created before the U.S. government would allow the acquisition. A senior White House official commented anonymously for the article that made the secret acquisition negotiations public, stating that the White House had not been in any way involved in the deal, further stating that the U.S. government \"opposes efforts by foreign companies to circumvent US export control measures or sanctions [...]\".In August 2022, Hulio stepped down from his post as CEO, with the company's COO Yaron Shohat temporarily assuming the role until a full-time replacement was to be named. Hulio's resignation from his post as CEO came amid a restructuring of the company as it attempted to focus on pursuing clients among NATO member countries. The reorganisation also entailed a downsizing NSO's workforce, with 100 employees (out of a total of 750 employees) being let go.In March 2023, it was reported that Omrie Lavie had emerged in control of the company after multiple legal fights between NSO and a US financial firm called Treo, which previously controlled the equity fund that held a majority stake in the Israeli firm.\n\n\n*** Foreign offices and export controls ***\nIn late 2020, Vice Media published an article in which it reported that NSO Group had closed the Cyprus-based offices of Circles, the company it had acquired in 2014. The article, based on interviews with two former employees, described the integration between the two companies as \"awful\" and stated that NSO would rely on Circles' Bulgarian office instead. According to Vice, this came just over a year after an activist group known as Access Now wrote to authorities in both Cyprus and Bulgaria, asking them to further scrutinise NSO exports. Access now had stated that they had received denials from both the Bulgarian and Cypriot authorities, with both countries stating that they had not provided export licenses to the NSO group. Despite this, an article written by The Guardian during the 2021 Pegasus scandal quoted NSO Group as saying that it had been \"regulated by the export control regimes of Israel, Cyprus and Bulgaria\". NSO's own \"Transparency and Responsibility Report 2021\", published about a month before the scandal, makes the same statement, adding that those were the three countries through which NSO exported its products. Circles' Bulgarian office, in particular, was stated to have been founded as a \"bogus phone company\" in 2015 by Citizen Lab citing IntelligenceOnline, a part of Indigo Publications. This report was reprinted by the Bulgarian investigation publication Bivol in December 2020, which appended it with public registry documents which indicated that the company's Bulgarian office had grown to employ up to 150 people and had received two loans worth about 275 million American dollars in 2017 from two offshore companies and a Swiss bank registered in the Cayman Islands.\n\n== Products and services ==\n\n\n*** Pegasus ***\n\nNSO Groups offers the smartphone spyware tool Pegasus to government clients for the exclusive intended purpose of combating crime and terrorism. The first version of Pegasus was finalised in 2011. Pegasus spyware is classified as a weapon by Israel and any export of the technology must be approved by the government. The Israeli Ministry of Defense licenses the export of Pegasus to foreign governments, but not to private entities.Pegasus is compatible with iPhone and Android devices. It can be deployed remotely. Once deployed, it allows the client to access the target phone's data and sensors, including: location data, texts, emails, social media messages, files, camera, and microphone. The client-facing side of the tool is user friendly, and all that may be required (depending upon the case) of the client to begin deployment of Pegasus is to enter the target's phone number into the tool.\n\n\n**** Phantom ****\nPhantom is a phone hacking product marketed by Westbridge, the United States branch of NSO Group. According to a former NSO employee, \"Phantom\" is the brand name for the Pegasus in the U.S., but the two tools are otherwise identical. Israel required NSO Group to program Pegasus so as not to be able to target US phone numbers. NSO then launched Phantom for the U.S. market for use on U.S. targets, receiving permission from Israel to develop it as a specialty tool for exclusive use by U.S. governmental agencies.\n\n\n*** Circles ***\nIn 2014, the surveillance firm Circles was acquired by Francisco Partners, becoming a corporate affiliate of NSO Group. Circles' product is a phone geolocation tool. The firm has two systems. One operates by connecting to the purchasing country's local telecommunications companies\u2019 infrastructure. The other separate system, known as the \u201cCircles Cloud\u201d, is capable of interconnecting with telecommunications companies across the globe.In December 2020, the Citizen Lab reported that Supreme Council on National Security (SCNS) of the United Arab Emirates was set to receive both these systems. In a lawsuit filed against the NSO group in Israel, emails revealed links between Circles and several customers in the United Arab Emirates. Documents also revealed that Circles sent targets\u2019 locations and phone records to the UAE SCNS. Aside from Israel and the UAE, the report named the governments of Australia, Belgium, Botswana, Chile, Denmark, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estonia, Equatorial Guinea, Guatemala, Honduras, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, Serbia, Vietnam, Zambia, and Zimbabwe as likely customers of Circles surveillance technology.In September 2021, Forensic News published shipping records showing that in 2020 Circles supplied equipment to Uzbekistan's State Security Service (SGB).\n\n== Criticism and controversies ==\n\n\n*** Use of undercover private investigators to pursue critics ***\nIn October 2018, Associated Press reported that two Citizen Lab researchers were being pursued by undercover operatives with false identities. The undercover agents had been inquiring about their work involving NSO Group, and also appeared to be trying to goad the researchers into making anti-Semitic or otherwise damaging remarks. After growing suspicious, one researcher contacted AP reporters. Together, they managed to arrange a sting during a meeting with a suspected undercover operative at a hotel luncheon with AP journalists secretly awaiting nearby; after the journalists approached the operative to question him, the operative fled, bumping into chairs and circling the room as he tried to get away. There also appeared to be two additional undercover operatives in the room. The operative that met the researcher appeared to be filming the researcher with a hidden camera during the meeting, and one of the operatives standing nearby appeared to be recording the meeting as well. The operative was later identified as a former Israeli security official. Responding to the AP report, NSO denied any involvement. It was later also uncovered that the identified undercover agent had previously worked on a case linked to the Israeli private intelligence agency Black Cube; NSO Group subsequently denied contracting Black Cube, and Black Cube denied involvement as well.In February 2019, Associated Press reported that at least four more individuals - three lawyers involved in lawsuits against NSO Group for alleged sales of NSO spyware to governments with poor human rights records, and one journalist who had been covering said litigation - were being pursued by undercover operatives for their work on NSO. Undercover agents again tried to goad the individuals into making racist or anti-Israel remarks. Two of the individuals were surreptitiously recorded by the undercover operatives. Channel 12, an Israeli television channel, obtained and aired the secret recordings made by the undercover operatives shortly before the AP published the revelations. Channel 12 claimed the two individuals were attempting to smear NSO Group on behalf of Qatar. Channel 12 also confirmed that Black Cube undercover investigators were involved.\n\n\n*** WhatsApp lawsuit ***\nIn May 2019, messaging service WhatsApp alleged that a spyware injection exploit targeting its calling feature was developed by NSO. Victims were exposed to the spyware payload even if they did not answer the call. WhatsApp told the Financial Times that \"the attack has all the hallmarks of a private company known to work with governments to deliver spyware that reportedly takes over the functions of mobile phone operating systems.\" NSO denied involvement in selecting or targeting victims, but did not explicitly deny creating the exploit. In response to the alleged cyberattack, WhatsApp sued NSO under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and other US laws in a San Francisco court on October 29. WhatsApp stated that the exploit targeted 1,400 users in 20 countries, including \"at least 100 human-rights defenders, journalists and other members of civil society\". WhatsApp alerted the 1,400 targeted users. In at least one case, the surveillance was authorized by a judge.NSO employees had complained to WhatsApp about improved security, according to the court filings by WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook:\nOn or about May 13, 2019, Facebook publicly announced that it had investigated and identified a vulnerability involving the WhatsApp Service (CVE-2019-3568). WhatsApp and Facebook closed the vulnerability, contacted law enforcement, and advised users to update the WhatsApp app. Defendants subsequently complained that WhatsApp had closed the vulnerability. Specifically, NSO Employee 1 stated, \"You just closed our biggest remote for cellular ... It's on the news all over the world.\"\nIn April 2020, NSO group blamed its government clients for the hacking of 1,400 WhatsApp users, including journalists and human rights activists. However, the firm did not disclose the names of the clients which, as Citizen Lab stated, include authorities in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Morocco, and Mexico. In court filings WhatsApp alleged that its investigation showed that the hacks originated from NSO Group servers rather than its clients'. WhatsApp said \"NSO used a network of computers to monitor and update Pegasus after it was implanted on users' devices. These NSO-controlled computers served as the nerve centre through which NSO controlled its customers' operation and use of Pegasus.\" WhatsApp said that NSO gained \"unauthorised access\" to WhatsApp servers by reverse-engineering the WhatsApp app to be able to evade security features. NSO responded \"NSO Group does not operate the Pegasus software for its clients\".\n\n\n*** Apple lawsuit ***\nIn November 2021, Apple Inc. filed a complaint against NSO Group and its parent company Q Cyber Technologies in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California about the FORCEDENTRY exploit used to deploy the Pegasus spyware package, requesting injunctive relief, compensatory damages, punitive damages, and disgorgement of profits. The \"zero-click\" exploit was discovered by the Canadian Citizen Lab after Saudi activist Loujain al-Hathloul's iPhone was hacked. Technical information uncovered by Bill Marczak's team at the lab allowed Apple to warn thousands of its users, including U.S. State Department employees in Uganda. Researchers also discovered that spyware from QuaDream, another Israeli vendor, took advantage of the same vulnerability in iPhones."

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nDisini v. Secretary of Justice\n\n==Introduction==\nDisini v. Secretary of Justice (G.R. Nos. 203335, et al.) is a landmark ruling of the Supreme Court of the Philippines handed down on February 18, 2014. When the Congress of the Philippines passed the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 the bill was immediately controversial, especially its strict penalties for the new crime of \"cyberlibel\", an upgraded form of the already existing criminal libel charge found in the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines.In the end, the Court declared that most of the law, including the cyberlibel provision, was constitutional. The ruling's abridgement of free expression has been widely criticized by critics of the law, including then attorney Harry Roque. The decision reached in Disini paved the way for the anti-fake news provisions of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.\n\n\n\n== Petition ==\nSeveral petitions were almost immediately submitted to the Supreme Court questioning the constitutionality of the Act upon its signing, including the petition of Jose Jesus M. Disini, Jr. on September 25, a Harvard-educated lawyer and law professor at the University of the Philippines College of Law from whose name the title of the case derives.\n\n== Initial deferment and protests ==\nOn October 2, the Supreme Court initially chose to defer action on the petitions, citing an absence of justices which prevented the Court from sitting en banc. The initial lack of a temporary restraining order meant that the law went into effect as scheduled on October 3.  In protest, Filipino netizens reacted by blacking out their Facebook profile pictures and trending the hashtag #NoToCybercrimeLaw on Twitter. \"Anonymous\" also defaced government websites, including those of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System and the Intellectual Property Office.\n\n== Temporary restraining order ==\nOn October 8, 2012, the Supreme Court decided to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO), pausing implementation of the law for 120 days. In early December 2012, the government requested the lifting of the TRO, which was denied. The TRO consolidated all fifteen petitions filed up to that point into one case.\n\n== Oral arguments ==\n\nOver four hours of oral arguments by petitioners were heard on January 15, 2013, followed by a three-hour rebuttal by the Office of the Solicitor General, representing the government, on January 29, 2013. This was the first time in Philippine history that oral arguments were uploaded online by the Supreme Court.\n\n== Ruling ==\nOn February 18, 2014, in a ruling penned by justice Roberto Abad, the Supreme Court ruled 12\u20131\u20132 that most of the law was constitutional, although it struck down other provisions, including the ones that violated double jeopardy. In total, \u00a74(c)(3), \u00a75 (only in relation to \u00a74(c)(2), \u00a74(c)(3), and \u00a74(c)(4)), \u00a77 (only in relation to sections \u00a74(c)(2) and \u00a74(c)(4)), \u00a712, and \u00a719 were struck down by the Court as unconstitutional.Notably, \"likes\" and \"retweets\" of libelous content, originally themselves also criminalized as libel under the law, were found to be legal, and this was the only instance in which the court modified the interpretation of section 4(c)(4). Only justice Marvic Leonen dissented from the ruling, writing that he believes the whole idea of criminal libel to be unconstitutional, and assailing the Court for not finding so.\nOf note also was the Court's justification for the higher penalties given to cybercrimes, such as prisi\u00f3n mayor (six to twelve years in prison) for cyberlibel:There exists a substantial distinction between crimes committed through the use of information and communications technology and similar crimes committed using other means. In using the technology in question, the offender often evades identification and is able to reach far more victims or cause greater harm. The distinction, therefore, creates a basis for higher penalties for cybercrimes.The Court's ruling also puts the burden of proof for whether or not there was malice on the defendant rather than the petitioner, even if the petitioner is a public figure. In his dissent in part, justice Antonio Carpio called this provision \"clearly repugnant to the Constitution.\"\n\n\n*** Motion for reconsideration ***\nWhile motions for reconsideration were immediately filed by numerous petitioners, including the Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility, they were all rejected with finality on April 22, 2014. However, justice Arturo Brion, who originally wrote a separate concurring opinion, changed his vote to dissent after reconsidering whether it was just to impose higher penalties for cyberlibel than for regular libel.\n\nWho represented the government during the oral arguments heard on the petitions questioning the constitutionality of the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012?",

In total, \u00a74(c)(3), \u00a75 (only in relation to \u00a74(c)(2), \u00a74(c)(3), and \u00a74(c)(4)), \u00a77 (only in relation to sections \u00a74(c)(2) and \u00a74(c)(4)), \u00a712, and \u00a719 were struck down by the Court as unconstitutional.Notably, \"likes\" and \"retweets\" of libelous content, originally themselves also criminalized as libel under the law, were found to be legal, and this was the only instance in which the court modified the interpretation of section 4(c)(4). Only justice Marvic Leonen dissented from the ruling, writing that he believes the whole idea of criminal libel to be unconstitutional, and assailing the Court for not finding so.\nOf note also was the Court's justification for the higher penalties given to cybercrimes, such as prisi\u00f3n mayor (six to twelve years in prison) for cyberlibel:There exists a substantial distinction between crimes committed through the use of information and communications technology and similar crimes committed using other means. In using the technology in question, the offender often evades identification and is able to reach far more victims or cause greater harm. The distinction, therefore, creates a basis for higher penalties for cybercrimes.The Court's ruling also puts the burden of proof for whether or not there was malice on the defendant rather than the petitioner, even if the petitioner is a public figure. In his dissent in part, justice Antonio Carpio called this provision \"clearly repugnant to the Constitution.\"\n\n\n*** Motion for reconsideration ***\nWhile motions for reconsideration were immediately filed by numerous petitioners, including the Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility, they were all rejected with finality on April 22, 2014. However, justice Arturo Brion, who originally wrote a separate concurring opinion, changed his vote to dissent after reconsidering whether it was just to impose higher penalties for cyberlibel than for regular libel."

    "instruction": "Pre-shared key\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, a pre-shared key (PSK) is a shared secret which was previously shared between the two parties using some secure channel before it needs to be used.\n\n== Key ==\nTo build a key from shared secret, the key derivation function is typically used. Such systems almost always use symmetric key cryptographic algorithms. The term PSK is used in Wi-Fi encryption such as Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), where the method is called WPA-PSK or WPA2-PSK, and also in the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), where it is known as EAP-PSK. In all these cases, both the wireless access points (AP) and all clients share the same key.The characteristics of this secret or key are determined by the system which uses it; some system designs require that such keys be in a particular format. It can be a password, a passphrase, or a hexadecimal string. The secret is used by all systems involved in the cryptographic processes used to secure the traffic between the systems.  \nCrypto systems rely on one or more keys for confidentiality.  One particular attack is always possible against keys, the brute force key space search attack. A sufficiently long, randomly chosen, key can resist any practical brute force attack, though not in principle if an attacker has sufficient computational power (see password strength and password cracking for more discussion). Unavoidably, however, pre-shared keys are held by both parties to the communication, and so can be compromised at one end, without the knowledge of anyone at the other. There are several tools available to help one choose strong passwords, though doing so over any network connection is inherently unsafe as one cannot in general know who, if anyone, may be eavesdropping on the interaction. Choosing keys used by cryptographic algorithms is somewhat different in that any pattern whatsoever should be avoided, as any such pattern may provide an attacker with a lower effort attack than brute force search. This implies random key choice to force attackers to spend as much effort as possible; this is very difficult in principle and in practice as well.

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nOblivious transfer\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, an oblivious transfer (OT) protocol is a type of protocol in which a sender transfers one of potentially many pieces of information to a receiver, but remains oblivious as to what piece (if any) has been transferred.\nThe first form of oblivious transfer was introduced in 1981 by Michael O. Rabin.1  In this form, the sender sends a message to the receiver with probability 1/2, while the sender remains oblivious as to whether or not the receiver received the message.  Rabin's oblivious transfer scheme is based on the RSA cryptosystem.  A more useful form of oblivious transfer called 1\u20132 oblivious transfer or \"1 out of 2 oblivious transfer\", was developed later by Shimon Even, Oded Goldreich, and Abraham Lempel,2 in order to build protocols for secure multiparty computation. It is generalized to \"1 out of n oblivious transfer\" where the user gets exactly one database element without the server getting to know which element was queried, and without the user knowing anything about the other elements that were not retrieved.

Rabin.1  In this form, the sender sends a message to the receiver with probability 1/2, while the sender remains oblivious as to whether or not the receiver received the message.  Rabin's oblivious transfer scheme is based on the RSA cryptosystem.  A more useful form of oblivious transfer called 1\u20132 oblivious transfer or \"1 out of 2 oblivious transfer\", was developed later by Shimon Even, Oded Goldreich, and Abraham Lempel,2 in order to build protocols for secure multiparty computation. It is generalized to \"1 out of n oblivious transfer\" where the user gets exactly one database element without the server getting to know which element was queried, and without the user knowing anything about the other elements that were not retrieved. The latter notion of oblivious transfer is a strengthening of private information retrieval, in which the database is not kept private.\nClaude Cr\u00e9peau showed that Rabin's oblivious transfer is equivalent to 1\u20132 oblivious transfer.3Further work has revealed oblivious transfer to be a fundamental and important problem in cryptography.

    "instruction": "Email spoofing\n\n==Introduction==\nEmail spoofing is the creation of email messages with a forged sender address. The term applies to email purporting to be from an address which is not actually the sender's; mail sent in reply to that address may bounce or be delivered to an unrelated party whose identity has been faked. Disposable email address or \"masked\" email is a different topic, providing a masked email address that is not the user's normal address, which is not disclosed (for example, so that it cannot be harvested), but forwards mail sent to it to the user's real address.The original transmission protocols used for email do not have built-in authentication methods: this deficiency allows spam and phishing emails to use spoofing in order to mislead the recipient. More recent countermeasures have made such spoofing from internet sources more difficult but not eliminated it; few internal networks have defenses against a spoof email from a colleague's compromised computer on that network. Individuals and businesses deceived by spoof emails may suffer significant financial losses; in particular, spoofed emails are often used to infect computers with ransomware.\n\n== Technical details ==\nWhen a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) email is sent, the initial connection provides two pieces of address information:\n\nMAIL FROM: - generally presented to the recipient as the Return-path: header but not normally visible to the end user, and by default no checks are done that the sending system is authorized to send on behalf of that address.\nRCPT TO: - specifies which email address the email is delivered to, is not normally visible to the end user but may be present in the headers as part of the \"Received:\" header.Together, these are sometimes referred to as the \"envelope\" addressing \u2013 an analogy to a traditional paper envelope. Unless the receiving mail server signals that it has problems with either of these items, the sending system sends the \"DATA\" command, and typically sends several header items, including:\n\nFrom: Joe Q Doe <joeqdoe@example.com>  - the address visible to the recipient; but again, by default no checks are done that the sending system is authorized to send on behalf of that address.\nReply-to: Jane Roe <Jane.Roe@example.mil> - similarly not checkedand sometimes:\n\nSender: Jin Jo <jin.jo@example.jp> - also not checkedThe result is that the email recipient sees the email as having come from the address in the From: header. They may sometimes be able to find the MAIL FROM address, and if they reply to the email, it will go to either the address presented in the From: or Reply-to: header, but none of these addresses are typically reliable, so automated bounce messages may generate backscatter.\nAlthough email spoofing is effective in forging the email address, the IP address of the computer sending the mail can generally be identified from the \"Received:\" lines in the email header. In malicious cases, however, this is likely to be the computer of an innocent third party infected by malware that is sending the email without the owner's knowledge.\n\n== Malicious use of spoofing ==\nPhishing and business email compromise (see below) scams generally involve an element of email spoofing.\nEmail spoofing has been responsible for public incidents with serious business and financial consequences. This was the case in an October 2013 email to a news agency which was spoofed to look as if it was from the Swedish company Fingerprint Cards. The email stated that Samsung offered to purchase the company. The news spread and the stock exchange rate surged by 50%.Malware such as Klez and Sober among many more modern examples often search for email addresses within the computer they have infected, and they use those addresses both as targets for email, and also to create credible forged From fields in the emails that they send. This is to ensure that the emails are more likely to be opened. For example:\n\nAlice is sent an infected email which she opens, running the worm code.\nThe worm code searches Alice's email address book and finds the addresses of Bob and Charlie.\nFrom Alice's computer, the worm sends an infected email to Bob, but is forged to appear as if it was sent by Charlie.In this case, even if Bob's system detects the incoming mail as containing malware, he sees the source as being Charlie, even though it really came from Alice's computer. Meanwhile, Alice may remain unaware that her computer has been infected, and Charlie does not know anything about it at all, unless he receives an error message from Bob.\nHow does email spoofing differ from spam and email phishing?\nThe main difference between spam and a spoofed message is that spammers don't edit email headers to pretend the email was sent from someone else. Both phishing and spoofing emails aim to trick someone to believe the message was sent from a legitimate sender. However, the main phishers' intent is to compromise user personal and financial information, while spoofing emails is just one of the ways they use to do so.\n\n== The effect on mail servers ==\nTraditionally, mail servers could accept a mail item, then later send a Non-Delivery Report or \"bounce\" message if it couldn't be delivered or had been quarantined for any reason.

      "answer": "Email spoofing affects the trust in email communication as it allows attackers to forge sender addresses, making it difficult for recipients to identify the true sender of an email. This can lead to recipients being tricked into providing personal and financial information, transferring money, or opening infected email attachments.",
      "context": "Email spoofing\n\n==Introduction==\nEmail spoofing is the creation of email messages with a forged sender address. The term applies to email purporting to be from an address which is not actually the sender's; mail sent in reply to that address may bounce or be delivered to an unrelated party whose identity has been faked. Disposable email address or \"masked\" email is a different topic, providing a masked email address that is not the user's normal address, which is not disclosed (for example, so that it cannot be harvested), but forwards mail sent to it to the user's real address.The original transmission protocols used for email do not have built-in authentication methods: this deficiency allows spam and phishing emails to use spoofing in order to mislead the recipient. More recent countermeasures have made such spoofing from internet sources more difficult but not eliminated it; few internal networks have defenses against a spoof email from a colleague's compromised computer on that network. Individuals and businesses deceived by spoof emails may suffer significant financial losses; in particular, spoofed emails are often used to infect computers with ransomware.\n\n== Technical details ==\nWhen a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) email is sent, the initial connection provides two pieces of address information:\n\nMAIL FROM: - generally presented to the recipient as the Return-path: header but not normally visible to the end user, and by default no checks are done that the sending system is authorized to send on behalf of that address.\nRCPT TO: - specifies which email address the email is delivered to, is not normally visible to the end user but may be present in the headers as part of the \"Received:\" header.Together, these are sometimes referred to as the \"envelope\" addressing \u2013 an analogy to a traditional paper envelope. Unless the receiving mail server signals that it has problems with either of these items, the sending system sends the \"DATA\" command, and typically sends several header items, including:\n\nFrom: Joe Q Doe <joeqdoe@example.com>  - the address visible to the recipient; but again, by default no checks are done that the sending system is authorized to send on behalf of that address.\nReply-to: Jane Roe <Jane.Roe@example.mil> - similarly not checkedand sometimes:\n\nSender: Jin Jo <jin.jo@example.jp> - also not checkedThe result is that the email recipient sees the email as having come from the address in the From: header. They may sometimes be able to find the MAIL FROM address, and if they reply to the email, it will go to either the address presented in the From: or Reply-to: header, but none of these addresses are typically reliable, so automated bounce messages may generate backscatter.\nAlthough email spoofing is effective in forging the email address, the IP address of the computer sending the mail can generally be identified from the \"Received:\" lines in the email header. In malicious cases, however, this is likely to be the computer of an innocent third party infected by malware that is sending the email without the owner's knowledge.\n\n== Malicious use of spoofing ==\nPhishing and business email compromise (see below) scams generally involve an element of email spoofing.\nEmail spoofing has been responsible for public incidents with serious business and financial consequences. This was the case in an October 2013 email to a news agency which was spoofed to look as if it was from the Swedish company Fingerprint Cards. The email stated that Samsung offered to purchase the company. The news spread and the stock exchange rate surged by 50%.Malware such as Klez and Sober among many more modern examples often search for email addresses within the computer they have infected, and they use those addresses both as targets for email, and also to create credible forged From fields in the emails that they send.

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nRandomness extractor\n\n==Introduction==\nA randomness extractor, often simply called an \"extractor\", is a function, which being applied to output from a weakly random entropy source, together with a short, uniformly random seed, generates a highly random output that appears independent from the source and uniformly distributed.  Examples of weakly random sources include radioactive decay or thermal noise; the only restriction on possible sources is that there is no way they can be fully controlled, calculated or predicted, and that a lower bound on their entropy rate can be established.  For a given source, a randomness extractor can even be considered to be a true random number generator (TRNG); but there is no single extractor that has been proven to produce truly random output from any type of weakly random source.\nSometimes the term \"bias\" is used to denote a weakly random source's departure from uniformity, and in older literature, some extractors are called unbiasing algorithms, as they take the randomness from a so-called \"biased\" source and output a distribution that appears unbiased.  The weakly random source will always be longer than the extractor's output, but an efficient extractor is one that lowers this ratio of lengths as much as possible, while simultaneously keeping the seed length low.  Intuitively, this means that as much randomness as possible has been \"extracted\" from the source.\nNote that an extractor has some conceptual similarities with a pseudorandom generator (PRG), but the two concepts are not identical. Both are functions that take as input a small, uniformly random seed and produce a longer output that \"looks\" uniformly random. Some pseudorandom generators are, in fact, also extractors.  (When a PRG is based on the existence of hard-core predicates, one can think of the weakly random source as a set of truth tables of such predicates and prove that the output is statistically close to uniform.) However, the general PRG definition does not specify that a weakly random source must be used, and while in the case of an extractor, the output should be statistically close to uniform, in a PRG it is only required to be computationally indistinguishable from uniform, a somewhat weaker concept.\nNIST Special Publication 800-90B (draft) recommends several extractors, including the SHA hash family and states that if the amount of entropy input is twice the number of bits output from them, that output can be considered essentially fully random.\n\n\n\n== Formal definition of extractors ==\nThe min-entropy of a distribution \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n   (denoted \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          H\n          \n            \u221e\n          \n        \n        (\n        X\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H_{\\infty }(X)}\n  ), is the largest real number \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k}\n   such that \n  \n    \n      \n        Pr\n        [\n        X\n\n== Randomness extractors in cryptography ==\nOne of the most important aspects of cryptography is random key generation. It is often necessary to generate secret and random keys from sources that are semi-secret or which may be compromised to some degree. By taking a single, short (and secret) random key as a source, an extractor can be used to generate a longer pseudo-random key, which then can be used for public key encryption. More specifically, when a strong extractor is used its output will appear be uniformly random, even to someone who sees part (but not all) of the source.  For example, if the source is known but the seed is not known (or vice versa).  This property of extractors is particularly useful in what is commonly called Exposure-Resilient cryptography in which the desired extractor is used as an Exposure-Resilient Function (ERF).  Exposure-Resilient cryptography takes into account that the fact that it is difficult to keep secret the initial exchange of data which often takes place during the initialization of an encryption application e.g., the sender of encrypted information has to provide the receivers with information which is required for decryption.\nThe following paragraphs define and establish an important relationship between two kinds of ERF--k-ERF and k-APRF--which are useful in Exposure-Resilient cryptography.  \nDefinition (k-ERF): An adaptive k-ERF is a function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n   where, for a random input \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n   , when a computationally unbounded adversary \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n   can adaptively read all of \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n   except for  \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k}\n   bits,  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        Pr\n        {\n        \n          A\n          \n            r\n          \n        \n        (\n        f\n        (\n        r\n        )\n        )\n\n== Examples ==\n\n\n*** Von Neumann extractor ***\n\nPerhaps the earliest example is due to John von Neumann.

This is an important property of extractors, as it allows for the use of non-uniform sources of randomness in cryptographic applications.",
      "context": "Randomness extractor\n\n==Introduction==\nA randomness extractor, often simply called an \"extractor\", is a function, which being applied to output from a weakly random entropy source, together with a short, uniformly random seed, generates a highly random output that appears independent from the source and uniformly distributed.  Examples of weakly random sources include radioactive decay or thermal noise; the only restriction on possible sources is that there is no way they can be fully controlled, calculated or predicted, and that a lower bound on their entropy rate can be established.  For a given source, a randomness extractor can even be considered to be a true random number generator (TRNG); but there is no single extractor that has been proven to produce truly random output from any type of weakly random source.\nSometimes the term \"bias\" is used to denote a weakly random source's departure from uniformity, and in older literature, some extractors are called unbiasing algorithms, as they take the randomness from a so-called \"biased\" source and output a distribution that appears unbiased.  The weakly random source will always be longer than the extractor's output, but an efficient extractor is one that lowers this ratio of lengths as much as possible, while simultaneously keeping the seed length low.  Intuitively, this means that as much randomness as possible has been \"extracted\" from the source.\nNote that an extractor has some conceptual similarities with a pseudorandom generator (PRG), but the two concepts are not identical. Both are functions that take as input a small, uniformly random seed and produce a longer output that \"looks\" uniformly random. Some pseudorandom generators are, in fact, also extractors.  (When a PRG is based on the existence of hard-core predicates, one can think of the weakly random source as a set of truth tables of such predicates and prove that the output is statistically close to uniform.) However, the general PRG definition does not specify that a weakly random source must be used, and while in the case of an extractor, the output should be statistically close to uniform, in a PRG it is only required to be computationally indistinguishable from uniform, a somewhat weaker concept.\nNIST Special Publication 800-90B (draft) recommends several extractors, including the SHA hash family and states that if the amount of entropy input is twice the number of bits output from them, that output can be considered essentially fully random.\n\n\n\n== Formal definition of extractors ==\nThe min-entropy of a distribution \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n   (denoted \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          H\n          \n            \u221e\n          \n        \n        (\n        X\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H_{\\infty }(X)}\n  ), is the largest real number \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k}\n   such that \n  \n    \n      \n        Pr\n        [\n        X\n\n== Randomness extractors in cryptography ==\nOne of the most important aspects of cryptography is random key generation. It is often necessary to generate secret and random keys from sources that are semi-secret or which may be compromised to some degree. By taking a single, short (and secret) random key as a source, an extractor can be used to generate a longer pseudo-random key, which then can be used for public key encryption. More specifically, when a strong extractor is used its output will appear be uniformly random, even to someone who sees part (but not all) of the source.  For example, if the source is known but the seed is not known (or vice versa).  This property of extractors is particularly useful in what is commonly called Exposure-Resilient cryptography in which the desired extractor is used as an Exposure-Resilient Function (ERF).  Exposure-Resilient cryptography takes into account that the fact that it is difficult to keep secret the initial exchange of data which often takes place during the initialization of an encryption application e.g., the sender of encrypted information has to provide the receivers with information which is required for decryption.\nThe following paragraphs define and establish an important relationship between two kinds of ERF--k-ERF and k-APRF--which are useful in Exposure-Resilient cryptography.  \nDefinition (k-ERF): An adaptive k-ERF is a function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n   where, for a random input \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n   , when a computationally unbounded adversary \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n   can adaptively read all of \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n   except for  \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k}\n   bits,  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        Pr\n        {\n        \n          A\n          \n            r\n          \n        \n        (\n        f\n        (\n        r\n        )\n        )\n\n== Examples ==\n\n\n*** Von Neumann extractor ***\n\nPerhaps the earliest example is due to John von Neumann.

The standard was originally published jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in 2005, revised in 2013, and again most recently in 2022. There are also numerous recognized national variants of the standard.  It details requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and continually improving an information security management system (ISMS) \u2013 the aim of which is to help organizations make the information assets they hold more secure. Organizations that meet the standard's requirements can choose to be certified by an accredited certification body following successful completion of an audit. The effectiveness of the ISO/IEC 27001 certification process and the overall standard has been addressed in a large-scale study conducted in 2020.\n\n\n\n== How the standard works ==\nMost organizations have a number of information security controls. However, without an information security management system (ISMS), controls tend to be somewhat disorganized and disjointed, having been implemented often as point solutions to specific situations or simply as a matter of convention. Security controls in operation typically address certain aspects of information technology (IT) or data security specifically; leaving non-IT information assets (such as paperwork and proprietary knowledge) less protected on the whole. Moreover, business continuity planning and physical security may be managed quite independently of IT or information security while Human Resources practices may make little reference to the need to define and assign information security roles and responsibilities throughout the organization.\nISO/IEC 27001 requires that management:\n\nSystematically examine the organization's information security risks, taking account of the threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts;\nDesign and implement a coherent and comprehensive suite of information security controls and/or other forms of risk treatment (such as risk avoidance or risk transfer) to address those risks that are deemed unacceptable; and\nAdopt an overarching management process to ensure that the information security controls continue to meet the organization's information security needs on an ongoing basis.What controls will be tested as part of certification to ISO/IEC 27001 is dependent on the certification auditor. This can include any controls that the organisation has deemed to be within the scope of the ISMS and this testing can be to any depth or extent as assessed by the auditor as needed to test that the control has been implemented and is operating effectively.\nManagement determines the scope of the ISMS for certification purposes and may limit it to, say, a single business unit or location. The ISO/IEC 27001 certificate does not necessarily mean the remainder of the organization, outside the scoped area, has an adequate approach to information security management.\nOther standards in the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards provide additional guidance on certain aspects of designing, implementing and operating an ISMS, for example on information security risk management (ISO/IEC 27005).\n\n== History of ISO/IEC 27001 ==\nBS 7799 was a standard originally published by BSI Group in 1995. It was written by the UK government's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and consisted of several parts.\nThe first part, containing the best practices for information security management, was revised in 1998; after a lengthy discussion in the worldwide standards bodies, it was eventually adopted by ISO as ISO/IEC 17799, \"Information Technology - Code of practice for information security management.\" in 2000. ISO/IEC 17799 was then revised in June 2005 and finally incorporated in the ISO 27000 series of standards as ISO/IEC 27002 in July 2007.\nThe second part of BS7799 was first published by BSI in 1999, known as BS 7799 Part 2, titled \"Information Security Management Systems - Specification with guidance for use.\" BS 7799-2 focused on how to implement an Information security management system (ISMS), referring to the information security management structure and controls identified in BS 7799-2. This later became ISO/IEC 27001:2005. BS 7799 Part 2 was adopted by ISO as ISO/IEC 27001 in November 2005.\nBS 7799 Part 3 was published in 2005, covering risk analysis and management. It aligns with ISO/IEC 27001:2005.\nVery little reference or use is made to any of the BS standards in connection with ISO/IEC 27001.\n\n== Certification ==\nAn ISMS may be certified compliant with the ISO/IEC 27001 standard by a number of Accredited Registrars worldwide. Certification against any of the recognized national variants of ISO/IEC 27001 (e.g. JIS Q 27001, the Japanese version) by an accredited certification body is functionally equivalent to certification against ISO/IEC 27001 itself.\nIn some countries, the bodies that verify conformity of management systems to specified standards are called \"certification bodies\", while in others they are commonly referred to as \"registration bodies\", \"assessment and registration bodies\", \"certification/ registration bodies\", and sometimes \"registrars\".\nThe ISO/IEC 27001 certification, like other ISO management system certifications, usually involves a three-stage external audit process defined by ISO/IEC 17021 and ISO/IEC 27006 standards:\n\nStage 1 is a preliminary, informal review of the ISMS.  For example there are checks for the existence and completeness of key documentation, such as the organization's information security policy, Statement of Applicability (SoA), and Risk Treatment Plan (RTP). This stage serves to familiarize the auditors with the organization and vice versa.\nStage 2 is a more detailed and formal compliance audit, independently testing the ISMS against the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 27001. The auditors will seek evidence to confirm that the management system has been properly designed and implemented, and is in fact in operation (for example by confirming that a security committee or similar management body meets regularly to oversee the ISMS). Certification audits are usually conducted by ISO/IEC 27001 Lead Auditors. Passing this stage results in the ISMS being certified compliant with ISO/IEC 27001.\nOngoing involves follow-up reviews or audits to confirm that the organization remains in compliance with the standard. Certification maintenance requires periodic re-assessment audits to confirm that the ISMS continues to operate as specified and intended. These should happen at least annually but (by agreement with management) are often conducted more frequently, particularly while the ISMS is still maturing.\nAnswer this question: What is the purpose of an ISMS according to ISO/IEC 27001?",

SSH client programs (such as ssh from OpenSSH) typically run for the duration of a remote login session and are configured to look for the user's private key in a file in the user's home directory (e.g., .ssh/id_rsa).  For added security (for instance, against an attacker that can read any file on the local filesystem), it is common to store the private key in an encrypted form, where the encryption key is computed from a passphrase that the user has memorized.  Because typing the passphrase can be tedious, many users would prefer to enter it just once per local login session.  The most secure place to store the unencrypted key is in program memory, and in Unix-like operating systems, memory is normally associated with a process. A normal SSH client process cannot be used to store the unencrypted key because SSH client processes only last the duration of a remote login session.  Therefore, users run a program called ssh-agent that runs beyond the duration of a local login session, stores unencrypted keys in memory, and communicates with SSH clients using a Unix domain socket.\n\n\n\n== Security issues ==\nssh-agent creates a socket and then checks the connections from ssh. Everyone who is able to connect to this socket also has access to the ssh-agent. The permissions are set as in a usual Linux or Unix system.

The socket is located in this directory.\nThere is a procedure that may prevent malware from using the ssh-agent socket. If the ssh-add -c option is set when the keys are imported into the ssh-agent, then the agent requests a confirmation from the user using the program specified by the SSH_ASKPASS environment variable, whenever ssh tries to connect.\nSsh-agents can be \"forwarded\" onto a server you connect to, making their keys available there as well, for other connections.  On the local system, it is important that the root user is trustworthy, because the root user can, amongst other things, just read the key file directly. On the remote system, if the ssh-agent connection is forwarded, it is also important that the root user on the other end is trustworthy, because it can access the agent socket on the remote (though not the key, which stays local).\n\n== Implementations ==\nThere are many different programs that perform the same functionality as the OpenSSH ssh-agent, some with very different user interfaces.

This solid state design dating from the mid-to-late 1960s, originally cost $13,000 per copy.  It was one of the first crypto machines to encrypt data such as facsimile. Crypto technicians received 10 to 12 weeks training on the machine.  The KG-13 was composed of a KG-3 transmitter and a KG-12 receiver.\nA KG-13 unit. One drawer bears the designation KGD-3/TSEC.  The total weight is around 250 pounds. The KG-13 was controlled by \"key cards\". These were IBM-like punch cards that determined the starting point of the KG-13 encryption which was done by \"koken stages\". The key cards were changed daily at HJ time. When the USS Pueblo, with a KG-13 aboard, was captured by the North Koreans in 1968, the personnel didn't have time to destroy it. As a result, a working model of the KG-13 fell into enemy hands. NSA quickly designed a modification to the koken stage board to alter its operation in order that the enemy didn't have an identical working model.\n\n\n*** Card Reader Description ***\nSelect this link to see the inside of the card reader.  Ronald Coppock, who worked with the KG-13 indicates that it was fitted with a card cutter and also without.  \"In Ethiopia, I worked at two locations (Stonehouse and Tract C)  that had KG13's equipped with the KW26 style card cutters. All the machines at Stonehouse were equipped that way and about 20% at Tract C. At the 7th Radio Research in South East Asia, about 30% of the KG13's had the card cutter style card readers. 13's equipped with the card cutters were operated on very high priority circuits with short cycles to change key material. Some were on 6 hour and others on 12 hour cycles\".\nThe KG-13 did have a major difference in that in its latter years,  it was equipped with a Card Reader Insert Board or CRIB.\n\n\n*** Internal Description ***\nThe KG-13  employed  \"FLYBALL\" modules. These were modules made of discrete components set up as logic element circuit groups such as NAND gates, NOR gates, XOR gates, flip flops, monostables, multivibrators, etc.  Once tested, the modules were potted in a compound whose colour indicated their function. The coloured potting compound was extremely hard and any attempt to penetrate it resulted in damage to the internal circuitry.\nIn a KG-13, the following colours are confirmed: Pink, Yellow, Green, Blue, Red, Orange and Black. Purple and Brown modules were probably used but those colours are unconfirmed as of this time.  Yellow modules were single transistor emitter follower clock drivers.  Pink modules were two transistor shift register flip flops.  Each yellow module drove nine pink ones.  A two transistor multivibrator module drove the audio alarm thru an amplifier.  Two transistor monostables were also used.  NAND and NOR modules were built from a single transistor and XOR modules were built from two transistors.  Failures usually occurred in the power supplies, buffers, and synchronizers though most problems were quickly resolved. When new, there was a high frequency of failures due to cold solder joints.\nOne board in the KG-13 had a black module which was a noise generator containing a Zener diode noise source. This was the only classified module because the noise was used to randomize the key stream on startup. The circuitry inside the module then used the koken chain shift registers to create an pseudo random key stream.  That was why there was no problem in restarting the KG-13 with the same card. The noise source ensured that the chances of duplicating the start point was negligible.\nTwo of the key cards were for the transmitter and the third for the receiver.  There were two for the transmitter because it had two key generators.  The keystream mixed with the plain text produced the ciphertext.  Two key generators generating the same keystream should match bit for bit at the output and a mismatch would cause a crypto alarm and a shutdown of the output.  A key generator failure would stop transmission and prevent a compromise.  With only a single key generator in the transmitter a failure could produce a trivial keystream (all one's, all zero's or alternations).  A receiver key generator failure just produced garble. The KG-3 could be used to transmit or receive since there is a XMIT/RECV switch on in the lower right hand portion of the lowest unit.\nIn the 1964/65 time frame, crypto techs were taught that it would take 50,000 years to break the key on a KG-13 using state of the art techniques which were available at the time. The KG-13 also employed traffic flow security. \nSteve Gardner recalls \"One of our operations sites which monitored satellites used an item called a \"shark\" between the teletype and the KG-13.

According to computer security Alan Woodward the attack was most likely carried out through a supply chain attack on a third party payment utility used by the website. This script sent the submitted payment information to the attackers directly. The breach of CVV codes in the attacks support this theory, as by PCI DSS standards CVV codes are not stored, and are only processed during the time payments are made which makes access to a database unlikely.\nBritish Airways said the attack affected bookings from 21 August 2018 and 5 September 2018 with credit card details of around 380,000 total customers being compromised. The attackers obtained names, street addresses, email addresses, credit card numbers, expiration dates and Card security codes - enough to allow thieves to steal from accounts. 77,000 customers had their name, address, email address and detailed payment information taken, while 108,000 people had personal details compromised which did not include CVV numbers.One customer of the airline reported that his card had been used to buy items by phone at Harrods while he was in Malaysia. The attempt was rejected - the customer did not think his card was exposed except by this attack.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nBritish Airways urged customers to contact their banks or credit card issuer and to follow their advice.  NatWest said that it received more calls than usual because of the breach. American Express said that customers would not need to take any action and that they would alert customers with unusual activity on their cards.\n\n== Consequences for British Airways ==\nBritish Airways was issued with a \u00a3183 million fine by the Information Commissioner's Office, which was the biggest fine issued by the office up to that date.

    "instruction": "IEEE 802.11i-2004\n\n==Introduction==\nIEEE 802.11i-2004, or 802.11i for short, is an amendment to the original IEEE 802.11, implemented as Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2). The draft standard was ratified on 24 June 2004.  This standard specifies security mechanisms for wireless networks, replacing the short Authentication and privacy clause of the original standard with a detailed Security clause.  In the process, the amendment deprecated broken Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), while it was later incorporated into the published IEEE 802.11-2007 standard.\n\n== Replacement of WEP ==\n802.11i supersedes the previous security specification, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), which was shown to have security vulnerabilities. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) had previously been introduced by the Wi-Fi Alliance as an intermediate solution to WEP insecurities. WPA implemented a subset of a draft of 802.11i. The Wi-Fi Alliance refers to their approved, interoperable implementation of the full 802.11i as WPA2, also called RSN (Robust Security). 802.11i makes use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) block cipher, whereas WEP and WPA use the RC4 stream cipher.\n\n== Protocol operation ==\nIEEE 802.11i enhances IEEE 802.11-1999 by providing a Robust Security Network (RSN) with two new protocols: the four-way handshake and the group key handshake.  These utilize the authentication services and port access control described in IEEE 802.1X to establish and change the appropriate cryptographic keys. The RSN is a security network that only allows the creation of robust security network associations (RSNAs), which are a type of association used by a pair of stations (STAs) if the procedure to establish authentication or association between them includes the 4-Way Handshake.The standard also provides two RSNA data confidentiality and integrity protocols, TKIP and CCMP, with implementation of CCMP being mandatory since the confidentiality and integrity mechanisms of TKIP are not as robust as those of CCMP. The main purpose to implement TKIP was that the algorithm should be implementable within the capabilities of most of the old devices supporting only WEP.\nThe initial authentication process is carried out either using a pre-shared key (PSK), or following an EAP exchange through 802.1X (known as EAPOL, which requires the presence of an authentication server). This process ensures that the client station (STA) is authenticated with the access point (AP).  After the PSK or 802.1X authentication, a shared secret key is generated, called the Pairwise Master Key (PMK). In PSK authentication, the PMK is actually the PSK, which is typically derived from the WiFi password by putting it through a key derivation function that uses SHA-1 as the cryptographic hash function. If an 802.1X EAP exchange was carried out, the PMK is derived from the EAP parameters provided by the authentication server.\n\n\n*** Four-way handshake ***\n\nThe four-way handshake is designed so that the access point (or authenticator) and wireless client (or supplicant) can independently prove to each other that they know the PSK/PMK, without ever disclosing the key. Instead of disclosing the key, the access point (AP) and client encrypt messages to each other\u2014that can only be decrypted by using the PMK that they already share\u2014and if decryption of the messages was successful, this proves knowledge of the PMK. The four-way handshake is critical for protection of the PMK from malicious access points\u2014for example, an attacker's SSID impersonating a real access point\u2014so that the client never has to tell the access point its PMK. \nThe PMK is designed to last the entire session and should be exposed as little as possible; therefore, keys to encrypt the traffic need to be derived. A four-way handshake is used to establish another key called the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK). The PTK is generated by concatenating the following attributes: PMK, AP nonce (ANonce), STA nonce (SNonce), AP MAC address, and STA MAC address. The product is then put through a pseudo-random function. The handshake also yields the GTK (Group Temporal Key), used to decrypt multicast and broadcast traffic. \nThe actual messages exchanged during the handshake are depicted in the figure and explained below (all messages are sent as EAPOL-Key frames):\n\nThe AP sends a nonce-value (ANonce) to the STA together with a Key Replay Counter, which is a number that is used to match each pair of messages sent, and discard replayed messages. The STA now has all the attributes to construct the PTK.\nThe STA sends its own nonce-value (SNonce) to the AP together with a Message Integrity Code (MIC), including authentication, which is really a Message Authentication and Integrity Code (MAIC), and the Key Replay Counter which will be the same as Message 1, to allow AP to match the right Message 1.\nThe AP verifies Message 2, by checking MIC, RSN, ANonce and Key Replay Counter Field, and if valid constructs and sends the GTK with another MIC.\nThe STA verifies Message 3, by checking MIC and Key Replay Counter Field, and if valid sends a confirmation to the AP.\n\n\n*** Group key handshake ***\nThe Group Temporal Key (GTK) used in the network may need to be updated due to the expiration of a preset timer.  When a device leaves the network, the GTK also needs to be updated.  This is to prevent the device from receiving any more multicast or broadcast messages from the AP.\nTo handle the updating, 802.11i defines a Group Key Handshake that consists of a two-way handshake:\n\nThe AP sends the new GTK to each STA in the network.  The GTK is encrypted using the KEK assigned to that STA, and protects the data from tampering, by use of a MIC.\nThe STA acknowledges the new GTK and replies to the AP.\n\n== CCMP overview ==\nCCMP is based on the Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) mode of the AES encryption algorithm.

      "context": "IEEE 802.11i-2004\n\n==Introduction==\nIEEE 802.11i-2004, or 802.11i for short, is an amendment to the original IEEE 802.11, implemented as Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2). The draft standard was ratified on 24 June 2004.  This standard specifies security mechanisms for wireless networks, replacing the short Authentication and privacy clause of the original standard with a detailed Security clause.  In the process, the amendment deprecated broken Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), while it was later incorporated into the published IEEE 802.11-2007 standard.\n\n== Replacement of WEP ==\n802.11i supersedes the previous security specification, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), which was shown to have security vulnerabilities. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) had previously been introduced by the Wi-Fi Alliance as an intermediate solution to WEP insecurities. WPA implemented a subset of a draft of 802.11i. The Wi-Fi Alliance refers to their approved, interoperable implementation of the full 802.11i as WPA2, also called RSN (Robust Security). 802.11i makes use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) block cipher, whereas WEP and WPA use the RC4 stream cipher.\n\n== Protocol operation ==\nIEEE 802.11i enhances IEEE 802.11-1999 by providing a Robust Security Network (RSN) with two new protocols: the four-way handshake and the group key handshake.  These utilize the authentication services and port access control described in IEEE 802.1X to establish and change the appropriate cryptographic keys. The RSN is a security network that only allows the creation of robust security network associations (RSNAs), which are a type of association used by a pair of stations (STAs) if the procedure to establish authentication or association between them includes the 4-Way Handshake.The standard also provides two RSNA data confidentiality and integrity protocols, TKIP and CCMP, with implementation of CCMP being mandatory since the confidentiality and integrity mechanisms of TKIP are not as robust as those of CCMP. The main purpose to implement TKIP was that the algorithm should be implementable within the capabilities of most of the old devices supporting only WEP.\nThe initial authentication process is carried out either using a pre-shared key (PSK), or following an EAP exchange through 802.1X (known as EAPOL, which requires the presence of an authentication server). This process ensures that the client station (STA) is authenticated with the access point (AP).  After the PSK or 802.1X authentication, a shared secret key is generated, called the Pairwise Master Key (PMK). In PSK authentication, the PMK is actually the PSK, which is typically derived from the WiFi password by putting it through a key derivation function that uses SHA-1 as the cryptographic hash function. If an 802.1X EAP exchange was carried out, the PMK is derived from the EAP parameters provided by the authentication server.\n\n\n*** Four-way handshake ***\n\nThe four-way handshake is designed so that the access point (or authenticator) and wireless client (or supplicant) can independently prove to each other that they know the PSK/PMK, without ever disclosing the key.

    "instruction": "Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange\n\n==Introduction==\nDiffie\u2013Hellman key exchange is a mathematical method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel and was one of the first public-key protocols as conceived by Ralph Merkle and named after Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. DH is one of the earliest practical examples of public key exchange implemented within the field of cryptography. Published in 1976 by Diffie and Hellman, this is the earliest publicly known work that proposed the idea of a private key and a corresponding public key.\nTraditionally, secure encrypted communication between two parties required that they first exchange keys by some secure physical means, such as paper key lists transported by a trusted courier. The Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel. This key can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric-key cipher.\nDiffie\u2013Hellman is used to secure a variety of Internet services. However, research published in October 2015 suggests that the parameters in use for many DH Internet applications at that time are not strong enough to prevent compromise by very well-funded attackers, such as the security services of some countries.The scheme was published by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976, but in 1997 it was revealed that James H. Ellis, Clifford Cocks, and Malcolm J. Williamson of GCHQ, the British signals intelligence agency, had previously shown in 1969 how public-key cryptography could be achieved.Although Diffie\u2013Hellman key agreement itself is a non-authenticated key-agreement protocol, it provides the basis for a variety of authenticated protocols, and is used to provide forward secrecy in Transport Layer Security's ephemeral modes (referred to as EDH or DHE depending on the cipher suite).\nThe method was followed shortly afterwards by RSA, an implementation of public-key cryptography using asymmetric algorithms.\nExpired US patent 4,200,770 from 1977 describes the now public-domain algorithm. It credits Hellman, Diffie, and Merkle as inventors.\n\n\n\n== Name ==\nIn 2002, Hellman suggested the algorithm be called Diffie\u2013Hellman\u2013Merkle key exchange in recognition of Ralph Merkle's contribution to the invention of public-key cryptography (Hellman, 2002), writing:\n\nThe system...has since become known as Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange. While that system was first described in a paper by Diffie and me, it is a public key distribution system, a concept developed by Merkle, and hence should be called 'Diffie\u2013Hellman\u2013Merkle key exchange' if names are to be associated with it. I hope this small pulpit might help in that endeavor to recognize Merkle's equal contribution to the invention of public key cryptography.\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n*** General overview ***\n\nDiffie\u2013Hellman key exchange establishes a shared secret between two parties that can be used for secret communication for exchanging data over a public network. An analogy illustrates the concept of public key exchange by using colors instead of very large numbers:\nThe process begins by having the two parties, Alice and Bob, publicly agree on an arbitrary starting color that does not need to be kept secret. In this example, the color is yellow. Each person also selects a secret color that they keep to themselves \u2013 in this case, red and cyan. The crucial part of the process is that Alice and Bob each mix their own secret color together with their mutually shared color, resulting in orange-tan and light-blue mixtures respectively, and then publicly exchange the two mixed colors. Finally, each of them mixes the color they received from the partner with their own private color. The result is a final color mixture (yellow-brown in this case) that is identical to their partner's final color mixture.\nIf a third party listened to the exchange, they would only know the common color (yellow) and the first mixed colors (orange-tan and light-blue), but it would be very hard for them to find out the final secret color (yellow-brown). Bringing the analogy back to a real-life exchange using large numbers rather than colors, this determination is computationally expensive. It is impossible to compute in a practical amount of time even for modern supercomputers.\n\n\n*** Cryptographic explanation ***\nThe simplest and the original implementation of the protocol uses the multiplicative group of integers modulo p, where p is prime, and g is a primitive root modulo p. These two values are chosen in this way to ensure that the resulting shared secret can take on any value from 1 to p\u20131. Here is an example of the protocol, with non-secret values in blue, and secret values in red.\n\nAlice and Bob publicly agree to use a modulus p\n\n== Ephemeral and/or static keys ==\nThe used keys can either be ephemeral or static (long term) key, but could even be mixed, so called semi-static DH. These variants have different properties and hence different use cases. An overview over many variants and some also discussions can for example be found in NIST SP 800-56A. A basic list:\n\nephemeral, ephemeral: Usually used for key agreement. Provides forward secrecy, but no authenticity.\nstatic, static: Would generate a long term shared secret. Does not provide forward secrecy, but implicit authenticity. Since the keys are static it would for example not protect against replay-attacks.\nephemeral, static: For example, used in ElGamal encryption or Integrated Encryption Scheme (IES). If used in key agreement it could provide implicit one-sided authenticity (the ephemeral side could verify the authenticity of the static side). No forward secrecy is provided.It is possible to use ephemeral and static keys in one key agreement to provide more security as for example shown in NIST SP 800-56A, but it is also possible to combine those in a single DH key exchange, which is then called triple DH (3-DH).\n\n\n*** Triple Diffie-Hellman (3-DH) ***\nIn 1997 a kind of triple DH was proposed by Simon Blake-Wilson, Don Johnson, Alfred Menezes in \"Key Agreement Protocols and their Security Analysis (1997)\", which was improved by C. Kudla and K. G. Paterson in \u201cModular Security Proofs for Key Agreement Protocols (2005)\u201d and shown to be secure. It's also used or mentioned in other variants. For example:\n\nExtended Triple Diffie-Hellman\nsci.crypt news group (from 18.08.2002)\nDouble Ratchet Algorithm\nSignal ProtocolThe long term secret keys of Alice and Bob are denoted by a and b respectively, with public keys A and B, as well as the ephemeral key pairs x, X and y, Y. Then protocol is:\n\nThe long term public keys need to be transferred somehow. That can be done beforehand in a separate, trusted channel, or the public keys can be encrypted using some partial key agreement to preserve anonymity. For more of such details as well as other improvements like side channel protection or explicit key confirmation, as well as early messages and additional password authentication, one could e.g. have a look at \"Advanced modular handshake for key agreement and optional authentication\"\n\n== Operation with more than two parties ==\nDiffie\u2013Hellman key agreement is not limited to negotiating a key shared by only two participants. Any number of users can take part in an agreement by performing iterations of the agreement protocol and exchanging intermediate data (which does not itself need to be kept secret). For example, Alice, Bob, and Carol could participate in a Diffie\u2013Hellman agreement as follows, with all operations taken to be modulo p:\n\nThe parties agree on the algorithm parameters p and g.\nThe parties generate their private keys, named a, b, and c.\nAlice computes ga mod p and sends it to Bob.\nBob computes (ga)b mod p\n\n== Security ==\nThe protocol is considered secure against eavesdroppers if G and g are chosen properly. In particular, the order of the group G must be large, particularly if the same group is used for large amounts of traffic. The eavesdropper has to solve the Diffie\u2013Hellman problem to obtain gab. This is currently considered difficult for groups whose order is large enough. An efficient algorithm to solve the discrete logarithm problem would make it easy to compute a or b and solve the Diffie\u2013Hellman problem, making this and many other public key cryptosystems insecure. Fields of small characteristic may be less secure.The order of G should have a large prime factor to prevent use of the Pohlig\u2013Hellman algorithm to obtain a or b. For this reason, a Sophie Germain prime q is sometimes used to calculate p\n\n== Other uses ==\n\n\n*** Encryption ***\nPublic key encryption schemes based on the Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange have been proposed. The first such scheme is the ElGamal encryption. A more modern variant is the Integrated Encryption Scheme.\n\n\n*** Forward secrecy ***\nProtocols that achieve forward secrecy generate new key pairs for each session and discard them at the end of the session. The Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange is a frequent choice for such protocols, because of its fast key generation.\n\n\n*** Password-authenticated key agreement ***\nWhen Alice and Bob share a password, they may use a password-authenticated key agreement (PK) form of Diffie\u2013Hellman to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. One simple scheme is to compare the hash of s concatenated with the password calculated independently on both ends of channel. A feature of these schemes is that an attacker can only test one specific password on each iteration with the other party, and so the system provides good security with relatively weak passwords. This approach is described in ITU-T Recommendation X.1035, which is used by the G.hn home networking standard.\nAn example of such a protocol is the Secure Remote Password protocol.\n\n\n*** Public key ***\nIt is also possible to use Diffie\u2013Hellman as part of a public key infrastructure, allowing Bob to encrypt a message so that only Alice will be able to decrypt it, with no prior communication between them other than Bob having trusted knowledge of Alice's public key. Alice's public key is \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          g\n          \n            a\n          \n        \n        \n          mod\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n        ,\n        g\n        ,\n        p\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (g^{a}{\\bmod {p}},g,p)}\n  .

Only Alice can determine the symmetric key and hence decrypt the message because only she has a (the private key). A pre-shared public key also prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.\nIn practice, Diffie\u2013Hellman is not used in this way, with RSA being the dominant public key algorithm. This is largely for historical and commercial reasons, namely that RSA Security created a certificate authority for key signing that became Verisign. Diffie\u2013Hellman, as elaborated above, cannot directly be used to sign certificates. However, the ElGamal and DSA signature algorithms are mathematically related to it, as well as MQV, STS and the IKE component of the IPsec protocol suite for securing Internet Protocol communications.\nQuestion: What is the Triple Diffie-Hellman (3-DH) and how does it improve the security of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange?",

      "context": "Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange\n\n==Introduction==\nDiffie\u2013Hellman key exchange is a mathematical method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel and was one of the first public-key protocols as conceived by Ralph Merkle and named after Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. DH is one of the earliest practical examples of public key exchange implemented within the field of cryptography. Published in 1976 by Diffie and Hellman, this is the earliest publicly known work that proposed the idea of a private key and a corresponding public key.\nTraditionally, secure encrypted communication between two parties required that they first exchange keys by some secure physical means, such as paper key lists transported by a trusted courier. The Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel. This key can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric-key cipher.\nDiffie\u2013Hellman is used to secure a variety of Internet services. However, research published in October 2015 suggests that the parameters in use for many DH Internet applications at that time are not strong enough to prevent compromise by very well-funded attackers, such as the security services of some countries.The scheme was published by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976, but in 1997 it was revealed that James H. Ellis, Clifford Cocks, and Malcolm J. Williamson of GCHQ, the British signals intelligence agency, had previously shown in 1969 how public-key cryptography could be achieved.Although Diffie\u2013Hellman key agreement itself is a non-authenticated key-agreement protocol, it provides the basis for a variety of authenticated protocols, and is used to provide forward secrecy in Transport Layer Security's ephemeral modes (referred to as EDH or DHE depending on the cipher suite).\nThe method was followed shortly afterwards by RSA, an implementation of public-key cryptography using asymmetric algorithms.\nExpired US patent 4,200,770 from 1977 describes the now public-domain algorithm. It credits Hellman, Diffie, and Merkle as inventors.\n\n\n\n== Name ==\nIn 2002, Hellman suggested the algorithm be called Diffie\u2013Hellman\u2013Merkle key exchange in recognition of Ralph Merkle's contribution to the invention of public-key cryptography (Hellman, 2002), writing:\n\nThe system...has since become known as Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange. While that system was first described in a paper by Diffie and me, it is a public key distribution system, a concept developed by Merkle, and hence should be called 'Diffie\u2013Hellman\u2013Merkle key exchange' if names are to be associated with it. I hope this small pulpit might help in that endeavor to recognize Merkle's equal contribution to the invention of public key cryptography.\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n*** General overview ***\n\nDiffie\u2013Hellman key exchange establishes a shared secret between two parties that can be used for secret communication for exchanging data over a public network. An analogy illustrates the concept of public key exchange by using colors instead of very large numbers:\nThe process begins by having the two parties, Alice and Bob, publicly agree on an arbitrary starting color that does not need to be kept secret. In this example, the color is yellow. Each person also selects a secret color that they keep to themselves \u2013 in this case, red and cyan. The crucial part of the process is that Alice and Bob each mix their own secret color together with their mutually shared color, resulting in orange-tan and light-blue mixtures respectively, and then publicly exchange the two mixed colors. Finally, each of them mixes the color they received from the partner with their own private color. The result is a final color mixture (yellow-brown in this case) that is identical to their partner's final color mixture.\nIf a third party listened to the exchange, they would only know the common color (yellow) and the first mixed colors (orange-tan and light-blue), but it would be very hard for them to find out the final secret color (yellow-brown). Bringing the analogy back to a real-life exchange using large numbers rather than colors, this determination is computationally expensive. It is impossible to compute in a practical amount of time even for modern supercomputers.\n\n\n*** Cryptographic explanation ***\nThe simplest and the original implementation of the protocol uses the multiplicative group of integers modulo p, where p is prime, and g is a primitive root modulo p. These two values are chosen in this way to ensure that the resulting shared secret can take on any value from 1 to p\u20131. Here is an example of the protocol, with non-secret values in blue, and secret values in red.\n\nAlice and Bob publicly agree to use a modulus p\n\n== Ephemeral and/or static keys ==\nThe used keys can either be ephemeral or static (long term) key, but could even be mixed, so called semi-static DH. These variants have different properties and hence different use cases. An overview over many variants and some also discussions can for example be found in NIST SP 800-56A. A basic list:\n\nephemeral, ephemeral: Usually used for key agreement. Provides forward secrecy, but no authenticity.\nstatic, static: Would generate a long term shared secret. Does not provide forward secrecy, but implicit authenticity. Since the keys are static it would for example not protect against replay-attacks.\nephemeral, static: For example, used in ElGamal encryption or Integrated Encryption Scheme (IES). If used in key agreement it could provide implicit one-sided authenticity (the ephemeral side could verify the authenticity of the static side). No forward secrecy is provided.It is possible to use ephemeral and static keys in one key agreement to provide more security as for example shown in NIST SP 800-56A, but it is also possible to combine those in a single DH key exchange, which is then called triple DH (3-DH).\n\n\n*** Triple Diffie-Hellman (3-DH) ***\nIn 1997 a kind of triple DH was proposed by Simon Blake-Wilson, Don Johnson, Alfred Menezes in \"Key Agreement Protocols and their Security Analysis (1997)\", which was improved by C. Kudla and K. G. Paterson in \u201cModular Security Proofs for Key Agreement Protocols (2005)\u201d and shown to be secure. It's also used or mentioned in other variants. For example:\n\nExtended Triple Diffie-Hellman\nsci.crypt news group (from 18.08.2002)\nDouble Ratchet Algorithm\nSignal ProtocolThe long term secret keys of Alice and Bob are denoted by a and b respectively, with public keys A and B, as well as the ephemeral key pairs x, X and y, Y. Then protocol is:\n\nThe long term public keys need to be transferred somehow. That can be done beforehand in a separate, trusted channel, or the public keys can be encrypted using some partial key agreement to preserve anonymity. For more of such details as well as other improvements like side channel protection or explicit key confirmation, as well as early messages and additional password authentication, one could e.g. have a look at \"Advanced modular handshake for key agreement and optional authentication\"\n\n== Operation with more than two parties ==\nDiffie\u2013Hellman key agreement is not limited to negotiating a key shared by only two participants.

    "instruction": "Hacker culture\n\n==Introduction==\nThe hacker culture is a subculture of individuals who enjoy\u2014often in collective effort\u2014the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming the limitations of software systems or electronic hardware (mostly digital electronics), to achieve novel and clever outcomes. The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed hacking. However, the defining characteristic of a hacker is not the activities performed themselves (e.g. programming), but how it is done and whether it is exciting and meaningful. Activities of playful cleverness can be said to have \"hack value\" and therefore the term \"hacks\" came about, with early examples including pranks at MIT done by students to demonstrate their technical aptitude and cleverness. The hacker culture originally emerged in academia in the 1960s around the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) and MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Hacking originally involved entering restricted areas in a clever way without causing any major damage. Some famous hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were placing of a campus police cruiser on the roof of the Great Dome and converting the Great Dome into R2-D2.Richard Stallman explains about hackers who program:\n\nWhat they had in common was mainly love of excellence and programming. They wanted to make their programs that they used be as good as they could. They also wanted to make them do neat things. They wanted to be able to do something in a more exciting way than anyone believed possible and show \"Look how wonderful this is. I bet you didn't believe this could be done.\"\nHackers from this subculture tend to emphatically differentiate themselves from what they pejoratively call \"crackers\"; those who are generally referred to by media and members of the general public using the term \"hacker\", and whose primary focus\u200d\u2014\u200cbe it to malign or for malevolent purposes\u200d\u2014\u200clies in exploiting weaknesses in computer security.\n\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThe Jargon File, an influential but not universally accepted compendium of hacker slang, defines hacker as \"A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and stretching their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.\" The Request for Comments (RFC) 1392, the Internet Users' Glossary, amplifies this meaning as \"A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.\"As documented in the Jargon File, these hackers are disappointed by the mass media and general public's usage of the word hacker to refer to security breakers, calling them \"crackers\" instead. This includes both \"good\" crackers (\"white hat hackers\"), who use their computer security-related skills and knowledge to learn more about how systems and networks work and to help to discover and fix security holes, as well as those more \"evil\" crackers (\"black hat hackers\"), who use the same skills to author harmful software (such as viruses or trojans) and illegally infiltrate secure systems with the intention of doing harm to the system. The programmer subculture of hackers, in contrast to the cracker community, generally sees computer security-related activities as contrary to the ideals of the original and true meaning of the hacker term, that instead related to playful cleverness.\n\n== Ethics and principles ==\n\nMany of the values and tenets of the free and open source software movement stem from the hacker ethics that originated at MIT and at the Homebrew Computer Club. The hacker ethics were chronicled by Steven Levy in Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution and in other texts in which Levy formulates and summarizes general hacker attitudes:\n\nAccess to computers-and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works-should be unlimited and total.\nAll information should be free.\nHackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.\nYou can create art and beauty on a computer.\nComputers can change your life for the better.Hacker ethics are concerned primarily with sharing, openness, collaboration, and engaging in the hands-on imperative.Linus Torvalds, one of the leaders of the open source movement (known primarily for developing the Linux kernel), has noted in the book The Hacker Ethic that these principles have evolved from the known Protestant ethics and incorporates the spirits of capitalism, as introduced in the early 20th century by Max Weber.\nHack value is the notion used by hackers to express that something is worth doing or is interesting. This is something that hackers often feel intuitively about a problem or solution.\nAn aspect of hack value is performing feats for the sake of showing that they can be done, even if others think it is difficult. Using things in a unique way outside their intended purpose is often perceived as having hack value. Examples are using a dot matrix impact printer to produce musical notes, using a flatbed scanner to take ultra-high-resolution photographs or using an optical mouse as barcode reader.\nA solution or feat has \"hack value\" if it is done in a way that has finesse, cleverness or brilliance, which makes creativity an essential part of the meaning. For example, picking a difficult lock has hack value; smashing it does not. As another example, proving Fermat's Last Theorem by linking together most of modern mathematics has hack value; solving a combinatorial problem by exhaustively trying all possibilities does not. Hacking is not using process of elimination to find a solution; it's the process of finding a clever solution to a problem.\n\n== Uses ==\nWhile using hacker to refer to someone who enjoys playful cleverness is most often applied to computer programmers, it is sometimes used for people who apply the same attitude to other fields. For example, Richard Stallman describes the silent composition 4\u203233\u2033 by John Cage and the 14th-century palindromic three-part piece \"Ma Fin Est Mon Commencement\" by Guillaume de Machaut as hacks. According to the Jargon File, the word hacker was used in a similar sense among radio amateurs in the 1950s, predating the software hacking community.\n\n\n*** Programming ***\nThe Boston Globe in 1984 defined \"hackers\" as \"computer nuts\". In their programmer subculture, a hacker is a person who follows a spirit of playful cleverness and loves programming. It is found in an originally academic movement unrelated to computer security and most visibly associated with free software, open source and demoscene. It also has a hacker ethic, based on the idea that writing software and sharing the result on a voluntary basis is a good idea, and that information should be free, but that it's not up to the hacker to make it free by breaking into private computer systems. This hacker ethic was publicized and perhaps originated in Steven Levy's Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution (1984). It contains a codification of its principles.\nThe programmer subculture of hackers disassociates from the mass media's pejorative use of the word 'hacker' referring to computer security, and usually prefer the term 'cracker' for that meaning. Complaints about supposed mainstream misuse started as early as 1983, when media used \"hacker\" to refer to the computer criminals involved in The 414s case.In the programmer subculture of hackers, a computer hacker is a person who enjoys designing software and building programs with a sense for aesthetics and playful cleverness. The term hack in this sense can be traced back to \"describe the elaborate college pranks that...students would regularly devise\" (Levy, 1984 p. 10). To be considered a 'hack' was an honor among like-minded peers as \"to qualify as a hack, the feat must be imbued with innovation, style and technical virtuosity\" (Levy, 1984 p. 10) The MIT Tech Model Railroad Club Dictionary defined hack in 1959 (not yet in a computer context) as \"1) an article or project without constructive end; 2) a project undertaken on bad self-advice; 3) an entropy booster; 4) to produce, or attempt to produce, a hack(3)\", and \"hacker\" was defined as \"one who hacks, or makes them\". Much of TMRC's jargon was later imported into early computing culture, because the club started using a DEC PDP-1 and applied its local model railroad slang in this computing context. Initially incomprehensible to outsiders, the slang also became popular in MIT's computing environments beyond the club. Other examples of jargon imported from the club are 'losing' (\"when a piece of equipment is not working\") and 'munged' (\"when a piece of equipment is ruined\").Others did not always view hackers with approval. MIT living groups in 1989 avoided advertising their sophisticated Project Athena workstations to prospective members because they wanted residents who were interested in people, not computers, with one fraternity member stating that \"We were worried about the hacker subculture\".According to Eric S. Raymond, the Open Source and Free Software hacker subculture developed in the 1960s among 'academic hackers' working on early minicomputers in computer science environments in the United States.\nHackers were influenced by and absorbed many ideas of key technological developments and the people associated with them. Most notable is the technical culture of the pioneers of the ARPANET, starting in 1969. The PDP-10 AI machine at MIT, running the ITS operating system and connected to the ARPANET, provided an early hacker meeting point. After 1980 the subculture coalesced with the culture of Unix. Since the mid-1990s, it has been largely coincident with what is now called the free software and open source movement.\nMany programmers have been labeled \"great hackers\", but the specifics of who that label applies to is a matter of opinion. Certainly major contributors to computer science such as Edsger Dijkstra and Donald Knuth, as well as the inventors of popular software such as Linus Torvalds (Linux), and Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie (Unix and C programming language) are likely to be included in any such list; see also List of programmers. People primarily known for their contributions to the consciousness of the programmer subculture of hackers include Richard Stallman, the founder of the free software movement and the GNU project, president of the Free Software Foundation and author of the famous Emacs text editor as well as the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), and Eric S. Raymond, one of the founders of the Open Source Initiative and writer of the famous text The Cathedral and the Bazaar and many other essays, maintainer of the Jargon File (which was previously maintained by Guy L. Steele, Jr.).\nWithin the computer programmer subculture of hackers, the term hacker is also used for a programmer who reaches a goal by employing a series of modifications to extend existing code or resources. In this sense, it can have a negative connotation of using inelegant kludges to accomplish programming tasks that are quick, but ugly, inelegant, difficult to extend, hard to maintain and inefficient. This derogatory form of the noun \"hack\" derives from the everyday English sense \"to cut or shape by or as if by crude or ruthless strokes\" [Merriam-Webster] and is even used among users of the positive sense of \"hacker\" who produces \"cool\" or \"neat\" hacks. In other words, to \"hack\" at an original creation, as if with an axe, is to force-fit it into being usable for a task not intended by the original creator, and a \"hacker\" would be someone who does this habitually. (The original creator and the hacker may be the same person.) This usage is common in both programming, engineering and building. In programming, hacking in this sense appears to be tolerated and seen as a necessary compromise in many situations. Some argue that it should not be, due to this negative meaning; others argue that some kludges can, for all their ugliness and imperfection, still have \"hack value\".\nIn non-software engineering, the culture is less tolerant of unmaintainable solutions, even when intended to be temporary, and describing someone as a \"hacker\" might imply that they lack professionalism. In this sense, the term has no real positive connotations, except for the idea that the hacker is capable of doing modifications that allow a system to work in the short term, and so has some sort of marketable skills. However, there is always the understanding that a more skillful or technical logician could have produced successful modifications that would not be considered a \"hack-job\". The definition is similar to other, non-computer based uses of the term \"hack-job\". For instance, a professional modification of a production sports car into a racing machine would not be considered a hack-job, but a cobbled together backyard mechanic's result could be. Even though the outcome of a race of the two machines could not be assumed, a quick inspection would instantly reveal the difference in the level of professionalism of the designers. The adjective associated with hacker is \"hackish\" (see the Jargon file).\nIn a very universal sense, hacker also means someone who makes things work beyond perceived limits in a clever way in general, without necessarily referring to computers, especially at MIT. That is, people who apply the creative attitude of software hackers in fields other than computing. This includes even activities that predate computer hacking, for example reality hackers or urban spelunkers (exploring undocumented or unauthorized areas in buildings). One specific example is clever pranks traditionally perpetrated by MIT students, with the perpetrator being called hacker. For example, when MIT students surreptitiously put a fake police car atop the dome on MIT's Building 10, that was a hack in this sense, and the students involved were therefore hackers. Other types of hacking are reality hackers, wetware hackers (\"hack your brain\"), and media hackers (\"hack your reputation\"). In a similar vein, a \"hack\" may refer to a math hack, that is, a clever solution to a mathematical problem. All of these uses have spread beyond MIT.\n\n\n*** Home computing enthusiasts ***\n\nIn yet another context, a hacker is a computer hobbyist who pushes the limits of software or hardware. The home computer hacking subculture relates to the hobbyist home computing of the late 1970s, beginning with the availability of MITS Altair. An influential organization was the Homebrew Computer Club. However, its roots go back further to amateur radio enthusiasts. The amateur radio slang referred to creatively tinkering to improve performance as \"hacking\" already in the 1950s.A large overlaps between hobbyist hackers and the programmer subculture hackers existed during the Homebrew Club's days, but the interests and values of both communities somewhat diverged. Today, the hobbyists focus on commercial computer and video games, software cracking and exceptional computer programming (demo scene). Also of interest to some members of this group is the modification of computer hardware and other electronic devices, see modding.\n\nElectronics hobbyists working on machines other than computers also fall into this category. This includes people who do simple modifications to graphing calculators, video game consoles, electronic musical keyboards or other device (see CueCat for a notorious example) to expose or add functionality to a device that was unintended for use by end users by the company who created it. A number of techno musicians have modified 1980s-era Casio SK-1 sampling keyboards to create unusual sounds by doing circuit bending: connecting wires to different leads of the integrated circuit chips. The results of these DIY experiments range from opening up previously inaccessible features that were part of the chip design to producing the strange, dis-harmonic digital tones that became part of the techno music style.\nCompanies take different attitudes towards such practices, ranging from open acceptance (such as Texas Instruments for its graphing calculators and Lego for its Lego Mindstorms robotics gear) to outright hostility (such as Microsoft's attempts to lock out Xbox hackers or the DRM routines on Blu-ray Disc players designed to sabotage compromised players.)\nIn this context, a \"hack\" refers to a program that (sometimes illegally) modifies another program, often a video game, giving the user access to features otherwise inaccessible to them. As an example of this use, for Palm OS users (until the 4th iteration of this operating system), a \"hack\" refers to an extension of the operating system which provides additional functionality. Term also refers to those people who cheat on video games using special software. This can also refer to the jailbreaking of iPhones.\n\n\n*** Hacker artists ***\n\nHacker artists create art by hacking on technology as an artistic medium. This has extended the definition of the term and what it means to be a hacker. Such artists may work with graphics, computer hardware, sculpture, music and other audio, animation, video, software, simulations, mathematics, reactive sensory systems, text, poetry, literature, or any combination thereof.\nDartmouth College musician Larry Polansky states:\n\nTechnology and art are inextricably related. Many musicians, video artists, graphic artists, and even poets who work with technology\u2014whether designing it or using it\u2014consider themselves to be part of the 'hacker community.' Computer artists, like non-art hackers, often find themselves on society's fringes, developing strange, innovative uses of existing technology. There is an empathetic relationship between those, for example, who design experimental music software and hackers who write communications freeware.\nAnother description is offered by Jenny Marketou: \n\nHacker artists operate as culture hackers who manipulate existing techno-semiotic structures towards a different end, to get inside cultural systems on the net and make them do things they were never intended to do.\nA successful software and hardware hacker artist is Mark Lottor (mkl), who has created the 3-D light art projects entitled the Cubatron, and the Big Round Cubatron. This art is made using custom computer technology, with specially designed circuit boards and programming for microprocessor chips to manipulate the LED lights.\n\nDon Hopkins is a software hacker artist well known for his artistic cellular automata. This art, created by a cellular automata computer program, generates objects which randomly bump into each other and in turn create more objects and designs, similar to a lava lamp, except that the parts change color and form through interaction. Hopkins Says: Cellular automata are simple rules that are applied to a grid of cells, or the pixel values of an image. The same rule is applied to every cell, to determine its next state, based on the previous state of that cell and its neighboring cells. There are many interesting cellular automata rules, and they all look very different, with amazing animated dynamic effects. 'Life' is a widely known cellular automata rule, but many other lesser known rules are much more interesting.\nSome hacker artists create art by writing computer code, and others, by developing hardware. Some create with existing software tools such as Adobe Photoshop or GIMP.\nThe creative process of hacker artists can be more abstract than artists using non-technological media. For example, mathematicians have produced visually stunning graphic presentations of fractals, which hackers have further enhanced, often producing detailed and intricate graphics and animations from simple mathematical formulas.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n**** Art ****\n\n\n**** Hacker art mentions ****\n\"Vector in Open Space\" by Gerfried Stocker 1996.\nSwitch|Journal Jun 14 1998.\nEye Weekly \"Tag \u2013 who's it?\" by Ingrid Hein, July 16, 1998.\nLinux Today Archived 2011-07-09 at the Wayback Machine \"Playing the Open Source Game\" by Shawn Hargreaves, Jul 5, 1999.\nCanterbury Christ Church University Library Resources by Subject \u2013 Art & Design, 2001.\nSuperCollider Workshop / Seminar Joel Ryan describes collaboration with hacker artists of Silicon Valley. 21 March 2002\nAnthony Barker's Weblog on Linux, Technology and the Economy \"Why Geeks Love Linux\", Sept 2003.\nLive Art Research Gesture and Response in Field-Based Performance by Sha Xin Wei & Satinder Gill, 2005.\nHackers, Who Are They \"The Hackers Identity\", October 2014.\nQ: What is the difference between \"hackers\" and \"crackers\" in the context of programming?",

      "context": "Hacker culture\n\n==Introduction==\nThe hacker culture is a subculture of individuals who enjoy\u2014often in collective effort\u2014the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming the limitations of software systems or electronic hardware (mostly digital electronics), to achieve novel and clever outcomes. The act of engaging in activities (such as programming or other media) in a spirit of playfulness and exploration is termed hacking. However, the defining characteristic of a hacker is not the activities performed themselves (e.g. programming), but how it is done and whether it is exciting and meaningful. Activities of playful cleverness can be said to have \"hack value\" and therefore the term \"hacks\" came about, with early examples including pranks at MIT done by students to demonstrate their technical aptitude and cleverness. The hacker culture originally emerged in academia in the 1960s around the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)'s Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) and MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Hacking originally involved entering restricted areas in a clever way without causing any major damage. Some famous hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were placing of a campus police cruiser on the roof of the Great Dome and converting the Great Dome into R2-D2.Richard Stallman explains about hackers who program:\n\nWhat they had in common was mainly love of excellence and programming. They wanted to make their programs that they used be as good as they could. They also wanted to make them do neat things. They wanted to be able to do something in a more exciting way than anyone believed possible and show \"Look how wonderful this is. I bet you didn't believe this could be done.\"\nHackers from this subculture tend to emphatically differentiate themselves from what they pejoratively call \"crackers\"; those who are generally referred to by media and members of the general public using the term \"hacker\", and whose primary focus\u200d\u2014\u200cbe it to malign or for malevolent purposes\u200d\u2014\u200clies in exploiting weaknesses in computer security.\n\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThe Jargon File, an influential but not universally accepted compendium of hacker slang, defines hacker as \"A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and stretching their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.\" The Request for Comments (RFC) 1392, the Internet Users' Glossary, amplifies this meaning as \"A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.\"As documented in the Jargon File, these hackers are disappointed by the mass media and general public's usage of the word hacker to refer to security breakers, calling them \"crackers\" instead. This includes both \"good\" crackers (\"white hat hackers\"), who use their computer security-related skills and knowledge to learn more about how systems and networks work and to help to discover and fix security holes, as well as those more \"evil\" crackers (\"black hat hackers\"), who use the same skills to author harmful software (such as viruses or trojans) and illegally infiltrate secure systems with the intention of doing harm to the system. The programmer subculture of hackers, in contrast to the cracker community, generally sees computer security-related activities as contrary to the ideals of the original and true meaning of the hacker term, that instead related to playful cleverness.\n\n== Ethics and principles ==\n\nMany of the values and tenets of the free and open source software movement stem from the hacker ethics that originated at MIT and at the Homebrew Computer Club. The hacker ethics were chronicled by Steven Levy in Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution and in other texts in which Levy formulates and summarizes general hacker attitudes:\n\nAccess to computers-and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works-should be unlimited and total.\nAll information should be free.\nHackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.\nYou can create art and beauty on a computer.\nComputers can change your life for the better.Hacker ethics are concerned primarily with sharing, openness, collaboration, and engaging in the hands-on imperative.Linus Torvalds, one of the leaders of the open source movement (known primarily for developing the Linux kernel), has noted in the book The Hacker Ethic that these principles have evolved from the known Protestant ethics and incorporates the spirits of capitalism, as introduced in the early 20th century by Max Weber.\nHack value is the notion used by hackers to express that something is worth doing or is interesting. This is something that hackers often feel intuitively about a problem or solution.\nAn aspect of hack value is performing feats for the sake of showing that they can be done, even if others think it is difficult. Using things in a unique way outside their intended purpose is often perceived as having hack value. Examples are using a dot matrix impact printer to produce musical notes, using a flatbed scanner to take ultra-high-resolution photographs or using an optical mouse as barcode reader.\nA solution or feat has \"hack value\" if it is done in a way that has finesse, cleverness or brilliance, which makes creativity an essential part of the meaning. For example, picking a difficult lock has hack value; smashing it does not. As another example, proving Fermat's Last Theorem by linking together most of modern mathematics has hack value; solving a combinatorial problem by exhaustively trying all possibilities does not. Hacking is not using process of elimination to find a solution; it's the process of finding a clever solution to a problem.\n\n== Uses ==\nWhile using hacker to refer to someone who enjoys playful cleverness is most often applied to computer programmers, it is sometimes used for people who apply the same attitude to other fields. For example, Richard Stallman describes the silent composition 4\u203233\u2033 by John Cage and the 14th-century palindromic three-part piece \"Ma Fin Est Mon Commencement\" by Guillaume de Machaut as hacks. According to the Jargon File, the word hacker was used in a similar sense among radio amateurs in the 1950s, predating the software hacking community.\n\n\n*** Programming ***\nThe Boston Globe in 1984 defined \"hackers\" as \"computer nuts\". In their programmer subculture, a hacker is a person who follows a spirit of playful cleverness and loves programming. It is found in an originally academic movement unrelated to computer security and most visibly associated with free software, open source and demoscene. It also has a hacker ethic, based on the idea that writing software and sharing the result on a voluntary basis is a good idea, and that information should be free, but that it's not up to the hacker to make it free by breaking into private computer systems. This hacker ethic was publicized and perhaps originated in Steven Levy's Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution (1984). It contains a codification of its principles.\nThe programmer subculture of hackers disassociates from the mass media's pejorative use of the word 'hacker' referring to computer security, and usually prefer the term 'cracker' for that meaning.

    "instruction": "Dining cryptographers problem\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, the dining cryptographers problem studies how to perform a secure multi-party computation of the boolean-XOR function. David Chaum first proposed this problem in the early 1980s and used it as an illustrative example to show that it was possible to send anonymous messages with unconditional sender and recipient untraceability. Anonymous communication networks based on this problem are often referred to as DC-nets (where DC stands for \"dining cryptographers\").Despite the word dining, the dining cryptographers problem is unrelated to the dining philosophers problem.\n\n== Description ==\n\nThree cryptographers gather around a table for dinner.  The waiter informs them that the meal has been paid for by someone, who could be one of the cryptographers or the National Security Agency (NSA).  The cryptographers respect each other's right to make an anonymous payment, but want to find out whether the NSA paid. So they decide to execute a two-stage protocol.\nIn the first stage, every two cryptographers establish a shared one-bit secret, say by tossing a coin behind a menu so that only two cryptographers see the outcome in turn for each two cryptographers. Suppose, for example, that after the coin tossing, cryptographer A and B share a secret bit \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1}\n  , A and C share \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0}\n  , and B and C share \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1}\n  .\nIn the second stage, each cryptographer publicly announces a bit, which is:\n\nif they didn't pay for the meal, the exclusive OR (XOR) of the two shared bits they hold with their two neighbours,\nif they did pay for the meal, the opposite of that XOR.Supposing none of the cryptographers paid, then A announces \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        \u2295\n        0\n\n== Limitations ==\nThe DC-net protocol is simple and elegant. It has several limitations, however, some solutions to which have been explored in follow-up research (see the References section below).\n\nCollision\nIf two cryptographers paid for the dinner, their messages will cancel each other out, and the final XOR result will be \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0}\n  .  This is called a collision and allows only one participant to transmit at a time using this protocol. In a more general case, a collision happens as long as any even number of participants send messages.Disruption\nAny malicious cryptographer who does not want the group to communicate successfully can jam the protocol so that the final XOR result is useless, simply by sending random bits instead of the correct result of the XOR. This problem occurs because the original protocol was designed without using any public key technology and lacks reliable mechanisms to check whether participants honestly follow the protocol.Complexity\nThe protocol requires pairwise shared secret keys between the participants, which may be problematic if there are many participants. Also, though the DC-net protocol is \"unconditionally secure\", it actually depends on the assumption that \"unconditionally secure\" channels already exist between pairs of the participants, which is not easy to achieve in practice.A related anonymous veto network algorithm computes the logical OR of several users' inputs, rather than a logical XOR as in DC-nets, which may be useful in applications to which a logical OR combining operation is naturally suited.\n\n== Generalizations ==\nDC-nets are readily generalized to allow for transmissions of more than one bit per round, for groups larger than three participants, and for arbitrary \"alphabets\" other than the binary digits 0 and 1, as described below.\n\n\n*** Transmissions of longer messages ***\nTo enable an anonymous sender to transmit more than one bit of information per DC-nets round, the group of cryptographers can simply repeat the protocol as many times as desired to create a desired number of bits worth of transmission bandwidth.  These repetitions need not be performed serially.  In practical DC-net systems, it is typical for pairs of participants to agree up-front on a single shared \"master\" secret, using Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange for example.  Each participant then locally feeds this shared master secret into a pseudorandom number generator, in order to produce as many shared \"coin flips\" as desired to allow an anonymous sender to transmit multiple bits of information.\n\n\n*** Larger group sizes ***\nThe protocol can be generalized to a group of \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   participants, each with a shared secret key in common with each other participant.  In each round of the protocol, if a participant wants to transmit an untraceable message to the group, they invert their publicly announced bit.  The participants can be visualized as a fully connected graph with the vertices representing the participants and the edges representing their shared secret keys.\n\n\n*** Sparse secret sharing graphs ***\nThe protocol may be run with less than fully connected secret sharing graphs, which can improve the performance and scalability of practical DC-net implementations, at the potential risk of reducing anonymity if colluding participants can split the secret sharing graph into separate connected components.  For example, an intuitively appealing but less secure generalization to \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        >\n        3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n>3}\n   participants using a ring topology, where each cryptographer sitting around a table shares a secret only with the cryptographer to their immediate left and right, and not with every other cryptographer.  Such a topology is appealing because each cryptographer needs to coordinate two coin flips per round, rather than \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  .  However, if Adam and Charlie are actually NSA agents sitting immediately to the left and right of Bob, an innocent victim, and if Adam and Charlie secretly collude to reveal their secrets to each other, then they can determine with certainty whether or not Bob was the sender of a 1 bit in a DC-net run, regardless of how many participants there are in total.  This is because the colluding participants Adam and Charlie effectively \"split\" the secret sharing graph into two separate disconnected components, one containing only Bob, the other containing all other honest participants.\nAnother compromise secret sharing DC-net topology, employed in the Dissent system for scalability, may be described as a client/server or user/trustee topology.  In this variant, we assume there are two types of participants playing different roles: a potentially large number n of users who desire anonymity, and a much smaller number \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m}\n   of trustees whose role is to help the users obtain that anonymity.  In this topology, each of the \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   users shares a secret with each of the \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m}\n   trustees\u2014but users share no secrets directly with other users, and trustees share no secrets directly with other trustees\u2014resulting in an \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        \u00d7\n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n\\times m}\n   secret sharing matrix.  If the number of trustees \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m}\n   is small, then each user needs to manage only a few shared secrets, improving efficiency for users in the same way the ring topology does.  However, as long as at least one trustee behaves honestly and does not leak his or her secrets or collude with other participants, then that honest trustee forms a \"hub\" connecting all honest users into a single fully connected component, regardless of which or how many other users and/or trustees might be dishonestly colluding.  Users need not know or guess which trustee is honest; their security depends only on the existence of at least one honest, non-colluding trustee.\n\n\n*** Alternate alphabets and combining operators ***\nThough the simple DC-nets protocol uses binary digits as its transmission alphabet, and uses the XOR operator to combine cipher texts, the basic protocol generalizes to any alphabet and combining operator suitable for one-time pad encryption.  This flexibility arises naturally from the fact that the secrets shared between the many pairs of participants are, in effect, merely one-time pads combined symmetrically within a single DC-net round.\nOne useful alternate choice of DC-nets alphabet and combining operator is to use a finite group suitable for public-key cryptography as the alphabet\u2014such as a Schnorr group or elliptic curve\u2014and to use the associated group operator as the DC-net combining operator.  Such a choice of alphabet and operator makes it possible for clients to use zero-knowledge proof techniques to prove correctness properties about the DC-net ciphertexts that they produce, such as that the participant is not \"jamming\" the transmission channel, without compromising the anonymity offered by the DC-net.  This technique was first suggested by Golle and Juels, further developed by Franck, and later implemented in Verdict, a cryptographically verifiable implementation of the Dissent system.\n\n== Handling or avoiding collisions ==\nThe measure originally suggested by David Chaum to avoid collisions is to retransmit the message once a collision is detected, but the paper does not explain exactly how to arrange the retransmission.\nDissent avoids the possibility of unintentional collisions by using a verifiable shuffle to establish a DC-nets transmission schedule, such that each participant knows exactly which bits in the schedule correspond to his own transmission slot, but does not know who owns other transmission slots.\n\n== Countering disruption attacks ==\nHerbivore divides a large anonymity network into smaller DC-net groups, enabling participants to evade disruption attempts by leaving a disrupted group and joining another group, until the participant finds a group free of disruptors.  This evasion approach introduces the risk that an adversary who owns many nodes could selectively disrupt only groups the adversary has not completely compromised, thereby \"herding\" participants toward groups that may be functional precisely because they are completely compromised.Dissent implements several schemes to counter disruption.  The original protocol used a verifiable cryptographic shuffle to form a DC-net transmission schedule and distribute \"transmission assignments\", allowing the correctness of subsequent DC-nets ciphertexts to be verified with a simple cryptographic hash check.  This technique required a fresh verifiable before every DC-nets round, however, leading to high latencies.  A later, more efficient scheme allows a series of DC-net rounds to proceed without intervening shuffles in the absence of disruption, but in response to a disruption event uses a shuffle to distribute anonymous accusations enabling a disruption victim to expose and prove the identity of the perpetrator.  Finally, more recent versions support fully verifiable DC-nets - at substantial cost in computation efficiency due to the use of public-key cryptography in the DC-net - as well as a hybrid mode that uses efficient XOR-based DC-nets in the normal case and verifiable DC-nets only upon disruption, to distribute accusations more quickly than is feasible using verifiable shuffles.\nQ: How can clients use zero-knowledge proof techniques in the dining cryptographers problem?",

    "instruction": "Deniable encryption\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography and steganography, plausibly deniable encryption describes encryption techniques where the existence of an encrypted file or message is deniable in the sense that an adversary cannot prove that the plaintext data exists.The users may convincingly deny that a given piece of data is encrypted, or that they are able to decrypt a given piece of encrypted data, or that some specific encrypted data exists. Such denials may or may not be genuine. For example, it may be impossible to prove that the data is encrypted without the cooperation of the users. If the data is encrypted, the users genuinely may not be able to decrypt it. Deniable encryption serves to undermine an attacker's confidence either that data is encrypted, or that the person in possession of it can decrypt it and provide the associated plaintext.\n\n== Function ==\nDeniable encryption makes it impossible to prove the existence of the plaintext message without the proper decryption key. This may be done by allowing an encrypted message to be decrypted to different sensible plaintexts, depending on the key used. This allows the sender to have plausible deniability if compelled to give up their encryption key.\nThe notion of \"deniable encryption\" was used by Julian Assange and Ralf Weinmann in the Rubberhose filesystem and explored in detail in a paper by Ran Canetti, Cynthia Dwork, Moni Naor, and Rafail Ostrovsky in 1996.\n\n\n*** Scenario ***\nDeniable encryption allows the sender of an encrypted message to deny sending that message. This requires a trusted third party. A possible scenario works like this:\n\nBob suspects his wife Alice is engaged in adultery. That being the case, Alice wants to communicate with her secret lover Carl. She creates two keys, one intended to be kept secret, the other intended to be sacrificed. She passes the secret key (or both) to Carl.\nAlice constructs an innocuous message M1 for Carl (intended to be revealed to Bob in case of discovery) and an incriminating love letter M2 to Carl. She constructs a cipher-text C out of both messages, M1 and M2, and emails it to Carl.\nCarl uses his key to decrypt M2 (and possibly M1, in order to read the fake message, too).\nBob finds out about the email to Carl, becomes suspicious and forces Alice to decrypt the message.\nAlice uses the sacrificial key and reveals the innocuous message M1 to Bob. Since it is impossible for Bob to know for sure that there might be other messages contained in C, he might assume that there are no other messages (alternatively, Bob may not be familiar with the concept of plausible encryption in the first place, and thus may not be aware it is even possible for C to contain more than one message).Another possible scenario involves Alice sending the same ciphertext (some secret instructions) to Bob and Carl, to whom she has handed different keys. Bob and Carl are to receive different instructions and must not be able to read each other's instructions. Bob will receive the message first and then forward it to Carl.\n\nAlice constructs the ciphertext out of both messages, M1 and M2, and emails it to Bob.\nBob uses his key to decrypt M1 and isn't able to read M2.\nBob forwards the ciphertext to Carl.\nCarl uses his key to decrypt M2 and isn't able to read M1.\n\n== Forms of deniable encryption ==\nNormally, ciphertexts decrypt to a single plaintext that is intended to be kept secret. However, one form of deniable encryption allows its users to decrypt the ciphertext to produce a different (innocuous but plausible) plaintext and plausibly claim that it is what they encrypted. The holder of the ciphertext will not be able to differentiate between the true plaintext, and the bogus-claim plaintext. In general, one ciphertext cannot be decrypted to all possible plaintexts unless the key is as large as the plaintext, so it is not practical in most cases for a ciphertext to reveal no information whatsoever about its plaintext. However, some schemes allow decryption to decoy plaintexts that are close to the original in some metric (such as edit distance).\nModern deniable encryption techniques exploit the fact that without the key, it is infeasible to distinguish between ciphertext from block ciphers and data generated by a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (the cipher's pseudorandom permutation properties).This is used in combination with some decoy data that the user would plausibly want to keep confidential that will be revealed to the attacker, claiming that this is all there is. This is a form of steganography.\nIf the user does not supply the correct key for the truly secret data, decrypting it will result in apparently random data, indistinguishable from not having stored any particular data there.\nOne example of deniable encryption is a cryptographic filesystem that employs a concept of abstract \"layers\", where each layer can be decrypted with a different encryption key. Additionally, special \"chaff layers\" are filled with random data in order to have plausible deniability of the existence of real layers and their encryption keys. The user can store decoy files on one or more layers while denying the existence of others, claiming that the rest of space is taken up by chaff layers. Physically, these types of filesystems are typically stored in a single directory consisting of equal-length files with filenames that are either randomized (in case they belong to chaff layers), or cryptographic hashes of strings identifying the blocks. The timestamps of these files are always randomized. Examples of this approach include Rubberhose filesystem and PhoneBookFS. \nAnother approach used by some conventional disk encryption software suites is creating a second encrypted volume within a container volume. The container volume is first formatted by filling it with encrypted random data, and then initializing a filesystem on it. The user then fills some of the filesystem with legitimate, but plausible-looking decoy files that the user would seem to have an incentive to hide. Next, a new encrypted volume (the hidden volume) is allocated within the free space of the container filesystem which will be used for data the user actually wants to hide.

      "context": "Deniable encryption\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography and steganography, plausibly deniable encryption describes encryption techniques where the existence of an encrypted file or message is deniable in the sense that an adversary cannot prove that the plaintext data exists.The users may convincingly deny that a given piece of data is encrypted, or that they are able to decrypt a given piece of encrypted data, or that some specific encrypted data exists. Such denials may or may not be genuine. For example, it may be impossible to prove that the data is encrypted without the cooperation of the users. If the data is encrypted, the users genuinely may not be able to decrypt it. Deniable encryption serves to undermine an attacker's confidence either that data is encrypted, or that the person in possession of it can decrypt it and provide the associated plaintext.\n\n== Function ==\nDeniable encryption makes it impossible to prove the existence of the plaintext message without the proper decryption key. This may be done by allowing an encrypted message to be decrypted to different sensible plaintexts, depending on the key used. This allows the sender to have plausible deniability if compelled to give up their encryption key.\nThe notion of \"deniable encryption\" was used by Julian Assange and Ralf Weinmann in the Rubberhose filesystem and explored in detail in a paper by Ran Canetti, Cynthia Dwork, Moni Naor, and Rafail Ostrovsky in 1996.\n\n\n*** Scenario ***\nDeniable encryption allows the sender of an encrypted message to deny sending that message. This requires a trusted third party. A possible scenario works like this:\n\nBob suspects his wife Alice is engaged in adultery. That being the case, Alice wants to communicate with her secret lover Carl. She creates two keys, one intended to be kept secret, the other intended to be sacrificed. She passes the secret key (or both) to Carl.\nAlice constructs an innocuous message M1 for Carl (intended to be revealed to Bob in case of discovery) and an incriminating love letter M2 to Carl. She constructs a cipher-text C out of both messages, M1 and M2, and emails it to Carl.\nCarl uses his key to decrypt M2 (and possibly M1, in order to read the fake message, too).\nBob finds out about the email to Carl, becomes suspicious and forces Alice to decrypt the message.\nAlice uses the sacrificial key and reveals the innocuous message M1 to Bob. Since it is impossible for Bob to know for sure that there might be other messages contained in C, he might assume that there are no other messages (alternatively, Bob may not be familiar with the concept of plausible encryption in the first place, and thus may not be aware it is even possible for C to contain more than one message).Another possible scenario involves Alice sending the same ciphertext (some secret instructions) to Bob and Carl, to whom she has handed different keys. Bob and Carl are to receive different instructions and must not be able to read each other's instructions. Bob will receive the message first and then forward it to Carl.\n\nAlice constructs the ciphertext out of both messages, M1 and M2, and emails it to Bob.\nBob uses his key to decrypt M1 and isn't able to read M2.\nBob forwards the ciphertext to Carl.\nCarl uses his key to decrypt M2 and isn't able to read M1.\n\n== Forms of deniable encryption ==\nNormally, ciphertexts decrypt to a single plaintext that is intended to be kept secret. However, one form of deniable encryption allows its users to decrypt the ciphertext to produce a different (innocuous but plausible) plaintext and plausibly claim that it is what they encrypted. The holder of the ciphertext will not be able to differentiate between the true plaintext, and the bogus-claim plaintext. In general, one ciphertext cannot be decrypted to all possible plaintexts unless the key is as large as the plaintext, so it is not practical in most cases for a ciphertext to reveal no information whatsoever about its plaintext. However, some schemes allow decryption to decoy plaintexts that are close to the original in some metric (such as edit distance).\nModern deniable encryption techniques exploit the fact that without the key, it is infeasible to distinguish between ciphertext from block ciphers and data generated by a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (the cipher's pseudorandom permutation properties).This is used in combination with some decoy data that the user would plausibly want to keep confidential that will be revealed to the attacker, claiming that this is all there is.

    "instruction": "Context: Authorization\n\n==Introduction==\nAuthorization or authorisation (see spelling differences) is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to general information security and computer security, and to access control in particular. More formally, \"to authorize\" is to define an access policy. For example, human resources staff are normally authorized to access employee records and this policy is often formalized as access control rules in a computer system. During operation, the system uses the access control rules to decide whether access requests from (authenticated) consumers shall be approved (granted) or disapproved (rejected). Resources include individual files or an item's data, computer programs, computer devices and functionality provided by computer applications. Examples of consumers are computer users, computer software and other hardware on the computer.\n\n== Overview ==\nAccess control in computer systems and networks rely on access policies. The access control process can be divided into the following phases: policy definition phase where access is authorized, and policy enforcement phase where access requests are approved or disapproved. Authorization is the function of the policy definition phase which precedes the policy enforcement phase where access requests are approved or disapproved based on the previously defined authorizations.\nMost modern, multi-user operating systems include role-based access control (RBAC) and thereby rely on authorization. Access control also uses authentication to verify the identity of consumers. When a consumer tries to access a resource, the access control process checks that the consumer has been authorized to use that resource. Authorization is the responsibility of an authority, such as a department manager, within the application domain, but is often delegated to a custodian such as a system administrator. Authorizations are expressed as access policies in some types of \"policy definition application\", e.g. in the form of an access control list or a capability, or a policy administration point e.g. XACML. On the basis of the \"principle of least privilege\": consumers should only be authorized to access whatever they need to do their jobs. Older and single user operating systems often had weak or non-existent authentication and access control systems.\n\"Anonymous consumers\" or \"guests\", are consumers that have not been required to authenticate. They often have limited authorization. On a distributed system, it is often desirable to grant access without requiring a unique identity. Familiar examples of access tokens include keys, certificates and tickets: they grant access without proving identity.\nTrusted consumers are often authorized for unrestricted access to resources on a system, but must be verified so that the access control system can make the access approval decision. \"Partially trusted\" and guests will often have restricted authorization in order to protect resources against improper access and usage. The access policy in some operating systems, by default, grant all consumers full access to all resources. Others do the opposite, insisting that the administrator explicitly authorizes a consumer to use each resource.\nEven when access is controlled through a combination of authentication and access control lists, the problems of maintaining the authorization data is not trivial, and often represents as much administrative burden as managing authentication credentials. It is often necessary to change or remove a user's authorization: this is done by changing or deleting the corresponding access rules on the system. Using atomic authorization is an alternative to per-system authorization management, where a trusted third party securely distributes authorization information.\n\n== Related interpretations ==\n\n\n*** Public policy ***\nIn public policy, authorization is a feature of trusted systems used for security or social control.\n\n\n*** Banking ***\nIn banking, an authorization is a hold placed on a customer's account when a purchase is made using a debit card or credit card.\n\n\n*** Publishing ***\n\nIn publishing, sometimes public lectures and other freely available texts are published without the approval of the author. These are called unauthorized texts. An example is the 2002  'The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe' , which was collected from Stephen Hawking's lectures and published without his permission as per copyright law.\n\nQuestion: What are anonymous consumers and how are they treated in access control?\n\nAnswer:",

Resources include individual files or an item's data, computer programs, computer devices and functionality provided by computer applications. Examples of consumers are computer users, computer software and other hardware on the computer.\n\n== Overview ==\nAccess control in computer systems and networks rely on access policies. The access control process can be divided into the following phases: policy definition phase where access is authorized, and policy enforcement phase where access requests are approved or disapproved. Authorization is the function of the policy definition phase which precedes the policy enforcement phase where access requests are approved or disapproved based on the previously defined authorizations.\nMost modern, multi-user operating systems include role-based access control (RBAC) and thereby rely on authorization. Access control also uses authentication to verify the identity of consumers. When a consumer tries to access a resource, the access control process checks that the consumer has been authorized to use that resource. Authorization is the responsibility of an authority, such as a department manager, within the application domain, but is often delegated to a custodian such as a system administrator. Authorizations are expressed as access policies in some types of \"policy definition application\", e.g. in the form of an access control list or a capability, or a policy administration point e.g. XACML. On the basis of the \"principle of least privilege\": consumers should only be authorized to access whatever they need to do their jobs. Older and single user operating systems often had weak or non-existent authentication and access control systems.\n\"Anonymous consumers\" or \"guests\", are consumers that have not been required to authenticate. They often have limited authorization. On a distributed system, it is often desirable to grant access without requiring a unique identity. Familiar examples of access tokens include keys, certificates and tickets: they grant access without proving identity.\nTrusted consumers are often authorized for unrestricted access to resources on a system, but must be verified so that the access control system can make the access approval decision. \"Partially trusted\" and guests will often have restricted authorization in order to protect resources against improper access and usage. The access policy in some operating systems, by default, grant all consumers full access to all resources. Others do the opposite, insisting that the administrator explicitly authorizes a consumer to use each resource.\nEven when access is controlled through a combination of authentication and access control lists, the problems of maintaining the authorization data is not trivial, and often represents as much administrative burden as managing authentication credentials. It is often necessary to change or remove a user's authorization: this is done by changing or deleting the corresponding access rules on the system. Using atomic authorization is an alternative to per-system authorization management, where a trusted third party securely distributes authorization information.\n\n== Related interpretations ==\n\n\n*** Public policy ***\nIn public policy, authorization is a feature of trusted systems used for security or social control.\n\n\n*** Banking ***\nIn banking, an authorization is a hold placed on a customer's account when a purchase is made using a debit card or credit card.\n\n\n*** Publishing ***\n\nIn publishing, sometimes public lectures and other freely available texts are published without the approval of the author. These are called unauthorized texts. An example is the 2002  'The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe' , which was collected from Stephen Hawking's lectures and published without his permission as per copyright law."

    "instruction": "Mobile phone spam\n\n==Introduction==\nMobile phone spam is a form of spam (unsolicited messages, especially advertising), directed at the text messaging or other communications services of mobile phones or smartphones. As the popularity of mobile phones surged in the early 2000s, frequent users of text messaging began to see an increase in the number of unsolicited (and generally unwanted) commercial advertisements being sent to their telephones through text messaging. This can be particularly annoying for the recipient because, unlike in email, some recipients may be charged a fee for every message received, including spam. Mobile phone spam is generally less pervasive than email spam, where in 2010 around 90% of email is spam.  The amount of mobile spam varies widely from region to region.  In North America, mobile spam steadily increased after 2008 and accounted for half of all mobile phone traffic by 2019.  In parts of Asia up to 30% of messages were spam in 2012.\nThe lesser and geographically uneven prevalence of mobile phone spam is attributable to geographic variation of prevalence of mobile vs non-mobile electronic communications, the higher cost (to spammers) of and technological barriers to sending mobile messages in some areas, and to law enforcement in others.   Today, particularly in North America, most mobile phone spam is sent from mobile devices that have prepaid unlimited messaging rate plans.  While the rate plans allow for unlimited messaging, in reality the relatively slow sending rate (on the order of magnitude of 1/s) limits the number of messages that may be sent before an abusing mobile is shut down.\n\n== Terminology ==\nMobile phone spam is described as \"mobile spamming\", \"SMS spam\", \"text spam\", \"m-spam\" or \"mspam\".\n\n== Criminality and law enforcement ==\nSMS spam is illegal under common law in many jurisdictions as trespass to chattels.  Jurisdictions with specific SMS spam regulation and fines include Australia, the EU, and the United States. In the US, violators face substantial costs. For example, in a 2008 settlement, the violator agreed to pay $150 to each spam recipient. In a 2010 class action settlement of Satterfield v. Simon & Schuster, a case that reached the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, defendants agreed to pay $175 to each spam recipient. In subsequent cases, the payment per class member has increased to $200 in 2011 and $500 in 2013. In  response to Satterfield, entities who make money sending mobile phone spam formed the Mobile Advocacy Coalition (MAC) to lobby the government to legalize that activity.  In the US, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has expanded Phone Spam regulations to cover also Voice Spam\u2014mostly in form of prerecorded telemarketing calls\u2014commonly known as robocalls; victims can file a complaint with the FCC. In California, Section 17538.41 of the B&P Code bans text message advertisement. Consumers can sue on an individual or class basis per a private right of action against unfair business practices. In 2019, senators John Thune, Roger Wicker and Ed Markey introduced a new proposal titled the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act (TRACED) to deter criminal robocall violations and improve enforcement  which passed the Senate on May 22, 2019 and was signed into law by President Trump in December 2019.\n\n\n*** Enforcement in small claims court ***\nThe U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released an order in Aug, 2004 that reiterated that SMS spam messages to cellphones are illegal under the existing Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). Each such unsolicited message received without permission entitles the recipient to take the sender to small claims court and collect a minimum of $1 for each violation. They said this in 2003, and reiterated it in 2004: \"In 2003, we released a Report and Order in which we reaffirmed that the TCPA prohibits any call using an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded message to any wireless telephone number. We concluded that this encompasses both voice calls and text calls, including Short Message Service (SMS) text messaging calls, to wireless phone numbers.\"The 2003 TCPA Order (18 FCC Rcd at 14115, para. 165) says: \u201cBoth the statute and our rules prohibit these calls, with limited exceptions, \u2018to any telephone number assigned to a paging service, cellular telephone service, specialized mobile radio service, or other common carrier service, or any service for which the called party is charged.\u2019 This encompasses both voice calls and text calls to wireless numbers including, for example, short message service (SMS) calls, provided the call is made to a telephone number assigned to such service.\u201d (citations omitted).\nIn the UK, Sending unsolicited text messages is acting contrary to Schedule 2 of the Data Protection Act 1998 and section 22 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003. Section 13 of Data Protection Act 1998 and section 30 of Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 enable consumers to bring proceedings for compensation  for spam emails or text messages.\n\n== Legalization ==\nIn 2013, Club Texting, Inc. petitioned the FCC for a Declaratory Ruling that Text Broadcasters Are Not Senders of Text Messages, and had a private meeting with five FCC staff members to argue their case. This would mean that Text Broadcasters would no longer be liable for mobile phone spam they conveyed.\n\n== Factors complicating SMS spam reduction ==\nFighting SMS spam is complicated by several factors, including the lower rate of SMS spam (compared to more abused services such as Internet email), which has allowed many users and service providers to ignore the issue, and the limited availability of mobile phone spam-filtering software. Filtering SMS spam at the recipient device would be an imperfect solution in markets where users are charged to receive messages, as the user may still be charged for the message once the provider sent it, even if software on the device blocked it from appearing on the device's display.  This problem is not present in most of the world outside the U.S., however, where users are not charged to receive messages.\nProviders may fear liability should a legitimate message of an emergency nature be blocked. Nonetheless, many providers voluntarily provide their subscribers technical means for mitigating unsolicited SMS messages.\n\n== Defense ==\nThere are several actions and strategies that can help reduce SMS spam. Legal actions can be effective and remunerative. Many carriers (such as AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Sprint in the US; and EE, T-Mobile, Orange and O2 in the UK) allow subscribers to report spam by forwarding the spam messages to short code 7726 (spells SPAM on a traditional phone keypad) (33700 in France, 1909 in India), other UK carriers Vodafone and Three use 87726 and 37726 respectively.  It is reported that 1/2 million spam reports in France resulted in the disconnection of 300 spammers, and many more cease-and-desist orders were sent. Some spam defense measures depend on detection, and there are two developments in that area:  a GSMA pilot spam reporting program, and the development of Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) standards for mobile spam reporting.  In February 2010, the GSM Association has announced a pilot program that will allow subscribers to report SMS spam by forwarding it to short code '7726' which spells \"SPAM\" on most phones.  AT&T Mobility, Korea Telecom, and SFR announced their participation.  Following the pilot, a number of other mobile operators have joined the GSMA's Spam Reporting Service program.\nThe Open Mobile Alliance completed its \"SpamRep\" standard which provides a standardized client-server interface suited for user reporting of mobile email, SMS, MMS and IM spam using a 'This-Is-Spam' button or menu item, as users of wired email systems are now doing. In 2012, responding to the increase in SMS spam, the GSM Association formed a Messaging Security Group to help reduce the impact of mobile spam. Another helpful SMS spam-reduction technique is guarding one's cell phone number. One of the biggest sources of SMS spam is number harvesting carried out by Internet sites offering \"free\" ring tone downloads. In order to facilitate the downloads, users must provide their phones' numbers; which in turn are used to send frequent advertising messages to the phone. Wording in the sites' Terms of Service intended to make this legal have not survived court challenge.Another approach to reducing SMS spam that is offered by some carriers involves creating an alias address rather than using the cell phone's number as a text message address. Only messages sent to the alias are delivered; messages sent to the phone's number are discarded. A New York Times article provided detailed information on this in 2008. Another countermeasure is to use a service that provides a public phone number and publishes the SMS messages received at that number to a publicly accessible website. Google Voice can be used in this way, but with numbers and messages kept private. most cell phone providers offer the option of completely disabling all text messaging services on a user's account. This extreme solution, however, is satisfactory only for those users who have neither the need nor the desire to utilize SMS at all.\nIn June 2009, three major Chinese carriers\u2014China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom\u2014imposed limits on text messaging in order to crack down on spam SMS. Under the restrictions, a phone number can send no more than 200 messages per hour and 1000/day on weekdays. In the United States, recipients of SMS spam can file a complaint with the FCC using form 1088G. Phone users in the United Kingdom can use the Information Commissioner's complaints  page and can take action against the sender through the small claims court. The ICO however only have powers to act against SMS spam originating in the UK, and in the event Spam originates outside their jurisdiction they will forward details to an equivalent local regulator if one exists.\n\n== Pro-active campaigns ==\nIn October 2014, a network of solicitors in the UK called PIE (Personal Injury Expert) Lawyers launched a campaign on social media to rid their industry of text message spam. Their feeling was that the use of unsolicited sms marketing was adding further damage to their industry's already poor reputation. The campaign focused on the fact that, under UK law, it is illegal for a solicitor to obtain business by unsolicited direct contact with potential personal injury clients. This is the case even in the event that it is not the solicitor who makes the unsolicited approach. The campaign actively encouraged people to respond to the spam text messages. Upon receipt of an offer of legal representation from a solicitor, the person would then report the solicitor to the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) which would then take appropriate action. Ultimately any solicitor found to be guilty on repeated occasions of obtaining customers by unsolicited approaches could have their practicing certificates revoked thereby ending their career as a solicitor.\n\nQ: How can users in the US report mobile phone spam?",

Filtering SMS spam at the recipient device would be an imperfect solution in markets where users are charged to receive messages, as the user may still be charged for the message once the provider sent it, even if software on the device blocked it from appearing on the device's display.  This problem is not present in most of the world outside the U.S., however, where users are not charged to receive messages.\nProviders may fear liability should a legitimate message of an emergency nature be blocked. Nonetheless, many providers voluntarily provide their subscribers technical means for mitigating unsolicited SMS messages.\n\n== Defense ==\nThere are several actions and strategies that can help reduce SMS spam. Legal actions can be effective and remunerative. Many carriers (such as AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and Sprint in the US; and EE, T-Mobile, Orange and O2 in the UK) allow subscribers to report spam by forwarding the spam messages to short code 7726 (spells SPAM on a traditional phone keypad) (33700 in France, 1909 in India), other UK carriers Vodafone and Three use 87726 and 37726 respectively.  It is reported that 1/2 million spam reports in France resulted in the disconnection of 300 spammers, and many more cease-and-desist orders were sent. Some spam defense measures depend on detection, and there are two developments in that area:  a GSMA pilot spam reporting program, and the development of Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) standards for mobile spam reporting.  In February 2010, the GSM Association has announced a pilot program that will allow subscribers to report SMS spam by forwarding it to short code '7726' which spells \"SPAM\" on most phones.  AT&T Mobility, Korea Telecom, and SFR announced their participation.  Following the pilot, a number of other mobile operators have joined the GSMA's Spam Reporting Service program.\nThe Open Mobile Alliance completed its \"SpamRep\" standard which provides a standardized client-server interface suited for user reporting of mobile email, SMS, MMS and IM spam using a 'This-Is-Spam' button or menu item, as users of wired email systems are now doing. In 2012, responding to the increase in SMS spam, the GSM Association formed a Messaging Security Group to help reduce the impact of mobile spam. Another helpful SMS spam-reduction technique is guarding one's cell phone number. One of the biggest sources of SMS spam is number harvesting carried out by Internet sites offering \"free\" ring tone downloads. In order to facilitate the downloads, users must provide their phones' numbers; which in turn are used to send frequent advertising messages to the phone. Wording in the sites' Terms of Service intended to make this legal have not survived court challenge.Another approach to reducing SMS spam that is offered by some carriers involves creating an alias address rather than using the cell phone's number as a text message address. Only messages sent to the alias are delivered; messages sent to the phone's number are discarded. A New York Times article provided detailed information on this in 2008. Another countermeasure is to use a service that provides a public phone number and publishes the SMS messages received at that number to a publicly accessible website. Google Voice can be used in this way, but with numbers and messages kept private. most cell phone providers offer the option of completely disabling all text messaging services on a user's account. This extreme solution, however, is satisfactory only for those users who have neither the need nor the desire to utilize SMS at all.\nIn June 2009, three major Chinese carriers\u2014China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom\u2014imposed limits on text messaging in order to crack down on spam SMS. Under the restrictions, a phone number can send no more than 200 messages per hour and 1000/day on weekdays. In the United States, recipients of SMS spam can file a complaint with the FCC using form 1088G. Phone users in the United Kingdom can use the Information Commissioner's complaints  page and can take action against the sender through the small claims court. The ICO however only have powers to act against SMS spam originating in the UK, and in the event Spam originates outside their jurisdiction they will forward details to an equivalent local regulator if one exists.\n\n== Pro-active campaigns ==\nIn October 2014, a network of solicitors in the UK called PIE (Personal Injury Expert) Lawyers launched a campaign on social media to rid their industry of text message spam. Their feeling was that the use of unsolicited sms marketing was adding further damage to their industry's already poor reputation. The campaign focused on the fact that, under UK law, it is illegal for a solicitor to obtain business by unsolicited direct contact with potential personal injury clients. This is the case even in the event that it is not the solicitor who makes the unsolicited approach. The campaign actively encouraged people to respond to the spam text messages. Upon receipt of an offer of legal representation from a solicitor, the person would then report the solicitor to the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) which would then take appropriate action. Ultimately any solicitor found to be guilty on repeated occasions of obtaining customers by unsolicited approaches could have their practicing certificates revoked thereby ending their career as a solicitor."

These involved limiting exportable software to use only public key pairs with RSA moduli of 512 bits or less (so-called RSA_EXPORT keys), with the intention of allowing them to be broken easily by the National Security Agency (NSA), but not by other organizations with lesser computing resources. However, by the early 2010s, increases in computing power meant that they could be broken by anyone with access to relatively modest computing resources using the well-known Number Field Sieve algorithm, using as little as $100 of cloud computing services. Combined with the ability of a man-in-the-middle attack to manipulate the initial cipher suite negotiation between the endpoints in the connection and the fact that the Finished hash only depended on the master secret, this meant that a man-in-the-middle attack with only a modest amount of computation could break the security of any website that allowed the use of 512-bit export-grade keys. While the exploit was only discovered in 2015, its underlying vulnerabilities had been present for many years, dating back to the 1990s.\n\n== Vulnerability ==\nThe flaw was found by researchers from IMDEA Software Institute, INRIA and Microsoft Research. The FREAK attack in OpenSSL has the identifier CVE-2015-0204.Vulnerable software and devices included Apple's Safari web browser, the default browser in Google's Android operating system, Microsoft's Internet Explorer, and OpenSSL.

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nExponential mechanism\n\n==Introduction==\nThe exponential mechanism is a technique for designing differentially private algorithms. It was developed by Frank McSherry and Kunal Talwar in 2007. Their work was recognized as a co-winner of the 2009 PET Award for Outstanding Research in Privacy Enhancing Technologies.Most of the initial research in the field of differential privacy revolved around real-valued functions which have relatively low sensitivity to change in the data of a single individual and whose usefulness is not hampered by small additive perturbations. A natural question is what happens in the situation when one wants to preserve more general sets of properties. The exponential mechanism helps to extend the notion of differential privacy to address these issues. Moreover, it describes a class of mechanisms that includes all possible differentially private mechanisms.\n\n== The mechanism ==\n\n\n*** Algorithm ***\nIn very generic terms, a privacy mechanism maps a set of \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n\\,\\!}\n   inputs from domain \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            D\n          \n        \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {D}}\\,\\!}\n   to a range \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            R\n          \n        \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {R}}\\,\\!}\n  .

It was developed by Frank McSherry and Kunal Talwar in 2007. Their work was recognized as a co-winner of the 2009 PET Award for Outstanding Research in Privacy Enhancing Technologies.Most of the initial research in the field of differential privacy revolved around real-valued functions which have relatively low sensitivity to change in the data of a single individual and whose usefulness is not hampered by small additive perturbations. A natural question is what happens in the situation when one wants to preserve more general sets of properties. The exponential mechanism helps to extend the notion of differential privacy to address these issues. Moreover, it describes a class of mechanisms that includes all possible differentially private mechanisms.\n\n== The mechanism ==\n\n\n*** Algorithm ***\nIn very generic terms, a privacy mechanism maps a set of \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n\\,\\!}\n   inputs from domain \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            D\n          \n        \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {D}}\\,\\!}\n   to a range \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            R\n          \n        \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {R}}\\,\\!}\n  .

If a user forgets their password then a password notification email is sent containing enough information for the user to access their account again.

This email may contain a temporary password or a URL that can be followed to enter a new password for that account. The new password or the URL often contain a randomly generated string of text that can only be obtained by reading that particular email.Another method used is to send all or part of the original password in the email.

    "instruction": "Linear-feedback shift register\n\n==Introduction==\nIn computing, a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) is a shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state.\nThe most commonly used linear function of single bits is exclusive-or (XOR). Thus, an LFSR is most often a shift register whose input bit is driven by the XOR of some bits of the overall shift register value.\nThe initial value of the LFSR is called the seed, and because the operation of the register is deterministic, the stream of values produced by the register is completely determined by its current (or previous) state. Likewise, because the register has a finite number of possible states, it must eventually enter a repeating cycle. However, an LFSR with a well-chosen feedback function can produce a sequence of bits that appears random and has a very long cycle.\nApplications of LFSRs include generating pseudo-random numbers, pseudo-noise sequences, fast digital counters, and whitening sequences. Both hardware and software implementations of LFSRs are common.\nThe mathematics of a cyclic redundancy check, used to provide a quick check against transmission errors, are closely related to those of an LFSR. In general, the arithmetics behind LFSRs makes them very elegant as an object to study and implement. One can produce relatively complex logics with simple building blocks. However, other methods, that are less elegant but perform better, should be considered as well.\n\n\n\n== Fibonacci LFSRs ==\n\nThe bit positions that affect the next state are called the taps. In the diagram the taps are [16,14,13,11]. The rightmost bit of the LFSR is called the output bit. The taps are XOR'd sequentially with the output bit and then fed back into the leftmost bit. The sequence of bits in the rightmost position is called the output stream.\n\nThe bits in the LFSR state that influence the input are called taps.\nA maximum-length LFSR produces an m-sequence (i.e., it cycles through all possible 2m \u2212 1 states within the shift register except the state where all bits are zero), unless it contains all zeros, in which case it will never change.\nAs an alternative to the XOR-based feedback in an LFSR, one can also use XNOR. This function is an affine map, not strictly a linear map, but it results in an equivalent polynomial counter whose state is the complement of the state of an LFSR. A state with all ones is illegal when using an XNOR feedback, in the same way as a state with all zeroes is illegal when using XOR. This state is considered illegal because the counter would remain \"locked-up\" in this state. This method can be advantageous in hardware LFSRs using flip-flops that start in a zero state, as it does not start in a lockup state, meaning that the register does not need to be seeded in order to begin operation.The sequence of numbers generated by an LFSR or its XNOR counterpart can be considered a binary numeral system just as valid as Gray code or the natural binary code.\nThe arrangement of taps for feedback in an LFSR can be expressed in finite field arithmetic as a polynomial mod 2. This means that the coefficients of the polynomial must be 1s or 0s. This is called the feedback polynomial or reciprocal characteristic polynomial. For example, if the taps are at the 16th, 14th, 13th and 11th bits (as shown), the feedback polynomial is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            16\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          x\n          \n            14\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          x\n          \n            13\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          x\n          \n            11\n          \n        \n        +\n        1.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x^{16}+x^{14}+x^{13}+x^{11}+1.}\n  The \"one\" in the polynomial does not correspond to a tap \u2013 it corresponds to the input to the first bit (i.e. x0, which is equivalent to 1). The powers of the terms represent the tapped bits, counting from the left. The first and last bits are always connected as an input and output tap respectively.\n\nThe LFSR is maximal-length if and only if the corresponding feedback polynomial is primitive over the Galois field GF(2). This means that the following conditions are necessary (but not sufficient):\n\nThe number of taps is even.\nThe set of taps is setwise co-prime; i.e., there must be no divisor other than 1 common to all taps.Tables of primitive polynomials from which maximum-length LFSRs can be constructed are given below and in the references.\nThere can be more than one maximum-length tap sequence for a given LFSR length. Also, once one maximum-length tap sequence has been found, another automatically follows. If the tap sequence in an n-bit LFSR is [n, A, B, C, 0], where the 0 corresponds to the x0\n\n== Galois LFSRs ==\n\nNamed after the French mathematician \u00c9variste Galois, an LFSR in Galois configuration, which is also known as modular, internal XORs, or one-to-many LFSR, is an alternate structure that can generate the same output stream as a conventional LFSR (but offset in time). In the Galois configuration, when the system is clocked, bits that are not taps are shifted one position to the right unchanged. The taps, on the other hand, are XORed with the output bit before they are stored in the next position. The new output bit is the next input bit. The effect of this is that when the output bit is zero, all the bits in the register shift to the right unchanged, and the input bit becomes zero. When the output bit is one, the bits in the tap positions all flip (if they are 0, they become 1, and if they are 1, they become 0), and then the entire register is shifted to the right and the input bit becomes 1.\nTo generate the same output stream, the order of the taps is the counterpart (see above) of the order for the conventional LFSR, otherwise the stream will be in reverse. Note that the internal state of the LFSR is not necessarily the same. The Galois register shown has the same output stream as the Fibonacci register in the first section. A time offset exists between the streams, so a different startpoint will be needed to get the same output each cycle.\n\nGalois LFSRs do not concatenate every tap to produce the new input (the XORing is done within the LFSR, and no XOR gates are run in serial, therefore the propagation times are reduced to that of one XOR rather than a whole chain), thus it is possible for each tap to be computed in parallel, increasing the speed of execution.\nIn a software implementation of an LFSR, the Galois form is more efficient, as the XOR operations can be implemented a word at a time: only the output bit must be examined individually.Below is a C code example for the 16-bit maximal-period Galois LFSR example in the figure:\n\nThe branch if (lsb) lfsr ^\n\n== Xorshift LFSRs ==\n\nAs shown by George Marsaglia and further analysed by Richard P.

The formalism for maximum-length LFSRs was developed by Solomon W. Golomb in his 1967 book. The number of different primitive polynomials grows exponentially with shift-register length and can be calculated exactly using Euler's totient function (sequence A011260 in the OEIS).\n\nXilinx published an extend list of tap counters up to 168 bit.  Tables of maximum length polynomials are available from http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/lfsr/ and can be generated by the https://github.com/hayguen/mlpolygen project.\n\n== Output-stream properties ==\nOnes and zeroes occur in \"runs\". The output stream 1110010, for example, consists of four runs of lengths 3, 2, 1, 1, in order. In one period of a maximal LFSR, 2n\u22121 runs occur (in the example above, the 3-bit LFSR has 4 runs). Exactly half of these runs are one bit long, a quarter are two bits long, up to a single run of zeroes n \u2212 1 bits long, and a single run of ones n bits long. This distribution almost equals the statistical expectation value for a truly random sequence. However, the probability of finding exactly this distribution in a sample of a truly random sequence is rather low.\nLFSR output streams are deterministic. If the present state and the positions of the XOR gates in the LFSR are known, the next state can be predicted. This is not possible with truly random events. With maximal-length LFSRs, it is much easier to compute the next state, as there are only an easily limited number of them for each length.\nThe output stream is reversible; an LFSR with mirrored taps will cycle through the output sequence in reverse order.\nThe value consisting of all zeros cannot appear. Thus an LFSR of length n cannot be used to generate all 2n values.\n\n== Applications ==\nLFSRs can be implemented in hardware, and this makes them useful in applications that require very fast generation of a pseudo-random sequence, such as direct-sequence spread spectrum radio. LFSRs have also been used for generating an approximation of white noise in various programmable sound generators.\n\n\n*** Uses as counters ***\nThe repeating sequence of states of an LFSR allows it to be used as a clock divider or as a counter when a non-binary sequence is acceptable, as is often the case where computer index or framing locations need to be machine-readable. LFSR counters have simpler feedback logic than natural binary counters or Gray-code counters, and therefore can operate at higher clock rates. However, it is necessary to ensure that the LFSR never enters an all-zeros state, for example by presetting it at start-up to any other state in the sequence.\nThe table of primitive polynomials shows how LFSRs can be arranged in Fibonacci or Galois form to give maximal periods. One can obtain any other period by adding to an LFSR that has a longer period some logic that shortens the sequence by skipping some states.\n\n\n*** Uses in cryptography ***\nLFSRs have long been used as pseudo-random number generators for use in stream ciphers, due to the ease of construction from simple electromechanical or electronic circuits, long periods, and very uniformly distributed output streams. However, an LFSR is a linear system, leading to fairly easy cryptanalysis. For example, given a stretch of known plaintext and corresponding ciphertext, an attacker can intercept and recover a stretch of LFSR output stream used in the system described, and from that stretch of the output stream can construct an LFSR of minimal size that simulates the intended receiver by using the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm. This LFSR can then be fed the intercepted stretch of output stream to recover the remaining plaintext.\nThree general methods are employed to reduce this problem in LFSR-based stream ciphers:\n\nNon-linear combination of several bits from the LFSR state;\nNon-linear combination of the output bits of two or more LFSRs (see also: shrinking generator); or using Evolutionary algorithm to introduce non-linearity.\nIrregular clocking of the LFSR, as in the alternating step generator.Important LFSR-based stream ciphers include A5/1 and A5/2, used in GSM cell phones, E0, used in Bluetooth, and the shrinking generator. The A5/2 cipher has been broken and both A5/1 and E0 have serious weaknesses.The linear feedback shift register has a strong relationship to linear congruential generators.\n\n\n*** Uses in circuit testing ***\nLFSRs are used in circuit testing for test-pattern generation (for exhaustive testing, pseudo-random testing or pseudo-exhaustive testing) and for signature analysis.\n\n\n**** Test-pattern generation ****\nComplete LFSR are commonly used as pattern generators for exhaustive testing, since they cover all possible inputs for an n-input circuit. Maximal-length LFSRs and weighted LFSRs are widely used as pseudo-random test-pattern generators for pseudo-random test applications.\n\n\n**** Signature analysis ****\nIn built-in self-test (BIST) techniques, storing all the circuit outputs on chip is not possible, but the circuit output can be compressed to form a signature that will later be compared to the golden signature (of the good circuit) to detect faults. Since this compression is lossy, there is always a possibility that a faulty output also generates the same signature as the golden signature and the faults cannot be detected. This condition is called error masking or aliasing. BIST is accomplished with a multiple-input signature register (MISR or MSR), which is a type of LFSR. A standard LFSR has a single XOR or XNOR gate, where the input of the gate is connected to several \"taps\" and the output is connected to the input of the first flip-flop. A MISR has the same structure, but the input to every flip-flop is fed through an XOR/XNOR gate. For example, a 4-bit MISR has a 4-bit parallel output and a 4-bit parallel input. The input of the first flip-flop is XOR/XNORd with parallel input bit zero and the \"taps\". Every other flip-flop input is XOR/XNORd with the preceding flip-flop output and the corresponding parallel input bit. Consequently, the next state of the MISR depends on the last several states opposed to just the current state. Therefore, a MISR will always generate the same golden signature given that the input sequence is the same every time.\nRecent applications are proposing set-reset flip-flops as \"taps\" of the LFSR. This allows the BIST system to optimise storage, since set-reset flip-flops can save the initial seed to generate the whole stream of bits from the LFSR. Nevertheless, this requires changes in the architecture of BIST, is an option for specific applications.\n\n\n*** Uses in digital broadcasting and communications ***\n\n\n**** Scrambling ****\n\nTo prevent short repeating sequences (e.g., runs of 0s or 1s) from forming spectral lines that may complicate symbol tracking at the\nreceiver or interfere with other transmissions, the data bit sequence is combined with the output of a linear-feedback register before modulation and transmission. This scrambling is removed at the receiver after demodulation. When the LFSR runs at the same bit rate as the transmitted symbol stream, this technique is referred to as scrambling. When the LFSR runs considerably faster than the symbol stream, the LFSR-generated bit sequence is called chipping code. The chipping code is combined with the data using exclusive or before transmitting using binary phase-shift keying or a similar modulation method. The resulting signal has a higher bandwidth than the data, and therefore this is a method of spread-spectrum communication. When used only for the spread-spectrum property, this technique is called direct-sequence spread spectrum; when used to distinguish several signals transmitted in the same channel at the same time and frequency, it is called code-division multiple access.\nNeither scheme should be confused with encryption or encipherment; scrambling and spreading with LFSRs do not protect the information from eavesdropping. They are instead used to produce equivalent streams that possess convenient engineering properties to allow robust and efficient modulation and demodulation.\nDigital broadcasting systems that use linear-feedback registers:\n\nATSC Standards (digital TV transmission system \u2013 North America)\nDAB (Digital Audio Broadcasting system \u2013 for radio)\nDVB-T (digital TV transmission system \u2013 Europe, Australia, parts of Asia)\nNICAM (digital audio system for television)Other digital communications systems using LFSRs:\n\nINTELSAT business service (IBS)\nIntermediate data rate (IDR)\nHDMI 2.0\nSDI (Serial Digital Interface transmission)\nData transfer over PSTN (according to the ITU-T V-series recommendations)\nCDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) cellular telephony\n100BASE-T2 \"fast\" Ethernet scrambles bits using an LFSR\n1000BASE-T Ethernet, the most common form of Gigabit Ethernet, scrambles bits using an LFSR\nPCI Express\nSATA\nSerial Attached SCSI (SAS/SPL)\nUSB 3.0\nIEEE 802.11a scrambles bits using an LFSR\nBluetooth Low Energy Link Layer is making use of LFSR (referred to as whitening)\nSatellite navigation systems such as GPS and GLONASS. All current systems use LFSR outputs to generate some or all of their ranging codes (as the chipping code for CDMA or DSSS) or to modulate the carrier without data (like GPS L2 CL ranging code). GLONASS also uses frequency-division multiple access combined with DSSS.\n\n\n**** Other uses ****\nLFSRs are also used in radio jamming systems to generate pseudo-random noise to raise the noise floor of a target communication system.\nThe German time signal DCF77, in addition to amplitude keying, employs phase-shift keying driven by a 9-stage LFSR to increase the accuracy of received time and the robustness of the data stream in the presence of noise.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question.

      "context": "Linear-feedback shift register\n\n==Introduction==\nIn computing, a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR) is a shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state.\nThe most commonly used linear function of single bits is exclusive-or (XOR). Thus, an LFSR is most often a shift register whose input bit is driven by the XOR of some bits of the overall shift register value.\nThe initial value of the LFSR is called the seed, and because the operation of the register is deterministic, the stream of values produced by the register is completely determined by its current (or previous) state. Likewise, because the register has a finite number of possible states, it must eventually enter a repeating cycle. However, an LFSR with a well-chosen feedback function can produce a sequence of bits that appears random and has a very long cycle.\nApplications of LFSRs include generating pseudo-random numbers, pseudo-noise sequences, fast digital counters, and whitening sequences. Both hardware and software implementations of LFSRs are common.\nThe mathematics of a cyclic redundancy check, used to provide a quick check against transmission errors, are closely related to those of an LFSR. In general, the arithmetics behind LFSRs makes them very elegant as an object to study and implement. One can produce relatively complex logics with simple building blocks. However, other methods, that are less elegant but perform better, should be considered as well.\n\n\n\n== Fibonacci LFSRs ==\n\nThe bit positions that affect the next state are called the taps. In the diagram the taps are [16,14,13,11]. The rightmost bit of the LFSR is called the output bit. The taps are XOR'd sequentially with the output bit and then fed back into the leftmost bit. The sequence of bits in the rightmost position is called the output stream.\n\nThe bits in the LFSR state that influence the input are called taps.\nA maximum-length LFSR produces an m-sequence (i.e., it cycles through all possible 2m \u2212 1 states within the shift register except the state where all bits are zero), unless it contains all zeros, in which case it will never change.\nAs an alternative to the XOR-based feedback in an LFSR, one can also use XNOR. This function is an affine map, not strictly a linear map, but it results in an equivalent polynomial counter whose state is the complement of the state of an LFSR. A state with all ones is illegal when using an XNOR feedback, in the same way as a state with all zeroes is illegal when using XOR. This state is considered illegal because the counter would remain \"locked-up\" in this state. This method can be advantageous in hardware LFSRs using flip-flops that start in a zero state, as it does not start in a lockup state, meaning that the register does not need to be seeded in order to begin operation.The sequence of numbers generated by an LFSR or its XNOR counterpart can be considered a binary numeral system just as valid as Gray code or the natural binary code.\nThe arrangement of taps for feedback in an LFSR can be expressed in finite field arithmetic as a polynomial mod 2. This means that the coefficients of the polynomial must be 1s or 0s. This is called the feedback polynomial or reciprocal characteristic polynomial. For example, if the taps are at the 16th, 14th, 13th and 11th bits (as shown), the feedback polynomial is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            16\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          x\n          \n            14\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          x\n          \n            13\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          x\n          \n            11\n          \n        \n        +\n        1.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x^{16}+x^{14}+x^{13}+x^{11}+1.}\n  The \"one\" in the polynomial does not correspond to a tap \u2013 it corresponds to the input to the first bit (i.e. x0, which is equivalent to 1). The powers of the terms represent the tapped bits, counting from the left. The first and last bits are always connected as an input and output tap respectively.\n\nThe LFSR is maximal-length if and only if the corresponding feedback polynomial is primitive over the Galois field GF(2). This means that the following conditions are necessary (but not sufficient):\n\nThe number of taps is even.\nThe set of taps is setwise co-prime; i.e., there must be no divisor other than 1 common to all taps.Tables of primitive polynomials from which maximum-length LFSRs can be constructed are given below and in the references.\nThere can be more than one maximum-length tap sequence for a given LFSR length. Also, once one maximum-length tap sequence has been found, another automatically follows. If the tap sequence in an n-bit LFSR is [n, A, B, C, 0], where the 0 corresponds to the x0\n\n== Galois LFSRs ==\n\nNamed after the French mathematician \u00c9variste Galois, an LFSR in Galois configuration, which is also known as modular, internal XORs, or one-to-many LFSR, is an alternate structure that can generate the same output stream as a conventional LFSR (but offset in time). In the Galois configuration, when the system is clocked, bits that are not taps are shifted one position to the right unchanged. The taps, on the other hand, are XORed with the output bit before they are stored in the next position. The new output bit is the next input bit. The effect of this is that when the output bit is zero, all the bits in the register shift to the right unchanged, and the input bit becomes zero. When the output bit is one, the bits in the tap positions all flip (if they are 0, they become 1, and if they are 1, they become 0), and then the entire register is shifted to the right and the input bit becomes 1.\nTo generate the same output stream, the order of the taps is the counterpart (see above) of the order for the conventional LFSR, otherwise the stream will be in reverse. Note that the internal state of the LFSR is not necessarily the same. The Galois register shown has the same output stream as the Fibonacci register in the first section. A time offset exists between the streams, so a different startpoint will be needed to get the same output each cycle.\n\nGalois LFSRs do not concatenate every tap to produce the new input (the XORing is done within the LFSR, and no XOR gates are run in serial, therefore the propagation times are reduced to that of one XOR rather than a whole chain), thus it is possible for each tap to be computed in parallel, increasing the speed of execution.\nIn a software implementation of an LFSR, the Galois form is more efficient, as the XOR operations can be implemented a word at a time: only the output bit must be examined individually.Below is a C code example for the 16-bit maximal-period Galois LFSR example in the figure:\n\nThe branch if (lsb) lfsr ^\n\n== Xorshift LFSRs ==\n\nAs shown by George Marsaglia and further analysed by Richard P. Brent, linear feedback shift registers can be implemented using XOR and Shift operations. This approach lends itself to fast execution in software because these operations typically map efficiently into modern processor instructions.\nBelow is a C code example for a 16-bit maximal-period Xorshift LFSR using the 7,9,13 triplet from John Metcalf:\n\n== Matrix forms ==\nBinary LFSRs of both Fibonacci and Galois configurations can be expressed as linear functions using matrices in \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            F\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {F} _{2}}\n   (see GF(2)).

The formalism for maximum-length LFSRs was developed by Solomon W. Golomb in his 1967 book. The number of different primitive polynomials grows exponentially with shift-register length and can be calculated exactly using Euler's totient function (sequence A011260 in the OEIS).\n\nXilinx published an extend list of tap counters up to 168 bit.  Tables of maximum length polynomials are available from http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/lfsr/ and can be generated by the https://github.com/hayguen/mlpolygen project.\n\n== Output-stream properties ==\nOnes and zeroes occur in \"runs\". The output stream 1110010, for example, consists of four runs of lengths 3, 2, 1, 1, in order. In one period of a maximal LFSR, 2n\u22121 runs occur (in the example above, the 3-bit LFSR has 4 runs). Exactly half of these runs are one bit long, a quarter are two bits long, up to a single run of zeroes n \u2212 1 bits long, and a single run of ones n bits long. This distribution almost equals the statistical expectation value for a truly random sequence. However, the probability of finding exactly this distribution in a sample of a truly random sequence is rather low.\nLFSR output streams are deterministic. If the present state and the positions of the XOR gates in the LFSR are known, the next state can be predicted. This is not possible with truly random events. With maximal-length LFSRs, it is much easier to compute the next state, as there are only an easily limited number of them for each length.\nThe output stream is reversible; an LFSR with mirrored taps will cycle through the output sequence in reverse order.\nThe value consisting of all zeros cannot appear. Thus an LFSR of length n cannot be used to generate all 2n values.\n\n== Applications ==\nLFSRs can be implemented in hardware, and this makes them useful in applications that require very fast generation of a pseudo-random sequence, such as direct-sequence spread spectrum radio. LFSRs have also been used for generating an approximation of white noise in various programmable sound generators.\n\n\n*** Uses as counters ***\nThe repeating sequence of states of an LFSR allows it to be used as a clock divider or as a counter when a non-binary sequence is acceptable, as is often the case where computer index or framing locations need to be machine-readable. LFSR counters have simpler feedback logic than natural binary counters or Gray-code counters, and therefore can operate at higher clock rates. However, it is necessary to ensure that the LFSR never enters an all-zeros state, for example by presetting it at start-up to any other state in the sequence.\nThe table of primitive polynomials shows how LFSRs can be arranged in Fibonacci or Galois form to give maximal periods. One can obtain any other period by adding to an LFSR that has a longer period some logic that shortens the sequence by skipping some states.\n\n\n*** Uses in cryptography ***\nLFSRs have long been used as pseudo-random number generators for use in stream ciphers, due to the ease of construction from simple electromechanical or electronic circuits, long periods, and very uniformly distributed output streams. However, an LFSR is a linear system, leading to fairly easy cryptanalysis. For example, given a stretch of known plaintext and corresponding ciphertext, an attacker can intercept and recover a stretch of LFSR output stream used in the system described, and from that stretch of the output stream can construct an LFSR of minimal size that simulates the intended receiver by using the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm. This LFSR can then be fed the intercepted stretch of output stream to recover the remaining plaintext.\nThree general methods are employed to reduce this problem in LFSR-based stream ciphers:\n\nNon-linear combination of several bits from the LFSR state;\nNon-linear combination of the output bits of two or more LFSRs (see also: shrinking generator); or using Evolutionary algorithm to introduce non-linearity.\nIrregular clocking of the LFSR, as in the alternating step generator.Important LFSR-based stream ciphers include A5/1 and A5/2, used in GSM cell phones, E0, used in Bluetooth, and the shrinking generator. The A5/2 cipher has been broken and both A5/1 and E0 have serious weaknesses.The linear feedback shift register has a strong relationship to linear congruential generators.\n\n\n*** Uses in circuit testing ***\nLFSRs are used in circuit testing for test-pattern generation (for exhaustive testing, pseudo-random testing or pseudo-exhaustive testing) and for signature analysis.\n\n\n**** Test-pattern generation ****\nComplete LFSR are commonly used as pattern generators for exhaustive testing, since they cover all possible inputs for an n-input circuit. Maximal-length LFSRs and weighted LFSRs are widely used as pseudo-random test-pattern generators for pseudo-random test applications.\n\n\n**** Signature analysis ****\nIn built-in self-test (BIST) techniques, storing all the circuit outputs on chip is not possible, but the circuit output can be compressed to form a signature that will later be compared to the golden signature (of the good circuit) to detect faults. Since this compression is lossy, there is always a possibility that a faulty output also generates the same signature as the golden signature and the faults cannot be detected. This condition is called error masking or aliasing. BIST is accomplished with a multiple-input signature register (MISR or MSR), which is a type of LFSR. A standard LFSR has a single XOR or XNOR gate, where the input of the gate is connected to several \"taps\" and the output is connected to the input of the first flip-flop. A MISR has the same structure, but the input to every flip-flop is fed through an XOR/XNOR gate. For example, a 4-bit MISR has a 4-bit parallel output and a 4-bit parallel input. The input of the first flip-flop is XOR/XNORd with parallel input bit zero and the \"taps\". Every other flip-flop input is XOR/XNORd with the preceding flip-flop output and the corresponding parallel input bit. Consequently, the next state of the MISR depends on the last several states opposed to just the current state. Therefore, a MISR will always generate the same golden signature given that the input sequence is the same every time.\nRecent applications are proposing set-reset flip-flops as \"taps\" of the LFSR. This allows the BIST system to optimise storage, since set-reset flip-flops can save the initial seed to generate the whole stream of bits from the LFSR. Nevertheless, this requires changes in the architecture of BIST, is an option for specific applications.\n\n\n*** Uses in digital broadcasting and communications ***\n\n\n**** Scrambling ****\n\nTo prevent short repeating sequences (e.g., runs of 0s or 1s) from forming spectral lines that may complicate symbol tracking at the\nreceiver or interfere with other transmissions, the data bit sequence is combined with the output of a linear-feedback register before modulation and transmission. This scrambling is removed at the receiver after demodulation. When the LFSR runs at the same bit rate as the transmitted symbol stream, this technique is referred to as scrambling. When the LFSR runs considerably faster than the symbol stream, the LFSR-generated bit sequence is called chipping code. The chipping code is combined with the data using exclusive or before transmitting using binary phase-shift keying or a similar modulation method. The resulting signal has a higher bandwidth than the data, and therefore this is a method of spread-spectrum communication. When used only for the spread-spectrum property, this technique is called direct-sequence spread spectrum; when used to distinguish several signals transmitted in the same channel at the same time and frequency, it is called code-division multiple access.\nNeither scheme should be confused with encryption or encipherment; scrambling and spreading with LFSRs do not protect the information from eavesdropping. They are instead used to produce equivalent streams that possess convenient engineering properties to allow robust and efficient modulation and demodulation.\nDigital broadcasting systems that use linear-feedback registers:\n\nATSC Standards (digital TV transmission system \u2013 North America)\nDAB (Digital Audio Broadcasting system \u2013 for radio)\nDVB-T (digital TV transmission system \u2013 Europe, Australia, parts of Asia)\nNICAM (digital audio system for television)Other digital communications systems using LFSRs:\n\nINTELSAT business service (IBS)\nIntermediate data rate (IDR)\nHDMI 2.0\nSDI (Serial Digital Interface transmission)\nData transfer over PSTN (according to the ITU-T V-series recommendations)\nCDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) cellular telephony\n100BASE-T2 \"fast\" Ethernet scrambles bits using an LFSR\n1000BASE-T Ethernet, the most common form of Gigabit Ethernet, scrambles bits using an LFSR\nPCI Express\nSATA\nSerial Attached SCSI (SAS/SPL)\nUSB 3.0\nIEEE 802.11a scrambles bits using an LFSR\nBluetooth Low Energy Link Layer is making use of LFSR (referred to as whitening)\nSatellite navigation systems such as GPS and GLONASS. All current systems use LFSR outputs to generate some or all of their ranging codes (as the chipping code for CDMA or DSSS) or to modulate the carrier without data (like GPS L2 CL ranging code). GLONASS also uses frequency-division multiple access combined with DSSS.\n\n\n**** Other uses ****\nLFSRs are also used in radio jamming systems to generate pseudo-random noise to raise the noise floor of a target communication system.\nThe German time signal DCF77, in addition to amplitude keying, employs phase-shift keying driven by a 9-stage LFSR to increase the accuracy of received time and the robustness of the data stream in the presence of noise."

    "instruction": "Vault 7\n\n==Introduction==\nVault 7 is a series of documents that WikiLeaks began to publish on 7 March 2017, detailing the activities and capabilities of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare. The files, dating from 2013 to 2016, include details on the agency's software capabilities, such as the ability to compromise cars, smart TVs, web browsers (including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera), and the operating systems of most smartphones (including Apple's iOS and Google's Android), as well as other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. A CIA internal audit identified 91 malware tools out of more than 500 tools in use in 2016 being compromised by the release. The tools were developed by the Operations Support Branch of the C.I.A.The release of Vault 7 led the CIA to redefine WikiLeaks as a \u201cnon-state hostile intelligence service.\u201d In July 2022 former CIA software engineer Joshua Schulte was convicted of leaking the documents to WikiLeaks.\n\n== Publications ==\n\n\n*** Part 1 \u2013 \"Year Zero\" ***\nThe first batch of documents named \"Year Zero\" was published by WikiLeaks on 7 March 2017, consisting of 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments, purportedly from the Center for Cyber Intelligence, which contained more pages than former NSA contractor and leaker, Edward Snowden's NSA release at the time. WikiLeaks had released Year Zero online in a locked archive earlier that week, and revealing the passphrase on the 7th. The passphrase referred to a President Kennedy quote that he wanted \u201cto splinter the CIA in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds\u201d.WikiLeaks did not name the source, but said that the files had \"circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.\" According to WikiLeaks, the source \"wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons\" since these tools raise questions that \"urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the C.I.A.'s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency.\"WikiLeaks attempted to redact names and other identifying information from the documents before their release, but faced criticism for leaving some key details unredacted. WikiLeaks also attempted to allow for connections between people to be drawn via unique identifiers generated by WikiLeaks. It also said that it would postpone releasing the source code for the cyber weapons, which is reportedly several hundred million lines long, \"until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the C.I.A.'s program and how such 'weapons' should be analyzed, disarmed and published.\" WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange claimed this was only part of a larger series.The CIA released a statement saying, \"The American public should be deeply troubled by any WikiLeaks disclosure designed to damage the Intelligence Community's ability to protect America against terrorists or other adversaries. Such disclosures not only jeopardize US personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm.\"In a statement issued on 19 March 2017, Assange said the technology companies who had been contacted had not agreed to, disagreed with, or questioned what he termed as WikiLeaks' standard industry disclosure plan. The standard disclosure time for a vulnerability is 90 days after the company responsible for patching the software is given full details of the flaw. According to WikiLeaks, only Mozilla had been provided with information on the vulnerabilities, while \"Google and some other companies\" only confirmed receiving the initial notification. WikiLeaks stated: \"Most of these lagging companies have conflicts of interest due to their classified work with US government agencies. In practice such associations limit industry staff with US security clearances from fixing holes based on leaked information from the CIA. Should such companies choose to not secure their users against CIA or NSA attacks users may prefer organizations such as Mozilla or European companies that prioritize their users over government contracts\".\n\n\n*** Part 2 \u2013 \"Dark Matter\" ***\nOn 23 March 2017 WikiLeaks published the second release of Vault 7 material, entitled \"Dark Matter\". The publication included documentation for several CIA efforts to hack Apple's iPhones and Macs. These included the Sonic Screwdriver malware that could use the Thunderbolt interface to bypass Apple's password firmware protection.\n\n\n*** Part 3 \u2013 \"Marble\" ***\nOn 31 March 2017, WikiLeaks published the third part of its Vault 7 documents, entitled \"Marble\". It contained 676 source code files for the CIA's Marble Framework. It is used to obfuscate, or scramble, malware code in an attempt to make it so that anti-virus firms or investigators cannot understand the code or attribute its source. According to WikiLeaks, the code also included a de-obfuscator to reverse the obfuscation effects.\n\n\n*** Part 4 \u2013 \"Grasshopper\" ***\nOn 7 April 2017, WikiLeaks published the fourth set of its Vault 7 documents, dubbed \"Grasshopper\". The publication contains 27 documents from the CIA's Grasshopper framework, which is used by the CIA to build customized and persistent malware payloads for the Microsoft Windows operating systems. Grasshopper focused on Personal Security Product (PSP) avoidance. PSPs are antivirus software such as MS Security Essentials, Symantec Endpoint or Kaspersky IS.\n\n\n*** Part 5 \u2013 \"HIVE\" ***\nOn 14 April 2017, WikiLeaks published the fifth part of its Vault 7 documents, titled \"HIVE\". Based on the CIA top-secret virus program created by its \"Embedded Development Branch\" (EDB). The six documents published by WikiLeaks are related to the HIVE multi-platform CIA malware suite. A CIA back-end infrastructure with a public-facing HTTPS interface used by CIA to transfer information from target desktop computers and smartphones to the CIA, and open those devices to receive further commands from CIA operators to execute specific tasks, all the while hiding its presence behind unsuspicious-looking public domains through a masking interface known as \"Switchblade\" (also known as Listening Post (LP) and Command and Control (C2)).\n\n\n*** Part 6 \u2013 \"Weeping Angel\" ***\nOn 21 April 2017, WikiLeaks published the sixth part of its Vault 7 material, code-named \"Weeping Angel\", a hacking tool co-developed by the CIA and MI5 used to exploit a series of early smart TVs for the purpose of covert intelligence gathering. Once installed in suitable televisions with a USB stick, the hacking tool enables those televisions' built-in microphones and possibly video cameras to record their surroundings, while the televisions falsely appear to be turned off. The recorded data is then either stored locally into the television's memory or sent over the internet to the CIA. Allegedly both the CIA and MI5 agencies collaborated to develop that malware in Joint Development Workshops. Security expert Sarah Zatko said about the data \"nothing in this suggests it would be used for mass surveillance,\" and Consumer Reports said that only some of the earliest smart TVs with built-in microphones and cameras were effected.As of this part 6 publication, \"Weeping Angel\" is the second major CIA hacking tool which notably references the British television show, Doctor Who, alongside \"Sonic Screwdriver\" in \"Dark Matter\".\n\n\n*** Part 7 \u2013 \"Scribbles\" ***\nOn 28 April 2017, WikiLeaks published the seventh part of its Vault 7 materials, dubbed \"Scribbles\". The leak includes documentation and source code of a tool intended to track documents leaked to whistleblowers and journalists by embedding web beacon tags into classified documents to trace who leaked them. The tool affects Microsoft Office documents, specifically \"Microsoft Office 2013 (on Windows 8.1 x64), documents from Office versions 97-2016 (Office 95 documents will not work) and documents that are not locked, encrypted, or password-protected\". When a CIA watermarked document is opened, an invisible image within the document that is hosted on the agency's server is loaded, generating a HTTP request. The request is then logged on the server, giving the intelligence agency information about who is opening it and where it is being opened. However, if a watermarked document is opened in an alternative word processor the image may be visible to the viewer. The documentation also states that if the document is viewed offline or in protected view, the watermarked image will not be able to contact its home server. This is overridden only when a user enables editing.\n\n\n*** Part 8 \u2013 \"Archimedes\" ***\nOn 5 May 2017, WikiLeaks published the eighth part of its Vault 7 documents, titled \"Archimedes\". According to U.S. SANS Institute instructor Jake Williams, who analyzed the published documents, Archimedes is a virus previously codenamed \"Fulcrum\". According to cyber security expert and ENISA member Pierluigi Paganini, the CIA operators use Archimedes to redirect local area network (LAN) web browser sessions from a targeted computer through a computer controlled by the CIA before the sessions are routed to the users. This type of attack is known as man-in-the-middle (MitM). With their publication WikiLeaks included a number of hashes that they claim can be used to potentially identify the Archimedes virus and guard against it in the future. Paganini stated that potential targeted computers can search for those hashes on their systems to check if their systems had been attacked by the CIA.\n\n\n*** Part 9 \u2013 \"AfterMidnight\" and \"Assassin\" ***\nOn 12 May 2017, WikiLeaks published part nine of its Vault 7 materials, \"AfterMidnight\" and \"Assassin\". AfterMidnight is a malware installed on a target personal computer and disguises as a DLL file, which is executed while the user's computer reboots. It then triggers a connection to the CIA's Command and Control (C2) computer, from which it downloads various modules to run. As for Assassin, it is very similar to its AfterMidnight counterpart, but deceptively runs inside a Windows service process. CIA operators reportedly use Assassin as a C2 to execute a series of tasks, collect, and then periodically send user data to the CIA Listening Post(s) (LP). Similar to backdoor Trojan behavior. Both AfterMidnight and Assassin run on Windows operating system, are persistent, and periodically beacon to their configured LP to either request tasks or send private information to the CIA, as well as automatically uninstall themselves on a set date and time.\n\n\n*** Part 10 \u2013 \"Athena\" ***\nOn 19 May 2017, WikiLeaks published the tenth part of its Vault 7 documents, titled \"Athena\". The published user guide, demo, and related documents were created between September 2015 and February 2016. They are all about a malware allegedly developed for the CIA in August 2015, roughly one month after Microsoft released Windows 10 with their firm statements about how difficult it was to compromise. Both the primary \"Athena\" malware and its secondary malware named \"Hera\" are similar in theory to Grasshopper and AfterMidnight malware but with some significant differences. One of those differences is that Athena and Hera were developed by the CIA with a New Hampshire private corporation called Siege Technologies. During a Bloomberg 2014 interview the founder of Siege Technologies confirmed and justified their development of such malware. Athena malware completely hijacks Windows' Remote Access services, while Hera hijacks Windows Dnscache service. Both Athena and Hera also affect all current versions of Windows including, but not limited to, Windows Server 2012 and Windows 10. Another difference is in the types of encryption used between the infected computers and the CIA Listening Posts (LP). As for the similarities, they exploit persistent DLL files to create a backdoor to communicate with CIA's LP, steal private data, then send it to CIA servers, or delete private data on the target computer, as well as Command and Control (C2) for CIA operatives to send additional malicious software to further run specific tasks on the attacked computer. All of the above designed to deceive computer security software. Beside the published detailed documents, WikiLeaks did not provide any evidence suggesting the CIA used Athena or not.\n\n\n*** Part 11 \u2013 \"Pandemic\" ***\nOn 1 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 11 of its Vault 7 materials, \"Pandemic\". This tool serves as a persistent implant affecting Windows machines with shared folders. It functions as a file system filter driver on an infected computer, and listens for Server Message Block traffic while detecting download attempts from other computers on a local network. \"Pandemic\" will answer a download request on behalf of the infected computer. However, it will replace the legitimate file with malware. In order to obfuscate its activities, \"Pandemic\" only modifies or replaces the legitimate file in transit, leaving the original on the server unchanged. The implant allows 20 files to be modified at a time, with a maximum individual file size of 800MB. While not stated in the leaked documentation, it is possible that newly infected computers could themselves become \"Pandemic\" file servers, allowing the implant to reach new targets on a local network.\n\n\n*** Part 12 \u2013 \"Cherry Blossom\" ***\nOn 15 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 12 of its Vault 7 materials, entitled \"Cherry Blossom\". Cherry Blossom used a command and control server called Cherry Tree and custom router firmware called FlyTrap to monitor internet activity of targets, scan for \u201cemail addresses, chat usernames, MAC addresses and VoIP numbers\" and redirect traffic.\n\n\n*** Part 13 \u2013 \"Brutal Kangaroo\" ***\nOn 22 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 13 of its Vault 7 materials, the manuals for \"Brutal Kangaroo\". Brutal Kangaroo was a project focused on CIA malware designed to compromise air-gapped computer networks with infected USB drives. Brutal Kangaroo included the tools Drifting Deadline, the main tool, Shattered Assurance, a server that automates thumb drive infection, Shadow, a tool to coordinate compromised machines, and Broken Promise, a tool for exfiltrating data from the air-gapped networks.\n\n\n*** Part 14 \u2013 \"Elsa\" ***\nOn 28 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 14 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project entitled \"Elsa\". Elsa was a tool used for tracking Windows devices on nearby WiFi networks.\n\n\n*** Part 15 \u2013 \"OutlawCountry\" ***\nOn 29 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 15 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project entitled \"OutlawCountry\". OutlawCountry was a kernel module for Linux 2.6 that let CIA agents spy on Linux servers and redirect outgoing traffic from a Linux computer to a chosen site.\n\n\n*** Part 16 \u2013 \"BothanSpy\" ***\nOn 6 July 2017, WikiLeaks published part 16 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project entitled \"BothanSpy\". BothanSpy was a CIA hacking tool made to steal SSH credentials from Windows computers.\n\n\n*** Part 17 \u2013 \"Highrise\" ***\nOn 13 July 2017, WikiLeaks published part 17 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project entitled \"Highrise\". The Highrise hacking tool, also known as Tidecheck, was used to intercept and redirect SMS messages to Android phones using versions 4.0 through 4.3. Highrise could also be used as an encrypted communications channel between CIA agents and supervisors.\n\n\n*** Part 18 \u2013 \"UCL / Raytheon\" ***\nOn 19 July 2017, WikiLeaks published part 18 of the Vault 7 materials, documents from Raytheon Blackbird Technologies for the \"UMBRAGE Component Library\" (UCL) project reports on malware and their attack vectors. According to WikiLeaks, it analysed malware attacks in the wild and gave \"recommendations to the CIA development teams for further investigation and PoC development for their own malware projects.\" It mostly contained Proof-of-Concept ideas partly based on public documents.\n\n\n*** Part 19 \u2013 \"Imperial\" ***\nOn 27 July 2017, WikiLeaks published part 19 of its Vault 7 materials, manuals for the project entitled \"Imperial\". Imperial included three tools named Achilles, Aeris and SeaPea. Achilles was a tool for turning MacOS DMG install files into trojan malware. Aeris was a malware implant for POSIX systems, and SeaPea was an OS X rootkit.\n\n\n*** Part 20 \u2013 \"Dumbo\" ***\nOn 3 August 2017, WikiLeaks published part 20 of its Vault 7 materials, manuals for the project entitled \"Dumbo\". Dumbo was a tool that the Agency used to disable webcams, microphones, and other surveillance tools over WiFi and bluetooth to allow field agents to perform their missions.\n\n\n*** Part 21 \u2013 \"CouchPotato\" ***\nOn 10 August 2017, WikiLeaks published part 21 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project CouchPotato. CouchPotato was a tool for intercepting and saving remote video streams, which let the CIA tap into other people's surveillance systems.\n\n\n*** Part 22 \u2013 \"ExpressLane\" ***\nOn 24 August 2017, WikiLeaks published part 22 of its Vault 7 materials from the CIA's \"ExpressLane\" project. These documents highlighted one of the cyber operations the CIA conducts against other services it liaises with, including the National Security Agency (NSA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\nExpressLane, a covert information collection tool, was used by the CIA to exfiltrate the biometric data collection systems of services it liaises with. ExpressLane was installed and run under the cover of upgrading the biometric software of liaison services by the CIA's Office of Technical Services (OTS) agents without their knowledge.\n\n\n*** Part 23 \u2013 \"Angelfire\" ***\nOn 31 August 2017, WikiLeaks published part 23 of the Vault 7 documents, the manual for the project Angelfire. Angelfire was a malware framework made to infect computers running Windows XP and Windows 7, made of five parts. Solartime was the malware that modified the boot sector to load Wolfcreek, which was a self-loading driver that loaded other drivers. Keystone was responsible for loading other malware. BadMFS was a covert file system that hid the malware, and Windows Transitory File System was a newer alternative to BadMFS. The manual included a long list of problems with the tools.\n\n\n*** Part 24 \u2013 \"Protego\" ***\nProtego, part 24 of the Vault 7 documents, was published on 7 September 2017. According to WikiLeaks, Protego \"is a PIC-based missile control system that was developed by Raytheon.\"\n\n== Vault 8 ==\nOn 9 November, 2017, WikiLeaks began publishing Vault 8, which it described as \"source code and analysis for CIA software projects including those described in the Vault7 series.\" The stated intention of the Vault 8 publication was to \"enable investigative journalists, forensic experts and the general public to better identify and understand covert CIA infrastructure components.\" The only Vault 8 release has been the source code and development logs for Hive, a covert communications platform for CIA malware. WikiLeaks published the Hive documentation as part of Vault 7 on 14 April 2017.\nIn October 2021, a new backdoor based on the Hive source code was discovered being used \"to collect sensitive information and provide a foothold for subsequent intrusions.\" Researchers called it xdr33 and released a report on it in January 2022. The malware targets an unspecified F5 appliance and allowed hackers to upload and download files. It also allowed network traffic spying and execute commands on the appliance.\n\n== Organization of cyber warfare ==\nWikiLeaks said that the documents came from \"an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI) in Langley, Virginia.\" The documents allowed WikiLeaks to partially determine the structure and organization of the CCI. The CCI reportedly has an entire unit devoted to compromising Apple products.The cybersecurity firm Symantec analyzed Vault 7 documents and found some of the described software closely matched cyberattacks by \"Longhorn,\" which it had monitored since 2014. Symantec had previously suspected that \"Longhorn\" was government-sponsored and had tracked its usage against 40 targets in 16 countries.\n\n\n*** Frankfurt base ***\nThe first portion of the documents made public on 7 March 2017, Vault 7 \"Year Zero\", revealed that a top secret CIA unit used the German city of Frankfurt as the starting point for hacking attacks on Europe, China and the Middle East. According to the documents, the U.S. government uses its Consulate General Office in Frankfurt as a hacker base for cyber operations. WikiLeaks documents reveal the Frankfurt hackers, part of the Center for Cyber Intelligence Europe (CCIE), were given cover identities and diplomatic passports to obfuscate customs officers to gain entry to Germany.The chief Public Prosecutor General of the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe Peter Frank announced on 8 March 2017 that the government was conducting a preliminary investigation to see if it will launch a major probe into the activities being conducted out of the consulate and also more broadly whether people in Germany were being attacked by the CIA. Germany's foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel from the Social Democratic Party responded to the documents of Vault 7 \"Year Zero\" that the CIA used Frankfurt as a base for its digital espionage operations, saying that Germany did not have any information about the cyber attacks.\n\n== UMBRAGE ==\nThe documents reportedly revealed that the agency had amassed a large collection of cyberattack techniques and malware produced by other hackers. This library was reportedly maintained by the CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group, with examples of using these techniques and source code contained in the \"Umbrage Component Library\" git repository. According to WikiLeaks, by recycling the techniques of third-parties through UMBRAGE, the CIA can not only increase its total number of attacks, but can also mislead forensic investigators by disguising these attacks as the work of other groups and nations. Among the techniques borrowed by UMBRAGE was the file wiping implementation used by Shamoon. According to PC World, some of the techniques and code snippets have been used by CIA in its internal projects, whose end result cannot be inferred from the leaks. PC World commented that the practice of planting \"false flags\" to deter attribution was not a new development in cyberattacks: Russian, North Korean and Israeli hacker groups are among those suspected of using false flags.According to a study by Kim Zetter in The Intercept, UMBRAGE was probably much more focused on speeding up development by repurposing existing tools, rather than on planting false flags. Robert Graham, CEO of Errata Security told The Intercept that the source code referenced in the UMBRAGE documents is \"extremely public\", and is likely used by a multitude of groups and state actors. Graham added: \"What we can conclusively say from the evidence in the documents is that they're creating snippets of code for use in other projects and they're reusing methods in code that they find on the internet. ... Elsewhere they talk about obscuring attacks so you can't see where it's coming from, but there's no concrete plan to do a false flag operation. They're not trying to say 'We're going to make this look like Russia'.\"\n\n\n*** False flag conspiracy theories ***\nOn the day the Vault 7 documents were first released, WikiLeaks described UMBRAGE as \"a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation,\" and tweeted, \"CIA steals other groups virus and malware facilitating false flag attacks.\" A conspiracy theory soon emerged alleging that the CIA framed the Russian government for interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections. Conservative commentators such as Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter speculated about this possibility on Twitter, and Rush Limbaugh discussed it on his radio show. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said that Vault 7 showed that \"the CIA could get access to such 'fingerprints' and then use them.\"Cybersecurity writers and experts, such as Ben Buchanan and Kevin Poulsen, were skeptical of those theories. Poulsen said the theories were \"disinformation\" being taken advantage of by Russia and spread by bots. He also wrote, \"The leaked catalog isn't organized by country of origin, and the specific malware used by the Russian DNC hackers is nowhere on the list.\" Robert M. Lee, who founded the cybersecurity firm Dragos, said the \"narrative emerged far too quickly to have been organic.\"\n\n== Marble framework ==\nThe documents describe the Marble framework, a string obfuscator used to hide text fragments in malware from visual inspection. Some outlets reported that foreign languages were used to cover up the source of CIA hacks, but technical analysis refuted the idea. According to WikiLeaks, it reached 1.0 in 2015 and was used by the CIA throughout 2016.In its release, WikiLeaks said \"Marble\" was used to insert foreign language text into the malware to mask viruses, trojans and hacking attacks, making it more difficult for them to be tracked to the CIA and to cause forensic investigators to falsely attribute code to the wrong nation. The source code revealed that Marble had examples in Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and Persian.Analysts called WikiLeaks' description of Marble's main purpose inaccurate, telling The Hill its main purpose was probably to avoid detection by antivirus programs.Marble also contained a deobfuscator tool with which the CIA could reverse text obfuscation.Security researcher Nicholas Weaver from International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley told the Washington Post: \"This appears to be one of the most technically damaging leaks ever done by WikiLeaks, as it seems designed to directly disrupt ongoing CIA operations.\"\n\n== Compromised technology and software ==\n\n\n*** CDs/DVDs ***\nHammerDrill is a CD/DVD collection tool that collects directory walks and files to a configured directory and filename pattern as well as logging CD/DVD insertion and removal events. v2.0 adds a gap jumping capability that injects a trojan into 32-bit executables as they are being burned to disc by Nero. Additionally, v2.0 adds a status, termination and an on-demand collection feature controlled by HammerDrillStatus.dll, HammerDrillKiller.dll and HammerDrillCollector.dll. The logging now also fingerprints discs by hashing the first two blocks of the ISO image, which enables unique identification of multi-sessions discs even as data is added and removed. The log also logs anytime a HammerDrill trojaned binary is seen on a disc.\n\n\n*** Apple products ***\nAfter WikiLeaks released the first installment of Vault 7, \"Year Zero\", Apple stated that \"many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS,\" and that the company will \"continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities.\"On 23 March 2017, WikiLeaks released \"Dark Matter\", the second batch of documents in its Vault 7 series, detailing the hacking techniques and tools all focusing on Apple products developed by the Embedded Development Branch (EDB) of the CIA. The leak also revealed the CIA had been targeting the iPhone since 2008, a year after the device was released. These EDB projects attacked Apple's firmware, meaning that the attack code would persist even if the device was rebooted. The \"Dark Matter\" archive included documents from 2009 and 2013. Apple issued a second statement assuring that based on an \"initial analysis, the alleged iPhone vulnerability affected iPhone 3G only and was fixed in 2009 when iPhone 3GS was released.\" Additionally, a preliminary assessment showed \"the alleged Mac vulnerabilities were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013\".\n\n\n*** Cisco ***\nWikiLeaks said on 19 March 2017 on Twitter that the \"CIA was secretly exploiting\" a vulnerability in a huge range of Cisco router models discovered thanks to the Vault 7 documents. The CIA had learned more than a year ago how to exploit flaws in Cisco's widely used internet switches, which direct electronic traffic, to enable eavesdropping. Cisco quickly reassigned staff from other projects to turn their focus solely on analyzing the attack and to figure out how the CIA hacking worked, so they could help customers patch their systems and prevent criminal hackers or spies from using similar methods.On 20 March, Cisco researchers confirmed that their study of the Vault 7 documents showed the CIA had developed malware which could exploit a flaw found in 318 of Cisco's switch models and alter or take control of the network.Cisco issued a warning on security risks, patches were not available, but Cisco provided mitigation advice.\n\n\n*** Smartphones/tablets ***\nThe electronic tools can reportedly compromise both Apple's iOS and Google's Android operating systems. By adding malware to the Android operating system, the tools could gain access to secure communications made on a device.\n\n\n**** Messaging services ****\nAccording to WikiLeaks, once an Android smartphone is penetrated the agency can collect \"audio and message traffic before encryption is applied\". Some of the agency's software is reportedly able to gain access to messages sent by instant messaging services. This method of accessing messages differs from obtaining access by decrypting an already encrypted message. While the encryption of messengers that offer end-to-end encryption, such as Telegram, WhatsApp and Signal, wasn't reported to be cracked, their encryption can be bypassed by capturing input before their encryption is applied, by methods such as keylogging and recording the touch input from the user. Commentators, among them Snowden and cryptographer and security pundit Bruce Schneier, observed that Wikileaks incorrectly implied that the messaging apps themselves, and their underlying encryption, had been compromised - an implication which was in turn reported for a period by the New York Times and other mainstream outlets.\n\n\n*** Vehicle control systems ***\n\nOne document reportedly showed that the CIA was researching ways to infect vehicle control systems. WikiLeaks stated, \"The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations.\" This statement brought renewed attention to conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Michael Hastings.\n\n\n*** Windows ***\nThe documents refer to a \"Windows FAX DLL injection\" exploit in Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 operating systems. This would allow a user with malicious intents to hide its own malware under the DLL of another application. However, a computer must have already been compromised through another method for the injection to take place.\n\n== Commentary ==\nOn 7 March 2017, Edward Snowden commented on the importance of the release, stating that it reveals the United States Government to be \"developing vulnerabilities in US products\" and \"then intentionally keeping the holes open\", which he considers highly reckless.On 7 March 2017, Nathan White, Senior Legislative Manager at the Internet advocacy group Access Now, writes:\nToday, our digital security has been compromised because the CIA has been stockpiling vulnerabilities rather than working with companies to patch them. The United States is supposed to have a process that helps secure our digital devices and services \u2014 the 'Vulnerabilities Equities Process.' Many of these vulnerabilities could have been responsibly disclosed and patched. This leak proves the inherent digital risk of stockpiling vulnerabilities rather than fixing them.\nOn 8 March 2017, Lee Mathews, a contributor to Forbes, wrote that most of the hacking techniques described in Vault 7 were already known to many cybersecurity experts.On 8 March 2017, some note that the revealed techniques and tools are most likely to be used for more targeted surveillance revealed by Edward Snowden.On 8 April 2017, Ashley Gorski, an American Civil Liberties Union staff attorney called it \"critical\" to understand that \"these vulnerabilities can be exploited not just by our government but by foreign governments and cyber criminals around the world.\" Justin Cappos, professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at New York University asks \"if the government knows of a problem in your phone that bad guys could use to hack your phone and have the ability to spy on you, is that a weakness that they themselves should use for counterterrorism, or for their own spying capabilities, or is it a problem they should fix for everyone?\".On 8 April 2017, Cindy Cohn, executive director of the San Francisco-based international nonprofit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, said: \"If the C.I.A. was walking past your front door and saw that your lock was broken, they should at least tell you and maybe even help you get it fixed.\" \"And worse, they then lost track of the information they had kept from you so that now criminals and hostile foreign governments know about your broken lock.\" Furthermore, she stated that the CIA had \"failed to accurately assess the risk of not disclosing vulnerabilities. Even spy agencies like the CIA have a responsibility to protect the security and privacy of Americans.\" \"The freedom to have a private conversation \u2013 free from the worry that a hostile government, a rogue government agent or a competitor or a criminal are listening \u2013 is central to a free society\". While not as strict as privacy laws in Europe, the Fourth Amendment to the US constitution does guarantee the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.On 12 May 2017 Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith wrote \"This is an emerging pattern in 2017. We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks,\" In other words, Smith expressed concern about the fact that the CIA have stockpiled such computer vulnerabilities, which in turn were stolen from them, as a result the privacy and security of their customers around the world were potentially negatively affected for an extended period.\n\nQ: What is the significance of the \"Cherry Blossom\" project as described in the Vault 7 documents?",

      "context": "Vault 7\n\n==Introduction==\nVault 7 is a series of documents that WikiLeaks began to publish on 7 March 2017, detailing the activities and capabilities of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare. The files, dating from 2013 to 2016, include details on the agency's software capabilities, such as the ability to compromise cars, smart TVs, web browsers (including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera), and the operating systems of most smartphones (including Apple's iOS and Google's Android), as well as other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. A CIA internal audit identified 91 malware tools out of more than 500 tools in use in 2016 being compromised by the release. The tools were developed by the Operations Support Branch of the C.I.A.The release of Vault 7 led the CIA to redefine WikiLeaks as a \u201cnon-state hostile intelligence service.\u201d In July 2022 former CIA software engineer Joshua Schulte was convicted of leaking the documents to WikiLeaks.\n\n== Publications ==\n\n\n*** Part 1 \u2013 \"Year Zero\" ***\nThe first batch of documents named \"Year Zero\" was published by WikiLeaks on 7 March 2017, consisting of 7,818 web pages with 943 attachments, purportedly from the Center for Cyber Intelligence, which contained more pages than former NSA contractor and leaker, Edward Snowden's NSA release at the time. WikiLeaks had released Year Zero online in a locked archive earlier that week, and revealing the passphrase on the 7th. The passphrase referred to a President Kennedy quote that he wanted \u201cto splinter the CIA in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds\u201d.WikiLeaks did not name the source, but said that the files had \"circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.\" According to WikiLeaks, the source \"wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons\" since these tools raise questions that \"urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the C.I.A.'s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency.\"WikiLeaks attempted to redact names and other identifying information from the documents before their release, but faced criticism for leaving some key details unredacted. WikiLeaks also attempted to allow for connections between people to be drawn via unique identifiers generated by WikiLeaks. It also said that it would postpone releasing the source code for the cyber weapons, which is reportedly several hundred million lines long, \"until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the C.I.A.'s program and how such 'weapons' should be analyzed, disarmed and published.\" WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange claimed this was only part of a larger series.The CIA released a statement saying, \"The American public should be deeply troubled by any WikiLeaks disclosure designed to damage the Intelligence Community's ability to protect America against terrorists or other adversaries. Such disclosures not only jeopardize US personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm.\"In a statement issued on 19 March 2017, Assange said the technology companies who had been contacted had not agreed to, disagreed with, or questioned what he termed as WikiLeaks' standard industry disclosure plan. The standard disclosure time for a vulnerability is 90 days after the company responsible for patching the software is given full details of the flaw. According to WikiLeaks, only Mozilla had been provided with information on the vulnerabilities, while \"Google and some other companies\" only confirmed receiving the initial notification. WikiLeaks stated: \"Most of these lagging companies have conflicts of interest due to their classified work with US government agencies. In practice such associations limit industry staff with US security clearances from fixing holes based on leaked information from the CIA. Should such companies choose to not secure their users against CIA or NSA attacks users may prefer organizations such as Mozilla or European companies that prioritize their users over government contracts\".\n\n\n*** Part 2 \u2013 \"Dark Matter\" ***\nOn 23 March 2017 WikiLeaks published the second release of Vault 7 material, entitled \"Dark Matter\". The publication included documentation for several CIA efforts to hack Apple's iPhones and Macs. These included the Sonic Screwdriver malware that could use the Thunderbolt interface to bypass Apple's password firmware protection.\n\n\n*** Part 3 \u2013 \"Marble\" ***\nOn 31 March 2017, WikiLeaks published the third part of its Vault 7 documents, entitled \"Marble\". It contained 676 source code files for the CIA's Marble Framework. It is used to obfuscate, or scramble, malware code in an attempt to make it so that anti-virus firms or investigators cannot understand the code or attribute its source. According to WikiLeaks, the code also included a de-obfuscator to reverse the obfuscation effects.\n\n\n*** Part 4 \u2013 \"Grasshopper\" ***\nOn 7 April 2017, WikiLeaks published the fourth set of its Vault 7 documents, dubbed \"Grasshopper\". The publication contains 27 documents from the CIA's Grasshopper framework, which is used by the CIA to build customized and persistent malware payloads for the Microsoft Windows operating systems. Grasshopper focused on Personal Security Product (PSP) avoidance. PSPs are antivirus software such as MS Security Essentials, Symantec Endpoint or Kaspersky IS.\n\n\n*** Part 5 \u2013 \"HIVE\" ***\nOn 14 April 2017, WikiLeaks published the fifth part of its Vault 7 documents, titled \"HIVE\". Based on the CIA top-secret virus program created by its \"Embedded Development Branch\" (EDB). The six documents published by WikiLeaks are related to the HIVE multi-platform CIA malware suite. A CIA back-end infrastructure with a public-facing HTTPS interface used by CIA to transfer information from target desktop computers and smartphones to the CIA, and open those devices to receive further commands from CIA operators to execute specific tasks, all the while hiding its presence behind unsuspicious-looking public domains through a masking interface known as \"Switchblade\" (also known as Listening Post (LP) and Command and Control (C2)).\n\n\n*** Part 6 \u2013 \"Weeping Angel\" ***\nOn 21 April 2017, WikiLeaks published the sixth part of its Vault 7 material, code-named \"Weeping Angel\", a hacking tool co-developed by the CIA and MI5 used to exploit a series of early smart TVs for the purpose of covert intelligence gathering. Once installed in suitable televisions with a USB stick, the hacking tool enables those televisions' built-in microphones and possibly video cameras to record their surroundings, while the televisions falsely appear to be turned off. The recorded data is then either stored locally into the television's memory or sent over the internet to the CIA. Allegedly both the CIA and MI5 agencies collaborated to develop that malware in Joint Development Workshops. Security expert Sarah Zatko said about the data \"nothing in this suggests it would be used for mass surveillance,\" and Consumer Reports said that only some of the earliest smart TVs with built-in microphones and cameras were effected.As of this part 6 publication, \"Weeping Angel\" is the second major CIA hacking tool which notably references the British television show, Doctor Who, alongside \"Sonic Screwdriver\" in \"Dark Matter\".\n\n\n*** Part 7 \u2013 \"Scribbles\" ***\nOn 28 April 2017, WikiLeaks published the seventh part of its Vault 7 materials, dubbed \"Scribbles\". The leak includes documentation and source code of a tool intended to track documents leaked to whistleblowers and journalists by embedding web beacon tags into classified documents to trace who leaked them. The tool affects Microsoft Office documents, specifically \"Microsoft Office 2013 (on Windows 8.1 x64), documents from Office versions 97-2016 (Office 95 documents will not work) and documents that are not locked, encrypted, or password-protected\". When a CIA watermarked document is opened, an invisible image within the document that is hosted on the agency's server is loaded, generating a HTTP request. The request is then logged on the server, giving the intelligence agency information about who is opening it and where it is being opened. However, if a watermarked document is opened in an alternative word processor the image may be visible to the viewer. The documentation also states that if the document is viewed offline or in protected view, the watermarked image will not be able to contact its home server. This is overridden only when a user enables editing.\n\n\n*** Part 8 \u2013 \"Archimedes\" ***\nOn 5 May 2017, WikiLeaks published the eighth part of its Vault 7 documents, titled \"Archimedes\". According to U.S. SANS Institute instructor Jake Williams, who analyzed the published documents, Archimedes is a virus previously codenamed \"Fulcrum\". According to cyber security expert and ENISA member Pierluigi Paganini, the CIA operators use Archimedes to redirect local area network (LAN) web browser sessions from a targeted computer through a computer controlled by the CIA before the sessions are routed to the users. This type of attack is known as man-in-the-middle (MitM). With their publication WikiLeaks included a number of hashes that they claim can be used to potentially identify the Archimedes virus and guard against it in the future. Paganini stated that potential targeted computers can search for those hashes on their systems to check if their systems had been attacked by the CIA.\n\n\n*** Part 9 \u2013 \"AfterMidnight\" and \"Assassin\" ***\nOn 12 May 2017, WikiLeaks published part nine of its Vault 7 materials, \"AfterMidnight\" and \"Assassin\". AfterMidnight is a malware installed on a target personal computer and disguises as a DLL file, which is executed while the user's computer reboots. It then triggers a connection to the CIA's Command and Control (C2) computer, from which it downloads various modules to run. As for Assassin, it is very similar to its AfterMidnight counterpart, but deceptively runs inside a Windows service process. CIA operators reportedly use Assassin as a C2 to execute a series of tasks, collect, and then periodically send user data to the CIA Listening Post(s) (LP). Similar to backdoor Trojan behavior. Both AfterMidnight and Assassin run on Windows operating system, are persistent, and periodically beacon to their configured LP to either request tasks or send private information to the CIA, as well as automatically uninstall themselves on a set date and time.\n\n\n*** Part 10 \u2013 \"Athena\" ***\nOn 19 May 2017, WikiLeaks published the tenth part of its Vault 7 documents, titled \"Athena\". The published user guide, demo, and related documents were created between September 2015 and February 2016. They are all about a malware allegedly developed for the CIA in August 2015, roughly one month after Microsoft released Windows 10 with their firm statements about how difficult it was to compromise. Both the primary \"Athena\" malware and its secondary malware named \"Hera\" are similar in theory to Grasshopper and AfterMidnight malware but with some significant differences. One of those differences is that Athena and Hera were developed by the CIA with a New Hampshire private corporation called Siege Technologies. During a Bloomberg 2014 interview the founder of Siege Technologies confirmed and justified their development of such malware. Athena malware completely hijacks Windows' Remote Access services, while Hera hijacks Windows Dnscache service. Both Athena and Hera also affect all current versions of Windows including, but not limited to, Windows Server 2012 and Windows 10. Another difference is in the types of encryption used between the infected computers and the CIA Listening Posts (LP). As for the similarities, they exploit persistent DLL files to create a backdoor to communicate with CIA's LP, steal private data, then send it to CIA servers, or delete private data on the target computer, as well as Command and Control (C2) for CIA operatives to send additional malicious software to further run specific tasks on the attacked computer. All of the above designed to deceive computer security software. Beside the published detailed documents, WikiLeaks did not provide any evidence suggesting the CIA used Athena or not.\n\n\n*** Part 11 \u2013 \"Pandemic\" ***\nOn 1 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 11 of its Vault 7 materials, \"Pandemic\". This tool serves as a persistent implant affecting Windows machines with shared folders. It functions as a file system filter driver on an infected computer, and listens for Server Message Block traffic while detecting download attempts from other computers on a local network. \"Pandemic\" will answer a download request on behalf of the infected computer. However, it will replace the legitimate file with malware. In order to obfuscate its activities, \"Pandemic\" only modifies or replaces the legitimate file in transit, leaving the original on the server unchanged. The implant allows 20 files to be modified at a time, with a maximum individual file size of 800MB. While not stated in the leaked documentation, it is possible that newly infected computers could themselves become \"Pandemic\" file servers, allowing the implant to reach new targets on a local network.\n\n\n*** Part 12 \u2013 \"Cherry Blossom\" ***\nOn 15 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 12 of its Vault 7 materials, entitled \"Cherry Blossom\". Cherry Blossom used a command and control server called Cherry Tree and custom router firmware called FlyTrap to monitor internet activity of targets, scan for \u201cemail addresses, chat usernames, MAC addresses and VoIP numbers\" and redirect traffic.\n\n\n*** Part 13 \u2013 \"Brutal Kangaroo\" ***\nOn 22 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 13 of its Vault 7 materials, the manuals for \"Brutal Kangaroo\". Brutal Kangaroo was a project focused on CIA malware designed to compromise air-gapped computer networks with infected USB drives. Brutal Kangaroo included the tools Drifting Deadline, the main tool, Shattered Assurance, a server that automates thumb drive infection, Shadow, a tool to coordinate compromised machines, and Broken Promise, a tool for exfiltrating data from the air-gapped networks.\n\n\n*** Part 14 \u2013 \"Elsa\" ***\nOn 28 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 14 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project entitled \"Elsa\". Elsa was a tool used for tracking Windows devices on nearby WiFi networks.\n\n\n*** Part 15 \u2013 \"OutlawCountry\" ***\nOn 29 June 2017, WikiLeaks published part 15 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project entitled \"OutlawCountry\". OutlawCountry was a kernel module for Linux 2.6 that let CIA agents spy on Linux servers and redirect outgoing traffic from a Linux computer to a chosen site.\n\n\n*** Part 16 \u2013 \"BothanSpy\" ***\nOn 6 July 2017, WikiLeaks published part 16 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project entitled \"BothanSpy\". BothanSpy was a CIA hacking tool made to steal SSH credentials from Windows computers.\n\n\n*** Part 17 \u2013 \"Highrise\" ***\nOn 13 July 2017, WikiLeaks published part 17 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project entitled \"Highrise\". The Highrise hacking tool, also known as Tidecheck, was used to intercept and redirect SMS messages to Android phones using versions 4.0 through 4.3. Highrise could also be used as an encrypted communications channel between CIA agents and supervisors.\n\n\n*** Part 18 \u2013 \"UCL / Raytheon\" ***\nOn 19 July 2017, WikiLeaks published part 18 of the Vault 7 materials, documents from Raytheon Blackbird Technologies for the \"UMBRAGE Component Library\" (UCL) project reports on malware and their attack vectors. According to WikiLeaks, it analysed malware attacks in the wild and gave \"recommendations to the CIA development teams for further investigation and PoC development for their own malware projects.\" It mostly contained Proof-of-Concept ideas partly based on public documents.\n\n\n*** Part 19 \u2013 \"Imperial\" ***\nOn 27 July 2017, WikiLeaks published part 19 of its Vault 7 materials, manuals for the project entitled \"Imperial\". Imperial included three tools named Achilles, Aeris and SeaPea. Achilles was a tool for turning MacOS DMG install files into trojan malware. Aeris was a malware implant for POSIX systems, and SeaPea was an OS X rootkit.\n\n\n*** Part 20 \u2013 \"Dumbo\" ***\nOn 3 August 2017, WikiLeaks published part 20 of its Vault 7 materials, manuals for the project entitled \"Dumbo\". Dumbo was a tool that the Agency used to disable webcams, microphones, and other surveillance tools over WiFi and bluetooth to allow field agents to perform their missions.\n\n\n*** Part 21 \u2013 \"CouchPotato\" ***\nOn 10 August 2017, WikiLeaks published part 21 of its Vault 7 materials, the manual for the project CouchPotato. CouchPotato was a tool for intercepting and saving remote video streams, which let the CIA tap into other people's surveillance systems.\n\n\n*** Part 22 \u2013 \"ExpressLane\" ***\nOn 24 August 2017, WikiLeaks published part 22 of its Vault 7 materials from the CIA's \"ExpressLane\" project. These documents highlighted one of the cyber operations the CIA conducts against other services it liaises with, including the National Security Agency (NSA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\nExpressLane, a covert information collection tool, was used by the CIA to exfiltrate the biometric data collection systems of services it liaises with. ExpressLane was installed and run under the cover of upgrading the biometric software of liaison services by the CIA's Office of Technical Services (OTS) agents without their knowledge.\n\n\n*** Part 23 \u2013 \"Angelfire\" ***\nOn 31 August 2017, WikiLeaks published part 23 of the Vault 7 documents, the manual for the project Angelfire. Angelfire was a malware framework made to infect computers running Windows XP and Windows 7, made of five parts. Solartime was the malware that modified the boot sector to load Wolfcreek, which was a self-loading driver that loaded other drivers. Keystone was responsible for loading other malware. BadMFS was a covert file system that hid the malware, and Windows Transitory File System was a newer alternative to BadMFS. The manual included a long list of problems with the tools.\n\n\n*** Part 24 \u2013 \"Protego\" ***\nProtego, part 24 of the Vault 7 documents, was published on 7 September 2017. According to WikiLeaks, Protego \"is a PIC-based missile control system that was developed by Raytheon.\"\n\n== Vault 8 ==\nOn 9 November, 2017, WikiLeaks began publishing Vault 8, which it described as \"source code and analysis for CIA software projects including those described in the Vault7 series.\" The stated intention of the Vault 8 publication was to \"enable investigative journalists, forensic experts and the general public to better identify and understand covert CIA infrastructure components.\" The only Vault 8 release has been the source code and development logs for Hive, a covert communications platform for CIA malware. WikiLeaks published the Hive documentation as part of Vault 7 on 14 April 2017.\nIn October 2021, a new backdoor based on the Hive source code was discovered being used \"to collect sensitive information and provide a foothold for subsequent intrusions.\" Researchers called it xdr33 and released a report on it in January 2022. The malware targets an unspecified F5 appliance and allowed hackers to upload and download files. It also allowed network traffic spying and execute commands on the appliance.\n\n== Organization of cyber warfare ==\nWikiLeaks said that the documents came from \"an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI) in Langley, Virginia.\" The documents allowed WikiLeaks to partially determine the structure and organization of the CCI. The CCI reportedly has an entire unit devoted to compromising Apple products.The cybersecurity firm Symantec analyzed Vault 7 documents and found some of the described software closely matched cyberattacks by \"Longhorn,\" which it had monitored since 2014. Symantec had previously suspected that \"Longhorn\" was government-sponsored and had tracked its usage against 40 targets in 16 countries.\n\n\n*** Frankfurt base ***\nThe first portion of the documents made public on 7 March 2017, Vault 7 \"Year Zero\", revealed that a top secret CIA unit used the German city of Frankfurt as the starting point for hacking attacks on Europe, China and the Middle East. According to the documents, the U.S. government uses its Consulate General Office in Frankfurt as a hacker base for cyber operations. WikiLeaks documents reveal the Frankfurt hackers, part of the Center for Cyber Intelligence Europe (CCIE), were given cover identities and diplomatic passports to obfuscate customs officers to gain entry to Germany.The chief Public Prosecutor General of the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe Peter Frank announced on 8 March 2017 that the government was conducting a preliminary investigation to see if it will launch a major probe into the activities being conducted out of the consulate and also more broadly whether people in Germany were being attacked by the CIA. Germany's foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel from the Social Democratic Party responded to the documents of Vault 7 \"Year Zero\" that the CIA used Frankfurt as a base for its digital espionage operations, saying that Germany did not have any information about the cyber attacks.\n\n== UMBRAGE ==\nThe documents reportedly revealed that the agency had amassed a large collection of cyberattack techniques and malware produced by other hackers. This library was reportedly maintained by the CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group, with examples of using these techniques and source code contained in the \"Umbrage Component Library\" git repository. According to WikiLeaks, by recycling the techniques of third-parties through UMBRAGE, the CIA can not only increase its total number of attacks, but can also mislead forensic investigators by disguising these attacks as the work of other groups and nations. Among the techniques borrowed by UMBRAGE was the file wiping implementation used by Shamoon. According to PC World, some of the techniques and code snippets have been used by CIA in its internal projects, whose end result cannot be inferred from the leaks. PC World commented that the practice of planting \"false flags\" to deter attribution was not a new development in cyberattacks: Russian, North Korean and Israeli hacker groups are among those suspected of using false flags.According to a study by Kim Zetter in The Intercept, UMBRAGE was probably much more focused on speeding up development by repurposing existing tools, rather than on planting false flags. Robert Graham, CEO of Errata Security told The Intercept that the source code referenced in the UMBRAGE documents is \"extremely public\", and is likely used by a multitude of groups and state actors. Graham added: \"What we can conclusively say from the evidence in the documents is that they're creating snippets of code for use in other projects and they're reusing methods in code that they find on the internet. ... Elsewhere they talk about obscuring attacks so you can't see where it's coming from, but there's no concrete plan to do a false flag operation. They're not trying to say 'We're going to make this look like Russia'.\"\n\n\n*** False flag conspiracy theories ***\nOn the day the Vault 7 documents were first released, WikiLeaks described UMBRAGE as \"a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation,\" and tweeted, \"CIA steals other groups virus and malware facilitating false flag attacks.\" A conspiracy theory soon emerged alleging that the CIA framed the Russian government for interfering in the 2016 U.S. elections. Conservative commentators such as Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter speculated about this possibility on Twitter, and Rush Limbaugh discussed it on his radio show. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said that Vault 7 showed that \"the CIA could get access to such 'fingerprints' and then use them.\"Cybersecurity writers and experts, such as Ben Buchanan and Kevin Poulsen, were skeptical of those theories. Poulsen said the theories were \"disinformation\" being taken advantage of by Russia and spread by bots. He also wrote, \"The leaked catalog isn't organized by country of origin, and the specific malware used by the Russian DNC hackers is nowhere on the list.\" Robert M. Lee, who founded the cybersecurity firm Dragos, said the \"narrative emerged far too quickly to have been organic.\"\n\n== Marble framework ==\nThe documents describe the Marble framework, a string obfuscator used to hide text fragments in malware from visual inspection. Some outlets reported that foreign languages were used to cover up the source of CIA hacks, but technical analysis refuted the idea. According to WikiLeaks, it reached 1.0 in 2015 and was used by the CIA throughout 2016.In its release, WikiLeaks said \"Marble\" was used to insert foreign language text into the malware to mask viruses, trojans and hacking attacks, making it more difficult for them to be tracked to the CIA and to cause forensic investigators to falsely attribute code to the wrong nation. The source code revealed that Marble had examples in Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and Persian.Analysts called WikiLeaks' description of Marble's main purpose inaccurate, telling The Hill its main purpose was probably to avoid detection by antivirus programs.Marble also contained a deobfuscator tool with which the CIA could reverse text obfuscation.Security researcher Nicholas Weaver from International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley told the Washington Post: \"This appears to be one of the most technically damaging leaks ever done by WikiLeaks, as it seems designed to directly disrupt ongoing CIA operations.\"\n\n== Compromised technology and software ==\n\n\n*** CDs/DVDs ***\nHammerDrill is a CD/DVD collection tool that collects directory walks and files to a configured directory and filename pattern as well as logging CD/DVD insertion and removal events. v2.0 adds a gap jumping capability that injects a trojan into 32-bit executables as they are being burned to disc by Nero. Additionally, v2.0 adds a status, termination and an on-demand collection feature controlled by HammerDrillStatus.dll, HammerDrillKiller.dll and HammerDrillCollector.dll. The logging now also fingerprints discs by hashing the first two blocks of the ISO image, which enables unique identification of multi-sessions discs even as data is added and removed. The log also logs anytime a HammerDrill trojaned binary is seen on a disc.\n\n\n*** Apple products ***\nAfter WikiLeaks released the first installment of Vault 7, \"Year Zero\", Apple stated that \"many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS,\" and that the company will \"continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities.\"On 23 March 2017, WikiLeaks released \"Dark Matter\", the second batch of documents in its Vault 7 series, detailing the hacking techniques and tools all focusing on Apple products developed by the Embedded Development Branch (EDB) of the CIA. The leak also revealed the CIA had been targeting the iPhone since 2008, a year after the device was released. These EDB projects attacked Apple's firmware, meaning that the attack code would persist even if the device was rebooted. The \"Dark Matter\" archive included documents from 2009 and 2013. Apple issued a second statement assuring that based on an \"initial analysis, the alleged iPhone vulnerability affected iPhone 3G only and was fixed in 2009 when iPhone 3GS was released.\" Additionally, a preliminary assessment showed \"the alleged Mac vulnerabilities were previously fixed in all Macs launched after 2013\".\n\n\n*** Cisco ***\nWikiLeaks said on 19 March 2017 on Twitter that the \"CIA was secretly exploiting\" a vulnerability in a huge range of Cisco router models discovered thanks to the Vault 7 documents. The CIA had learned more than a year ago how to exploit flaws in Cisco's widely used internet switches, which direct electronic traffic, to enable eavesdropping. Cisco quickly reassigned staff from other projects to turn their focus solely on analyzing the attack and to figure out how the CIA hacking worked, so they could help customers patch their systems and prevent criminal hackers or spies from using similar methods.On 20 March, Cisco researchers confirmed that their study of the Vault 7 documents showed the CIA had developed malware which could exploit a flaw found in 318 of Cisco's switch models and alter or take control of the network.Cisco issued a warning on security risks, patches were not available, but Cisco provided mitigation advice.\n\n\n*** Smartphones/tablets ***\nThe electronic tools can reportedly compromise both Apple's iOS and Google's Android operating systems. By adding malware to the Android operating system, the tools could gain access to secure communications made on a device.\n\n\n**** Messaging services ****\nAccording to WikiLeaks, once an Android smartphone is penetrated the agency can collect \"audio and message traffic before encryption is applied\". Some of the agency's software is reportedly able to gain access to messages sent by instant messaging services. This method of accessing messages differs from obtaining access by decrypting an already encrypted message. While the encryption of messengers that offer end-to-end encryption, such as Telegram, WhatsApp and Signal, wasn't reported to be cracked, their encryption can be bypassed by capturing input before their encryption is applied, by methods such as keylogging and recording the touch input from the user. Commentators, among them Snowden and cryptographer and security pundit Bruce Schneier, observed that Wikileaks incorrectly implied that the messaging apps themselves, and their underlying encryption, had been compromised - an implication which was in turn reported for a period by the New York Times and other mainstream outlets.\n\n\n*** Vehicle control systems ***\n\nOne document reportedly showed that the CIA was researching ways to infect vehicle control systems. WikiLeaks stated, \"The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations.\" This statement brought renewed attention to conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Michael Hastings.\n\n\n*** Windows ***\nThe documents refer to a \"Windows FAX DLL injection\" exploit in Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 operating systems. This would allow a user with malicious intents to hide its own malware under the DLL of another application. However, a computer must have already been compromised through another method for the injection to take place.\n\n== Commentary ==\nOn 7 March 2017, Edward Snowden commented on the importance of the release, stating that it reveals the United States Government to be \"developing vulnerabilities in US products\" and \"then intentionally keeping the holes open\", which he considers highly reckless.On 7 March 2017, Nathan White, Senior Legislative Manager at the Internet advocacy group Access Now, writes:\nToday, our digital security has been compromised because the CIA has been stockpiling vulnerabilities rather than working with companies to patch them. The United States is supposed to have a process that helps secure our digital devices and services \u2014 the 'Vulnerabilities Equities Process.' Many of these vulnerabilities could have been responsibly disclosed and patched. This leak proves the inherent digital risk of stockpiling vulnerabilities rather than fixing them.\nOn 8 March 2017, Lee Mathews, a contributor to Forbes, wrote that most of the hacking techniques described in Vault 7 were already known to many cybersecurity experts.On 8 March 2017, some note that the revealed techniques and tools are most likely to be used for more targeted surveillance revealed by Edward Snowden.On 8 April 2017, Ashley Gorski, an American Civil Liberties Union staff attorney called it \"critical\" to understand that \"these vulnerabilities can be exploited not just by our government but by foreign governments and cyber criminals around the world.\" Justin Cappos, professor in the Computer Science and Engineering department at New York University asks \"if the government knows of a problem in your phone that bad guys could use to hack your phone and have the ability to spy on you, is that a weakness that they themselves should use for counterterrorism, or for their own spying capabilities, or is it a problem they should fix for everyone?\".On 8 April 2017, Cindy Cohn, executive director of the San Francisco-based international nonprofit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, said: \"If the C.I.A. was walking past your front door and saw that your lock was broken, they should at least tell you and maybe even help you get it fixed.\" \"And worse, they then lost track of the information they had kept from you so that now criminals and hostile foreign governments know about your broken lock.\" Furthermore, she stated that the CIA had \"failed to accurately assess the risk of not disclosing vulnerabilities. Even spy agencies like the CIA have a responsibility to protect the security and privacy of Americans.\" \"The freedom to have a private conversation \u2013 free from the worry that a hostile government, a rogue government agent or a competitor or a criminal are listening \u2013 is central to a free society\". While not as strict as privacy laws in Europe, the Fourth Amendment to the US constitution does guarantee the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.On 12 May 2017 Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith wrote \"This is an emerging pattern in 2017. We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks,\" In other words, Smith expressed concern about the fact that the CIA have stockpiled such computer vulnerabilities, which in turn were stolen from them, as a result the privacy and security of their customers around the world were potentially negatively affected for an extended period."

    "instruction": "Security of the Java software platform\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Java platform provides a number of features designed for improving the security of Java applications. This includes enforcing runtime constraints through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), a security manager that sandboxes untrusted code from the rest of the operating system, and a suite of security APIs that Java developers can utilise. Despite this, criticism has been directed at the programming language, and Oracle, due to an increase in malicious programs that revealed security vulnerabilities in the JVM, which were subsequently not properly addressed by Oracle in a timely manner.\n\n\n\n== Security features ==\n\n\n*** The JVM ***\nThe binary form of programs running on the Java platform is not native machine code but an intermediate bytecode. The JVM performs verification on this bytecode before running it to prevent the program from performing unsafe operations such as branching to incorrect locations, which may contain data rather than instructions. It also allows the JVM to enforce runtime constraints such as array bounds checking. This means that Java programs are significantly less likely to suffer from memory safety flaws such as buffer overflow than programs written in languages such as C which do not provide such memory safety guarantees.\nThe platform does not allow programs to perform certain potentially unsafe operations such as pointer arithmetic or unchecked type casts. It manages memory allocation and initialization and provides automatic garbage collection which in many cases (but not all) relieves the developer from manual memory management. This contributes to type safety and memory safety.\n\n\n*** Security manager ***\nThe platform provides a security manager which allows users to run untrusted bytecode in a \"sandboxed\" environment designed to protect them from malicious or poorly written software by preventing the untrusted code from accessing certain platform features and APIs. For example, untrusted code might be prevented from reading or writing files on the local filesystem, running arbitrary commands with the current user's privileges, accessing communication networks, accessing the internal private state of objects using reflection, or causing the JVM to exit.\nThe security manager also allows Java programs to be cryptographically signed; users can choose to allow code with a valid digital signature from a trusted entity to run with full privileges in circumstances where it would otherwise be untrusted.\nUsers can also set fine-grained access control policies for programs from different sources. For example, a user may decide that only system classes should be fully trusted, that code from certain trusted entities may be allowed to read certain specific files, and that all other code should be fully sandboxed.\n\n\n*** Security APIs ***\nThe Java Class Library provides a number of APIs related to security, such as standard cryptographic algorithms, authentication, and secure communication protocols.\n\n== Potential sources of security vulnerabilities in Java applications ==\nThere are a number of possible sources of security vulnerabilities in Java applications, some of which are common to non-Java applications and some of which are specific to the Java platform. (Note that these refer to potential sources of vulnerabilities which need to be kept in mind by security-conscious programmers: this is not intended as a list of actual vulnerabilities.)\nExamples of potential sources of vulnerability common to Java and non-Java applications are:\n\nVulnerabilities in the protection mechanisms provided by the hardware or operating system which the application relies upon for its security\nVulnerabilities in native libraries, such as the C standard library, which may be used to implement the application and/or runtime\nVulnerabilities caused purely by errors in user programs (for example improper construction of SQL queries leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities)However, much discussion of Java security focusses on potential sources of vulnerability specific to the Java platform. These include:\n\nVulnerabilities in the sandboxing mechanism which allow untrusted bytecode to circumvent the restrictions imposed by the security manager\nVulnerabilities in the Java class library which an application relies upon for its securityA vulnerability in the Java platform will not necessarily make all Java applications vulnerable. When vulnerabilities and patches are announced, for example by Oracle, the announcement will normally contain a breakdown of which types of application are affected (example).\nFor example, a hypothetical security flaw which affects only the security manager sandboxing mechanism of a particular JVM implementation would mean that only Java applications which run arbitrary untrusted bytecode would be compromised: applications where the user fully trusts and controls all bytecode being executed would not. This would mean that, say, a web browser plugin based on that JVM would be vulnerable to malicious applets downloaded from public websites, but a server-side web application running on the same version of the JVM where the administrator has full control over the classpath would be unaffected.\nAs with non-Java applications, security vulnerabilities can stem from parts of the platform which may not initially appear to be security-related. For example, in 2011, Oracle issued a security fix for a bug in the Double.parseDouble method. This method converts a string such as \"12.34\" into the equivalent double-precision floating point number. The bug caused this method to enter an infinite loop when called on a specific input. This bug had security implications, because for example if a web server converts a string typed into a form by the user using this method, a malicious user could type in the string which triggers the bug. This would cause the web server thread processing the malicious request to enter an infinite loop and become unavailable for serving requests from other users. Doing this repeatedly to a vulnerable web server would be an easy denial-of-service attack: all the web server's threads for responding to user requests would soon be stuck in the infinite loop and the web server would be unable to serve any legitimate users at all.\n\n== Criticism of security manager ==\nThe security manager in the Java platform (which, as mentioned above, is designed to allow the user to safely run untrusted bytecode) has been criticized in recent years for making users vulnerable to malware, especially in web browser plugins which execute Java applets downloaded from public websites, more informally known as \"Java in the browser\".\nOracle's efforts to address these vulnerabilities resulted in a delay to the release of Java 8.\n\n\n*** 2012 ***\nAn OS X trojan referred to as Flashback exploited a vulnerability in Java, which had not been patched by Apple, although Oracle had already released a patch. In April, Apple later released a removal tool for Lion users without Java. With Java 7 Update 4, Oracle began to release Java directly for Lion and later.In October, Apple released an update that removed the Java plugin from all browsers. This was seen as a move by Apple to distance OS X from Java.\n\n\n*** 2013 ***\nIn January, a zero-day vulnerability was found in all versions of Java 7, including the latest version Java 7 Update 10, which was already exploited in the wild. The vulnerability was caused by a patch to fix an earlier vulnerability. In response, Apple blacklisted the latest version of the Java plugin. Oracle released a patch (Update 11) within three days. Microsoft also released a patch for Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8.Cyberespionage malware Red October was found exploiting a Java vulnerability that was patched in October 2011. The website for Reporters Without Borders was also compromised by a Java vulnerability in versions prior to Update 11.After the release of Update 11, another vulnerability began circulating online, which was later confirmed. It was also found that Java's security mode itself was vulnerable due to a bug. In response, Mozilla disabled Java (as well as Adobe Reader and Microsoft Silverlight) in Firefox by default, while Apple blacklisted the latest Java plugin again.In February, Twitter reported that it had shut down an attack. Twitter advised users to disable Java, although it did not explain why. Later in the month, Facebook reported that it had been hacked by a zero-day Java attack. Apple also reported an attack. It was found that a breach of an iPhone developer forum was used to attack Twitter, Facebook, and Apple. The forum itself was unaware of the breach. Following Twitter, Facebook, and Apple, Microsoft reported that it was also similarly compromised.Another vulnerability discovered allowed for the Java security sandbox to be completely bypassed in the original release of Java 7, as well as Updates 11 and 15. In March, trojan called McRat was found exploiting a zero-day Java vulnerability. Oracle then released another patch to address the vulnerability.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: What are some potential sources of security vulnerabilities in Java applications that are common to non-Java applications?",

In response, Mozilla disabled Java (as well as Adobe Reader and Microsoft Silverlight) in Firefox by default, while Apple blacklisted the latest Java plugin again.In February, Twitter reported that it had shut down an attack. Twitter advised users to disable Java, although it did not explain why. Later in the month, Facebook reported that it had been hacked by a zero-day Java attack. Apple also reported an attack. It was found that a breach of an iPhone developer forum was used to attack Twitter, Facebook, and Apple. The forum itself was unaware of the breach. Following Twitter, Facebook, and Apple, Microsoft reported that it was also similarly compromised.Another vulnerability discovered allowed for the Java security sandbox to be completely bypassed in the original release of Java 7, as well as Updates 11 and 15. In March, trojan called McRat was found exploiting a zero-day Java vulnerability. Oracle then released another patch to address the vulnerability."

    "instruction": "Cryptographic key types\n\n==Introduction==\nA cryptographic key is a string of data that is used to lock or unlock cryptographic functions, including authentication, authorization and encryption. Cryptographic keys are grouped into cryptographic key types according to the functions they perform.\n\n== Description ==\nConsider a keyring that contains a variety of keys. These keys might be various shapes and sizes, but one thing is certain, each will generally serve a separate purpose. One key might be used to start an automobile, while another might be used to open a safety deposit box. The automobile key will not work to open the safety deposit box and vice versa. This analogy provides some insight on how cryptographic key types work. These keys are categorized in respect to how they are used and what properties they possess. \nA cryptographic key is categorized according to how it will be used and what properties it has. For example, a key might have one of the following properties: Symmetric, Public or Private. Keys may also be grouped into pairs that have one private and one public key, which is referred to as an Asymmetric key pair.\n\n\n*** Asymmetric versus symmetric keys ***\nAsymmetric keys differ from symmetric keys in that the algorithms use separate keys for encryption and decryption while a symmetric key\u2019s algorithm uses a single key for both processes. Because multiple keys are used with an asymmetric algorithm, the process takes longer to produce than a symmetric key algorithm would. However, the benefits lay in the fact that an asymmetric algorithm is much more secure than a symmetric key algorithm is.\nWith a symmetric key, the key needs to be transmitted to the receiver where there is always the possibility that the key could be intercepted or tampered with. With an asymmetric key, the message and/or accompanying data can be sent or received by using a public key; however, the receiver or sender would use his or her personal private key to access the message and/or accompanying data. Thus, asymmetric keys are suited for use for transmitting confidential messages and data and when authentication is required for assurance that the message has not been tampered with. Only the receiver, who is in possession of the private key\u2019s corresponding to the public key(encryption only key), has the ability to decode the message. A public key can be sent back and forth between recipients, but a private key remains fixed to one location and is not sent back and forth, which keeps it safe from being intercepted during transmission.\n\n\n*** Long term versus single use ***\nCryptographic keys may also have keys that designate they can be used for long-term (static, archived) use or used for a single session (ephemeral). The latter generally applies to the use of an Ephemeral Key Agreement Key. Most other key types are designed to last for long crypto-periods from about one to two years. When a shorter crypto-period is designed different key types may be used, such as Data Encryption keys, Symmetric Authentication keys, Private Key-Transport keys, Key-Wrapping keys, Authorization keys or RNG keys.\n\n== Key types ==\nThis page shows the classification of key types from the point of view of key management. In a key management system, each key should be labeled with one such type and that key should never be used for a different purpose.\nAccording to NIST SP 800-57 (Revision 4) the following types of keys exist:\nPrivate signature key\nPrivate signature keys are the private keys of asymmetric (public) key pairs that are used by public key algorithms to generate digital signatures with possible long-term implications. When properly handled, private signature keys can be used to provide authentication, integrity and non-repudiation.\nPublic signature verification key\nA public signature verification key is the public key of an asymmetric key pair that is used by a public key algorithm to verify digital signatures, either to authenticate a user's identity, to determine the integrity of the data, for non-repudiation, or a combination thereof.\nSymmetric authentication key\nSymmetric authentication keys are used with symmetric key algorithms to provide assurance of the integrity and source of messages, communication sessions, or stored data.\nPrivate authentication key\nA private authentication key is the private key of an asymmetric key pair that is used with a public key algorithm to provide assurance as to the integrity of information, and the identity of the originating entity or the source of messages, communication sessions, or stored data.\nPublic authentication key\nA public authentication key is the public key of an asymmetric key pair that is used with a public key algorithm to determine the integrity of information and to authenticate the identity of entities, or the source of messages, communication sessions, or stored data.\nSymmetric data encryption key\nThese keys are used with symmetric key algorithms to apply confidentiality protection to information.\nSymmetric key wrapping key\nSymmetric key wrapping keys are used to encrypt other keys using symmetric key algorithms. Key wrapping keys are also known as key encrypting keys.\nSymmetric and asymmetric random number generation keys\nThese are keys used to generate random numbers.\nSymmetric master key\nA symmetric master key is used to derive other symmetric keys (e.g., data encryption keys, key wrapping keys, or authentication keys) using symmetric cryptographic methods.\nPrivate key transport key\nPrivate key transport keys are the private keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used to decrypt keys that have been encrypted with the associated public key using a public key algorithm. Key transport keys are usually used to establish keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., initialization vectors).\nPublic key transport key\nPublic key transport keys are the public keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used to encrypt keys using a public key algorithm. These keys are used to establish keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., Initialization Vectors).\nSymmetric key agreement key\nThese symmetric keys are used to establish keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys, or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., Initialization Vectors) using a symmetric key agreement algorithm.\nPrivate static key agreement key\nPrivate static key agreement keys are the private keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used to establish keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys, or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., Initialization Vectors).\nPublic static key agreement key\nPublic static key agreement keys are the public keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used to establish keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys, or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., Initialization Vectors).\nPrivate ephemeral key agreement key\nPrivate ephemeral key agreement keys are the private keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used only once to establish one or more keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys, or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., Initialization Vectors).\nPublic ephemeral key agreement key\nPublic ephemeral key agreement keys are the public keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used in a single key establishment transaction to establish one or more keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys, or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., Initialization Vectors).\nSymmetric authorization key\nSymmetric authorization keys are used to provide privileges to an entity using a symmetric cryptographic method. The authorization key is known by the entity responsible for monitoring and granting access privileges for authorized entities and by the entity seeking access to resources.\nPrivate authorization key\nA private authorization key is the private key of an asymmetric key pair that is used to provide privileges to an entity.\nPublic authorization key\nA public authorization key is the public key of an asymmetric key pair that is used to verify privileges for an entity that knows the associated private authorization key.\nRead the text above and answer this question: How are private ephemeral key agreement keys used in a key management system?",

For example, a key might have one of the following properties: Symmetric, Public or Private. Keys may also be grouped into pairs that have one private and one public key, which is referred to as an Asymmetric key pair.\n\n\n*** Asymmetric versus symmetric keys ***\nAsymmetric keys differ from symmetric keys in that the algorithms use separate keys for encryption and decryption while a symmetric key\u2019s algorithm uses a single key for both processes. Because multiple keys are used with an asymmetric algorithm, the process takes longer to produce than a symmetric key algorithm would. However, the benefits lay in the fact that an asymmetric algorithm is much more secure than a symmetric key algorithm is.\nWith a symmetric key, the key needs to be transmitted to the receiver where there is always the possibility that the key could be intercepted or tampered with. With an asymmetric key, the message and/or accompanying data can be sent or received by using a public key; however, the receiver or sender would use his or her personal private key to access the message and/or accompanying data. Thus, asymmetric keys are suited for use for transmitting confidential messages and data and when authentication is required for assurance that the message has not been tampered with. Only the receiver, who is in possession of the private key\u2019s corresponding to the public key(encryption only key), has the ability to decode the message. A public key can be sent back and forth between recipients, but a private key remains fixed to one location and is not sent back and forth, which keeps it safe from being intercepted during transmission.\n\n\n*** Long term versus single use ***\nCryptographic keys may also have keys that designate they can be used for long-term (static, archived) use or used for a single session (ephemeral). The latter generally applies to the use of an Ephemeral Key Agreement Key. Most other key types are designed to last for long crypto-periods from about one to two years. When a shorter crypto-period is designed different key types may be used, such as Data Encryption keys, Symmetric Authentication keys, Private Key-Transport keys, Key-Wrapping keys, Authorization keys or RNG keys.\n\n== Key types ==\nThis page shows the classification of key types from the point of view of key management. In a key management system, each key should be labeled with one such type and that key should never be used for a different purpose.\nAccording to NIST SP 800-57 (Revision 4) the following types of keys exist:\nPrivate signature key\nPrivate signature keys are the private keys of asymmetric (public) key pairs that are used by public key algorithms to generate digital signatures with possible long-term implications. When properly handled, private signature keys can be used to provide authentication, integrity and non-repudiation.\nPublic signature verification key\nA public signature verification key is the public key of an asymmetric key pair that is used by a public key algorithm to verify digital signatures, either to authenticate a user's identity, to determine the integrity of the data, for non-repudiation, or a combination thereof.\nSymmetric authentication key\nSymmetric authentication keys are used with symmetric key algorithms to provide assurance of the integrity and source of messages, communication sessions, or stored data.\nPrivate authentication key\nA private authentication key is the private key of an asymmetric key pair that is used with a public key algorithm to provide assurance as to the integrity of information, and the identity of the originating entity or the source of messages, communication sessions, or stored data.\nPublic authentication key\nA public authentication key is the public key of an asymmetric key pair that is used with a public key algorithm to determine the integrity of information and to authenticate the identity of entities, or the source of messages, communication sessions, or stored data.\nSymmetric data encryption key\nThese keys are used with symmetric key algorithms to apply confidentiality protection to information.\nSymmetric key wrapping key\nSymmetric key wrapping keys are used to encrypt other keys using symmetric key algorithms. Key wrapping keys are also known as key encrypting keys.\nSymmetric and asymmetric random number generation keys\nThese are keys used to generate random numbers.\nSymmetric master key\nA symmetric master key is used to derive other symmetric keys (e.g., data encryption keys, key wrapping keys, or authentication keys) using symmetric cryptographic methods.\nPrivate key transport key\nPrivate key transport keys are the private keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used to decrypt keys that have been encrypted with the associated public key using a public key algorithm. Key transport keys are usually used to establish keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., initialization vectors).\nPublic key transport key\nPublic key transport keys are the public keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used to encrypt keys using a public key algorithm. These keys are used to establish keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., Initialization Vectors).\nSymmetric key agreement key\nThese symmetric keys are used to establish keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys, or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., Initialization Vectors) using a symmetric key agreement algorithm.\nPrivate static key agreement key\nPrivate static key agreement keys are the private keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used to establish keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys, or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., Initialization Vectors).\nPublic static key agreement key\nPublic static key agreement keys are the public keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used to establish keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys, or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., Initialization Vectors).\nPrivate ephemeral key agreement key\nPrivate ephemeral key agreement keys are the private keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used only once to establish one or more keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys, or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., Initialization Vectors).\nPublic ephemeral key agreement key\nPublic ephemeral key agreement keys are the public keys of asymmetric key pairs that are used in a single key establishment transaction to establish one or more keys (e.g., key wrapping keys, data encryption keys, or MAC keys) and, optionally, other keying material (e.g., Initialization Vectors).\nSymmetric authorization key\nSymmetric authorization keys are used to provide privileges to an entity using a symmetric cryptographic method. The authorization key is known by the entity responsible for monitoring and granting access privileges for authorized entities and by the entity seeking access to resources.\nPrivate authorization key\nA private authorization key is the private key of an asymmetric key pair that is used to provide privileges to an entity.\nPublic authorization key\nA public authorization key is the public key of an asymmetric key pair that is used to verify privileges for an entity that knows the associated private authorization key."

HIPAA includes provisions designed to save health care businesses money by encouraging electronic transactions, as well as regulations to protect the security and confidentiality of patient information. The Privacy Rule became effective April 14, 2001, and most covered entities (health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers that conduct certain financial and administrative transactions electronically) had until April 2003 to comply. This security provision became effective April 21, 2003. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is the baseline set of federal regulations governing medical information. It does three things: i. i. i.Establish a structure for how personal health information is disclosed and establish the rights of individuals with respect to health information; ii.Specify security standards for the retention and transmission of electronic patient information; iii.Need a common format and data structure for the electronic exchange of health information.\nCalifornia-Specific Laws  California\u2019s medical privacy laws, primarily the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA), the data breach sections of the Civil Code, and sections of the Health and Safety Code, provide HIPAA-like protections although the terminology is different. HIPAA establishes a federal \"minimum standard\" that applies where there are gaps in California law, and HIPAA also specifies that stricter state laws will override or supersede HIPAA. California's health care privacy laws apply to providers who provide personal health records (PHR), while HIPAA only applies when the provider providing the PHR is a business associate of a covered entity. Federal law does not grant individuals the right to file a lawsuit in the event of a data breach (only the Attorney General can file a lawsuit), but California law does.This means that California law sets a higher standard for medical privacy, and that individuals in California enjoy stronger legal protections and more ways to hold entities that violate their medical privacy accountable.\nIn the UK, the legal framework for how patient data is cared for and processed is the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA), which incorporates the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) into law, and the common law duty of confidentiality (CLDC).

    "instruction": "Secure by design\n\n==Introduction==\nSecure by design, in software engineering, means that software products and capabilities have been designed to be foundationally secure.\nAlternate security strategies, tactics and patterns are considered at the beginning of a software design, and the best are selected and enforced by the architecture, and they are used as guiding principles for developers. It is also encouraged to use strategic design patterns that have beneficial effects on security, even though those design patterns were not originally devised with security in mind.Secure by Design is increasingly becoming the mainstream development approach to ensure security and privacy of software systems. In this approach, security is considered and built into the system at every layer and starts with a robust architecture design. Security architectural design decisions are based on well-known security strategies, tactics, and patterns defined as reusable techniques for achieving specific quality concerns. Security tactics/patterns provide solutions for enforcing the necessary authentication, authorization, confidentiality, data integrity, privacy, accountability, availability, safety and non-repudiation requirements, even when the system is under attack.\nIn order to ensure the security of a software system, not only is it important to design a robust intended security architecture but it is also necessary to map updated security strategies, tactics and patterns to software development in order to maintain security persistence.\n\n== Expect attacks ==\nMalicious attacks on software should be assumed to occur, and care is taken to minimize impact.  Security vulnerabilities are anticipated, along with invalid user input. Closely related is the practice of using \"good\" software design, such as domain-driven design or cloud native, as a way to increase security by reducing risk of vulnerability-opening mistakes\u2014even though the design principles used were not originally conceived for security purposes.\n\n== Avoid security through obscurity ==\nGenerally, designs that work well do not rely on being secret. Often, secrecy reduces the number of attackers by demotivating a subset of the threat population. The logic is that if there is an increase in complexity for the attacker, the increased attacker effort to compromise the target will discourage them. While this technique implies reduced inherent risks, a virtually infinite set of threat actors and techniques applied over time will cause most secrecy methods to fail. While not mandatory, proper security usually means that everyone is allowed to know and understand the design because it is secure. This has the advantage that many people are looking at the computer code, which improves the odds that any flaws will be found sooner (see Linus's law). The disadvantage is that attackers can also obtain the code, which makes it easier for them to find vulnerabilities to exploit. It is generally believed, though, that the advantage of the open computer code outweighs the disadvantage.\n\n== Fewest privileges ==\nAlso, it is important that everything works with the fewest privileges possible (see the principle of least privilege). For example, a web server that runs as the administrative user (\"root\" or \"admin\") can have the privilege to remove files and users. A flaw in such a program could therefore put the entire system at risk, whereas a web server that runs inside an isolated environment, and only has the privileges for required network and filesystem functions, cannot compromise the system it runs on unless the security around it in itself is also flawed.\n\n== Methodologies ==\nSecure Design should be a consideration at all points in the development lifecycle (whichever development methodology is chosen).\nSome pre-built Secure By Design development methodologies exist (e.g. Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle).\n\n\n*** Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle ***\n\nMicrosoft issued methodology and guidance based on the classical spiral model.\n\n== Standards and Legislation ==\n\nStandards and Legislation exist to aide secure design by controlling the definition of \"Secure\", and providing concrete steps to testing and integrating secure systems.\nSome examples of standards which cover or touch on Secure By Design principles:\n\nETSI TS 103 645  which is included in part in the UK Government \"Proposals for regulating consumer smart product cyber security\" \nISO/IEC 27000-series covers many aspects of secure design.\n\n== Server/client architectures ==\nIn server/client architectures, the program at the other side may not be an authorised client and the client's server may not be an authorised server. Even when they are, a man-in-the-middle attack could compromise communications.\nOften the easiest way to break the security of a client/server system is not to go head on to the security mechanisms, but instead to go around them.  A man in the middle attack is a simple example of this, because you can use it to collect details to impersonate a user.  Which is why it is important to consider encryption, hashing, and other security mechanisms in your design to ensure that information collected from a potential attacker won't allow access.\nAnother key feature to client-server security design is good coding practices.  For example, following a known software design structure, such as client and broker, can help in designing a well-built structure with a solid foundation.  Furthermore, if the software is to be modified in the future, it is even more important that it follows a logical foundation of separation between the client and server.  This is because if a programmer comes in and cannot clearly understand the dynamics of the program, they may end up adding or changing something that can add a security flaw.  Even with the best design, this is always a possibility, but the better the standardization of the design, the less chance there is of this occurring.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question.

A flaw in such a program could therefore put the entire system at risk, whereas a web server that runs inside an isolated environment, and only has the privileges for required network and filesystem functions, cannot compromise the system it runs on unless the security around it in itself is also flawed.\n\n== Methodologies ==\nSecure Design should be a consideration at all points in the development lifecycle (whichever development methodology is chosen).\nSome pre-built Secure By Design development methodologies exist (e.g. Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle).\n\n\n*** Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle ***\n\nMicrosoft issued methodology and guidance based on the classical spiral model.\n\n== Standards and Legislation ==\n\nStandards and Legislation exist to aide secure design by controlling the definition of \"Secure\", and providing concrete steps to testing and integrating secure systems.\nSome examples of standards which cover or touch on Secure By Design principles:\n\nETSI TS 103 645  which is included in part in the UK Government \"Proposals for regulating consumer smart product cyber security\" \nISO/IEC 27000-series covers many aspects of secure design.\n\n== Server/client architectures ==\nIn server/client architectures, the program at the other side may not be an authorised client and the client's server may not be an authorised server. Even when they are, a man-in-the-middle attack could compromise communications.\nOften the easiest way to break the security of a client/server system is not to go head on to the security mechanisms, but instead to go around them.  A man in the middle attack is a simple example of this, because you can use it to collect details to impersonate a user.  Which is why it is important to consider encryption, hashing, and other security mechanisms in your design to ensure that information collected from a potential attacker won't allow access.\nAnother key feature to client-server security design is good coding practices.  For example, following a known software design structure, such as client and broker, can help in designing a well-built structure with a solid foundation.  Furthermore, if the software is to be modified in the future, it is even more important that it follows a logical foundation of separation between the client and server.  This is because if a programmer comes in and cannot clearly understand the dynamics of the program, they may end up adding or changing something that can add a security flaw.  Even with the best design, this is always a possibility, but the better the standardization of the design, the less chance there is of this occurring."

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nMultiOTP\n\n==Introduction==\nmultiOTP is an open source PHP class, a command line tool, and a web interface that can be used to provide an operating-system-independent, strong authentication system. multiOTP is OATH-certified since version 4.1.0 and is developed under the LGPL license. Starting with version 4.3.2.5, multiOTP open source is also available as a virtual appliance - as a standard OVA file, a customized OVA file with open-vm-tools, and also as a Hyper-V downloadable file.A QR code is generated automatically when printing the user-configuration page.\n\n== Overview ==\nSpyware, viruses and other hacking technologies or bugs (such as Heartbleed) are regularly used to steal passwords. If a strong two-factor authentication system is used, the stolen passwords cannot be stored and later used because each one-time password is valid for only one authentication session, and will fail if tried a second time.\nmultiOTP is a PHP class library. The class can be used with any PHP application using a PHP version of 5.3.0 or higher. The multiOTP library is provided as an all-in-one self-contained file that requires no other includes. If the strong authentication needs to be done from a hardware device instead of an Internet application, a request will go through a RADIUS server which will call the multiOTP command line tool. The implementation is light enough in order to work on limited computers, such as the Raspberry Pi.\n\n== Features ==\nFor Windows, the multiOTP library is provided with a pre-configured RADIUS server (freeradius) which can be installed as a service. A pre-configured web service (based on mongoose) can also be installed as a service and is needed if we want to use the multiOTP library in a client/server configuration.\nUnder Linux, the readme.txt file provided with the library indicates what should be done in order to configure the RADIUS server and the web service.\nAll necessary files and instructions are also provided to make a strong authentication device using a Raspberry Pi nano-computer.\nSince version 4.3.2.5, ready to use virtual appliance is provided in standard OVA format, with open-vm-tools integrated and also in Hyper-V format.\nThe client can strongly authenticate on an application or a device using different methods:\n\nsoftware tokens (like Google Authenticator)\nhardware tokens (any OATH/HOTP and OATH/TOTP certified token, like NagraID tokens, and some other non-certified but compatible tokens, like Feitian C200 time based tokens)\ncode sent per SMS (since version 4.0.4)\nscratch passwords list (since version 4.0.4)\nYubiKey in proprietary Yubico OTP mode (since version 4.3)\nwithout2FA for accounts that doesn't nedd strong authentication (since 5.3)\n\n== Standardization and normalization ==\nmultiOTP is Initiative For Open Authentication certified for HOTP and TOTP and currently supports the following algorithms and RFCs:\n\nHOTP, HMAC-based one-time password (RFC4226)\nTOTP, time-based one-time password (RFC6238)\nGoogle Authenticator (OATH/HOTP or OATH/TOTP, base32 seed, QRcode provisioning)\nSMS tokens (using aspsms, clickatell, intellisms, or a local provider)\nPSKC, Additional Portable Symmetric Key Container Algorithm Profiles (RFC6030)\nCHAP, Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (RFC1994)\nMS-CHAP, Microsoft PPP CHAP Extensions (RFC2433)\nMS-CHAPv2, Microsoft PPP CHAP Extensions, version 2 (RFC2759)\nSyslog protocol (client; RFC5424)\nSMTP, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (RFC2821)\nSMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP over TLS (RFC2487)\n\n== Scope of the class ==\nThe multiOTP class provides strong authentication functionality and can be used in different strong authentication situations:\n\nAdding a strong authentication in order to identify a user (to avoid static password)\nFixing a hardware token at a specific place, and be sure that somebody was there at a specific time (the token code displayed to the user at the specific time will give information about where it was displayed)\nAuthenticating a user by sending him a code through SMS, which will validate automatically the mobile phone number of the user\nCreating automatically strong authentication accounts for users present in a specific group of the Active Directory (or LDAP)Several free projects use the library:\n\nSince November 2016, the multiOTP team provides an up-to-date Credential Provider for Windows 7/8/8.1/10/2012(R2)/2016, with options like RDP only and UPN name support, called multiOTP Credential Provider, based on the MultiOneTimePassword Credential Provider created by Last Squirrel IT.\nownCloud OTP is a One Time Password app based on the multiOTP class that add strong authentication to the OwnCloud project, an open source Dropbox alternative.\n2FA Credential Provider for Windows is another strong authentication Credential Provider for Windows Login using the multiOTP library.\nThe multiOTP class has been used as a learning tool in security demonstrations and a Bachelor thesis\n\nWhat is the implementation of multiOTP for hardware devices?",

The software can apply encryption or filtering of various kinds.\n\n\n\n== Types of protection ==\nPrivacy software can refer to two different types of protection.  The first type is protecting a users Internet privacy from the World Wide Web. There are software products that will mask or hide a users IP address from the outside world to protect the user from identity theft.  The second type of protection is hiding or deleting the user's Internet traces that are left on their PC after they have been surfing the Internet.  There is software that will erase all the user's Internet traces and there is software that will hide and (Encrypt) a users traces so that others using their PC will not know where they have been surfing.\n\n\n*** Whitelisting and blacklisting ***\nOne solution to enhance privacy software is whitelisting. Whitelisting is a process in which a company identifies the software that it will allow and does not try to recognize malware. Whitelisting permits acceptable software to run and either prevents anything else from running or lets new software run in a quarantined environment until its validity can be verified. Whereas whitelisting allows nothing to run unless it is on the whitelist, blacklisting allows everything to run unless it is on the black. A blacklist then includes certain types of software that are not allowed to run in the company environment. For example, a company might blacklist peer-to-peer file sharing on its systems. In addition to software, people, devices, and websites can also be whitelisted or blacklisted.\n\n\n*** Intrusion detection systems ***\nIntrusion detection systems are designed to detect all types of malicious network traffic and computer usage that cannot be detected by a firewall. These systems capture all network traffic flows and examine the contents of each packet for malicious traffic.\n\n\n*** Encryption ***\n\nEncryption is another form of privacy security. When organizations do not have a secure channel for sending information, they use encryption to stop unauthorized eavesdroppers. Encryption is the process of converting an original message into a form that cannot be read by anyone except the intended receiver.\n\n\n*** Steganography ***\n\nSteganography is the practice of representing information within another message or physical object, in such a manner that the presence of the information is not evident to human inspection.  Its purpose is to hide messages from eavesdropping and e-surveillance. Compared to using cryptography, which translates the text itself to another format, stenography hides the data rather than converting it.\n\n== Privacy vs anonymity ==\nPrivacy is different from anonymity in its applicability and usage. Anonymity is subordinate to privacy and might be desired for the exchange, retrieval, or publication of specific information.\n\nHow does anonymity differ from privacy in privacy software?",

    "instruction": "Patch Tuesday\n\n==Introduction==\nPatch Tuesday (also known as Update Tuesday) is an unofficial term used to refer to when Microsoft, Adobe, Oracle and others regularly release software patches for their software products. It is widely referred to in this way by the industry. Microsoft formalized Patch Tuesday in October 2003. Patch Tuesday is known within Microsoft also as the \"B\" release, to distinguish it from the \"C\" and \"D\" releases that occur in the third and fourth weeks of the month, respectively.Patch Tuesday occurs on the second Tuesday of each month in North America. Critical security updates are occasionally released outside of the normal Patch Tuesday cycle; these are known as \"Out-of-band\" releases. As far as the integrated Windows Update (WU) function is concerned, Patch Tuesday begins at 10:00 a.m. PST. Vulnerability information is immediately available in the Security Update Guide. The updates show up in Download Center before they are added to WU, and the KB articles are unlocked later.\nDaily updates consist of malware database refreshes for Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials, these updates are not part of the normal Patch Tuesday release cycle.\n\n== Security implications ==\nAn obvious security implication is that security problems that have a solution are withheld from the public for up to a month. This policy is adequate when the vulnerability is not widely known or is extremely obscure, but that is not always the case.\nThere have been cases where vulnerability information became public or actual worms were circulating prior to the next scheduled Patch Tuesday. In critical cases Microsoft issues corresponding patches as they become ready, alleviating the risk if updates are checked for and installed frequently.\nAt the Ignite 2015 event, Microsoft revealed a change in distributing security patches. They release security updates to home PCs, tablets and phones as soon as they are ready, while enterprise customers will stay on the monthly update cycle, which was reworked as Windows Update for Business.\n\n== Exploit Wednesday ==\nMany exploitation events are seen shortly after the release of a patch; analysis of the patch helps exploit developers to immediately take advantage of the previously undisclosed vulnerability, which will remain in unpatched systems. Therefore, the term \"Exploit Wednesday\" was coined.\n\n\n*** Discontinued Windows versions ***\nMicrosoft warned users that it discontinued support for Windows XP starting on April 8, 2014 \u2013  users running Windows XP afterwards would be at the risk of attacks. As security patches of newer Windows versions can reveal similar (or same) vulnerabilities already present in older Windows versions, this can allow attacks on devices with unsupported Windows versions (cf. \"zero-day attacks\"). However Microsoft stopped fixing such (and other) vulnerabilities in unsupported Windows versions, regardless how widely known they became, leaving devices running these Windows versions vulnerable to attacks.  Microsoft made a singular exception during the rapid spread of the WannaCry ransomware and released patches in May 2017 for the by then-unsupported Windows XP, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2003 (in addition to then supported Windows versions).For Windows Vista \"extended support\" was ended April 11, 2017, which will leave vulnerabilities discovered afterwards unfixed, creating the same situation for Vista as for XP before.For Windows 7 (including Service Pack 1), support ended January 14, 2020, and on January 10, 2023 for Windows 8.1; this will cause the same \"unfixed vulnerabilities\" issue for users of these operating systems. Support for Windows 8 already ended January 12, 2016 (with users having to install Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 to continue to get support), and support for Windows 7 without SP1 was ended April 9, 2013 (with the ability to install SP1 to continue to get support until 2020, or having to install Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 to receive support after 2020).\n\n\n*** Windows 10 and 11 ***\n\nStarting with Windows 10, Microsoft began releasing feature updates of Windows twice per year. These releases brought new functionalities, and are governed by Microsoft's modern lifecycle policy, which specifies a support period of 18-36 months. This is in contrast to previous Windows versions, which received only infrequent updates via service packs, and whose support was governed by the fixed lifecycle policy. With the release of Windows 11, both Windows 10 and 11 started receiving annual feature updates in the second half of the year.\nOnce a release's support period ends, devices must be updated to the latest feature update in order to receive updates from Microsoft. As such, for Home and Pro editions of Windows 10 and 11, the latest Windows version is downloaded and installed automatically when the device approaches the end of support date.\n\nIn addition to the commonly used editions like Home and Pro, Microsoft offers specialized Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) versions of Windows 10 with longer support timelines, governed by Microsoft's fixed lifecycle policy. For instance, Windows 10 Enterprise 2016 LTSB will receive extended support until October 13, 2026, and Windows 10 LTSC 2019 will receive extended support until January 9, 2029.\n\n== Adoption by other companies ==\nSAP's \"Security Patch Day\", when the company advises users to install security updates, was chosen to coincide with Patch Tuesdays. Adobe Systems' update schedule for Flash Player since November 2012 also coincides with Patch Tuesday. One of the reasons for this is that Flash Player comes as part of Windows starting with Windows 8 and Flash Player updates for the built-in and the plugin based version both need to be published at the same time in order to prevent reverse-engineering threats. Oracle's quarterly updates coincide with Patch Tuesday.\n\n== Bandwidth impact ==\nWindows Update uses the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) to download the updates, using idle network bandwidth. However BITS will use the speed as reported by the network interface (NIC) to calculate bandwidth. This can lead to bandwidth calculation errors, for example when a fast network adapter (e.g. 10 Mbit/s) is connected to the network via a slow link (e.g. 56 kbit/s) \u2013  according to Microsoft \"BITS will compete for the full bandwidth [of the NIC] ... BITS has no visibility of the network traffic beyond the client.\"Furthermore, the Windows Update servers of Microsoft do not honor the TCP's slow start congestion control strategy. As a result, other users on the same network may experience significantly slower connections from machines actively retrieving updates. This can be particularly noticeable in environments where many machines individually retrieve updates over a shared, bandwidth-constrained link such as those found in many multi-PC homes and small to medium-sized businesses. Bandwidth demands of patching large numbers of computers can be reduced significantly by deploying Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) to distribute the updates locally.\nIn addition to updates being downloaded from Microsoft servers, Windows 10 devices can \"share\" updates in a peer-to-peer fashion with other Windows 10 devices on the local network, or even with Windows 10 devices on the internet. This can potentially distribute updates faster while reducing usage for networks with a metered connection.\nQuestion: What is the term for exploitation events seen shortly after the release of a patch?",

    "instruction": "Authorization\n\n==Introduction==\nAuthorization or authorisation (see spelling differences) is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to general information security and computer security, and to access control in particular. More formally, \"to authorize\" is to define an access policy. For example, human resources staff are normally authorized to access employee records and this policy is often formalized as access control rules in a computer system. During operation, the system uses the access control rules to decide whether access requests from (authenticated) consumers shall be approved (granted) or disapproved (rejected). Resources include individual files or an item's data, computer programs, computer devices and functionality provided by computer applications. Examples of consumers are computer users, computer software and other hardware on the computer.\n\n== Overview ==\nAccess control in computer systems and networks rely on access policies. The access control process can be divided into the following phases: policy definition phase where access is authorized, and policy enforcement phase where access requests are approved or disapproved. Authorization is the function of the policy definition phase which precedes the policy enforcement phase where access requests are approved or disapproved based on the previously defined authorizations.\nMost modern, multi-user operating systems include role-based access control (RBAC) and thereby rely on authorization. Access control also uses authentication to verify the identity of consumers. When a consumer tries to access a resource, the access control process checks that the consumer has been authorized to use that resource. Authorization is the responsibility of an authority, such as a department manager, within the application domain, but is often delegated to a custodian such as a system administrator. Authorizations are expressed as access policies in some types of \"policy definition application\", e.g. in the form of an access control list or a capability, or a policy administration point e.g. XACML. On the basis of the \"principle of least privilege\": consumers should only be authorized to access whatever they need to do their jobs. Older and single user operating systems often had weak or non-existent authentication and access control systems.\n\"Anonymous consumers\" or \"guests\", are consumers that have not been required to authenticate. They often have limited authorization. On a distributed system, it is often desirable to grant access without requiring a unique identity. Familiar examples of access tokens include keys, certificates and tickets: they grant access without proving identity.\nTrusted consumers are often authorized for unrestricted access to resources on a system, but must be verified so that the access control system can make the access approval decision. \"Partially trusted\" and guests will often have restricted authorization in order to protect resources against improper access and usage. The access policy in some operating systems, by default, grant all consumers full access to all resources. Others do the opposite, insisting that the administrator explicitly authorizes a consumer to use each resource.\nEven when access is controlled through a combination of authentication and access control lists, the problems of maintaining the authorization data is not trivial, and often represents as much administrative burden as managing authentication credentials. It is often necessary to change or remove a user's authorization: this is done by changing or deleting the corresponding access rules on the system. Using atomic authorization is an alternative to per-system authorization management, where a trusted third party securely distributes authorization information.\n\n== Related interpretations ==\n\n\n*** Public policy ***\nIn public policy, authorization is a feature of trusted systems used for security or social control.\n\n\n*** Banking ***\nIn banking, an authorization is a hold placed on a customer's account when a purchase is made using a debit card or credit card.\n\n\n*** Publishing ***\n\nIn publishing, sometimes public lectures and other freely available texts are published without the approval of the author. These are called unauthorized texts. An example is the 2002  'The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe' , which was collected from Stephen Hawking's lectures and published without his permission as per copyright law.\nRead the text above and answer this question: What is the role of authentication in access control?",

Resources include individual files or an item's data, computer programs, computer devices and functionality provided by computer applications. Examples of consumers are computer users, computer software and other hardware on the computer.\n\n== Overview ==\nAccess control in computer systems and networks rely on access policies. The access control process can be divided into the following phases: policy definition phase where access is authorized, and policy enforcement phase where access requests are approved or disapproved. Authorization is the function of the policy definition phase which precedes the policy enforcement phase where access requests are approved or disapproved based on the previously defined authorizations.\nMost modern, multi-user operating systems include role-based access control (RBAC) and thereby rely on authorization. Access control also uses authentication to verify the identity of consumers. When a consumer tries to access a resource, the access control process checks that the consumer has been authorized to use that resource. Authorization is the responsibility of an authority, such as a department manager, within the application domain, but is often delegated to a custodian such as a system administrator. Authorizations are expressed as access policies in some types of \"policy definition application\", e.g. in the form of an access control list or a capability, or a policy administration point e.g. XACML. On the basis of the \"principle of least privilege\": consumers should only be authorized to access whatever they need to do their jobs. Older and single user operating systems often had weak or non-existent authentication and access control systems.\n\"Anonymous consumers\" or \"guests\", are consumers that have not been required to authenticate. They often have limited authorization. On a distributed system, it is often desirable to grant access without requiring a unique identity. Familiar examples of access tokens include keys, certificates and tickets: they grant access without proving identity.\nTrusted consumers are often authorized for unrestricted access to resources on a system, but must be verified so that the access control system can make the access approval decision. \"Partially trusted\" and guests will often have restricted authorization in order to protect resources against improper access and usage. The access policy in some operating systems, by default, grant all consumers full access to all resources. Others do the opposite, insisting that the administrator explicitly authorizes a consumer to use each resource.\nEven when access is controlled through a combination of authentication and access control lists, the problems of maintaining the authorization data is not trivial, and often represents as much administrative burden as managing authentication credentials. It is often necessary to change or remove a user's authorization: this is done by changing or deleting the corresponding access rules on the system. Using atomic authorization is an alternative to per-system authorization management, where a trusted third party securely distributes authorization information.\n\n== Related interpretations ==\n\n\n*** Public policy ***\nIn public policy, authorization is a feature of trusted systems used for security or social control.\n\n\n*** Banking ***\nIn banking, an authorization is a hold placed on a customer's account when a purchase is made using a debit card or credit card.\n\n\n*** Publishing ***\n\nIn publishing, sometimes public lectures and other freely available texts are published without the approval of the author. These are called unauthorized texts. An example is the 2002  'The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe' , which was collected from Stephen Hawking's lectures and published without his permission as per copyright law."

    "instruction": "Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator\n\n==Introduction==\nA cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) or cryptographic pseudorandom number generator (CPRNG) is a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) with properties that make it suitable for use in cryptography. It is also loosely known as a cryptographic random number generator (CRNG).\n\n== Background ==\nMost cryptographic applications require random numbers, for example:\n\nkey generation\nnonces\nsalts in certain signature schemes, including ECDSA, RSASSA-PSSThe \"quality\" of the randomness required for these applications varies.\nFor example, creating a nonce in some protocols needs only uniqueness.\nOn the other hand, the generation of a master key requires a higher quality, such as more entropy. And in the case of one-time pads, the information-theoretic guarantee of perfect secrecy only holds if the key material comes from a true random source with high entropy, and thus any kind of pseudorandom number generator is insufficient.\nIdeally, the generation of random numbers in CSPRNGs uses entropy obtained from a high-quality source, generally the operating system's randomness API. However, unexpected correlations have been found in several such ostensibly independent processes. From an information-theoretic point of view, the amount of randomness, the entropy that can be generated, is equal to the entropy provided by the system. But sometimes, in practical situations, more random numbers are needed than there is entropy available. Also, the processes to extract randomness from a running system are slow in actual practice.  In such instances, a CSPRNG can sometimes be used. A CSPRNG can \"stretch\" the available entropy over more bits.\n\n== Requirements ==\nA cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) or cryptographic pseudorandom number generator (CPRNG) is a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) with properties that make it suitable for use in cryptography. It is also loosely known as a cryptographic random number generator (CRNG), which can be compared to \"true\" vs. pseudo-random numbers.\nThe requirements of an ordinary PRNG are also satisfied by a cryptographically secure PRNG, but the reverse is not true. CSPRNG requirements fall into two groups: first, that they pass statistical randomness tests; and secondly, that they hold up well under serious attack, even when part of their initial or running state becomes available to an attacker.\nEvery CSPRNG should satisfy the next-bit test. That is, given the first k bits of a random sequence, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that can predict the (k+1)th bit with probability of success non-negligibly better than 50%. Andrew Yao proved in 1982 that a generator passing the next-bit test will pass all other polynomial-time statistical tests for randomness.\nEvery CSPRNG should withstand \"state compromise extensions\". In the event that part or all of its state has been revealed (or guessed correctly), it should be impossible to reconstruct the stream of random numbers prior to the revelation. Additionally, if there is an entropy input while running, it should be infeasible to use knowledge of the input's state to predict future conditions of the CSPRNG state.Example: If the CSPRNG under consideration produces output by computing bits of \u03c0 in sequence, starting from some unknown point in the binary expansion, it may well satisfy the next-bit test and thus be statistically random, as \u03c0 appears to be a random sequence. (This would be guaranteed if \u03c0 is a normal number, for example.) However, this algorithm is not cryptographically secure; an attacker who determines which bit of pi (i.e. the state of the algorithm) is currently in use will be able to calculate all preceding bits as well.Most PRNGs are not suitable for use as CSPRNGs and will fail on both counts. First, while most PRNGs outputs appear random to assorted statistical tests, they do not resist determined reverse engineering. Specialized statistical tests may be found specially tuned to such a PRNG that shows the random numbers not to be truly random. Second, for most PRNGs, when their state has been revealed, all past random numbers can be retrodicted, allowing an attacker to read all past messages, as well as future ones.\nCSPRNGs are designed explicitly to resist this type of cryptanalysis.\n\n== Definitions ==\nIn the asymptotic setting, a family of deterministic polynomial time computable functions \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          G\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        :\n        {\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        \n          }\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        \u2192\n        {\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        \n          }\n          \n            p\n            (\n            k\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G_{k}\\colon \\{0,1\\}^{k}\\to \\{0,1\\}^{p(k)}}\n   for some polynomial p, is a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG, or PRG in some references), if it stretches the length of its input (\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        (\n        k\n        )\n        >\n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p(k)>k}\n   for any k), and if its output is computationally indistinguishable from true randomness, i.e. for any probabilistic polynomial time algorithm A, which outputs 1 or 0 as a distinguisher,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n          \n            \n              Pr\n              \n                x\n                \u2190\n                {\n                0\n                ,\n                1\n                \n                  }\n                  \n                    k\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            [\n            A\n            (\n            G\n            (\n            x\n            )\n            )\n\n== Entropy extraction ==\n\nSantha and Vazirani proved that several bit streams with weak randomness can be combined to produce a higher-quality quasi-random bit stream.\nEven earlier, John von Neumann proved that a simple algorithm can remove a considerable amount of the bias in any bit stream, which should be applied to each bit stream before using any variation of the Santha\u2013Vazirani design.\n\n== Designs ==\nIn the discussion below, CSPRNG designs are divided into three classes:\n\nthose based on cryptographic primitives such as ciphers and cryptographic hashes,\nthose based upon mathematical problems thought to be hard, and\nspecial-purpose designs.The last often introduces additional entropy when available and, strictly speaking, are not  \"pure\" pseudorandom number generators, as their output is not completely determined by their initial state. This addition can prevent attacks even if the initial state is compromised.\n\n\n*** Designs based on cryptographic primitives ***\nA secure block cipher can be converted into a CSPRNG by running it in counter mode. This is done by choosing a random key and encrypting a 0, then encrypting a 1, then encrypting a 2, etc.  The counter can also be started at an arbitrary number other than zero.  Assuming an n-bit block cipher the output can be distinguished from random data after around 2n/2 blocks since, following the birthday problem, colliding blocks should become likely at that point, whereas a block cipher in CTR mode will never output identical blocks. For 64-bit block ciphers this limits the safe output size to a few gigabytes, with 128-bit blocks the limitation is large enough not to impact typical applications. However, when used alone it does not meet all of the criteria of a CSPRNG (as stated above) since it is not strong against \"state compromise extensions\": with knowledge of the state (in this case a counter and a key) you can predict all past output.\nA cryptographically secure hash of a counter might also act as a good CSPRNG in some cases. In this case, it is also necessary that the initial value of this counter is random and secret. However, there has been little study of these algorithms for use in this manner, and at least some authors warn against this use.\nMost stream ciphers work by generating a pseudorandom stream of bits that are combined (almost always XORed) with the plaintext; running the cipher on a counter will return a new pseudorandom stream, possibly with a longer period. The cipher can only be secure if the original stream is a good CSPRNG, although this is not necessarily the case (see the RC4 cipher). Again, the initial state must be kept secret.\n\n\n*** Number-theoretic designs ***\nThe Blum Blum Shub algorithm has a security proof based on the difficulty of the quadratic residuosity problem. Since the only known way to solve that problem is to factor the modulus, it is generally regarded that the difficulty of integer factorization provides a conditional security proof for the Blum Blum Shub algorithm. However the algorithm is very inefficient and therefore impractical unless extreme security is needed.\nThe Blum\u2013Micali algorithm has a security proof based on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem but is also very inefficient.\nDaniel Brown of Certicom has written a 2006 security proof for Dual EC DRBG, based on the assumed hardness of the Decisional Diffie\u2013Hellman assumption, the x-logarithm problem, and the truncated point problem. The 2006 proof explicitly assumes a lower outlen than in the Dual_EC_DRBG standard, and that the P and Q in the Dual_EC_DRBG standard (which were revealed in 2013 to be probably backdoored by NSA) are replaced with non-backdoored values.\n\n\n*** Special designs ***\nThere are a number of practical PRNGs that have been designed to be cryptographically secure, including\n\nthe Yarrow algorithm which attempts to evaluate the entropic quality of its inputs.

Two of them are uncontroversial and proven: CSPRNGs named Hash_DRBG and HMAC_DRBG.The third PRNG in this standard, CTR DRBG, is based on a block cipher running in counter mode. It has an uncontroversial design but has been proven to be weaker in terms of distinguishing attack, than the security level of the underlying block cipher when the number of bits output from this PRNG is greater than two to the power of the underlying block cipher's block size in bits.When the maximum number of bits output from this PRNG is equal to the 2blocksize, the resulting output delivers the mathematically expected security level that the key size would be expected to generate, but the output is shown to not be indistinguishable from a true random number generator. When the maximum number of bits output from this PRNG is less than it, the expected security level is delivered and the output appears to be indistinguishable from a true random number generator.It is noted in the next revision that claimed security strength for CTR_DRBG depends on limiting the total number of generate requests and the bits provided per generate request.The fourth and final PRNG in this standard is named Dual EC DRBG. It has been shown to not be cryptographically secure and is believed to have a kleptographic NSA backdoor.NIST SP 800-90A Rev.1: This is essentially NIST SP 800-90A with Dual_EC_DRBG removed, and is the withdrawn standard's replacement.\nANSI X9.17-1985 Appendix C\nANSI X9.31-1998 Appendix A.2.4\nANSI X9.62-1998 Annex A.4, obsoleted by ANSI X9.62-2005, Annex D (HMAC_DRBG)A good reference is maintained by NIST.There are also standards for statistical testing of new CSPRNG designs:\n\nA Statistical Test Suite for Random and Pseudorandom Number Generators, NIST Special Publication 800-22.\n\n== NSA kleptographic backdoor in the Dual_EC_DRBG PRNG ==\n\nThe Guardian and The New York Times have reported in 2013 that the National Security Agency (NSA) inserted a backdoor into a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) of NIST SP 800-90A which allows the NSA to readily decrypt material that was encrypted with the aid of Dual EC DRBG. Both papers report that, as independent security experts long suspected,  the NSA has been introducing weaknesses into CSPRNG standard 800-90; this being confirmed for the first time by one of the top secret documents leaked to the Guardian by Edward Snowden. The NSA worked covertly to get its own version of the NIST draft security standard approved for worldwide use in 2006. The leaked document states that \"eventually, NSA became the sole editor.\" In spite of the known potential for a kleptographic backdoor and other known significant deficiencies with Dual_EC_DRBG, several companies such as RSA Security continued using Dual_EC_DRBG until the backdoor was confirmed in 2013.

      "context": "Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator\n\n==Introduction==\nA cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) or cryptographic pseudorandom number generator (CPRNG) is a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) with properties that make it suitable for use in cryptography. It is also loosely known as a cryptographic random number generator (CRNG).\n\n== Background ==\nMost cryptographic applications require random numbers, for example:\n\nkey generation\nnonces\nsalts in certain signature schemes, including ECDSA, RSASSA-PSSThe \"quality\" of the randomness required for these applications varies.\nFor example, creating a nonce in some protocols needs only uniqueness.\nOn the other hand, the generation of a master key requires a higher quality, such as more entropy. And in the case of one-time pads, the information-theoretic guarantee of perfect secrecy only holds if the key material comes from a true random source with high entropy, and thus any kind of pseudorandom number generator is insufficient.\nIdeally, the generation of random numbers in CSPRNGs uses entropy obtained from a high-quality source, generally the operating system's randomness API. However, unexpected correlations have been found in several such ostensibly independent processes. From an information-theoretic point of view, the amount of randomness, the entropy that can be generated, is equal to the entropy provided by the system. But sometimes, in practical situations, more random numbers are needed than there is entropy available. Also, the processes to extract randomness from a running system are slow in actual practice.  In such instances, a CSPRNG can sometimes be used. A CSPRNG can \"stretch\" the available entropy over more bits.\n\n== Requirements ==\nA cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) or cryptographic pseudorandom number generator (CPRNG) is a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) with properties that make it suitable for use in cryptography. It is also loosely known as a cryptographic random number generator (CRNG), which can be compared to \"true\" vs. pseudo-random numbers.\nThe requirements of an ordinary PRNG are also satisfied by a cryptographically secure PRNG, but the reverse is not true. CSPRNG requirements fall into two groups: first, that they pass statistical randomness tests; and secondly, that they hold up well under serious attack, even when part of their initial or running state becomes available to an attacker.\nEvery CSPRNG should satisfy the next-bit test. That is, given the first k bits of a random sequence, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that can predict the (k+1)th bit with probability of success non-negligibly better than 50%. Andrew Yao proved in 1982 that a generator passing the next-bit test will pass all other polynomial-time statistical tests for randomness.\nEvery CSPRNG should withstand \"state compromise extensions\". In the event that part or all of its state has been revealed (or guessed correctly), it should be impossible to reconstruct the stream of random numbers prior to the revelation. Additionally, if there is an entropy input while running, it should be infeasible to use knowledge of the input's state to predict future conditions of the CSPRNG state.Example: If the CSPRNG under consideration produces output by computing bits of \u03c0 in sequence, starting from some unknown point in the binary expansion, it may well satisfy the next-bit test and thus be statistically random, as \u03c0 appears to be a random sequence. (This would be guaranteed if \u03c0 is a normal number, for example.) However, this algorithm is not cryptographically secure; an attacker who determines which bit of pi (i.e. the state of the algorithm) is currently in use will be able to calculate all preceding bits as well.Most PRNGs are not suitable for use as CSPRNGs and will fail on both counts. First, while most PRNGs outputs appear random to assorted statistical tests, they do not resist determined reverse engineering. Specialized statistical tests may be found specially tuned to such a PRNG that shows the random numbers not to be truly random. Second, for most PRNGs, when their state has been revealed, all past random numbers can be retrodicted, allowing an attacker to read all past messages, as well as future ones.\nCSPRNGs are designed explicitly to resist this type of cryptanalysis.\n\n== Definitions ==\nIn the asymptotic setting, a family of deterministic polynomial time computable functions \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          G\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        :\n        {\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        \n          }\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        \u2192\n        {\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        \n          }\n          \n            p\n            (\n            k\n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G_{k}\\colon \\{0,1\\}^{k}\\to \\{0,1\\}^{p(k)}}\n   for some polynomial p, is a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG, or PRG in some references), if it stretches the length of its input (\n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        (\n        k\n        )\n        >\n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p(k)>k}\n   for any k), and if its output is computationally indistinguishable from true randomness, i.e. for any probabilistic polynomial time algorithm A, which outputs 1 or 0 as a distinguisher,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n          \n            \n              Pr\n              \n                x\n                \u2190\n                {\n                0\n                ,\n                1\n                \n                  }\n                  \n                    k\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            [\n            A\n            (\n            G\n            (\n            x\n            )\n            )\n\n== Entropy extraction ==\n\nSantha and Vazirani proved that several bit streams with weak randomness can be combined to produce a higher-quality quasi-random bit stream.\nEven earlier, John von Neumann proved that a simple algorithm can remove a considerable amount of the bias in any bit stream, which should be applied to each bit stream before using any variation of the Santha\u2013Vazirani design.\n\n== Designs ==\nIn the discussion below, CSPRNG designs are divided into three classes:\n\nthose based on cryptographic primitives such as ciphers and cryptographic hashes,\nthose based upon mathematical problems thought to be hard, and\nspecial-purpose designs.The last often introduces additional entropy when available and, strictly speaking, are not  \"pure\" pseudorandom number generators, as their output is not completely determined by their initial state. This addition can prevent attacks even if the initial state is compromised.\n\n\n*** Designs based on cryptographic primitives ***\nA secure block cipher can be converted into a CSPRNG by running it in counter mode. This is done by choosing a random key and encrypting a 0, then encrypting a 1, then encrypting a 2, etc.  The counter can also be started at an arbitrary number other than zero.  Assuming an n-bit block cipher the output can be distinguished from random data after around 2n/2 blocks since, following the birthday problem, colliding blocks should become likely at that point, whereas a block cipher in CTR mode will never output identical blocks.

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nCyber self-defense\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cybersecurity, cyber self-defense refers to self-defense against cyberattack. While it generally emphasizes active cybersecurity measures by computer users themselves, cyber self-defense is sometimes used to refer to the self-defense of organizations as a whole, such as corporate entities or entire nations. Surveillance self-defense is a variant of cyber self-defense and largely overlaps with it. Active and passive cybersecurity measures provide defenders with higher levels of cybersecurity, intrusion detection, incident handling and remediation capabilities.  Various sectors and organizations are legally obligated to adhere to cyber security standards.\n\n\n\n== Background ==\nOrganizations may conduct a penetration test via internal team or hire a third-party organization to audit the organization's systems. Larger organizations may conduct internal attacker-defender scenarios with a \"red team\" attacking and a \"blue team\" defending.  The defenders, namely threat hunters, system administrators, and programmers, proactively manage information systems, remediate vulnerabilities, gather cyber threat intelligence, and harden their operating systems, code, connected devices, and networks.  Blue teams may include all information and physical security personnel employed by the organization. Physical security may be tested for weaknesses, and all employees may be the target of social engineering attacks and IT security audits.  Digital and physical systems may be audited with varying degrees of knowledge of relevant systems to simulate realistic conditions for attackers and for employees, who are frequently trained in security practices and measures.  In full-knowledge test scenarios, known as white box tests, the attacking party knows all available information regarding the client's systems.  In black box tests, the attacking party is provided with no information regarding the client's systems.  Gray box tests provide limited information to the attacking party.\nCybersecurity researcher Jeffrey Carr compares cyber self-defense to martial arts as one's computer and network attack surface may be shrunk to reduce the risk of exploitation.\n\n== Measures ==\n\n\n*** Authentication ***\nEnable multi-factor authentication.\nMinimize authentication risk by limiting the number of people who know one's three common authentication factors, such as \"something you are, something you know, or something you have.\" Unique information is characterized as possessing a particular degree of usefulness to a threat actor in gaining unauthorized access to a person's information.\nReduce one's social media footprint to mitigate risk profile.\nRegularly check one's social media security and privacy settings.\nCreate strong and unique passwords for each user account and change passwords frequently and after any security incident.\nUse a password manager to avoid storing passwords in physical form.  This incurs a greater software risk profile due to potential vulnerabilities in the password management software, but mitigates the risk of breaches if one's password list were stolen or lost and in the case keyloggers were present on machine.\nPay attention to what information one might accidentally reveal in online posts.\nChange default passwords to programs and services to prevent default credential vulnerability exploitation techniques.\nAppropriately use password brute force attack prevention software such as Fail2ban or an effective equivalent.\nNever give out logins or passwords to anyone unless absolutely necessary and if so, change them immediately thereafter.\nUse security questions and answers that are impossible for anybody else to answer even if they have access to one's social media posts or engage in social engineering.\n\n\n*** Anti-social engineering measures ***\nDo not plug in found external storage devices, such as  external hard drives, USB flash drives, and other digital media.\nBeware of social engineering techniques and the six key principles, reciprocity, commitment and consistency, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity.\nBeware of shoulder surfing, wherein threat actors collect passwords and authentication information by physically observing the target user.\nBeware of piggybacking (tailgating) wherein a threat actor closely follows an authorized personnel into a secure facility.\nBeware of wardriving, wherein threat actors use mobile hacking stations to gain unauthorized access to WiFi.  Wardriving might also consist of the use of parabolic microphones to gather acoustic data, such as passwords and personally identifiable data.\nBe cautious when browsing and opening email attachments or links in emails, known as phishing.\nRefrain from interacting with fake phone calls voice fishing, also known as \"vishing\".\nScan links to malicious websites with Google Transparency Report to check for known malware.\n\n\n*** Preventative software measures ***\nUse, but do not rely solely on antivirus software, as evading it is trivial for threat actors. This is due to its reliance on an easily altered digital signature, a form of applied hash, of the previously known malicious code.\nUse an antimalware product, such as Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, in conjunction with an antivirus with vulnerability scanning features.\nUpdate and upgrade all of one's software and programs \u2014 including, but not limited to a user's operating system, firmware, software drivers, and device drivers. Use dedicated updating-software and enable automated update features.\nEncrypt one's computer and phone.\nRegularly create backups of one's data.\nUninstall insecure software such as Adobe Flash on one's operating system.

      "context": "Cyber self-defense\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cybersecurity, cyber self-defense refers to self-defense against cyberattack. While it generally emphasizes active cybersecurity measures by computer users themselves, cyber self-defense is sometimes used to refer to the self-defense of organizations as a whole, such as corporate entities or entire nations. Surveillance self-defense is a variant of cyber self-defense and largely overlaps with it. Active and passive cybersecurity measures provide defenders with higher levels of cybersecurity, intrusion detection, incident handling and remediation capabilities.  Various sectors and organizations are legally obligated to adhere to cyber security standards.\n\n\n\n== Background ==\nOrganizations may conduct a penetration test via internal team or hire a third-party organization to audit the organization's systems. Larger organizations may conduct internal attacker-defender scenarios with a \"red team\" attacking and a \"blue team\" defending.  The defenders, namely threat hunters, system administrators, and programmers, proactively manage information systems, remediate vulnerabilities, gather cyber threat intelligence, and harden their operating systems, code, connected devices, and networks.  Blue teams may include all information and physical security personnel employed by the organization. Physical security may be tested for weaknesses, and all employees may be the target of social engineering attacks and IT security audits.  Digital and physical systems may be audited with varying degrees of knowledge of relevant systems to simulate realistic conditions for attackers and for employees, who are frequently trained in security practices and measures.  In full-knowledge test scenarios, known as white box tests, the attacking party knows all available information regarding the client's systems.  In black box tests, the attacking party is provided with no information regarding the client's systems.  Gray box tests provide limited information to the attacking party.\nCybersecurity researcher Jeffrey Carr compares cyber self-defense to martial arts as one's computer and network attack surface may be shrunk to reduce the risk of exploitation.\n\n== Measures ==\n\n\n*** Authentication ***\nEnable multi-factor authentication.\nMinimize authentication risk by limiting the number of people who know one's three common authentication factors, such as \"something you are, something you know, or something you have.\" Unique information is characterized as possessing a particular degree of usefulness to a threat actor in gaining unauthorized access to a person's information.\nReduce one's social media footprint to mitigate risk profile.\nRegularly check one's social media security and privacy settings.\nCreate strong and unique passwords for each user account and change passwords frequently and after any security incident.\nUse a password manager to avoid storing passwords in physical form.  This incurs a greater software risk profile due to potential vulnerabilities in the password management software, but mitigates the risk of breaches if one's password list were stolen or lost and in the case keyloggers were present on machine.\nPay attention to what information one might accidentally reveal in online posts.\nChange default passwords to programs and services to prevent default credential vulnerability exploitation techniques.\nAppropriately use password brute force attack prevention software such as Fail2ban or an effective equivalent.\nNever give out logins or passwords to anyone unless absolutely necessary and if so, change them immediately thereafter.\nUse security questions and answers that are impossible for anybody else to answer even if they have access to one's social media posts or engage in social engineering.\n\n\n*** Anti-social engineering measures ***\nDo not plug in found external storage devices, such as  external hard drives, USB flash drives, and other digital media.\nBeware of social engineering techniques and the six key principles, reciprocity, commitment and consistency, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity.\nBeware of shoulder surfing, wherein threat actors collect passwords and authentication information by physically observing the target user.\nBeware of piggybacking (tailgating) wherein a threat actor closely follows an authorized personnel into a secure facility.\nBeware of wardriving, wherein threat actors use mobile hacking stations to gain unauthorized access to WiFi.  Wardriving might also consist of the use of parabolic microphones to gather acoustic data, such as passwords and personally identifiable data.\nBe cautious when browsing and opening email attachments or links in emails, known as phishing.\nRefrain from interacting with fake phone calls voice fishing, also known as \"vishing\".\nScan links to malicious websites with Google Transparency Report to check for known malware.\n\n\n*** Preventative software measures ***\nUse, but do not rely solely on antivirus software, as evading it is trivial for threat actors. This is due to its reliance on an easily altered digital signature, a form of applied hash, of the previously known malicious code.\nUse an antimalware product, such as Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, in conjunction with an antivirus with vulnerability scanning features.\nUpdate and upgrade all of one's software and programs \u2014 including, but not limited to a user's operating system, firmware, software drivers, and device drivers. Use dedicated updating-software and enable automated update features.\nEncrypt one's computer and phone.\nRegularly create backups of one's data.\nUninstall insecure software such as Adobe Flash on one's operating system.  Refrain from accessing web pages and related plugins within one's web browser.\nOnly run software when necessary to reduce attack surface.\nRefrain from rooting one's phone or internet-facing device.\n\n\n*** Network and information security measures ***\nUsing a firewall on Internet-connected devices.\nNot running programs, services, or browsers with a super-user or privileged user account, such as root in Linux and Unix ) or as Administrator (Windows), unless one understands the security risks of such an action.\nAvoiding free WiFi and not logging into any accounts while using it.\nAppropriately using privacy and anonymity software such as Tor (anonymity network) for anonymous web browsing, given that this attracts some attention.\nAppropriately using HTTP and various Internet Protocol proxies and security measures, such as disabling HTTP header fields, filtering, and relaying traffic with proxy servers such as Squid Proxy, proxychains, socks4, and socks5.\nPublishing public keys for PGP authentication for being able to prove one's identity.\nUsing the strongest encryption method one's router offers and updating router firmware.\nUsing an intrusion detection system(IDS) or a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management System) to alert as to indicators of compromise, such as configuration changes in the operating system, privilege escalation, network security breaches, and unauthorized remote logins.\nUsing a demilitarized zone to reduce the number of systems and services openly facing the internet.\nUsing a virtual private network with IPsec to secure traffic at the transport layer of the OSI model to harden the IP stack.\n\n\n*** Reporting breaches and incidents ***\nGather evidence and document security and data breaches (intrusions).\nContact relevant authorities, administrators or organizations in the case of a cyberattack.\nBeware of website data breaches wherein stored passwords and personally identifiable information are publicized.\nRefer to a state's statute on security breach notification laws.\n\n== \"Hacking back\" ==\nLegal theorists and policy makers are increasingly considering authorizing the private sector to take active measures by \"hacking back\" (also known as hackbacks).

This allows an intruder masquerading as B to intercept the first message, then send the second message to S constructing the second ciphertext using its own key and naming itself in the plaintext. The protocol ends with A sharing a session key with the intruder rather than B.\nG\u00fcrgens and Peralta describe another attack which they name an arity attack. In this attack the intruder intercepts the second message and replies to B using the two ciphertexts from message 2 in message 3. In the absence of any check to prevent it, M (or perhaps M,A,B) becomes the session key between A and B and is known to the intruder.\nCole describes both the G\u00fcrgens and Peralta arity attack and another attack in his book Hackers Beware. In this the intruder intercepts the first message, removes the plaintext A,B and uses that as message 4 omitting messages 2 and 3. This leaves A communicating with the intruder using M (or M,A,B) as the session key.\n\n\n*** Disruptive attacks ***\nThis attack allows the intruder to disrupt the communication but does not allow the intruder to gain access to it.\nOne problem with this protocol is that a malicious intruder can arrange for A and B to end up with different keys.

This allows an intruder masquerading as B to intercept the first message, then send the second message to S constructing the second ciphertext using its own key and naming itself in the plaintext. The protocol ends with A sharing a session key with the intruder rather than B.\nG\u00fcrgens and Peralta describe another attack which they name an arity attack. In this attack the intruder intercepts the second message and replies to B using the two ciphertexts from message 2 in message 3. In the absence of any check to prevent it, M (or perhaps M,A,B) becomes the session key between A and B and is known to the intruder.\nCole describes both the G\u00fcrgens and Peralta arity attack and another attack in his book Hackers Beware. In this the intruder intercepts the first message, removes the plaintext A,B and uses that as message 4 omitting messages 2 and 3. This leaves A communicating with the intruder using M (or M,A,B) as the session key.\n\n\n*** Disruptive attacks ***\nThis attack allows the intruder to disrupt the communication but does not allow the intruder to gain access to it.\nOne problem with this protocol is that a malicious intruder can arrange for A and B to end up with different keys. Here is how: after A and B execute the first three messages, B has received the key \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            A\n            B\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{AB}}\n  . The intruder then intercepts the fourth message. He resends message 2, which results in S generating a new key \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            A\n            B\n          \n          \u2032\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K'_{AB}}\n  , subsequently sent to B. The intruder intercepts this message too, but sends to A the part of it that B would have sent to A. So now A has finally received the expected fourth message, but with \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            A\n            B\n          \n          \u2032\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K'_{AB}}\n   instead of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          K\n          \n            A\n            B\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K_{AB}}\n  ."

    "instruction": "2022 Costa Rican ransomware attack\n\n==Introduction==\nBeginning on the night (UTC-6:00) of April 17, 2022, a ransomware attack began against nearly 30 institutions of the government of Costa Rica, including its Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications (MICITT), the National Meteorological Institute, state internet service provider RACSA, the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, CCSS), the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, the Fund for Social Development and Family Allowances, and the Administrative Board of the Municipal Electricity Service of Cartago.The pro-Russian Conti Group claimed the first group of attacks and demanded a US$10 million ransom in exchange for not releasing the information stolen from the Ministry of Finance, which could include sensitive information such as citizens' tax returns and companies operating in Costa Rica.As a consequence, the government had to shut down the computer systems used to declare taxes and for the control and management of imports and exports, causing losses to the productive sector on the order of US$30 million per day. Likewise, the web pages of the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications were removed from the network.\nCosta Rica required technical assistance from the United States, Israel, Spain, and Microsoft, among others, to deal with the cyber attack. The attack consisted of infections of computer systems with ransomware, defacement of web pages, theft of email files and attacks on the Social Security human resources portal, as well as on its official Twitter account.On May 6, 2022, the United States government through the FBI offered a US$10 million reward for information leading to the identification of a person or persons in a leadership position within the Conti Group, and an additional US$5 million for information leading to the capture or conviction, in any country, of individuals who aided or conspired to carry out Conti ransomware attacks.On May 8, 2022, the new president of Costa Rica, Rodrigo Chaves Robles, decreed a state of national emergency due to cyber attacks, considering them an act of terrorism. Days later, at a press conference, he stated that the country was in a state of war and that there was evidence that people inside Costa Rica were helping Conti, calling them \"traitors\" and \"filibusters\".On May 31, 2022, at dawn, the Hive Ransomware Group carried out an attack against the Costa Rican Social Security Fund, forcing the institution to turn off all its critical systems, including the Unique Digital Health File and the Centralized Collection System. The former stores sensitive medical information of patients using Social Security, while the latter is used to collect the population's insurance fees.\n\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n*** Conti Group ***\n\nConti Group is a criminal organization dedicated to carrying out ransomware attacks, stealing files and documents from servers and then demanding a ransom. Its modus operandi is to infect computers with the Conti malware, which operates with up to 32 individual logical threads, making it much faster than most viruses of its kind.The oldest member is known by the aliases Stern or Demon and acts as CEO. Another member known as Mango acts as the general manager and communicates frequently with Stern. Mango told Stern in a message that there were 62 people on the core team. The numbers of people involved fluctuate, reaching up to 100. Due to the constant turnover of members, the group recruits new members through legitimate job recruitment sites and hacker sites.Ordinary programmers earn $1,500 to $2,000 per month, and members who negotiate ransom payments can take a cut of the profits. In April 2021, a member of the Conti Group claimed to have an anonymous journalist take a 5% cut of ransomware payments by pressuring victims to pay.During the Russian invasion of Ukraine of 2022, the Conti Group announced its support for Russia and threatened to implement \"retaliatory measures\" if cyber-attacks were launched against the country. As a result, an anonymous person leaked approximately 60,000 internal chat log messages along with source code and other files used by the group.Opinions expressed in the leaks include support for Vladimir Putin, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and antisemitism (including towards Volodymyr Zelensky). A member known as Patrick repeated several false claims made by Putin about Ukraine. Patrick lives in Australia and may be a Russian citizen. Messages containing homophobia, misogyny and references to child abuse were also found.Conti has been responsible for hundreds of ransomware incidents since 2020. The FBI estimates that, as of January 2022, there were more than 1,000 victims of attacks associated with Conti ransomware with victim payouts exceeding $150 million, making Conti's the most damaging ransomware strain ever documented.Days after the FBI's announcement, Conti announced that they would begin a shutdown process. Some of the Conti members migrated to smaller organizations like Hive, HelloKitty, AvosLocker, BlackCat, and BlackByteo; others founded groups of their own.\n\n\n*** Hive Ransomware Group ***\nHive Ransomware Group is a criminal organization known for attacking public health organizations and institutions, particularly hospitals and clinics. It first appeared in June 2021, and according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), it works as affiliate-based ransomware. It employs a wide variety of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), creating significant challenges for defense and mitigation. Hive uses multiple mechanisms to compromise business networks, including phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain access and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move once on the network.According to a Cisco report, Hive criminals have evidenced low operational security by revealing information about their encryption process and other operational details. The report also indicates that Hive employs any and all means necessary to convince its victims to pay, including offering bribes to victims' negotiators once the ransom payment is made.In August 2021, ZDNet reported that Hive had attacked at least 28 healthcare organizations in the United States, hitting clinics and hospitals across Ohio and West Virginia. Among the victims was the Memorial Healthcare System, which was forced to have its hospitals use paper records, cancel procedures, and refer patients to other non-compromised facilities. The organization ended up paying the ransom to regain access to their systems.In December 2021, Hive revealed that it had attacked 355 companies over six months, the vast majority being in the United States. Of those, at least 104 ended up paying the ransom to get their systems back.In February 2022, four researchers from Kookmin University in South Korea discovered a vulnerability in the Hive ransomware encryption algorithm that allowed them to obtain the master key and recover the hijacked information.The specialized site TechTarget stated that the Hive Ransomware Group communicates in Russian, but that there is no information about the location of its operations.Bleeping Computer LLC reported that some of the Conti hackers migrated to organizations such as Hive; however, the group has denied having any connection with Conti, despite the fact that once the process of closing operations began and its hackers reached that other criminal group, the organization began to employ the tactic of publishing leaked data on the deep web, just as Conti did. AdvIntel expert Yelisey Boguslavskiy identified and confirmed with a high level of certainty that Conti had been working with Hive for more than half a year, since at least November 2021. According to her information, Hive was actively using the initial attack access provided by Conti. Unlike the Conti Group, Hive is not associated with direct support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, even though the ransom payment to Hive is likely to be received by the same people within Conti who claimed the group's collective alignment with the Russian government.Also in May 2022, Hive attacked the Community of Navarra, Spain, forcing a hundred institutions to use pen and paper while systems were recovered. That same month Hive also attacked the Central Bank of Zambia; however, the entity refused to pay the ransom, stating that it had the means to recover its systems, and it entered the extortionists' chat and provided a link to a \"dick pic\" with the message:\n\nSuck this dick and stop blocking banking networks thinking that you will monetize something, learn to monetizeIn July 2022, the FBI infiltrated Hive. Undercover Tampa, Florida Field Office agents acquired full access and acted as a subsidiary in the Hive network undetected for seven months, while gathering evidence and secretly generating decryption keys for victims to recover their data. in January 2023, the United States Department of Justice announced that they had dismantled Hive by seizing the group\u2019s servers, in coordination with Germany and the Netherlands.\n\n== Attacks ==\n\n\n*** Conti Group attack ***\nThe servers of the Ministry of Finance were the first to be compromised during the night of Sunday, April 17. The BetterCyber Twitter account was the first to replicate, the next day, the post on the Conti Group forum that reported the hacking of the government institution, indicating that 1 TeraByte of information had been stolen from the Virtual Tax Administration (ATV) platform, used by the government for citizens and companies to file their tax returns. In turn, the publication indicated that the data would begin to be published on April 23.Before 10 a.m. on April 18, the Ministry of Finance informed through a press release and through its social networks that, \"due to technical problems\", the ATV platform and the Customs Information System (TICA) had been disabled and that the deadline for filing and paying taxes that were due that day would be extended until the next business day after the systems were restored. The institution did not immediately acknowledge being hacked and initially refused to answer questions from the press about the Conti Group claim.The next day, Conti Group posted a new post on their forum announcing that they were asking for US$10 million in ransom for the stolen information. The Ministry of Finance confirmed that the information published so far corresponded to information from the National Customs Service, used for supplies and support.\nIn relation to the communications that have been detected on social networks, and classified as hacking, the Ministry of Finance communicates the following:\nIndeed, since early today we have been facing a situation in some of our servers, which has been attended by our staff and by external experts, who during the last few hours have tried to detect and repair the situations that are occurring.\nThis Ministry has made the decision to allow the investigation teams to carry out an in-depth analysis of the information systems, for which it has made the decision to temporarily suspend some platforms such as ATV and TICA, and services will be restarted once the teams complete their analyses.\nIn the last few hours, the exposure of some of the data belonging to the General Directorate of Customs has been detected, which is carrying out the information investigation processes, as established in the response plan.\n\nThe data identified so far are of a historical nature and are used by the National Customs Service as inputs and support.\nHours after the Treasury statement, the microsite of the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications suffered a defacement with a message reading, \"We greet you from Conti, look for us on your network.\"Jorge Mora Flores, director of Digital Governance of Costa Rica, indicated that as a result of the attack, and because the affected server hosts other pages, the decision was made to turn it off while checks were carried out to determine to what extent security was breached. Subsequently, an update on the Conti Group forum indicated that the attacks against Costa Rican ministries would continue \"until the government pays us\".Hours later, Conti attacked an email server of the National Meteorological Institute, stealing the information contained therein. Conti stated that the scenario that Costa Rica was experiencing was a \"beta version of a global cyber attack on an entire country\". Later, in another update on their forum, they indicated that if the Ministry of Finance did not inform their taxpayers of what was happening, they would carry out additional actions:\n\nIf the minister cannot explain to his taxpayers what is going on, we will: 1) have penetrated his critical infrastructure, gained access to over 800 servers, downloaded over 900 GB of databases and over 100 GB of internal documents, databases in the MSSQL mdf format, there is more than just the email, first name, last name... If the minister considers that this information is not confidential, we will publish it. The leak problem is not the Ministry's main problem, their backups were also encrypted, 70% of their infrastructure will probably not be able to be restored and we have backdoors in a large number of their ministries and private companies. We ask for a significantly small amount of what you will spend in the future. Their export business is already in trouble and they've already lost the $10 million they could have paid us.\nLater that day, the Costa Rican government denied having received a ransom request, despite Conti Group's forum post regarding the US$10 million.\n\nOn April 20, Conti published an additional 5 GB of information stolen from the Ministry of Finance. In the afternoon, the Government called a press conference at the Presidential House where it argued that the situation was under control, and that in addition to the Treasury, MICITT and the IMN, Radiograf\u00eda Costarricense S.A. (RACSA), a state internet service provider, had been attacked through an internal email server breach. In the meantime, the Costa Rican Social Security Fund reported having suffered a cyber attack on its human resources site, which was being combated. Conti Group did not claim responsibility for the attack, since the Fund reported hours later that no sensitive information was stolen from the insured, such as their medical history or contributions to pension or health insurance, and that the databases had been left behind intact.The Minister of the Presidency, Geannina Dinarte Romero, indicated that this was a case of international organized crime and that the Government of Costa Rica would not pay any ransom. She also announced that they were receiving technical assistance from the governments of the United States, Israel and Spain, as well as from Microsoft, which operated the servers of the Ministry of Finance.Early on April 21, Conti Group attacked the servers of the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, as well as the Social Development and Family Allowances Fund. The preliminary report of the government indicated that information such as emails and data on pension payments and social aid from both institutions was stolen. Likewise, the group offered a 35% discount on the amount of the ransom demanded if the Government of Costa Rica made a prompt payment. Before noon, the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications held a press conference where the Government reiterated its position of not paying the ransom demanded by the Conti Group, for which hours later the criminal group announced that it would immediately begin publishing the stolen information, urging Costa Rican cybercriminals to take advantage of it to commit phishing.\n\nPresident Carlos Alvarado Quesada gave his first public statement on the hack that day.\nI reiterate that the Costa Rican State WILL NOT PAY ANYTHING to these cybercriminals. But my opinion is that this attack is not a matter of money, but rather seeks to threaten the stability of the country, in a situation of transition. This they will not do. As we have always done, each person on this earth will do their part to defend Costa Rica.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Government issued a directive addressed to the public sector in order to protect the proper functioning, confidentiality and cybersecurity of public institutions. The document provides that, in the event of any situation that affects the confidentiality, availability and integrity of services available to the public, the continuity of institutional functions, or the identity theft of the institution on social networks\u2014even those that within the institution are considered to be under control\u2014the Computer Security Incident Response Center (CSIRT-CR) must be informed of the event. In addition, agencies are required to back up information regarding the incident for use in investigations. Likewise, institutions must carry out maintenance of their telecommunications infrastructure\u2014whether through public employees or private contractors\u2014including regular updates of institutional systems, changing passwords of all institutional systems and networks, disabling unnecessary services and ports, and monitoring network infrastructure, as well as taking heed of alerts from the CSIRT-CR. The guideline also orders a vulnerability scan to be carried out at least twice a year on the official websites of the government of Costa Rica.On the morning of April 22, the government reported that no new Conti Group attacks against the country had been recorded since the previous day. However, the director of Digital Governance, Jorge Mora, explained that since Monday, when they began to take preventive measures in state institutions, they have detected 35,000 malware communication requests, 9,900 phishing incidents, 60,000 attempts to take remote control of IT systems, and 60,000 attempts to mine cryptocurrencies using the computer infrastructure of the first 100 state institutions intervened.On April 23, the Conti Group attacked the Administrative Board of the Municipal Electrical Service of Cartago, the public company in charge of electricity supply in the province of Cartago. Jorge Mora Flores reported that day that subscriber information could have been compromised; the next day, he reported that the institution's accounting and human resources information was encrypted as part of the attack.On April 25, Conti announced that it would shift its strategy from attacking state institutions to focus on large companies in the private sector; in addition, it would stop announcing its hacks on its deep web page to focus on requesting ransoms for stolen and encrypted information.On April 26, the MICITT reported that the website of the Sede Interuniversitaria de Alajuela, a multi-university campus, was attacked; in addition, there was an attempt to breach the servers of the Rural Development Institute, which was effectively repelled. On April 29, the government reported a hacking attempt to the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Commerce and a day later against the National Liquor Factory and the municipalities of Turrialba and Golfito.On May 2, another hacking attempt was reported at the Ministry of Justice and Peace (MJP), although it was rebuffed. The next day, unsuccessful cyberattacks were reported on the municipalities of Garabito and Alajuelita, as well as on the San Jos\u00e9 Social Protection Board, a national charitable organization that administers the country's national lottery.On May 4, MICITT reported hacking attempts to the National Education Loan Commission and one more to the Cartago University College (CUC), although the latter was not Conti's responsibility.\nNearly two months after the original attack, on June 11, the Ministry of Finance announced that the ATV tax system would be restarted on June 13 so that Costa Ricans could make their payments. On June 24, two other systems disabled by Conti attacks were restored: TICA (Spanish: Tecnolog\u00eda de Informaci\u00f3n para el Control Aduanero, Customs Control Information Technology) and Exonet, a platform used to manage and process tax exemption requests.\n\n\n*** Hive Ransomware Group attack ***\nOn May 31 at two in the morning (UTC-6:00), the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (CCSS) detected anomalous information flows in its systems and began to receive reports from different hospitals of unusual behavior in various computers; it immediately proceeded to turn off all its critical systems, including the Single Digital Health File (Expediente Digital \u00danico en Salud, EDUS) and the Centralized Collection System. Some printers in the institution printed messages with random codes or characters, while others printed default instructions from the Hive Ransomware Group on how to regain access to systems.In a press conference before noon, CCSS officials described the attack as \"exceptionally violent\" and detailed that the first incidents were recorded at the San Vicente de Paul Hospital, in the province of Heredia and then in the Hospital of Liberia, province of Guanacaste; from there, attacks were carried out on the hospitals of the Greater Metropolitan Area. The president of the CCSS, \u00c1lvaro Ramos Chaves, affirmed that databases with sensitive information were not compromised but noted that at least thirty servers (of the more than 1,500 that the institution has) were contaminated with ransomware. He added that they had a plan to restore the systems, but that it would take time because each piece of equipment had to be reviewed to ensure hackers no longer had access.As a consequence, a number of insured persons saw their medical appointments cancelled. The CCSS medical centers had to resort to running on paper, as the digital backup system, the Digital File in a Contingency Environment (Expediente Digital en Ambiente de Contingencia, EDAC), was also taken down as a security measure, a situation that could remain that way for an indefinite period. Medical facilities were left without access to the EDUS, EDAC, and such systems including the hospital occupancy control system (ARCA) and billing. Financial areas of the CCSS were unable to use systems including the Centralized Collection System (SICERE), the Disability Control and Payment Registry (RCPI), and the Integrated Voucher System (SICO). Offices and administrative areas were unable to use computers; teleworkers could only access Office 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams).In total, on the first day of effects from the cyberattack, 4,871 users missed their medical appointments, with another 12,000 missing appointments the next day. The CCSS reported that the laboratory service was the most affected, with only 45 percent operating normally and 48 percent partially affected. A review of 108 health establishments showed that 96% of hospital services operated with a contingency plan, 18% of outpatient consultations were partially affected, 19% of radiology and medical imaging services were partially affected, and 37% of pharmacy services were affected.On June 1, during a press conference at the Presidential Palace, the executive president of the CCSS, \u00c1lvaro Ramos Chaves, announced the opening of an administrative investigation against the agency's Information Technology Department for the hack, to determine if there was negligence. President Chaves Robles noted that fewer than 15 CCSS computers had the microCLAUDIA system donated by Spain installed after the Conti attacks. Ramos Chaves also revealed that the effects of the attack were 27 times greater than what was reported on the first day: more than 800 servers and 9,000 end-user computers were affected, making it impossible to restore all systems within a week as initially planned.On June 2, the Hive Ransomware Group requested $5 million in bitcoin so that the CCSS could get its services back.On June 4, the Superintendency of Pensions (SUPEN) announced the suspension until further notice of the possibility of freely transferring complementary pension funds between the different operators, since this required one of the CCSS systems that was affected by the hack.Given the fall of its systems for reporting payroll and payment of social contributions, the CCSS had to extend until June 10 the deadline for employers to submit the payroll corresponding to the month of May. Likewise, it announced that self-employed and voluntary insured workers would not be able to pay their monthly installments due to the impossibility of making the corresponding invoice. The pension scheme for Disability, Old Age and Death (IVM) had to enable bank accounts and specific email accounts so that people with mortgage loans could pay their monthly payments and report the installments. Likewise, 163 health establishments of the CCSS set up telephone lines for the population to answer questions regarding the continuity of services and the status of their medical appointments.\n\n== Declaration of emergency ==\nOn April 22, the then president-elect of Costa Rica, Rodrigo Chaves Robles, announced his intention to declare a national state of emergency once he assumed power due to the cyberattacks against the country's public sector.On May 3, the Costa Rican Chamber of Industries (CICR), the National Chamber of Freight Carriers (CANATRAC), the Costa Rican Chamber of Foreign Trade (CRECEX), the Chamber of Fiscal and General Deposit Warehouses (CAMALFI), the Costa Rican Chamber of Shippers (NAVE), the Chamber of Exporters of Costa Rica (CADEXCO) and the Association of Customs Agents (AAACR) requested to declare a state of emergency due to the situation of the country's customs as a result of the Conti hack; they warned that within a few days, if the situation did not improve, Costa Rica could face a paralysis of international trade due to the accumulation of cargo containers, since Customs had to carry out procedures on paper, raising the wait to three or even four days to receive approval to move the containers.On May 8, upon assuming power, Chaves Robles signed Executive Decree No. 43542-MP-MICITT, declaring a state of national emergency due to cyberattacks against the public sector in Costa Rica and ordered the Presidency of the Republic to take control of the coordination of the national response, in lieu of the National Emergency Commission, which by law manages situations of declared national emergency.On May 16, President Chaves affirmed that the country was in a state of war due to Conti's hacks and denounced that there were nationals helping the \"terrorist group\" that the previous weekend had threatened to overthrow the newly elected government.\nWe don't know, we don't have information about who is paying us taxes correctly and incorrectly. There is a huge impact on the international trade process since the Customs TICA system is not working. We don't know how the country's budget execution is progressing: Costa Rica doesn't know how much of the budget each person is spending, whether we are going to pay ourselves or not. We are paying salaries almost blindly based on previous payrolls, which represents a huge challenge for the future. What happens if someone surpasses you due to an extraordinary staff and we are repeating the same payroll? There are people who are being paid less by the State than they should be for using old forms. This represents a huge risk because the systems are not flexible to recover excess payments. We have 27 institutions attacked and 9 institutions very affected, including the Ministry of Finance, which is the one that receives the income and makes the expenses of the State. They want to drown us through the financial system of the State's public finances.\nThe next day, dozens of workers from the Ministry of Public Education (MEP) took to the streets to protest the non-payment of their salaries\u2014 payments less than what was due, among other problems related to the impossibility of updating the state payroll due to the hack. The MEP estimated that 16,000 workers were affected, of whom 3,000 did not receive any payments at all. The Ministry of Finance, as a contingency measure, provided a tool that had to be filled out by hand to update employee payments.On May 21, due to new protests, the unions negotiated with the government, which promised to pay the amounts owed and subsequently recover any sums overpaid to the workers. On May 27, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice upheld more than 200 recursos de amparo filed against the state by MEP workers affected in the payment of their salaries and ordered contingency measures to reconcile payments within a month. On May 30, the government announced that the MEP and the Finance Ministry had paid more than 6 billion colones as an extraordinary payroll corresponding to 25,618 movements pending cancellation due to the hack.\n\nQ: What was the impact of the Conti Group's attack on the Ministry of Finance, and how did the government respond to the situation?",

      "context": "2022 Costa Rican ransomware attack\n\n==Introduction==\nBeginning on the night (UTC-6:00) of April 17, 2022, a ransomware attack began against nearly 30 institutions of the government of Costa Rica, including its Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications (MICITT), the National Meteorological Institute, state internet service provider RACSA, the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, CCSS), the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, the Fund for Social Development and Family Allowances, and the Administrative Board of the Municipal Electricity Service of Cartago.The pro-Russian Conti Group claimed the first group of attacks and demanded a US$10 million ransom in exchange for not releasing the information stolen from the Ministry of Finance, which could include sensitive information such as citizens' tax returns and companies operating in Costa Rica.As a consequence, the government had to shut down the computer systems used to declare taxes and for the control and management of imports and exports, causing losses to the productive sector on the order of US$30 million per day. Likewise, the web pages of the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications were removed from the network.\nCosta Rica required technical assistance from the United States, Israel, Spain, and Microsoft, among others, to deal with the cyber attack. The attack consisted of infections of computer systems with ransomware, defacement of web pages, theft of email files and attacks on the Social Security human resources portal, as well as on its official Twitter account.On May 6, 2022, the United States government through the FBI offered a US$10 million reward for information leading to the identification of a person or persons in a leadership position within the Conti Group, and an additional US$5 million for information leading to the capture or conviction, in any country, of individuals who aided or conspired to carry out Conti ransomware attacks.On May 8, 2022, the new president of Costa Rica, Rodrigo Chaves Robles, decreed a state of national emergency due to cyber attacks, considering them an act of terrorism. Days later, at a press conference, he stated that the country was in a state of war and that there was evidence that people inside Costa Rica were helping Conti, calling them \"traitors\" and \"filibusters\".On May 31, 2022, at dawn, the Hive Ransomware Group carried out an attack against the Costa Rican Social Security Fund, forcing the institution to turn off all its critical systems, including the Unique Digital Health File and the Centralized Collection System. The former stores sensitive medical information of patients using Social Security, while the latter is used to collect the population's insurance fees.\n\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n*** Conti Group ***\n\nConti Group is a criminal organization dedicated to carrying out ransomware attacks, stealing files and documents from servers and then demanding a ransom. Its modus operandi is to infect computers with the Conti malware, which operates with up to 32 individual logical threads, making it much faster than most viruses of its kind.The oldest member is known by the aliases Stern or Demon and acts as CEO. Another member known as Mango acts as the general manager and communicates frequently with Stern. Mango told Stern in a message that there were 62 people on the core team. The numbers of people involved fluctuate, reaching up to 100. Due to the constant turnover of members, the group recruits new members through legitimate job recruitment sites and hacker sites.Ordinary programmers earn $1,500 to $2,000 per month, and members who negotiate ransom payments can take a cut of the profits. In April 2021, a member of the Conti Group claimed to have an anonymous journalist take a 5% cut of ransomware payments by pressuring victims to pay.During the Russian invasion of Ukraine of 2022, the Conti Group announced its support for Russia and threatened to implement \"retaliatory measures\" if cyber-attacks were launched against the country. As a result, an anonymous person leaked approximately 60,000 internal chat log messages along with source code and other files used by the group.Opinions expressed in the leaks include support for Vladimir Putin, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and antisemitism (including towards Volodymyr Zelensky). A member known as Patrick repeated several false claims made by Putin about Ukraine. Patrick lives in Australia and may be a Russian citizen. Messages containing homophobia, misogyny and references to child abuse were also found.Conti has been responsible for hundreds of ransomware incidents since 2020. The FBI estimates that, as of January 2022, there were more than 1,000 victims of attacks associated with Conti ransomware with victim payouts exceeding $150 million, making Conti's the most damaging ransomware strain ever documented.Days after the FBI's announcement, Conti announced that they would begin a shutdown process. Some of the Conti members migrated to smaller organizations like Hive, HelloKitty, AvosLocker, BlackCat, and BlackByteo; others founded groups of their own.\n\n\n*** Hive Ransomware Group ***\nHive Ransomware Group is a criminal organization known for attacking public health organizations and institutions, particularly hospitals and clinics. It first appeared in June 2021, and according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), it works as affiliate-based ransomware. It employs a wide variety of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), creating significant challenges for defense and mitigation. Hive uses multiple mechanisms to compromise business networks, including phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain access and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move once on the network.According to a Cisco report, Hive criminals have evidenced low operational security by revealing information about their encryption process and other operational details. The report also indicates that Hive employs any and all means necessary to convince its victims to pay, including offering bribes to victims' negotiators once the ransom payment is made.In August 2021, ZDNet reported that Hive had attacked at least 28 healthcare organizations in the United States, hitting clinics and hospitals across Ohio and West Virginia. Among the victims was the Memorial Healthcare System, which was forced to have its hospitals use paper records, cancel procedures, and refer patients to other non-compromised facilities. The organization ended up paying the ransom to regain access to their systems.In December 2021, Hive revealed that it had attacked 355 companies over six months, the vast majority being in the United States. Of those, at least 104 ended up paying the ransom to get their systems back.In February 2022, four researchers from Kookmin University in South Korea discovered a vulnerability in the Hive ransomware encryption algorithm that allowed them to obtain the master key and recover the hijacked information.The specialized site TechTarget stated that the Hive Ransomware Group communicates in Russian, but that there is no information about the location of its operations.Bleeping Computer LLC reported that some of the Conti hackers migrated to organizations such as Hive; however, the group has denied having any connection with Conti, despite the fact that once the process of closing operations began and its hackers reached that other criminal group, the organization began to employ the tactic of publishing leaked data on the deep web, just as Conti did. AdvIntel expert Yelisey Boguslavskiy identified and confirmed with a high level of certainty that Conti had been working with Hive for more than half a year, since at least November 2021. According to her information, Hive was actively using the initial attack access provided by Conti. Unlike the Conti Group, Hive is not associated with direct support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, even though the ransom payment to Hive is likely to be received by the same people within Conti who claimed the group's collective alignment with the Russian government.Also in May 2022, Hive attacked the Community of Navarra, Spain, forcing a hundred institutions to use pen and paper while systems were recovered. That same month Hive also attacked the Central Bank of Zambia; however, the entity refused to pay the ransom, stating that it had the means to recover its systems, and it entered the extortionists' chat and provided a link to a \"dick pic\" with the message:\n\nSuck this dick and stop blocking banking networks thinking that you will monetize something, learn to monetizeIn July 2022, the FBI infiltrated Hive. Undercover Tampa, Florida Field Office agents acquired full access and acted as a subsidiary in the Hive network undetected for seven months, while gathering evidence and secretly generating decryption keys for victims to recover their data. in January 2023, the United States Department of Justice announced that they had dismantled Hive by seizing the group\u2019s servers, in coordination with Germany and the Netherlands.\n\n== Attacks ==\n\n\n*** Conti Group attack ***\nThe servers of the Ministry of Finance were the first to be compromised during the night of Sunday, April 17. The BetterCyber Twitter account was the first to replicate, the next day, the post on the Conti Group forum that reported the hacking of the government institution, indicating that 1 TeraByte of information had been stolen from the Virtual Tax Administration (ATV) platform, used by the government for citizens and companies to file their tax returns. In turn, the publication indicated that the data would begin to be published on April 23.Before 10 a.m. on April 18, the Ministry of Finance informed through a press release and through its social networks that, \"due to technical problems\", the ATV platform and the Customs Information System (TICA) had been disabled and that the deadline for filing and paying taxes that were due that day would be extended until the next business day after the systems were restored. The institution did not immediately acknowledge being hacked and initially refused to answer questions from the press about the Conti Group claim.The next day, Conti Group posted a new post on their forum announcing that they were asking for US$10 million in ransom for the stolen information. The Ministry of Finance confirmed that the information published so far corresponded to information from the National Customs Service, used for supplies and support.\nIn relation to the communications that have been detected on social networks, and classified as hacking, the Ministry of Finance communicates the following:\nIndeed, since early today we have been facing a situation in some of our servers, which has been attended by our staff and by external experts, who during the last few hours have tried to detect and repair the situations that are occurring.\nThis Ministry has made the decision to allow the investigation teams to carry out an in-depth analysis of the information systems, for which it has made the decision to temporarily suspend some platforms such as ATV and TICA, and services will be restarted once the teams complete their analyses.\nIn the last few hours, the exposure of some of the data belonging to the General Directorate of Customs has been detected, which is carrying out the information investigation processes, as established in the response plan.\n\nThe data identified so far are of a historical nature and are used by the National Customs Service as inputs and support.\nHours after the Treasury statement, the microsite of the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications suffered a defacement with a message reading, \"We greet you from Conti, look for us on your network.\"Jorge Mora Flores, director of Digital Governance of Costa Rica, indicated that as a result of the attack, and because the affected server hosts other pages, the decision was made to turn it off while checks were carried out to determine to what extent security was breached. Subsequently, an update on the Conti Group forum indicated that the attacks against Costa Rican ministries would continue \"until the government pays us\".Hours later, Conti attacked an email server of the National Meteorological Institute, stealing the information contained therein. Conti stated that the scenario that Costa Rica was experiencing was a \"beta version of a global cyber attack on an entire country\". Later, in another update on their forum, they indicated that if the Ministry of Finance did not inform their taxpayers of what was happening, they would carry out additional actions:\n\nIf the minister cannot explain to his taxpayers what is going on, we will: 1) have penetrated his critical infrastructure, gained access to over 800 servers, downloaded over 900 GB of databases and over 100 GB of internal documents, databases in the MSSQL mdf format, there is more than just the email, first name, last name... If the minister considers that this information is not confidential, we will publish it. The leak problem is not the Ministry's main problem, their backups were also encrypted, 70% of their infrastructure will probably not be able to be restored and we have backdoors in a large number of their ministries and private companies. We ask for a significantly small amount of what you will spend in the future. Their export business is already in trouble and they've already lost the $10 million they could have paid us.\nLater that day, the Costa Rican government denied having received a ransom request, despite Conti Group's forum post regarding the US$10 million.\n\nOn April 20, Conti published an additional 5 GB of information stolen from the Ministry of Finance. In the afternoon, the Government called a press conference at the Presidential House where it argued that the situation was under control, and that in addition to the Treasury, MICITT and the IMN, Radiograf\u00eda Costarricense S.A. (RACSA), a state internet service provider, had been attacked through an internal email server breach. In the meantime, the Costa Rican Social Security Fund reported having suffered a cyber attack on its human resources site, which was being combated. Conti Group did not claim responsibility for the attack, since the Fund reported hours later that no sensitive information was stolen from the insured, such as their medical history or contributions to pension or health insurance, and that the databases had been left behind intact.The Minister of the Presidency, Geannina Dinarte Romero, indicated that this was a case of international organized crime and that the Government of Costa Rica would not pay any ransom. She also announced that they were receiving technical assistance from the governments of the United States, Israel and Spain, as well as from Microsoft, which operated the servers of the Ministry of Finance.Early on April 21, Conti Group attacked the servers of the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, as well as the Social Development and Family Allowances Fund. The preliminary report of the government indicated that information such as emails and data on pension payments and social aid from both institutions was stolen. Likewise, the group offered a 35% discount on the amount of the ransom demanded if the Government of Costa Rica made a prompt payment. Before noon, the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications held a press conference where the Government reiterated its position of not paying the ransom demanded by the Conti Group, for which hours later the criminal group announced that it would immediately begin publishing the stolen information, urging Costa Rican cybercriminals to take advantage of it to commit phishing.\n\nPresident Carlos Alvarado Quesada gave his first public statement on the hack that day.\nI reiterate that the Costa Rican State WILL NOT PAY ANYTHING to these cybercriminals. But my opinion is that this attack is not a matter of money, but rather seeks to threaten the stability of the country, in a situation of transition. This they will not do. As we have always done, each person on this earth will do their part to defend Costa Rica.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Government issued a directive addressed to the public sector in order to protect the proper functioning, confidentiality and cybersecurity of public institutions. The document provides that, in the event of any situation that affects the confidentiality, availability and integrity of services available to the public, the continuity of institutional functions, or the identity theft of the institution on social networks\u2014even those that within the institution are considered to be under control\u2014the Computer Security Incident Response Center (CSIRT-CR) must be informed of the event. In addition, agencies are required to back up information regarding the incident for use in investigations. Likewise, institutions must carry out maintenance of their telecommunications infrastructure\u2014whether through public employees or private contractors\u2014including regular updates of institutional systems, changing passwords of all institutional systems and networks, disabling unnecessary services and ports, and monitoring network infrastructure, as well as taking heed of alerts from the CSIRT-CR. The guideline also orders a vulnerability scan to be carried out at least twice a year on the official websites of the government of Costa Rica.On the morning of April 22, the government reported that no new Conti Group attacks against the country had been recorded since the previous day. However, the director of Digital Governance, Jorge Mora, explained that since Monday, when they began to take preventive measures in state institutions, they have detected 35,000 malware communication requests, 9,900 phishing incidents, 60,000 attempts to take remote control of IT systems, and 60,000 attempts to mine cryptocurrencies using the computer infrastructure of the first 100 state institutions intervened.On April 23, the Conti Group attacked the Administrative Board of the Municipal Electrical Service of Cartago, the public company in charge of electricity supply in the province of Cartago. Jorge Mora Flores reported that day that subscriber information could have been compromised; the next day, he reported that the institution's accounting and human resources information was encrypted as part of the attack.On April 25, Conti announced that it would shift its strategy from attacking state institutions to focus on large companies in the private sector; in addition, it would stop announcing its hacks on its deep web page to focus on requesting ransoms for stolen and encrypted information.On April 26, the MICITT reported that the website of the Sede Interuniversitaria de Alajuela, a multi-university campus, was attacked; in addition, there was an attempt to breach the servers of the Rural Development Institute, which was effectively repelled. On April 29, the government reported a hacking attempt to the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Commerce and a day later against the National Liquor Factory and the municipalities of Turrialba and Golfito.On May 2, another hacking attempt was reported at the Ministry of Justice and Peace (MJP), although it was rebuffed. The next day, unsuccessful cyberattacks were reported on the municipalities of Garabito and Alajuelita, as well as on the San Jos\u00e9 Social Protection Board, a national charitable organization that administers the country's national lottery.On May 4, MICITT reported hacking attempts to the National Education Loan Commission and one more to the Cartago University College (CUC), although the latter was not Conti's responsibility.\nNearly two months after the original attack, on June 11, the Ministry of Finance announced that the ATV tax system would be restarted on June 13 so that Costa Ricans could make their payments. On June 24, two other systems disabled by Conti attacks were restored: TICA (Spanish: Tecnolog\u00eda de Informaci\u00f3n para el Control Aduanero, Customs Control Information Technology) and Exonet, a platform used to manage and process tax exemption requests.\n\n\n*** Hive Ransomware Group attack ***\nOn May 31 at two in the morning (UTC-6:00), the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (CCSS) detected anomalous information flows in its systems and began to receive reports from different hospitals of unusual behavior in various computers; it immediately proceeded to turn off all its critical systems, including the Single Digital Health File (Expediente Digital \u00danico en Salud, EDUS) and the Centralized Collection System.

The pension scheme for Disability, Old Age and Death (IVM) had to enable bank accounts and specific email accounts so that people with mortgage loans could pay their monthly payments and report the installments. Likewise, 163 health establishments of the CCSS set up telephone lines for the population to answer questions regarding the continuity of services and the status of their medical appointments.\n\n== Declaration of emergency ==\nOn April 22, the then president-elect of Costa Rica, Rodrigo Chaves Robles, announced his intention to declare a national state of emergency once he assumed power due to the cyberattacks against the country's public sector.On May 3, the Costa Rican Chamber of Industries (CICR), the National Chamber of Freight Carriers (CANATRAC), the Costa Rican Chamber of Foreign Trade (CRECEX), the Chamber of Fiscal and General Deposit Warehouses (CAMALFI), the Costa Rican Chamber of Shippers (NAVE), the Chamber of Exporters of Costa Rica (CADEXCO) and the Association of Customs Agents (AAACR) requested to declare a state of emergency due to the situation of the country's customs as a result of the Conti hack; they warned that within a few days, if the situation did not improve, Costa Rica could face a paralysis of international trade due to the accumulation of cargo containers, since Customs had to carry out procedures on paper, raising the wait to three or even four days to receive approval to move the containers.On May 8, upon assuming power, Chaves Robles signed Executive Decree No. 43542-MP-MICITT, declaring a state of national emergency due to cyberattacks against the public sector in Costa Rica and ordered the Presidency of the Republic to take control of the coordination of the national response, in lieu of the National Emergency Commission, which by law manages situations of declared national emergency.On May 16, President Chaves affirmed that the country was in a state of war due to Conti's hacks and denounced that there were nationals helping the \"terrorist group\" that the previous weekend had threatened to overthrow the newly elected government.\nWe don't know, we don't have information about who is paying us taxes correctly and incorrectly. There is a huge impact on the international trade process since the Customs TICA system is not working. We don't know how the country's budget execution is progressing: Costa Rica doesn't know how much of the budget each person is spending, whether we are going to pay ourselves or not. We are paying salaries almost blindly based on previous payrolls, which represents a huge challenge for the future. What happens if someone surpasses you due to an extraordinary staff and we are repeating the same payroll? There are people who are being paid less by the State than they should be for using old forms. This represents a huge risk because the systems are not flexible to recover excess payments. We have 27 institutions attacked and 9 institutions very affected, including the Ministry of Finance, which is the one that receives the income and makes the expenses of the State. They want to drown us through the financial system of the State's public finances.\nThe next day, dozens of workers from the Ministry of Public Education (MEP) took to the streets to protest the non-payment of their salaries\u2014 payments less than what was due, among other problems related to the impossibility of updating the state payroll due to the hack. The MEP estimated that 16,000 workers were affected, of whom 3,000 did not receive any payments at all. The Ministry of Finance, as a contingency measure, provided a tool that had to be filled out by hand to update employee payments.On May 21, due to new protests, the unions negotiated with the government, which promised to pay the amounts owed and subsequently recover any sums overpaid to the workers. On May 27, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice upheld more than 200 recursos de amparo filed against the state by MEP workers affected in the payment of their salaries and ordered contingency measures to reconcile payments within a month. On May 30, the government announced that the MEP and the Finance Ministry had paid more than 6 billion colones as an extraordinary payroll corresponding to 25,618 movements pending cancellation due to the hack."

It was launched in July 2011, but after failing to achieve traction, Mozilla announced in January 2016 plans to decommission the service by the end of the year.\n\n== History and motivations ==\nPersona was launched in July 2011 and shared some of its goals with some similar authentication systems like OpenID or Facebook Connect, but it was different in several ways:\n\nIt used email addresses as identifiers\nIt was more focused on privacy\nIt was intended to be fully integrated in the browser (relying heavily on Javascript).The privacy goal was motivated by the fact that the identity provider does not know which website the user is identifying on. It was first released in July 2011 and fully deployed by Mozilla on its own websites in January 2012.In March 2014, Mozilla indicated it was dropping full-time developers from Persona and moving the project to community ownership. Mozilla indicated, however, that it had no plans to decommission Persona and would maintain some level of involvement such as in maintenance and reviewing pull requests.Persona services are shut down since November 30, 2016.\n\n== Principles and implementation ==\nPersona was inspired by the VerifiedEmailProtocol which is now known as the BrowserID protocol. It uses any user email address to identify its owner. This protocol involves the browser, an identity provider, and any compliant website.\n\n\n*** The browser, the provider and the website ***\nThe browser stores a list of user verified email addresses (certificates issued by the identity providers), and demonstrates the user's ownership of the addresses to the website using cryptographic proof.\nThe certificates must be renewed every 24 hours by logging into the identity provider (which will usually mean entering the email and a password in a Web form on the identity provider's site). Once done, they will be usable for authenticating to web sites with the same browser for the rest of the day, without entering passwords again (single sign-on).\nThe decentralization aspects of the protocol reside in the theoretical support of any identity provider service, while in practice it seems to rely mainly on Mozilla's servers currently (which may in turn delegate email address verification, see identity bridging below). However, even if the protocol heavily relies on a central identity provider, this central actor only knows when browsers renew certificates, and cannot in principle monitor where the certificates will be used.\n\n\n*** Identity bridging ***\nMozilla announced \"identity bridging\" support for Persona in July, 2013. As they describe on their blog: \"Traditionally ... Mozilla would send you an email and ask you to click on the confirmation link it contained. With Identity Bridging, Persona learned a new trick; instead of sending confirmation emails, Persona can ask you to verify your identity via your email provider\u2019s existing OpenID or OAuth gateway.\"\nThis announcement included support for existing users of the Yahoo Mail service. In August 2013, Mozilla announced support for Identity Bridging with all Gmail accounts. They wrote in this additional announcement that \"combined with our Identity Bridge for Yahoo, Persona now natively supports more than 700,000,000 active email users. That covers roughly 60\u201380% of people on most North American websites.\"\n\n== Deployment ==\nPersona relies heavily on the JavaScript client-side program running in the user's browser, making it widely usable.\nSupport of authentication to Web applications via Persona can be implemented by CMSs such as Drupal, Serendipity, WordPress, Tiki or SPIP. There is also support for Persona in the Phonegap platform (used for compiling HTML5 apps into mobile apps). Mozilla provides its own Persona server at persona.org.

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nOperation Aurora\n\n==Introduction==\nOperation Aurora was a series of cyber attacks conducted by advanced persistent threats such as the Elderwood Group based in Beijing, China, with ties to the People's Liberation Army. First publicly disclosed by Google on January 12, 2010, in a blog post, the attacks began in mid-2009 and continued through December 2009.The attack was aimed at dozens of other organizations, of which Adobe Systems, Akamai Technologies, Juniper Networks, and Rackspace have publicly confirmed that they were targeted. According to media reports, Yahoo, Symantec, Northrop Grumman, Morgan Stanley, and Dow Chemical were also among the targets.\nAs a result of the attack, Google stated in its blog that it plans to operate a completely uncensored version of its search engine in China \"within the law, if at all,\" and acknowledged that if this is not possible, it may leave China and close its Chinese offices. Official Chinese sources claimed this was part of a strategy developed by the U.S. government.The attack was named \"Operation Aurora\" by Dmitri Alperovitch, Vice President of Threat Research at cybersecurity company McAfee. Research by McAfee Labs discovered that \"Aurora\" was part of the file path on the attacker's machine that was included in two of the malware binaries McAfee said were associated with the attack. \"We believe the name was the internal name the attacker(s) gave to this operation,\" McAfee Chief Technology Officer George Kurtz said in a blog post.According to McAfee, the primary goal of the attack was to gain access to and potentially modify source code repositories at these high-tech, security, and defense contractor companies. \"[The SCMs] were wide open,\" says Alperovitch. \"No one ever thought about securing them, yet these were the crown jewels of most of these companies in many ways\u2014much more valuable than any financial or personally identifiable data that they may have and spend so much time and effort protecting.\"\n\n== Attackers involved ==\n\nTechnical evidence including IP addresses, domain names, malware signatures, and other factors, show Elderwood was behind the Operation Aurora attack. The \"Elderwood\" group was named by Symantec (after a source-code variable used by the attackers), and is referred to as the \"Beijing Group\" by Dell Secureworks. The group obtained some of Google's source code, as well as access to information about Chinese activists. Elderwood also targeted numerous other companies in the shipping, aeronautics, arms, energy, manufacturing, engineering, electronics, financial, and software sectors.The \"APT\" designation for the Chinese threat actors responsible for attacking Google is APT17.Elderwood specializes in attacking and infiltrating second-tier defense industry suppliers that make electronic or mechanical components for top defense companies. Those firms then become a cyber \"stepping stone\" to gain access to top-tier defense contractors. One attack procedure used by Elderwood is to infect legitimate websites frequented by employees of the target company \u2013 a so-called \"water hole\" attack, just as lions stake out a watering hole for their prey. Elderwood infects these less-secure sites with malware that downloads to a computer that clicks on the site. After that, the group searches inside the network to which the infected computer is connected, finding and then downloading executives' e-mails and critical documents on company plans, decisions, acquisitions, and product designs.\n\n== Attack analysis ==\nIn its blog posting, Google stated that some of its intellectual property had been stolen. It suggested that the attackers were interested in accessing Gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents. According to the Financial Times, two accounts used by Ai Weiwei had been attacked, their contents read and copied;  his bank accounts were investigated by state security agents who claimed he was under investigation for \"unspecified suspected crimes\". However, the attackers were only able to view details on two accounts and those details were limited to things such as the subject line and the accounts' creation date.Security experts immediately noted the sophistication of the attack. Two days after the attack became public, McAfee reported that the attackers had exploited purported zero-day vulnerabilities (unfixed and previously unknown to the target system developers) in Internet Explorer and dubbed the attack \"Operation Aurora\". A week after the report by McAfee, Microsoft issued a fix for the issue, and admitted that they had known about the security hole used since September. Additional vulnerabilities were found in Perforce, the source code revision software used by Google to manage their source code.VeriSign's iDefense Labs claimed that the attacks were perpetrated by \"agents of the Chinese state or proxies thereof\".According to a diplomatic cable from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, a Chinese source reported that the Chinese Politburo directed the intrusion into Google's computer systems. The cable suggested that the attack was part of a coordinated campaign executed by \"government operatives, public security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the Chinese government.\" The report suggested that it was part of an ongoing campaign in which attackers have \"broken into American government computers and those of Western allies, the Dalai Lama and American businesses since 2002.\" According to The Guardian's reporting on the leak, the attacks were \"orchestrated by a senior member of the Politburo who typed his own name into the global version of the search engine and found articles criticising him personally.\"Once a victim's system was compromised, a backdoor connection that masqueraded as an SSL connection made connections to command and control servers running in Illinois, Texas, and Taiwan, including machines that were running under stolen Rackspace customer accounts.  The victim's machine then began exploring the protected corporate intranet that it was a part of, searching for other vulnerable systems as well as sources of intellectual property, specifically the contents of source code repositories.\nThe attacks were thought to have definitively ended on Jan 4 when the command and control servers were taken down, although it is not known at this point whether or not the attackers intentionally shut them down. However, the attacks were still occurring as of February 2010.\n\n== Response and aftermath ==\nThe German, Australian, and French governments publicly issued warnings to users of Internet Explorer after the attack, advising them to use alternative browsers at least until a fix for the security hole was made. The German, Australian, and French governments considered all versions of Internet Explorer vulnerable or potentially vulnerable.In an advisory on January 14, 2010, Microsoft said that attackers targeting Google and other U.S. companies used software that exploits a hole in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8 on Windows 7, Vista, Windows XP, Server 2003, Server 2008 R2, as well as IE 6 Service Pack 1 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4.The Internet Explorer exploit code used in the attack has been released into the public domain, and has been incorporated into the Metasploit Framework penetration testing tool. A copy of the exploit was uploaded to Wepawet, a service for detecting and analyzing web-based malware operated by the computer security group at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \"The public release of the exploit code increases the possibility of widespread attacks using the Internet Explorer vulnerability,\" said George Kurtz, CTO of McAfee, of the attack. \"The now public computer code may help cybercriminals craft attacks that use the vulnerability to compromise Windows systems.\"Security company Websense said it identified \"limited public use\" of the unpatched IE vulnerability in drive-by attacks against users who strayed onto malicious Web sites. According to Websense, the attack code it spotted is the same as the exploit that went public last week. \"Internet Explorer users currently face a real and present danger due to the public disclosure of the vulnerability and release of attack code, increasing the possibility of widespread attacks,\" said George Kurtz, chief technology officer of McAfee, in a blog update. Confirming this speculation, Websense Security Labs identified additional sites using the exploit on January 19. According to reports from Ahnlab, the second URL was spread through the Instant Messenger network Misslee Messenger, a popular IM client in South Korea.Researchers have created attack code that exploits the vulnerability in Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) and IE8\u2014even when Microsoft's recommended defensive measure (Data Execution Prevention (DEP)) is turned on.  According to Dino Dai Zovi, a security vulnerability researcher, \"even the newest IE8 isn't safe from attack if it's running on Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) or earlier, or on Windows Vista RTM (release to manufacturing), the version Microsoft shipped in January 2007.\"Microsoft admitted that the security hole used had been known to them since September. Work on an update was prioritized and on Thursday, January 21, 2010, Microsoft released a security patch aiming to counter this weakness, the published exploits based on it and a number of other privately reported vulnerabilities. They did not state if any of the latter had been used or published by exploiters or whether these had any particular relation to the Aurora operation, but the entire cumulative update was termed critical for most versions of Windows, including Windows 7.\nSecurity researchers continued to investigate the attacks. HBGary, a security firm, released a report in which they claimed to have found some significant markers that might help identify the code developer. The firm also said that the code was Chinese language based but could not be specifically tied to any government entity.On February 19, 2010, a security expert investigating the cyber-attack on Google, has claimed that the people behind the attack were also responsible for the cyber-attacks made on several Fortune 100 companies in the past one and a half years. They have also tracked the attack back to its point of origin, which seems to be two Chinese schools, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Lanxiang Vocational School. As highlighted by The New York Times, both of these schools have ties with the Chinese search engine Baidu, a rival of Google China. Both Lanxiang Vocational and Jiaotong University have denied the allegation.In March 2010, Symantec, which was helping investigate the attack for Google, identified Shaoxing as the source of 21.3% of all (12 billion) malicious emails sent throughout the world.\n\n\n*** Google retrospective ***\nOn October 3, 2022, Google on YouTube released a six-episode series covering the events that occurred during Operation Aurora, with commentary from insiders who dealt with the attack, though the series primary focus was to reassure the Google-using public that measures are in place to counter hacking attempts.\n\nHow did Microsoft respond to the security hole used in Operation Aurora?",

The cable suggested that the attack was part of a coordinated campaign executed by \"government operatives, public security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the Chinese government.\" The report suggested that it was part of an ongoing campaign in which attackers have \"broken into American government computers and those of Western allies, the Dalai Lama and American businesses since 2002.\" According to The Guardian's reporting on the leak, the attacks were \"orchestrated by a senior member of the Politburo who typed his own name into the global version of the search engine and found articles criticising him personally.\"Once a victim's system was compromised, a backdoor connection that masqueraded as an SSL connection made connections to command and control servers running in Illinois, Texas, and Taiwan, including machines that were running under stolen Rackspace customer accounts.  The victim's machine then began exploring the protected corporate intranet that it was a part of, searching for other vulnerable systems as well as sources of intellectual property, specifically the contents of source code repositories.\nThe attacks were thought to have definitively ended on Jan 4 when the command and control servers were taken down, although it is not known at this point whether or not the attackers intentionally shut them down. However, the attacks were still occurring as of February 2010.\n\n== Response and aftermath ==\nThe German, Australian, and French governments publicly issued warnings to users of Internet Explorer after the attack, advising them to use alternative browsers at least until a fix for the security hole was made. The German, Australian, and French governments considered all versions of Internet Explorer vulnerable or potentially vulnerable.In an advisory on January 14, 2010, Microsoft said that attackers targeting Google and other U.S. companies used software that exploits a hole in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8 on Windows 7, Vista, Windows XP, Server 2003, Server 2008 R2, as well as IE 6 Service Pack 1 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4.The Internet Explorer exploit code used in the attack has been released into the public domain, and has been incorporated into the Metasploit Framework penetration testing tool. A copy of the exploit was uploaded to Wepawet, a service for detecting and analyzing web-based malware operated by the computer security group at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \"The public release of the exploit code increases the possibility of widespread attacks using the Internet Explorer vulnerability,\" said George Kurtz, CTO of McAfee, of the attack. \"The now public computer code may help cybercriminals craft attacks that use the vulnerability to compromise Windows systems.\"Security company Websense said it identified \"limited public use\" of the unpatched IE vulnerability in drive-by attacks against users who strayed onto malicious Web sites. According to Websense, the attack code it spotted is the same as the exploit that went public last week. \"Internet Explorer users currently face a real and present danger due to the public disclosure of the vulnerability and release of attack code, increasing the possibility of widespread attacks,\" said George Kurtz, chief technology officer of McAfee, in a blog update. Confirming this speculation, Websense Security Labs identified additional sites using the exploit on January 19. According to reports from Ahnlab, the second URL was spread through the Instant Messenger network Misslee Messenger, a popular IM client in South Korea.Researchers have created attack code that exploits the vulnerability in Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) and IE8\u2014even when Microsoft's recommended defensive measure (Data Execution Prevention (DEP)) is turned on.  According to Dino Dai Zovi, a security vulnerability researcher, \"even the newest IE8 isn't safe from attack if it's running on Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) or earlier, or on Windows Vista RTM (release to manufacturing), the version Microsoft shipped in January 2007.\"Microsoft admitted that the security hole used had been known to them since September. Work on an update was prioritized and on Thursday, January 21, 2010, Microsoft released a security patch aiming to counter this weakness, the published exploits based on it and a number of other privately reported vulnerabilities. They did not state if any of the latter had been used or published by exploiters or whether these had any particular relation to the Aurora operation, but the entire cumulative update was termed critical for most versions of Windows, including Windows 7.\nSecurity researchers continued to investigate the attacks. HBGary, a security firm, released a report in which they claimed to have found some significant markers that might help identify the code developer. The firm also said that the code was Chinese language based but could not be specifically tied to any government entity.On February 19, 2010, a security expert investigating the cyber-attack on Google, has claimed that the people behind the attack were also responsible for the cyber-attacks made on several Fortune 100 companies in the past one and a half years. They have also tracked the attack back to its point of origin, which seems to be two Chinese schools, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Lanxiang Vocational School. As highlighted by The New York Times, both of these schools have ties with the Chinese search engine Baidu, a rival of Google China. Both Lanxiang Vocational and Jiaotong University have denied the allegation.In March 2010, Symantec, which was helping investigate the attack for Google, identified Shaoxing as the source of 21.3% of all (12 billion) malicious emails sent throughout the world.\n\n\n*** Google retrospective ***\nOn October 3, 2022, Google on YouTube released a six-episode series covering the events that occurred during Operation Aurora, with commentary from insiders who dealt with the attack, though the series primary focus was to reassure the Google-using public that measures are in place to counter hacking attempts."

An affected application can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the file system.\n\n\n\n== Example ==\nA typical example of a vulnerable application in PHP code is:\n\nAn attack against this system could be to send the following HTTP request:\n\nThe server would then generate a response such as:\n\nThe repeated ../ characters after /home/users/phpguru/templates/ have caused \ninclude() to traverse to the root directory, and then include the Unix password file /etc/passwd.\nUnix /etc/passwd is a common file used to demonstrate directory traversal, as it is often used by crackers to try cracking the passwords. However, in more recent Unix systems, the /etc/passwd file does not contain the hashed passwords, and they are instead located in the /etc/shadow file, which cannot be read by unprivileged users on the machine. Even in that case, though, reading /etc/passwd does still show a list of user accounts.\n\n== Variations ==\nDirectory traversal in its simplest form uses the ../ pattern. Some common variations are listed below:\n\n\n*** Microsoft Windows ***\nMicrosoft Windows and DOS directory traversal uses the ..\\ or ../ patterns.Each partition has a separate root directory (labeled C:\\ where C could be any partition), and there is no common root directory above that. This means that for most directory vulnerabilities on Windows, attacks are limited to a single partition.\nDirectory traversal has been the cause of numerous Microsoft vulnerabilities.\n\n\n*** Percent encoding in URIs ***\nSome web applications attempt to prevent directory traversal by scanning the path of a request URI for patterns such as ../. This check is sometimes mistakenly performed before percent-decoding, causing URIs containing patterns like %2e%2e/ to be accepted despite being decoded into ../ before actual use.\n\n\n**** Double encoding ****\nPercent decoding may accidentally be performed multiple times; once before validation, but again afterwards, making the application vulnerable to Double percent-encoding attacks in which illegal characters are replaced by their double-percent-encoded form in order to bypass security countermeasures. For example, in a double percent-encoding attack, ../ may be replaced by its double-percent-encoded form %252E%252E%252F. This kind of vulnerability notably affected versions 5.0 and earlier of Microsoft's IIS web server software.\n\n\n**** UTF-8 ****\nA badly implemented UTF-8 decoder may accept characters encoded using more bytes than necessary, leading to alternative character representations, such as %2e and %c0%ae both representing .. This is specifically forbidden by the UTF-8 standard, but has still led to directory traversal vulnerabilities in software such as the IIS web server.\n\n\n*** Archives ***\nSome archive formats like zip allow for directory traversal attacks: files in the archive can be written such that they overwrite files on the filesystem by backtracking.

    "instruction": "Context: Host-based intrusion detection system\n\n==Introduction==\nA host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) is an intrusion detection system that is capable of monitoring and analyzing the internals of a computing system as well as the network packets on its network interfaces, similar to the way a network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) operates. This was the first type of intrusion detection software to have been designed, with the original target system being the mainframe computer where outside interaction was infrequent.\n\n== Overview ==\nA host-based IDS is capable of monitoring all or parts of the dynamic behavior and the state of a computer system, based on how it is configured. Besides such activities as dynamically inspecting network packets targeted at this specific host (optional component with most software solutions commercially available), a HIDS might detect which program accesses what resources and discover that, for example, a word-processor has suddenly and inexplicably started modifying the system password database. Similarly a HIDS might look at the state of a system, its stored information, whether in RAM, in the file system, log files or elsewhere; and check that the contents of these appear as expected, e.g. have not been changed by intruders.One can think of a HIDS as an agent that monitors whether anything or anyone, whether internal or external, has circumvented the system's security policy.\n\n\n*** Monitoring dynamic behavior ***\nMany computer users have encountered tools that monitor dynamic system behavior in the form of anti-virus (AV) packages. While AV programs often also monitor system state, they do spend a lot of their time looking at who is doing what inside a computer \u2013 and whether a given program should or should not have access to particular system resources. The lines become blurred here, as many of the tools overlap in functionality.\nSome intrusion prevention systems protect against buffer overflow attacks on system memory and can enforce security policy.\n\n\n*** Monitoring state ***\nThe principle operation of a HIDS depends on the fact that successful intruders (hackers) will generally leave a trace of their activities. In fact, such intruders often want to own the computer they have attacked, and will establish their \"ownership\" by installing software that will grant the intruders future access to carry out whatever activity (keystroke logging, identity theft, spamming, botnet activity, spyware-usage etc.) they envisage.\nIn theory, a computer user has the ability to detect any such modifications, and the HIDS attempts to do just that and reports its findings.\nIdeally a HIDS works in conjunction with a NIDS, such that a HIDS finds anything that slips past the NIDS. Commercially available software solutions often do correlate the findings from NIDS and HIDS in order to find out about whether a network intruder has been successful or not at the targeted host.\nMost successful intruders, on entering a target machine, immediately apply best-practice security techniques to secure the system which they have infiltrated, leaving only their own backdoor open, so that other intruders can not take over their computers.\n\n\n**** Technique ****\nIn general a HIDS uses a database (object-database) of system objects it should monitor \u2013 usually (but not necessarily) file system objects. A HIDS could also check that appropriate regions of memory have not been modified \u2013 for example, the system call table for Linux, and various vtable structures in Microsoft Windows.\nFor each object in question a HIDS will usually remember its attributes (permissions, size, modifications dates) and create a checksum of some kind (an MD5, SHA1 hash or similar) for the contents, if any. This information gets stored in a secure database for later comparison (checksum database).\nAn alternate method to HIDS would be to provide NIDS type functionality at the network interface (NIC) level of an end-point (either server, workstation or other end device). Providing HIDS at the network layer has the advantage of providing more detailed logging of the source (IP address) of the attack and attack details, such as packet data, neither of which a dynamic behavioral monitoring approach could see.\n\n\n**** Operation ****\nAt installation time \u2013 and whenever any of the monitored objects change legitimately \u2013 a HIDS must initialize its checksum-database by scanning the relevant objects. Persons in charge of computer security need to control this process tightly in order to prevent intruders making un-authorized changes to the database(s). Such initialization thus generally takes a long time and involves cryptographically locking each monitored object and the checksum databases or worse. Because of this, manufacturers of HIDS usually construct the object-database in such a way that makes frequent updates to the checksum database unnecessary.\nComputer systems generally have many dynamic (frequently changing) objects which intruders want to modify \u2013 and which a HIDS thus should monitor \u2013 but their dynamic nature makes them unsuitable for the checksum technique. To overcome this problem, HIDS employ various other detection techniques: monitoring changing file-attributes, log-files that decreased in size since last checked, and numerous other means to detect unusual events.\nOnce a system administrator has constructed a suitable object-database \u2013 ideally with help and advice from the HIDS installation tools \u2013 and initialized the checksum-database, the HIDS has all it requires to scan the monitored objects regularly and to report on anything that may appear to have gone wrong. Reports can take the form of logs, e-mails or similar.\n\n\n*** Protecting the HIDS ***\nA HIDS will usually go to great lengths to prevent the object-database, checksum-database and its reports from any form of tampering. After all, if intruders succeed in modifying any of the objects the HIDS monitors, nothing can stop such intruders from modifying the HIDS itself \u2013 unless security administrators take appropriate precautions. Many worms and viruses will try to disable anti-virus tools, for example.\nApart from crypto-techniques, HIDS might allow administrators to store the databases on a CD-ROM or on other read-only memory devices (another factor in favor of infrequent updates...) or storing them in some off-system memory. Similarly, a HIDS will often send its logs off-system immediately \u2013 typically using VPN channels to some central management system.\nOne could argue that the trusted platform module comprises a type of HIDS. Although its scope differs in many ways from that of a HIDS, fundamentally it provides a means to identify whether anything/anyone has tampered with a portion of a computer. Architecturally this provides the ultimate (at least at this point in time) host-based intrusion detection, as depends on hardware external to the CPU itself, thus making it that much harder for an intruder to corrupt its object and checksum databases.\nAnswer this question: Why do most successful intruders immediately apply best-practice security techniques to secure the system they have infiltrated?",

    "instruction": "Authenticated Received Chain\n\n==Introduction==\nAuthenticated Received Chain (ARC) is an email authentication system designed to allow an intermediate mail server like a mailing list or forwarding service to sign an email's original authentication results. This allows a receiving service to validate an email when the email's SPF and DKIM records are rendered invalid by an intermediate server's processing.ARC is defined in RFC 8617, published in July 2019, as \"Experimental\".\n\n== Overview ==\nDMARC allows a sender's domain to indicate that their emails are protected by SPF and/or DKIM, and tells a receiving service what to do if neither of those authentication methods passes - such as to reject the message. However, a strict DMARC policy may block legitimate emails sent through a mailing list or forwarder, as the DKIM signature will be invalidated if the message is modified, such as by adding a subject tag or footer, and the SPF check will either fail (if the forwarder didn't change the bounce address) or be aligned with the mailing list domain and not with the message author's domain (unless the mailing list rewrites the From: header field.)\nARC was devised to solve this problem by giving intermediate servers a way to sign the original message's validation results. Even if the SPF and DKIM validation fail, the receiving service can choose to validate the ARC chain.

      "context": "Authenticated Received Chain\n\n==Introduction==\nAuthenticated Received Chain (ARC) is an email authentication system designed to allow an intermediate mail server like a mailing list or forwarding service to sign an email's original authentication results. This allows a receiving service to validate an email when the email's SPF and DKIM records are rendered invalid by an intermediate server's processing.ARC is defined in RFC 8617, published in July 2019, as \"Experimental\".\n\n== Overview ==\nDMARC allows a sender's domain to indicate that their emails are protected by SPF and/or DKIM, and tells a receiving service what to do if neither of those authentication methods passes - such as to reject the message. However, a strict DMARC policy may block legitimate emails sent through a mailing list or forwarder, as the DKIM signature will be invalidated if the message is modified, such as by adding a subject tag or footer, and the SPF check will either fail (if the forwarder didn't change the bounce address) or be aligned with the mailing list domain and not with the message author's domain (unless the mailing list rewrites the From: header field.)\nARC was devised to solve this problem by giving intermediate servers a way to sign the original message's validation results. Even if the SPF and DKIM validation fail, the receiving service can choose to validate the ARC chain. If it indicates that the original message passed the SPF and DKIM checks, and the only modifications were made by intermediaries trusted by the receiving service, the receiving service may choose to accept the email.

    "instruction": "International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance\n\n==Introduction==\nThe International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance (also called the \"Necessary and Proportionate Principles\" or just \"the Principles\") is a document which attempts to \"clarify how international human rights law applies in the current digital environment\".\nCommunications surveillance (that is to say, mass surveillance of communications) conflicts with a number of international human rights, mainly that of privacy. As a result, communications surveillance may only occur when prescribed by law necessary to achieve legitimate aim, and proportionate to the aim used.The document consists of 13 principles developed to provide society groups, industry, governments, and others with a framework to assess whether current and proposed surveillance laws or statutes conflict with International Human Rights law.\n\n== Political Support Prior to the Publication of the Principles ==\nThe initial release followed a report from the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Opinion in April 2013, which highlights the widespread practice of states surveying communications, stating that such surveillance severely undermines citizens' ability to enjoy a private life, freely express themselves and enjoy their other fundamental human rights.In July 2013 the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, emphasized the importance of applying human right standards and democratic safeguards to surveillance and law enforcement activities:\"While concerns about national security and criminal activity may justify the exceptional and narrowly-tailored use of surveillance programmes, surveillance without adequate safeguards to protect the right to privacy actually risk impacting negatively on the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\"\n\n== Purpose ==\nThe purpose of the principles was to provide civil society groups, states, the courts, legislative and regulatory bodies, industry and others with a framework to evaluate whether current or proposed surveillance laws comply with International Human Rights.The concern was that key protections to privacy had been eroded away with technological advancements, therefore needed robust support in some areas to raise international human rights to the standards which had developed in the pre-digital age.\n\n== The Principles ==\nThe following is a summary of the document containing the principles. All below is source from the actual document itself, except where noted.\n\n\n*** Preamble ***\nThe preamble of the document recognizes that Communications Surveillance interferes with the Right to privacy, therefore can only be used when it is prescribed by law, necessary to achieve a legitimate aim, and proportionate to the aim pursued. The view of the document is that existing human rights law has not kept up with the progression of technology. The preamble states that the threat to these rights combined with the increase in popularity of using communications content and metadata that states are not placing \"sufficient restrictions on how they can be subsequently used by States\".\n\n\n*** Scope of Application ***\nTo get the correct scope and purpose of application for the document, it is required to be read and interpreted as part of a larger framework rather than as individual principles.\nApplication of this document is to apply both within states and extra territorially, regardless of purpose.\nIt is to apply for protection of the individual from the state, and also states there is an obligation of states to protect individuals from non-state actors.The document states that unless the principles are applied this way, a State conducting Communications Surveillance may not meet International Human Rights obligations. The principles are stated to \"articulate the duties and obligations of States when engaging in Communications Surveillance\".\n\n\n*** Changing Definitions and Technology ***\nThis section of the document is dedicated to the interpretation of certain terms found throughout the document, and highlighting that some of the legal definitions used may not have effectively kept pace with technological change, and require reiteration. \nThe principles state that the because of the increased ability of communications surveillance, the existing legal framework which currently distinguishes between 'content' and 'non-content' is no longer appropriate, and protection from all types of surveillance should be given a higher legal priority.\n\n\n*** The Principles ***\n\n\n**** Legality ****\nAny limitation imposed on an International Human Rights must be prescribed by law. Sufficient notice should be given if a proposed law is going to limit one of these rights. The law should be clear, and given periodic review to ensure it remains effective given the speed of technological development.\n\n\n**** Legitimate Aim ****\nCommunications surveillance should only be used by permitted state authorities where necessary in a democratic society. Any situation where discrimination arises should not be used.\n\n\n**** Necessity ****\nSurveillance laws should be limited to those which are necessary to achieve a legitimate aim, or where there are multiple means but Communications Surveillance is the least intrusive method on International Human Rights. The onus of establishing necessity should remain with the state\n\n\n**** Adequacy ****\nAny communications surveillance authorized by law must be appropriate for the legitimate aim it is fulfilling.\n\n\n**** Proportionality ****\nCommunications Surveillance is regarded as a highly intrusive act, and therefore must consider the sensitivity and severity of the situation. The state should establish the following prior to conducting communications surveillance:\n\nThere is a high chance of serious crime or specific threat\nThere is a high degree of probability that relevant evidence will be obtained.\nOther less invasive techniques have been exhausted, such that communications surveillance is the least intrusive method\nInformation collected will be confined to only which is relevant\nExcess information obtained will be returned or destroyed\nThe information accesses will be used by the specific authority for the purpose the authority was given\nThe requested authority to use communications surveillance does not undermine the purpose of the right to privacy or other fundamental freedoms.\n\n\n**** Competent Judicial Authority ****\nThe authority determining the validity of the communications surveillance must be independent of those conducting the surveillance, and be competent when making these decisions.\n\n\n**** Due Process ****\nThat everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by a competent judicial authority. Due process can be used interchangeably with \"procedural fairness\" and \"natural justice\"\n\n\n**** User Notification ****\nThose subjects of Communication Surveillance should be given the opportunity to challenge the decision when a decision authorizing Surveillance has been issued. The materials presented in support of the application should be available for those subjects. Delay in notification is acceptable where notification would frustrate the purpose of communication surveillance and authorization is granted by a competent judicial authority.\n\n\n**** Transparency ****\nInformation about use and amount of Communication Surveillance should be available to those who request it. States should provide the requestor with information sufficient to ascertain the nature of the request and determine the size of both the request and those who will be affected by it. Records of requests for communications surveyed should also be published.\n\n\n**** Public Oversight ****\nStates should establish an independent position to oversee the use of Communications Surveillance and to ensure transparency and accountability. The person(s) in this position would have sufficient authority to access all potentially relevant information, to assess whether the State is making legitimate use of its lawful capabilities, to evaluate whether the State has met its transparency obligations, and to make public determinations as to the lawfulness of those actions. The document in this instance makes reference to the United Kingdom's Interception of Communications Commissioner as an example of such an independent oversight mechanism.\n\n\n**** Integrity of communication and systems ****\nStates should not require those service providers or software/hardware vendors to build surveillance/monitoring capability into their systems. People have a right to express themselves anonymously.\n\n\n**** Safeguards for International Cooperation ****\nWhere a state has entered into a mutual legal assistance treaty(MLAT) or other multi-jurisdictional agreement where more than one legal jurisdiction overlaps, the laws that apply are those which have the higher level of protection for the individual. MLAT's should also be transparent, publicly available and subject to guarantees of procedural fairness\n\n\n**** Safeguards against illegitimate access and right to effective remedy ****\nCommunications surveillance by third parties should be prohibited with sufficient penalties. Protection for whistle-blowers should be enacted. Any information obtained by means not consistent with these principles should be inadmissible as evidence. Once information collected by communications surveillance has been used for the purpose for which it was collected it should be promptly destroyed or returned.\n\n== Response ==\nIn October 2013, The Principles were promoted in a brief filed before the President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies. They claim that \"In a world of ever more complex technology, it is increasingly unclear whether the distinction between \"meta-data\" and other information carries much weight.\"The Center for Democracy and Technology released a report noting overlap between the Principles and a December 9, 2013 proposal by tech groups such as AOL, Apple, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter, and Yahoo!.Now, the principles have over 400 organizations from across the world supporting the principles along with over 40 Experts, Academics and prominent individuals from over 17 countries, and 6 elected officials or political parties from 5 countries.The principles are now being used as model for reform of surveillance law and policy around the world and to provide a benchmark for measuring whether a State's surveillance practices comply with International Human Rights Law.\n\nQ: What is the principle of Transparency in the document on International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance?",
