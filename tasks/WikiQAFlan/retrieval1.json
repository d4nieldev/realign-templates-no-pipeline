    "instruction": "Secure Remote Password protocol\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Secure Remote Password protocol (SRP) is an augmented password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) protocol, specifically designed to work around existing patents.Like all PAKE protocols, an eavesdropper or man in the middle cannot obtain enough information to be able to brute-force guess a password or apply a dictionary attack without further interactions with the parties for each guess. Furthermore, being an augmented PAKE protocol, the server does not store password-equivalent data. This means that an attacker who steals the server data cannot masquerade as the client unless they first perform a brute force search for the password.\nIn layman's terms, during SRP (or any other PAKE protocol) authentication, one party (the \"client\" or \"user\") demonstrates to another party (the \"server\") that they know the password, without sending the password itself nor any other information from which the password can be derived. The password never leaves the client and is unknown to the server.\nFurthermore, the server also needs to know about the password (but not the password itself) in order to instigate the secure connection. This means that the server also authenticates itself to the client which prevents phishing without reliance on the user parsing complex URLs.\nNewer alternative algorithms include AuCPace\nand OPAQUE\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe SRP protocol has a number of desirable properties: it allows a user to authenticate themselves to a server, it is resistant to dictionary attacks mounted by an eavesdropper, and it does not require a trusted third party. It effectively conveys a zero-knowledge password proof from the user to the server. In revision 6 of the protocol only one password can be guessed per connection attempt. One of the interesting properties of the protocol is that even if one or two of the cryptographic primitives it uses are attacked, it is still secure. The SRP protocol has been revised several times, and is currently at revision 6a.\nThe SRP protocol creates a large private key shared between the two parties in a manner similar to Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange based on the client side having the user password and the server side having a cryptographic verifier derived from the password. The shared public key is derived from two random numbers, one generated by the client, and the other generated by the server, which are unique to the login attempt. In cases where encrypted communications as well as authentication are required, the SRP protocol is more secure than the alternative SSH protocol and faster than using Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange with signed messages. It is also independent of third parties, unlike Kerberos. The SRP protocol, version 3 is described in RFC 2945. SRP version 6 is also used for strong password authentication in SSL/TLS (in TLS-SRP) and other standards such as EAP and SAML, and is being standardized in IEEE P1363 and ISO/IEC 11770-4.\n\n== Protocol ==\nThe following notation is used in this description of the protocol, version 6:\n\nq and N\n\nHow does SRP differ from other PAKE protocols in terms of server data storage?",

Concerns about massive growth of telephone tapping incidents led to growing demand for secure telephones.\nThe practical availability of secure telephones is restricted by several factors; notably politics, export issues, incompatibility between different products (the devices on each side of the call have to use the same protocol), and high (though recently decreasing) price of the devices.\n\n== Well-known products ==\nThe best-known product on the US government market is the STU-III family. However, this system has now been replaced by the Secure Terminal Equipment (STE) and SCIP standards which defines specifications for the design of equipment to secure both data and voice. The SCIP standard was developed by the NSA and the US DOD to derive more interoperability between secure communication equipment. A new family of standard secure phones has been developed based on Philip Zimmermann's VoIP encryption standard ZRTP.\n\n== VoIP and direct connection phones ==\nAs the popularity of VoIP grows, secure telephony is becoming more widely used. Many major hardware and software providers offer it as a standard feature at no extra cost.\nExamples include the Gizmo5 and Twinkle. Both of the former work with offerings from the founder of PGP, Phil Zimmermann, and his VoIP secure protocol, ZRTP. ZRTP is implemented in, amongst others, Ripcord Networks product SecurePC with up to NSA Suite B compliant Elliptic Curve math libraries. ZRTP is also being made available for mobile GSM CSD as a new standard for non-VoIP secure calls.\nThe U.S. National Security Agency is developing a secure phone based on Google's Android called Fishbowl.\n\n== Historically significant products ==\n\nScramblers were used to secure voice traffic during World War II, but were often intercepted and decoded due to scrambling's inherent insecurity. The first true secure telephone was SIGSALY, a massive device that weighed over 50 tons. The NSA, formed after World War II, developed a series of secure telephones, including the STU I, STU II and STU-III, as well as voice encryption devices for military telephones.\nIn 1989 an Irish company called Intrepid developed one of the most advanced secure phones. Called Milcode, the phone was the first to implement code-excited linear prediction (or CELP) which dramatically improved voice quality and user operability over previous LPC (Linear Predictive Coding) and LPC-10e versions.\nMilcode also boasted significantly higher levels of security than previous secure telephones. The base model offered a proprietary encryption algorithm with a key length of 512 bits, and a more advanced model with a key length of 1024 bits. Key exchange used a public key, based on Diffie-Hellman, as opposed to a plug-in datakey. A new key was generated for each phone call. Milcode was also able to encrypt fax and data and was electromagnetically shielded to NATO TEMPEST standards.\nOther products of historical significance are PGPfone and Nautilus (designed as a non-key escrow alternative to Clipper, now officially discontinued, but still available on SourceForge), SpeakFreely, and the security VoIP protocol wrapper Zfone developed by the creator of PGP.\nScrambling, generally using a form of voice inversion, was available from electronic hobbyist kit suppliers and is common on FRS radios.

DSA is a variant of the Schnorr and ElGamal signature schemes.:\u200a486\u200aThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposed DSA for use in their Digital Signature Standard (DSS) in 1991, and adopted it as FIPS 186 in 1994. Four revisions to the initial specification have been released. The newest specification is: FIPS 186-4  from July 2013. DSA is patented but NIST has made this patent available worldwide royalty-free.  A draft version of the specification FIPS 186-5 indicates DSA will no longer be approved for digital signature generation, but may be used to verify signatures generated prior to the implementation date of that standard.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe DSA works in the framework of public-key cryptosystems and is based on the algebraic properties of modular exponentiation, together with the discrete logarithm problem, which is considered to be computationally intractable. The algorithm uses a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. The private key is used to generate a digital signature for a message, and such a signature can be verified by using the signer's corresponding public key. The digital signature provides message authentication (the receiver can verify the origin of the message), integrity (the receiver can verify that the message has not been modified since it was signed) and non-repudiation (the sender cannot falsely claim that they have not signed the message).\n\n== Operation ==\nThe DSA algorithm involves four operations: key generation (which creates the key pair), key distribution, signing and signature verification.\n\n\n*** 1.

    "instruction": "Mental poker\n\n==Introduction==\nMental poker is the common name for a set of cryptographic problems that concerns playing a fair game over distance without the need for a trusted third party. The term is also applied to the theories surrounding these problems and their possible solutions. The name comes from the card game poker which is one of the games to which this kind of problem applies. Similar problems described as two party games are Blum's flipping a coin over a distance,  Yao's Millionaires' Problem, and Rabin's oblivious transfer.\nThe problem can be described thus: \"How can one allow only authorized actors to have access to certain information while not using a trusted arbiter?\" (Eliminating the trusted third-party avoids the problem of trying to determine whether the third party can be trusted or not, and may also reduce the resources required.)\nIn poker, this could translate to: \"How can we make sure no player is stacking the deck or peeking at other players' cards when we are shuffling the deck ourselves?\". In a physical card game, this would be relatively simple if the players were sitting face to face and observing each other, at least if the possibility of conventional cheating can be ruled out. However, if the players are not sitting at the same location but instead are at widely separate locations and pass the entire deck between them (using the postal mail, for instance), this suddenly becomes very difficult. And for electronic card games, such as online poker, where the mechanics of the game are hidden from the user, this is impossible unless the method used is such that it cannot allow any party to cheat by manipulating or inappropriately observing the electronic \"deck\".\nSeveral protocols for doing this have been suggested, the first by Adi Shamir, Ron Rivest and Len Adleman (the creators of the RSA-encryption protocol). This protocol was the first example of two parties conducting secure computation rather than secure message transmission, employing cryptography; later on due to leaking partial information in the original protocol, this led to the definition of semantic security by Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali. The concept of multi-player mental poker was introduced in Moti Yung's 1984 book Cryptoprotocols. The area has later evolved into what is known as secure multi-party computation protocols (for two parties, and multi parties as well).\n\n\n\n== Shuffling cards using commutative encryption ==\nOne possible algorithm for shuffling cards without the use of a trusted third party is to use a commutative encryption scheme. A commutative scheme means that if some data is encrypted more than once, the order in which one decrypts this data will not matter.\nExample: Alice has a plaintext message. She encrypts this, producing a garbled ciphertext which she gives then to Bob. Bob encrypts the ciphertext again, using the same scheme as Alice but with another key. When decrypting this double encrypted message, if the encryption scheme is commutative, it will not matter who decrypts first.\n\n\n*** The algorithm ***\nAn algorithm for shuffling cards using commutative encryption would be as follows:\n\nAlice and Bob agree on a certain \"deck\" of cards. In practice, this means they agree on a set of numbers or other data such that each element of the set represents a card.\nAlice picks an encryption key A and uses this to encrypt each card of the deck.\nAlice shuffles the cards.\nAlice passes the encrypted and shuffled deck to Bob. With the encryption in place, Bob cannot know which card is which.\nBob picks an encryption key B and uses this to encrypt each card of the encrypted and shuffled deck.\nBob shuffles the deck.\nBob passes the double encrypted and shuffled deck back to Alice.\nAlice decrypts each card using her key A. This still leaves Bob's encryption in place though so she cannot know which card is which.\nAlice picks one encryption key for each card (A1, A2, etc.) and encrypts them individually.\nAlice passes the deck to Bob.\nBob decrypts each card using his key B. This still leaves Alice's individual encryption in place though so he cannot know which card is which.\nBob picks one encryption key for each card (B1, B2, etc.) and encrypts them individually.\nBob passes the deck back to Alice.\nAlice publishes the deck for everyone playing (in this case only Alice and Bob, see below on expansion though).The deck is now shuffled.\nThis algorithm may be expanded for an arbitrary number of players. Players Carol, Dave and so forth need only repeat steps 2-4 and 8-10.\nDuring the game, Alice and Bob will pick cards from the deck, identified in which order they are placed in the shuffled deck. When either player wants to see their cards, they will request the corresponding keys from the other player. That player, upon checking that the requesting player is indeed entitled to look at the cards, passes the individual keys for those cards to the other player. The check is to ensure that the player does not try to request keys for cards that do not belong to that player.\nExample: Alice has picked cards 1 to 5 in the shuffled deck. Bob has picked cards 6 to 10. Bob requests to look at his allotted cards. Alice agrees that Bob is entitled to look at cards 6 to 10 and gives him her individual card keys A6 to A10. Bob decrypts his cards by using both Alice's keys and his own for these cards, B6 to B10. Bob can now see the cards. Alice cannot know which cards Bob has because she does not have access to Bob's keys B6 to B10 which are required to decrypt the cards.\n\n\n*** Weakness ***\nThe encryption scheme used must be secure against known-plaintext attacks: Bob must not be able to determine Alice's original key A (or enough of it to allow him to decrypt any cards he does not hold) based on his knowledge of the unencrypted values of the cards he has drawn. This rules out some obvious commutative encryption schemes, such as simply XORing each card with the key. (Using a separate key for each card even in the initial exchange, which would otherwise make this scheme secure, doesn't work since the cards are shuffled before they're returned.)\nDepending on the deck agreed upon, this algorithm may be weak. When encrypting data, certain properties of this data may be preserved from the plaintext to the ciphertext. This may be used to \"tag\" certain cards. Therefore, the parties must agree on a deck where no cards have properties that are preserved during encryption.\n\n== \"A Toolbox for Mental Card Games\" and its implementation ==\nChristian Schindelhauer describes sophisticated protocols to both perform and verify a large number of useful operations on cards and stacks of cards in his 1998 paper \"A Toolbox for Mental Card Games\" [SCH98]. The work is concerned with general-purpose operations (masking and unmasking cards, shuffling and re-shuffling, inserting a card into a stack, etc.) that make the protocols applicable to any card game. The cryptographic protocols used by Schindelhauer are based on quadratic residuosity, and the general scheme is similar in spirit to the above protocol. The correctness of operations can be checked by using zero-knowledge proofs, so that players do not need to reveal their strategy to verify the game's correctness.\nThe C++ library libtmcg [STA05] provides an implementation of the Schindelhauer toolbox. It has been used to implement a secure version of the German card game Skat, achieving modest real-world performance. The game Skat is played by three players with a 32-card deck, and so is substantially less computationally intensive than a poker game in which anywhere from five to eight players use a full 52-card deck.\n\n== A non-shuffling poker protocol ==\nTo date, mental poker approaches based on the standard Alice-Bob protocol (above) do not offer high enough performance for real-time online play. The requirement that each player encrypts each card imposes a substantial overhead. A recent paper by Golle [GOL05] describes a mental poker protocol that achieves significantly higher performance by exploiting the properties of the poker game to move away from the encrypt-shuffle model. Rather than shuffle the cards and then deal as needed, with the new approach, the players generate (encrypted) random numbers on the fly, which are used to select the next card. Every new card needs to be checked against all the cards that have already been dealt to detect duplicates. As a result, this method is uniquely useful in poker-style games, in which the number of cards dealt is very small compared to the size of the whole deck. However, the method needs all cards that have already been dealt to be known to all, which in most poker-style games would beat its very purpose.\nThe card-generation algorithm requires a cryptosystem with two key properties. The encryption E must be additively homomorphic, so that E(c1)*E(c2)\n\n== Better performance through increased trust ==\nAny mental poker protocol that relies on the players to perform the encryption is bound by the requirement that every player encrypt every card that is dealt. However, by making limited assumptions about the trustworthiness of third parties, significantly more efficient protocols may be realized. The protocol for choosing cards without shuffling may be adapted so that the encryption is handled by two or more servers. Under the assumption that the servers are non-colluding, such a protocol is secure.\nThe basic protocol using two servers is as follows:\n\nServers S1 and S2 encrypt and shuffle a deck of cards, and publish a non-malleable commitment to some permutation of encrypted cards to the players. This can be done with any of several well-understood cryptographic protocols.\nPlayers compute independent random numbers in {0,...,51}, which are combined to generate a random number in {0,..., 51}, as in [GOL05]\nThe random number is used as an index into the random permutation, the appropriate player gains \"ownership\" of the specified card, and the servers send that player the keys to read the card's value.In this protocol, servers S1 and S2 must collude if either is to learn the values of any cards. Furthermore, because players ultimately decide which cards are dealt, non-trustworthy servers are unable to influence the game to the extent that is possible in traditional online poker. The scheme may be extended to allow more servers, (and thus, increased security), simply by including the additional servers in the initial encryption. Finally, step one in the protocol may be done offline, allowing for large numbers of shuffled, encrypted \"decks\" to be pre-computed and cached, resulting in excellent in-game performance.\nQuestion: What is the limitation of the non-shuffling poker protocol described by Golle?",

All operations are byte-oriented. The algorithm uses a single 8\u00d78-bit S-box K, designed so that both K(X) and X XOR K(X) are injective functions. In each round, the bytes of the block are first permuted. Then each byte is XORed with a key byte and an earlier ciphertext byte, processed through the S-box, and XORed with the previous plaintext byte.\nThe key schedule is rather complex, processing the key with SXAL itself, beginning with a null key and using permuted intermediate results as later keys.\n\n== MBAL ==\nMBAL is an encryption algorithm built using SXAL that can be applied to messages any number of bytes in length (at least 8). It uses two 64-bit extended keys for key whitening on the first 64 bits. The algorithm consists of 9 steps:\n\nPre-whitening\nFm: An expanded version of SXAL applied to the entire message\nSXAL the block consisting of the first 4 and last 4 bytes\nReverse the byte order of the entire message\nFm\nReverse\nSXAL the ends\nFm\nPost-whiteningMBAL has been shown to be susceptible to both differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis."

    "instruction": "Context: Cyberbullying\n\n==Introduction==\nCyberbullying or cyberharassment is a form of bullying or harassment using electronic means. Cyberbullying and cyberharassment are also known as online bullying. It has become increasingly common, especially among teenagers, as the digital sphere has expanded and technology has advanced. Cyberbullying is when someone, typically a teenager, bullies or harasses others on the internet and other digital spaces, particularly on social media sites. \n\n\n\n== Tactics ==\nHarmful bullying behavior can include posting rumors, threats, sexual remarks, a victims' personal information, or pejorative labels (i.e. hate speech). Bullying or harassment can be identified by repeated behavior and an intent to harm. Victims of cyberbullying may experience lower self-esteem, increased suicidal ideation, and various negative emotional responses, including being anxious, frustrated, angry, or depressed.\n\n== Overview ==\nCyberbullying is in many cases an extension of already existing traditional bullying. Students who are bullied via the Internet have, in most cases, also been bullied in other more traditional ways before (e.g., physically or verbally). There are few students who are bullied exclusively over the Internet; these cyber victims are often physically stronger students, which causes bullies to prefer online confrontations over face-to-face contact at school.Awareness in the United States has risen in the 2010s, due in part to high-profile cases. Several US states and other countries have passed laws to combat cyberbullying. Some are designed to specifically target teen cyberbullying, while others extend from the scope of physical harassment. In cases of adult cyberharassment, these reports are usually filed beginning with local police. The laws differ by area or state.\nResearch has demonstrated a number of serious consequences of cyberbullying victimisation. Specific statistics on the negative effects of cyberbullying differ by country and other demographics. Some researchers point out there could be some way to use modern computer techniques to determine and stopping cyberbullying.Other research has suggested an uptick in cyberbullying during the COVID-19 pandemic when many youth and adults were quarantined at home and, as a consequence, online more often than before the pandemic. For example, a study of adults published in the Journal of Social Psychology identified statistically significant increases in pro-cyberbullying attitudes as well as in cyberbullying offending behavior. However, another study involving over 6,500 Canadian youth in grades 4\u201312 did not find higher rates of cyberbullying involvement. The authors speculated that this might be a result of closer monitoring and involvement of online activities by parents while their children were at home.Internet trolling is a common form of bullying that takes place in an online community (such as online gaming or social media) in order to elicit a reaction or disruption, or simply just for someone's own personal amusement. Cyberstalking is another form of bullying or harassment that uses electronic communications to stalk a victim; this may pose a credible threat to the victim.Not all negative interaction online or on social media can be attributed to cyberbullying. Research suggests that there are also interactions online that result in peer pressure, which can have a negative, positive, or neutral impact on those involved.\n\n== Definitions ==\nA frequently used definition of cyberbullying is \"an aggressive, intentional act or behavior that is carried out by a group or an individual, using electronic forms of contact, repeatedly and over time against a victim who cannot easily defend him or herself.\" It is to be distinguished from normal conflicts between people of comparable power or status that often also occur online.There are many variations of the definition, such as the National Crime Prevention Council's more specific definition: \"the process of using the Internet, cell phones or other devices to send or post text or images intended to hurt or embarrass another person.\" Cyberbullying is often similar to traditional bullying, with some notable distinctions. Victims of cyberbullying may not know the identity of their bully, or why the bully is targeting them, based on the online nature of the interaction. The harassment can have wide-reaching effects on the victim, as the content used to harass the victim can be spread and shared easily among many people and often remains accessible long after the initial incident.The terms \"cyberharassment\" and \"cyberbullying\" are sometimes used synonymously, though some people use the latter to refer specifically to harassment among minors or in a school setting.\n\n\n*** Cyberstalking ***\n\nCyberstalking is a form of online harassment in which the perpetrator uses electronic communications to stalk a victim. This is considered more dangerous than other forms of cyberbullying because it generally involves a credible threat to the victim's safety. Cyberstalkers may send repeated messages intended to threaten or harass, and they may encourage others to do the same, either explicitly or by impersonating their victim and asking others to contact them.This can be a combination of most of the other methods in order to stalk someone using electronic means. This can include finding the victims location, harassing them with spam, or using sextortion. An example of this situation occurring is when Paris Deshaunte Evitt, a 30-year old from Tulsa cyberstalked one of his former partners. A news article on it states, \"Between October 2018 and continuing until October 2020, Evitt used email, Facebook, and text messages to control and threaten the victim. However, his abuse of the victim had started years before. Between 2012 and 2019, Evitt was convicted on 5 different occasions for physically abusing the victim including strangulation, assault, and interfering with reporting. Evitt was also on state supervision at the time of the current offenses.\"\"(The unidentified victim) explained that Evitt had destroyed her sense of security and became emotional when she discussed Evitt\u2019s statement that he would rather see her dead than happy. She also stated, 'the longer he is away from my children and I, the more time we have to try and heal and move on with our lives, if that is even possible.'\"\n\n\n*** Trolling ***\n\nInternet trolls intentionally try to provoke or offend others in order to elicit a reaction. Trolls and cyberbullies do not always have the same goals: while some trolls engage in cyberbullying, others may be engaged in comparatively harmless mischief. A troll may be disruptive either for their own amusement or because they are genuinely a combative person. Trolling can include insults, false news, or in this case, terrorist threats.\nAn example of this is when the Infamous Roblox troll, Ruben Sim (real name Benjamin Simon), has been banned from the popular game Roblox. This ban was court ordered, and Sim was ordered to pay Roblox $150,000 before the case was settled. \"The court\u2019s judgement 'permanently restrains the Defendant (Simon)' from 'Making, publishing, or re-publishing false threats of terrorist activity relating to Roblox; Knowingly making false statements of fact about Roblox; Glamorizing or encouraging violence against Roblox, its employees, or facilities;' and more...Simon is also barred from 'accessing the Roblox Platform other than those public portions of the Roblox website that do not require an account to access,' and must stay 100 feet away from any Roblox office or facility, as well.\"\n\n\n*** Hate raids ***\nOn Twitch and other livestreaming services, hate raids are situations where a stream is \"raided\" by multiple viewers simultaneously that flood the chat with harassing and hateful messages, preventing the streamer from executing their stream. These viewers are typically automated bots, making it difficult to moderate and block these viewers by the streamer and their moderators.\n\n\n*** Spam ***\nSpamming is the act of creating multiple accounts, and sending mass amounts of messages to a target-especially despite being blocked. A common situation where spam can occur is after a breakup. If one partner is obsessive, they may send their ex multiple messages through multiple means. This can include social media, email, and fake accounts. This is often despite being blocked. The article What Can Police Do About Harassing Texts? states, \"Keep in mind that harassment of any kind is illegal and includes in person, over the phone, via text messages, through social media, or any other method. Some laws are in place about cyberbullying that are designed to protect the public from this happening.\"\n\n\n*** Impersonation ***\n\nImpersonation is the act of pretending to either be the victim or another person. If the offender pretends to be the victim, they may say or do things to hurt the victim's reputation. This can include hacking into a Twitter account and posting harmful tweets. One famous example is when Sony Music's Twitter account was hacked and posted the following statement: \"Britney spears is dead by accident! we will tell you more soon. #RIPBRITNEY.\" Britney Spears was, in fact, alive and well.\n\n\n*** Doxing ***\nDoxing is the act of disclosing a victim's personal data, which can include their home address, phone number, real name, and other things that are private. Doxing can happen when fans in fandoms with large fanbases often go too far when protecting their idols and enter the realm of cyberbullying. Extreme fans of the music genre \"K-pop\" sometimes dox fans of rival music groups. This specifically was shown in an incident where fans of the group BlackPink doxed the owner of a Twice fan account, sending him to a hospital. This is allegedly because a member of the group Twice disrespected a member of the group BlackPink.\n\n\n*** Sexual harassment ***\nOnline sexual harassment, using means of cyberbullying, typically is committed by men targeting young females. Sextortion, a form of sexual harassment, is the act of coercing a person into sharing intimate images before threatening to release them unless money is paid. It is a specific type of blackmail. The line between sexual harassment and cyberbullying is blurred.Aldyn C (only identified by his first name due to Dutch privacy laws), a 38-year-old Dutchman, harassed 39 people in the context of sextortion. 34 were women and five were gay men. One victim, 15-year-old Amanda Todd was blackmailed by Aldyn to send pictures of her chest. She committed suicide after he published the pictures. Aldyn threatened he would send his victim's explicit pictures and videos to family and porn sites if they did not comply to his demands. Aldyn was arrested and sentenced to 11 years. He pleaded not guilty to 72 charges, many of which were sexual-related.\nOften, teenage boys will blackmail their girl classmates for nudes, threatening to release embarrassing information. They also use revenge porn and release nudes of girls to get payback. This was the case when a 16-year-old student of W.F. West High School in Chehalis exploited more than 100 victims, many of which were his classmates. He owned over 900 photos and videos of victims.\n\n== Methods used ==\nManuals intended to educate the public about cyberbullying summarize that cyberbullying is inclusive of acts of intended cruelty to others in the form of posting or sending material using an internet capable device. Research, legislation and education in the field are ongoing. Research has identified basic definitions and guidelines to help recognize and cope with what is regarded as abuse of electronic communications.\nCyberbullying involves repeated behavior with intent to harm.\nCyberbullying is perpetrated through harassment, cyberstalking, denigration (sending or posting cruel rumors and falsehoods to damage reputation and friendships), impersonation, and exclusion (intentionally and cruelly excluding someone from an online group)Cyberbullying can be as simple as continuing to send emails or text messages harassing someone who has said they want no further contact with the sender. It may also include public actions such as repeated threats, sexual remarks, pejorative labels (i.e. hate speech) or defamatory false accusations, ganging up on a victim by making the person the subject of ridicule in online forums, hacking into or vandalizing sites about a person, and posting false statements as fact aimed a discrediting or humiliating a targeted person. Cyberbullying could be limited to posting rumors about a person on the internet with the intention of bringing about hatred in others' minds or convincing others to dislike or participate in online denigration of a target. It may go to the extent of personally identifying victims of crime and publishing materials defaming or humiliating them.Cyberbullies may disclose victims' personal data (e.g. real name, home address, or workplace/schools) on websites or forums\u2014called doxing, or may use impersonation, creating fake accounts, comments or sites posing as their target for the purpose of publishing material in their name that defames, discredits or ridicules them. This can leave the cyberbully anonymous, which can make it difficult for them to be caught or punished for their behavior, although not all cyberbullies maintain their anonymity. Users of semi-anonymous chat websites are at high risk for cyberbullying, as it is also easy in this outlet for a cyberbully to remain anonymous. Text or instant messages and emails between friends can also constitute cyberbullying if what is said is hurtful.\n\nThe recent rise of smartphones and mobile apps have yielded a more accessible form of cyberbullying. It is expected that cyberbullying via these platforms will occur more often than through more stationary internet platforms because of constant access to the internet. In addition, the combination of cameras and Internet access and the instant availability of these modern smartphone technologies yield specific types of cyberbullying not found in other platforms. It is likely that those cyberbullied via mobile devices will experience a wider range of cyberbullying methods than those who are exclusively bullied elsewhere.Some teens argue that some events categorized as cyberbullying are simply drama. Danah Boyd writes, \"teens regularly used that word [drama] to describe various forms of interpersonal conflict that ranged from insignificant joking around to serious jealousy-driven relational aggression. Whereas adults might have labeled many of these practices as bullying, teens saw them as drama.\"\n\n\n*** In social media ***\nCyberbullying can take place on social media sites such as Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter. \"By 2008, 93% of young people between the ages of 12 and 17 were online. In fact, youth spend more time with media than any single other activity besides sleeping.\" The last decade has witnessed a surge of cyberbullying, which is categorized as bullying that occurs through the use of electronic communication technologies, such as e-mail, instant messaging, social media, online gaming, or through digital messages or images sent to a cellular phone.There are many risks attached to social media sites, and cyberbullying is one of the larger risks. One million children were harassed, threatened or subjected to other forms of cyberbullying on Facebook during the past year, while 90 percent of social-media-using teens who have witnessed online cruelty say they have ignored mean behavior on social media, and 35 percent have done so frequently. Ninety-five percent of social-media-using teens who have witnessed cruel behavior on social networking sites say they have seen others ignoring the mean behavior, and 55 percent have witnessed this frequently. Terms like \"Facebook depression\" have been coined specifically in regard to the result of extended social media use, with cyberbullying playing a large part in this.\n\nCyberbullying has become more common nowadays because of all the technology that children have access to. The most common apps that teenagers use to cyberbully are Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat. Cyberbullying has become harder to stop because parents and teachers are unaware of when and where it is happening. A 2006 study found that 45% of teens and 30% of adolescents were cyberbullied while at school. This was linked to the reason students had access to their online devices such as cell phones or computers. Teens will say awful things to one another online and what they do not realize is that once it is said and published online it will not go away. Home used to be a safe place for teens, but now a child is still within reach of becoming a victim of cyberbullying \u2013 whether it is through YouTube, Ask.fm, or a text message. Wherever you face, it is easy to come across Cyberbullying making it almost impossible to escape.\nAccording to a 2013 Pew Research study, eight out of ten teens who use social media now share more information about themselves than they have in the past. This includes their location, images, and contact information. In order to protect children, it is important that personal information such as age, birthday, school/church, phone number, etc. be kept confidential.Two studies from 2014 found that 80% of body-shaming tweets are sent by women, while they also accounted for 50% of misogynistic tweets.Cyberbullying can also take place through the use of websites belonging to certain groups to effectively request the targeting of another individual or group. An example of this is the bullying of climate scientists and activists.\n\n\n*** In gaming ***\n\nOf those who reported having experienced online harassment in a Pew Research poll, 16% said the most recent incident had occurred in an online game. A study from National Sun Yat-sen University observed that children who enjoyed violent video games were significantly more likely to both experience and perpetrate cyberbullying.Another study that discusses the direct correlation between exposure to violent video games and cyber bullying also took into account personal factors such as \"duration of playing online games, alcohol consumption in the last 3 months, parents drunk in the last 3 months, anger, hostility, ADHD, and a sense of belonging\" as potential contributing factors of cyberbullying.\nGaming was a more common venue for men in which to experience harassment, whereas women's harassment tended to occur more via social media. Most respondents considered gaming culture to be equally welcoming to both genders, though 44% thought it favored men. Sexual harassment in gaming generally involves slurs directed towards women, sex role stereotyping, and overaggressive language. Keza MacDonald writes in The Guardian that sexism exists in gaming culture, but is not mainstream within it. U.S. President Barack Obama made reference to the harassment of women gamers during his remarks in honor of Women's History Month.Competitive gaming scenes have been less welcoming of women than has broader gaming culture. In an internet-streamed fighting game competition, one female gamer forfeited a match after the coach of her team, Aris Bakhtanians, stated, \"The sexual harassment is part of the culture. If you remove that from the fighting game community, it's not the fighting game community.\" The comments were widely condemned by gamers, with comments in support of sexual harassment \"drowned out by a vocal majority of people expressing outrage, disappointment and sympathy.\" The incident built momentum for action to counter sexual harassment in gaming.Some game developers have been subjected to harassment and death threats by players upset by changes to a game or by a developer's online policies. Harassment also occurs in reaction to critics such as Jack Thompson or Anita Sarkeesian, whom some fans see as threats to the medium. Various people have been harassed in connection with the Gamergate controversy. Harassment related to gaming is not of a notably different severity or tenor compared to online harassment motivated by other subcultures or advocacy issues. Other developers have been harassed simply due to misogyny or anti-LGBTQ+ stances. A notable case was the death of \"Near\", the developer of Higan, a console emulator, who took their own life after becoming the subject to ridicule from members of the online Kiwi Farms board following their announcement of being nonbinary.Sabotage among rival crowdfunding campaigns is a recurring problem for projects related to gaming.Some instances of swatting in games such as Call of Duty and League of Legends have resulted in law enforcement SWAT units called on individuals' homes as a prank. On December 28, 2017, Wichita, Kansas, police officers killed Andrew Finch at his Kansas home in a reported swatting prank.\n\n\n*** In search engines ***\nInformation cascades happen when users start passing along information they assume to be true, but cannot know to be true, based on information on what other users are doing. This can be accelerated by search engines' ranking technologies and their tendency to return results relevant to a user's previous interests. This type of information spreading is hard to stop. Information cascades over social media and the Internet may also be harmless, and may contain truthful information.Bullies use Google bombs (a term applicable to any search engine) to increase the prominence of favored posts sorted by the most popular searches, done by linking to those posts from as many other web pages as possible. Examples include the campaign for the neologism \"santorum\" organized by the LGBT lobby. Google bombs can manipulate the Internet's search engines regardless of how authentic the pages are, but there is a way to counteract this type of manipulation as well.\n\n== Famous cyberbullying cases ==\nThere are many famous cases of cyberbullying online (eg. Daisy Coleman). \nAlthough most people may not realize it, some of these internet \"memes\" actually show cyberbullying in action.\n\n\n*** Greatest Freakout Ever videos ***\nAlthough it is not clear on whether the videos were faked or not, this YouTube series made a big impact on YouTube and the internet as a whole. The first and most famous video of the series aired on May 9, 2009. It shows 15-year-old Jack Quire (username \"wafflepwn\") secretly filming his older brother, Stephen, have a temper tantrum after their parents cancelled Stephen's World of Warcraft account. Stephen does many embarrassing things, including taking his shorts off and attempting to stick a TV remote up his butt. According to TV Tropes, \"Over the span of twelve years, the series is now over 40 videos long and has garnered over a total of 551 million views.\" Stephen is now known exclusively for his temper tantrums.\n\n\n*** Star Wars Kid ***\nUploaded in 2003, the star of the video, Ghyslain Raza (a 9th grader at the time) is shown messing around and waving around a golf ball retriever as if it is a real Jedi lightsaber. He was helping his friend parody the movie Star Wars. The video was uploaded to YouTube a few months later by Raza's classmates without his knowledge or permission. The video blew up and because one of the first viral internet memes. The video accumulated 900 million views.\nDespite trying to protect his privacy, Raza was mocked both online and in real life. He was body shamed, doxxed, and told to commit suicide, among other things. Students at school leaped onto tables to mock him, and his video was parodied on multiple shows including South Park. Raza had to move schools multiple times, and became homeschooled. He was harassed for years over a video he did not upload. Today, he is working on a documentary talking about his internet fame and the harassment that came along with it. He wants to focus on internet privacy and consent.\n\n== Ethical cyberbullying ==\nControversially, some internet users use cyberbullying for \"ethical\" means. Some reasons include justice for victims, activism, and persuading/scaring politicians. Committing moral actions for immoral causes is commonly seen in the realm of activism.\n\n\n*** Anonymous hacker group ***\nThe hacktivist group \"Anonymous\" uses cyberbullying tactics for activism. Its users are anonymous, even to each other. They have doxed numerous politicians and vandalized numerous governmental websites. Recently, they have doxed Supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, who was instrumental in overturning Roe v Wade (protecting rights to abortion). His Pornhub account has been posted on the database Doxbin.\nThe announcement posted on Anonymous' TikTok account (which is now banned) on April 11, 2023, stated as follows, \u201cThis is a message to the GOP from Anonymous. We gave you warnings. We gave you time to adjust your actions to meet the wants and needs of the people. In that time you have used the majorities you hold in states to expel members of Congress. You passed laws to inspect transgender children\u2019s genitalia. You have overstepped, and now we can share what we did with that time. Anonymous has a dark web database where information is posted to the world and the collective\u2026. We are going to call this dark web database \u2018the bin'...Remember, human rights and civil rights are not negotiable.\u201d\n\n\n*** Vigilantism ***\nYouTube account \"Scammer Payback\" creates videos hacking into scammers' web cameras and doxing scammers. He posts the videos to YouTube, exposing them, revealing their identities, and humiliating them. He uses some cyberbullying methods to get justice, such as doxing and trolling. His bio reads, \"Scammers are ruthless, and that is why I am here. My channel is all about bringing awareness to this critical problem with humor and fun. We will learn a lot of things along the way and if I help one person through this, it will be worth it.\"\n\n\n*** Predator catchers ***\nSome internet users pose as children online in order to catch online predators, child sex trafficking rings and pedophiles. One such user is Roo Powell, who poses as a 15-year-old girl online in order to catch sex offenders targeting children. She is the star of the show \"Undercover Underage,\" which documents her experiences exposing pedophiles and working with law enforcement. She is the founder of the nonprofit organization SOSA (Safe from Online Sex Abuse). Powell educates children on the dangers of online predators and talks to them about how to practice online safety.\n\n== Law enforcement ==\nA majority of states have laws that explicitly include electronic forms of communication within stalking or harassment laws. Most law enforcement agencies have cyber-crime units, and Internet stalking is often treated with more seriousness than reports of physical stalking. Help and resources can be searched by state or area.\n\n\n*** Schools ***\nThe safety of online privacy issues in schools is increasingly becoming a focus of state legislative action. There was an increase in cyberbullying enacted legislation between 2006 and 2010. Initiatives and curriculum requirements also exist in the UK (the Ofsted eSafety guidance) and Australia (Overarching Learning Outcome 13).\nIn 2012, a group of teenagers in a design class New Haven, Connecticut, developed an application to help fight bullying, \"Back Off Bully\" (BOB). This is an anonymous resource for computer, smart phone or iPad, designed so when someone witnesses or is the victim of bullying, they can immediately report the incident. The app asks questions about time, location and how the bullying is happening, as well as provides positive action and empowerment regarding the incident. The reported information goes to a database, where it may be studied by administrators. Common threads are spotted so others can intervene and break the bully's pattern. \"Back Off Bully\" is being considered as standard operating procedure at schools across Connecticut, while recent studies carried out among 66 high school teachers have concluded that prevention programs have proved ineffective to date.Teachers can also be cyberbullied by pupils, as well as by parents and other school staff.\n\n\n*** Protection ***\nThere are laws that only address online harassment of children or focus on child predators, as well as laws that protect adult cyberstalking victims, or victims of any age. Currently, there are 45 cyberstalking (and related) laws on the books. While some sites specialize in laws that protect victims age 18 and under, Working to Halt Online Abuse is a help resource containing a list of current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws. It also lists those states that do not yet have laws, and related laws from other countries. The Global Cyber Law Database (GCLD) aims to become the most comprehensive and authoritative source of cyber laws for all countries.Several states, including Florida, California, and Missouri have passed laws against cyberbullying. California prohibits the use of an electronic device to cause someone to fear for their life. In Florida, the \"Jeffrey Johnson Stand Up for All Students Act\" prohibits any type of bullying including cyberbullying. In Missouri, anyone who violently threatens someone over social media can be convicted with a Class A misdemeanor, but if the victim is seventeen years or younger, they can be convicted with a Class D felony.\n\n\n*** Age ***\nChildren report negative online behaviors occurring from the second grade. According to research, boys initiate negative online activity earlier than girls. However, by middle school, girls are more likely to engage in cyberbullying than boys. Whether the bully is male or female, the purpose of childhood bullying is to intentionally embarrass, harass, intimidate, or make threats online.\nStudies on the psycho-social effects of cyberspace have begun to monitor the effects cyberbullying may have on the victims. Consequences of cyberbullying are multi-faceted, and affect both online and offline behavior. Research on adolescents reported that changes in the victims' behavior as a result of cyberbullying could potentially be positive. Victims \"created a cognitive pattern of bullies, which consequently helped them to recognize aggressive people.\"However, the Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace abstract reports critical impacts in almost all of the respondents, taking the form of lower self-esteem, loneliness, disillusionment, and distrust of people. The more extreme effects included self-harm. Children have killed each other and committed suicide after cyberbullying incidents. Some cases of digital self-harm have been reported in which an individual engages in cyberbullying against themselves, or purposefully and knowingly exposes themselves to cyberbullying.\n\n\n*** Adults ***\nCyberstalking may be an extension of physical stalking and may have criminal consequences. A target's understanding of why cyberstalking is happening is helpful to remedy and take protective action. Among factors that motivate stalkers are envy, pathological obsession (professional or sexual), unemployment or failure with own job or life, or the desire to intimidate and cause others to feel inferior. The stalker may be delusional and believe they \"know\" the target. The stalker wants to instill fear in a person to justify their status, or may  believe they can get away with these actions due to online anonymity.The US federal cyberstalking law is designed to prosecute people for using electronic means to repeatedly harass or threaten someone online. There are resources dedicated to helping adult victims deal with cyberbullies legally and effectively. One of the steps recommended is to record everything and contact police. In Mexico, Olimpia Coral Melo,  promoted the creation of a law against digital harassment that took her name, the Olimpia Law.\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n*** Australia ***\nThe nationwide Australian Covert Bullying Prevalence Survey (Cross et al., 2009) assessed cyberbullying experiences among 7,418 students. The results indicated that rates of cyberbullying increased with age, with 4.9% of students in Year 4 reporting cyberbullying compared to 7.9% in year nine. Cross et al., (2009) reported that rates of bullying and harassing others were lower, but also increased with age. Only 1.2% of Year 4 students reported cyberbullying others compared to 5.6% of Year 9 students.\n\n\n*** China ***\nIn mainland China, cyberbullying has yet to receive adequate scholarly attention. A study investigating the risk factors of cyberbullying sampled 1,438 high school students from central China. Data  showed that 34.84% had participated in bullying and 56.88% had been bullied online.A study on cyberbullying in Hong Kong chose 48 out of 7,654 students from elementary school to high school who were classified as potential aggressors related to cyberbullying. 31 out of 48 students declared they barely participated in cyber-attacks. It is common among high school students (28 out of 36 students) to participate in social media platforms; 58% admitted to changing a nickname for others, 56.3% to humiliation, 54.2% to making fun of someone, and 54.2% to spreading rumors. The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups interviewed 1,820 teenagers, 17.5% of whom indicated having experienced cyberbullying. This included insults, abuse, and the publishing of personal private pictures on social media without permission.\n\n\n*** European Union ***\nIn a study published in 2011, across 25 EU member states studied, an average 6% of children (9\u201316 years old) had been bullied and only 3% of them confessed to having been a bully. However, in an earlier publication by Hasenbrink et al. (2009), reporting on the results from a meta analysis from European Union countries, the authors estimated (via median results) that approximately 18% of European young people had been \"bullied/harassed/stalked\" via the internet and mobile phones. Cyberharassment rates for young people across the EU member states ranged from 10% to 52%. \n\n\n*** Finland ***\nSourander et al. (2010) conducted a population-based cross-sectional study that took place in Finland. The authors of this study took the self-reports of 2,215 Finish adolescents between the ages of 13 and 16 about cyberbullying and cybervictimization during the previous six months. It was found that, amongst the total sample, 4.8% were victims only, 7.4% were cyberbullies only, and 5.4% were cyberbully-victims.\nThe authors of this study were able to conclude that cyberbullying, as well as cybervictimization, is associated not only with psychiatric issues, but with psychosomatic issues as well. Many adolescents in the study reported headaches or difficulty sleeping. The authors believe that their results indicate a greater need for new ideas on how to prevent cyberbullying and what to do when it occurs. It is clearly a worldwide problem that needs to be taken seriously.\n\n\n*** Ireland ***\nThe Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) pilot survey was carried out in eight post-primary schools across Ireland, including 318 students aged 15\u201318. 59% were boys and 41% were girls. Participation in this survey was voluntary for students, and consent had to be obtained from parents, students and the school itself. This survey was anonymous and confidential, and it took 40 minutes to complete. It asked questions on traditional forms of bullying, as well as cyberbullying, risk behaviors and self-reported health and life satisfaction.\n66% of the students said that they had never been bullied, 14% had been victims of traditional forms of bullying, 10% had been victims of cyberbullying, and the remaining 10% had been victims of both traditional forms of bullying and cyberbullying. Boys mostly said they were victims of traditional forms of bullying, and girls mostly were victims of both traditional forms of bullying and cyberbullying. 20% of the students in this survey said that they had been cyberbullied, showing that cyberbullying is on the rise.Arrow DIT claims that 23% of 9\u201316 year olds in Ireland have been bullied online or offline, compared to 19% in Europe. Although online bullying in Ireland stands at 4% according to Arrow DIT, this is lower than the European average, which stands at 6%, and half that of the UK where 8% reported being cyberbullied. Traditional forms of bullying in Ireland occur more often than in Europe.\nA 2018 study by Dublin City University (DCU)'s National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre (ABC) found that almost 10% of post-primary teachers were victims of cyberbullying, and 15% knew of a colleague who had experienced it in the previous 12 months. 59% of the bullying was by pupils, mainly on social media, with the rest perpetrated by parents and other school staff. Various effects on bullied teachers included increased stress and anxiety, \"negative impacts on their working environment, and a reluctance to report the issue and seek help from management\".\n\n\n*** Japan ***\nAccording to recent research, in Japan, 17 percent (compared with a 25-country average of 37 percent) of youth between the ages of 8 and 17 have been victims of online bullying. The number shows that online bullying is a serious concern in Japan. Teenagers who spend more than 10 hours a week on the Internet are more likely to become the targets of online bullying, though only 28 percent of the survey participants understood what cyberbullying is. However, they do know the severity of the issue; 63 percent of the surveyed students worried about being targeted as victims of cyberbullying.Since teenagers find themselves congregating socially on the internet via social media, they become easy targets for cyberbullying. Cyberbullying may occur via email, text, chat rooms, and social media websites. Some cyberbullies set up websites or blogs to post the target's images, publicize their personal information, gossip about the target, express why they hate the target, request people to agree with the bully's view, and send links to the target to make sure they are watching the activity.Much cyberbullying is an act of relational aggression, which involves alienating the victim from peers through gossip or ostracism. This kind of attack can be easily launched via texting or other online activities. One 19-year-old Japanese student was targeted by classmates who posted his photo online, insulted him constantly, and asked him to die. Because of the constant harassment, he did attempt suicide twice. Even when he quit school, the attacks did not stop.Cyberbullying can cause serious psychological impact to the victims. They often feel anxious, nervous, tired, and depressed. Other examples of negative psychological trauma include losing confidence as a result of being socially isolated from their schoolmates or friends. Psychological problems can also show up in the form of headaches, skin problems, abdominal pain, sleep problems, bed-wetting, and crying. It may also lead victims to commit suicide to end the bullying.\n\n\n*** United States ***\n\n\n**** 2000 ****\nA 2000 survey by the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire found that 6% of the young people who completed the survey had experienced some form of harassment, including threats and negative rumors, and 2% had suffered distressing harassment.\n\n\n**** 2004 ****\nThe 2004 I-Safe.org survey of 1,500 students between grades 4 and 8 found:\n42% of children had been bullied online. One in four had experienced it more than once.\n35% had been threatened online. Nearly one in five had experienced it more than once.\n21% had received mean or threatening e-mails or other messages.\n58% admitted that someone had said hurtful things to them online. More than four out of ten said this had happened more than once.\n58% had not told their parents or an adult about something hurtful that had happened to them online.\n\n\n**** 2005 ****\nThe Youth Internet Safety Survey-2, conducted by the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire in 2005, found that 9% of the young people in the survey had experienced some form of harassment. The survey was a nationally representative telephone survey of 1,500 youth 10\u201317 years old. One-third reported feeling distressed by the incident, with distress being more likely for younger respondents and those who were the victims of aggressive harassment (including being telephoned, sent gifts, or visited at home by the harasser). Compared to youth not harassed online, victims are more likely to have social problems. On the other hand, youth who harass others are more likely to have problems with rule breaking and aggression.Hinduja and Patchin completed a study in the summer of 2005 of approximately 1,500 Internet-using adolescents and found that over one-third of youth reported being victimized online, and over 16% of respondents admitted to cyberbullying others. While most of the instances of cyberbullying involved relatively minor behavior (41% were disrespected, 19% were called names), over 12% were physically threatened and about 5% were scared for their safety. Notably, fewer than 15% of victims told an adult about the incident. Additional research by Hinduja and Patchin in 2007 found that youth who report being victims of cyberbullying also experience stress or strain that is related to offline problem behaviors such as running away from home, cheating on a test, skipping school, or using alcohol or marijuana. The authors acknowledge that both of these studies provide only preliminary information about the nature and consequences of online bullying, due to the methodological challenges associated with an online survey.\nAccording to a 2005 survey by the National Children's Home charity and Tesco Mobile, of 770 youth between the ages of 11 and 19, 20% of respondents revealed that they had been bullied via electronic means. Almost three-quarters (73%) stated that they knew the bully, while 26% stated that the offender was a stranger. 10% of responders indicated that another person had taken a picture and/or video of them via a cellular phone camera, consequently making them feel uncomfortable, embarrassed, or threatened. Many youths are not comfortable telling an authority figure about their cyberbullying victimization for fear their access to technology will be taken from them; while 24% and 14% told a parent or teacher respectively, 28% did not tell anyone, and 41% told a friend.\n\n\n**** 2006 ****\nAccording to the 2006 Harris Interactive Cyberbullying Research Report, commissioned by the National Crime Prevention Council, cyberbullying is a problem that \"affects almost half of all American teens\".\n\n\n**** 2007 ****\n\nStudies published in 2007 in the Journal of Adolescent Health indicated young people reporting being victims of electronic aggression in a range of 9% to 35%.In 2007, Debbie Heimowitz, a Stanford University master's student, created Adina's Deck, a film based on Stanford-accredited research. She worked in focus groups for ten weeks in three schools to learn about the problem of cyberbullying in northern California. The findings determined that over 60% of students had been cyberbullied and were victims of cyberbullying. The film is now being used in classrooms nationwide as it was designed around learning goals pertaining to problems that students had understanding the topic. The middle school of Megan Meier is reportedly using the film as a solution to the crisis in their town.\n\n\n**** 2008 ****\nIn 2008, researchers Sameer Hinduja (Florida Atlantic University) and Justin Patchin (University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire) published a book on cyberbullying that summarized the current state of cyberbullying research (Bullying Beyond the Schoolyard: Preventing and Responding to Cyberbullying). Their research documented that cyberbullying instances had been increasing over the preceding several years. They also reported findings from a then-recent study of cyberbullying. In a random sample of approximately 2000 middle-school students from a large school district in the southern United States, about 10% of respondents reported being cyberbullied in the previous 30 days while over 17% reported having been cyberbullied at least once in their lifetime. While these rates are slightly lower than some of the findings from their previous research, Hinduja and Patchin pointed out that the earlier studies were predominantly conducted among older adolescents and Internet samples; that is, older youth use the Internet more frequently and are more likely to experience cyberbullying than younger children.\n\n\n**** 2011 ****\n\nAccording to the 2011 National Crime Victimization Survey, conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, School Crime Supplement (SCS), 9% of students age 12\u201318 admitted to having experienced cyberbullying during that school year (with a coefficient of variation between 30% and 50%).\n\n\n**** 2013 ****\nIn the Youth Risk Behavior Survey 2013, the Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published results of its survey as part of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) in June 2014, indicating the percentage of school children being bullied through e-mail, chat rooms, instant messaging, websites, or texting (\"electronically bullied\") during the course of 2013.\n\n\n**** 2014 ****\nIn 2014, Mehari, Farrell, and Le published a study that focused on the literature on cyberbullying among adolescents. They found that researchers have generally assumed that cyberbullying is distinct from aggression perpetrated in person. Mehari et al. suggest that the media through which aggression is perpetrated may be best conceptualized as a new classification of aggression, rather than considering cyberbullying as a distinct counterpart to existing forms of aggression. They suggest that future research on cyberbullying be considered within the context of theoretical and empirical knowledge of aggression in adolescence.Mary Howlett-Brandon's doctoral dissertation analyzed the National Crime Victimization Survey: Student Crime Supplement, 2009, to focus on the cyberbullying victimization of Black and White students in specific conditions.\n\n\n**** 2015 ****\nWalletHub's 2015's Best & Worst States at Controlling Bullying report measured the relative levels of bullying in 42 states. According to the report, North Dakota, Illinois, Louisiana, Rhode Island, and Washington, D.C., have the most attempted suicides by high school students. The five states with highest percentage of students being bullied on campus are Missouri, Michigan, Idaho, North Dakota, and Montana.Cyberbullying on social media has usually been student-to-student, but recently, students have been cyberbullying their teachers. High school students in Colorado created a Twitter site that bullies teachers. This ranges from obscenities to false accusations of inappropriate actions with students.\n\n\n*** Gender ***\nResearch conducted to try to determine differences in cyberbullying patterns comparing male to female and ages of each are relatively inconclusive. There are some factors that lean towards males being more involved in cyberbullying behaviors due to males tending to have more aggressive behaviors than females. This is not proven, but speculated based on literature reviews of research indicating that significant data is self-reported. Comparatively, the review of articles indicates that age differences have some indicators of cyberbullying; increasing age indicates increasing bullying behaviors. Gender differences have mixed results, but one finding indicated that younger females (10 or 11) and older males (13+) tend to engage in cyber bullying behaviors.Cyberbullies mostly have at least one common trait. Cyberbullies generally get angry and discouraged easily and usually have strong personalities. They connect with others belligerently and do not care for the feelings of their victims. Both males and females engage in cyberbullying. Females are involved in cyberbullying just as much as males, and females are sometimes even found more involved in cyberbullying than males are. The reason behind this is because of the way they respond; men will usually respond with physical retaliation, while women will use \"indirect forms such as gossiping.\" As cyberbullying is a more indirect form, women are more likely to be involved.Also, women tend to have less face-to-face confrontations than men, and since cyberbullying occurs online, this allows women to have a greater chance to be attacked. According to a 2017 Pew Research study on online harassment, 14% of Americans have been harassed because of their political views. Such harassment affects men and women differently; men are approximately twice as likely as women to have experienced online harassment because of their political views. However, women politicians are disproportionately more likely to be sexually harassed online. Women lawmakers are three times more likely than their male counterparts to receive sexually abusive comments, including threats of rape, beatings, death, or abduction.\n\n== Legislation ==\n\n\n*** Jurisdictions ***\n\n\n**** United States ****\nLegislation geared at penalizing cyberbullying has been introduced in a number of U.S. states including New York, Missouri, Rhode Island and Maryland. At least 45 states have passed laws against digital harassment. Dardenne Prairie of Springfield, Missouri, passed a city ordinance making online harassment a misdemeanor. The city of St. Charles, Missouri passed a similar ordinance. Missouri is among the states where lawmakers are pursuing state legislation, with task forces expected to have cyberbullying laws drafted and implemented. In June 2008, Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.) and Rep. Kenny Hulshof (R-Mo.) proposed a federal law that would criminalize acts of cyberbullying.Lawmakers are seeking to address cyberbullying with new legislation because there is currently no specific law on the books that deals with it. A fairly new federal cyberstalking law might address such acts, according to Parry Aftab, but no one has been prosecuted under it yet. The proposed federal law would make it illegal to use electronic means to \"coerce, intimidate, harass or cause other substantial emotional distress.\"\nIn August 2008, the California state legislature passed one of the first laws in the country to deal directly with cyberbullying. Assembly Bill 86 2008 gives school administrators the authority to discipline students for bullying, offline or online. This law took effect on January 1, 2009.A law in New York's Albany County that criminalized cyberbullying was struck down as unconstitutional by the New York Court of Appeals in People v. Marquan M.\nA recent ruling first seen in the UK determined that it is possible for an Internet service provider (ISP) to be liable for the content of the sites it hosts, setting a precedent that any ISP should treat a notice of complaint seriously and investigate it immediately.18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c) criminalizes the making of threats via the Internet.\nWhile some states have laws that require schools to mediate cyberbullying conflicts, several states have been sued on First Amendment grounds for doing so. By examining the decisions of three such lawsuits heard in lower courts, Alvin J. Primack and Kevin A. Johnson argued that current First Amendment doctrine, particularly the case of Morse v. Frederick (2007), may offer interpretive resources for justifying administrative reach to some online digital speech. They concluded, \"[w]ithout clearer standards, school administrators are likely to feel constrained and err on the side of inaction.\"\n\n\n**** United Kingdom ****\nIn early February 2022, ministers of the UK parliament planned to add to their proposed Online Safety Bill several criminal offences against those who send death threats online or deliberately share dangerous disinformation about fake Covid cures. Other new offences, such as revenge porn, posts advertising people-smuggling, and messages encouraging people to commit suicide, would fall under the responsibilities of online platforms like Facebook and Twitter to tackle.\n\n\n**** Philippines ****\n\nThe Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 defines cyberlibel as a punishable offence under Section 355 of the Revised Penal Code of 1930.\n\n\n**** European Union ****\nSince the 1990s, the United Kingdom and other European countries have been working to solve workplace bullying since there is no legislation regulating cyberbullying. The pervasive nature of technology has made the act of bullying online much easier. A 24-hour internet connection gives bullies a neverending opportunity to find and bully victims. Employers in the European Union have more legal responsibility to their employees than do those in other countries. Since employers do not have the ability to fire or hire an employee at will like in the United States, employers in Europe are held to a high standard in how their employees are treated.\nIn 2007, the European Union developed the Framework Agreement on Harassment and Violence at Work, a law that prevents bullying occurring in the workplace and holds employers accountable for providing fair working conditions. The law defines the responsibilities of an employer such as protecting their employees from bullies in a work environment and the psychological pain a victim faces from bullies during business hours. Lawyers pursuing cyberbullying cases use the Ordinance on Victimization at Work law, since there are not any laws specifically condemning cyberbullying.In 1993, Sweden was the first European Union country to have a law against cyberbullying. The Ordinance on Victimization at Work protected victims from \"recurrent reprehensible or distinctly negative actions which are directed which are directed against individual employees in an offensive manner and can result in those employees being placed outside the workplace community\".In 2002, France passed the Social Modernization Law, which added consequences to the French Labor Code for cyberbullying such as holding employers accountable for their involvement in harassment. The legislation defines \"moral harassment\" as \"repeated acts leading to a deterioration of the working conditions and that are likely to harm the dignity, the physical or psychological heath of the victim or his professional career.\"The United Kingdom does not have anti-bullying legislation. However, it does have the Protection From Harassment Act, an anti-stalking law. U.K. courts have used this legislation in bullying cases.\n\nThe United States and some other countries have more extensive legislation on cyberbullying than the European Union. Cyberbullying incidents on social media are widespread and have increased drastically in number. However, the process of getting a claim against a bully is not an easy one because of the victim's need to provide sufficient evidence to prove the existence of bullying.\nAs of mid-2015, countries in the European Union like the United Kingdom are in the process of creating laws specially related to cyberbullying. Since the process takes time, the government is supporting school programs to promote internet safety with the help of teachers and parents. This will allow the government to take the time it needs to create the cyberbullying laws while helping safeguard students from cyberbullying as much as possible.\n\n\n*** Research on preventive legislation ***\nResearchers suggest that programs be put in place for prevention of cyberbullying. These programs would be incorporated into school curricula and would include online safety and instruction on how to use the Internet properly. This could teach the victim proper methods of potentially avoiding the cyberbully, such as blocking messages or increasing the security of their computer.Even in a perfect world, no crime can be stopped fully. That is why it is suggested that within this prevention method, effective coping strategies should be introduced and adopted. People can adopt coping strategies to combat future cyberbullying. Coping strategies may include social support groups composed of victims of cyberbullying, which could allow students to share their stories, and remove the feeling of being alone.\nTeachers should be involved in all prevention educational models, as they are essentially the \"police\" of the classroom. Most cyberbullying often goes unreported as the victim feels nothing can be done to help in their current situation. However, if given the proper tools with preventive measures and more power in the classroom, teachers can be of assistance; if the parent, teacher, and victim can work together, solutions may be found.There have been many legislative attempts to facilitate the control of bullying and cyberbullying. Some existing legislation is incorrectly thought to be tied to bullying and cyberbullying (including terms such as \"libel\" and \"slander\"). The problem is that the existing legislation does not directly apply to bullying, nor define it as its own criminal behavior. Anti-cyberbullying advocates have even expressed concern about the broad scope of some of the bills attempted to be passed.In the United States, attempts have been made to pass legislation against cyberbullying. Few states attempted to pass broad sanctions in an effort to prohibit cyberbullying. Problems include how to define cyberbullying and cyberstalking, and, if charges are pressed, whether this violates the bully's freedom of speech. B. Walther said that \"Illinois is the only state to criminalize 'electronic communication(s) sent for the purpose of harassing another person' when the activity takes place outside a public school setting.\" This was criticized for infringement on freedom of speech.Preventing a child from being cyberbullied is hard, but now they are working to form programs and laws to help stop the issue from getting worse than it already is. They have created movies such as Cyberbully by Charles Biname and The Duff by Ari Sandel for teenagers to watch and see how cyberbullying can affect an individual. Children that are victims of this problem feel they can not go to an adult for help because they may feel embarrassed by the situation. Bullying online will not only hurt the teenager emotionally, but there is also a risk of the child hurting themselves physically as well; in 2017, suicide was the tenth leading cause of death among persons in the United States.Being able to tell if a child is being hurt from this issue can be tough, but there are certain things that a child will do that should give a red flag that they are being bullied. A cyberbully could have said nasty words to that child and the victim could be looking for compliments. If the victim is always online wondering when the bully will strike next that could also be a sign. Being an active parent in their children's lives will make a difference on whether their child is experiencing online bullying or not. Also bringing police involved in the case will be a problem solver too.\n\n== Harmful effects ==\nResearch has demonstrated a number of serious consequences of cyberbullying victimization. Victims may have lower self-esteem, increased suicidal ideation, and a variety of emotional responses, including being scared, frustrated, angry, and depressed. Cyberbullying may be more harmful than traditional bullying, because there is no escaping it. One of the most damaging effects is that a victim begins to avoid friends and activities, which is often the very intention of the bully.\nCyberbullying campaigns are sometimes so damaging that victims have committed suicide. There are at least four examples in the United States in which cyberbullying has been linked to the suicide of a teenager. The suicide of Megan Meier is an example that led to the conviction of the adult perpetrator of the attacks. Holly Grogan committed suicide by jumping off a 30-foot bridge near Gloucester in the UK. It was reported that a number of her schoolmates had posted a number of hateful messages on her Facebook page.According to Lucie Russell, director of campaigns, policy and participation at youth mental health charity Young Minds, young people who suffer from mental disorders are vulnerable to cyberbullying as they are sometimes unable to shrug it off:\n\nWhen someone says nasty things healthy people can filter that out, they're able to put a block between that and their self-esteem. But mentally unwell people don't have the strength and the self-esteem to do that, to separate it, and so it gets compiled with everything else. To them, it becomes the absolute truth \u2013 there's no filter, there's no block. That person will take that on, take it as fact.\nSocial media has allowed bullies to disconnect from the impact they may be having on others.\n\n\n*** Intimidation, emotional damage, and suicide ***\nAccording to the Cyberbullying Research Center, \"there have been several high\u2010profile cases involving teenagers taking their own lives in part because of being harassed and mistreated over the Internet, a phenomenon we have termed cyberbullicide \u2013 suicide indirectly or directly influenced by experiences with online aggression.\"\nCyberbullying is an intense form of psychological abuse, whose victims are more than twice as likely to suffer from mental disorders compared to traditional bullying.The reluctance youth have in telling an authority figure about instances of cyberbullying has led to fatal outcomes. At least three children between the ages of 12 and 13 have committed suicide due to depression brought on by cyberbullying, according to reports by USA Today and the Baltimore Examiner. These include the suicide of Ryan Halligan and the suicide of Megan Meier, the latter of which resulted in United States v. Lori Drew. Teen suicides tied to cyberbullying have recently become more prevalent. Rebecca Ann Sedwick committed suicide after being terrorized through mobile applications such as Ask.fm, Kik Messenger and Voxer.\n\n\n*** On youth and teenagers ***\nThe effects of cyberbullying vary, but research illustrates that cyberbullying adversely affects youth to a higher degree than adolescents and adults. Youth are more likely to suffer since they are still growing mentally and physically. Jennifer N. Caudle, a certified family physician, says, \"Kids that are bullied are likely to experience anxiety, depression, loneliness, unhappiness and poor sleep\".\n\nMost of the time cyberbullying goes unnoticed; the younger generation hides their bullying from anyone that can help to prevent the bullying from occurring and from getting worse. Between 20% and 40% of adolescents are victims of cyberbullying worldwide. The youth slowly change their behaviors and actions so they become more withdrawn and quiet, but this may go unnoticed since the change is subtle. Metin Deniz believes cyberbullying will \"become a serious problem in the future with an increase in the Internet and mobile phone usage among young people\".If preventive actions are not taken against cyberbullying, younger children in addition to teenagers will feel more lonely and depressed along with having significant changes in their eating and sleeping patterns as well as loss of interest in their normal activities. These changes will affect their growth and development into adulthood. Younger children and teenagers are 76.2% less likely to display suicidal behaviors and thoughts, but are still at risk depending on other factors such as mental health status, home care, and relationships with others. The risk of suicide increases by 35% to 45% when victims do not have any support from anyone in their life, and cyberbullying amplifies the situation.Young people seem particularly vulnerable to the effects of cyberbullying through anonymous social media, perhaps because adolescents are attracted to these platforms as a means of seeking validation from their peers. Abuse on these platforms, such as ASKfm, Yik Yak and Sarahah, can be particularly keenly felt by young people, leading to issues of loss of confidence. There have been a number of suicides related to bullying on these platforms in the US and Britain.\n\n\n*** Suppression of speech ***\nBy at least 2018, some doctors have been targets of online harassment from anti-vaccine activists responding to their social media posts, including hundreds of negative false reviews on doctor ratings sites. This made some of the doctors more reluctant to share information about vaccines, but others formed groups to spread factual information about vaccine safety on social media in response.\n\n== Awareness ==\n\n\n*** Campaigns ***\n\n\n**** International ****\nThe Cybersmile Foundation is a cyberbullying charity committed to tackling all forms of online bullying, abuse, and hate campaigns. It was founded in 2010 in response to the increasing number of cyberbullying related incidents of depression, eating disorders, social isolation, self-harm and suicides devastating lives around the world. Cybersmile provides support to victims and their friends and families through social media interaction, email and helpline support. They also run an annual event, Stop Cyberbullying Day, to draw attention to the issue.\n\n\n**** Spain ****\nMultiple non-profit organizations fight cyberbullying and cyberstalking. They advise victims, provide awareness campaigns, and report offenses to the police. These NGOs include the Prot\u00e9geles, PantallasAmigas, Foundation Alia2, the non-profit initiative Act\u00faa Contra el Ciberacoso, the National Communications Technology Institute (INTECO), the Agency of Internet quality, the Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Protecci\u00f3n de Datos, the Oficina de Seguridad del Internauta, the Spanish Internet users' Association, the Internauts' Association, and the Spanish Association of Mothers and Parents Internauts. The government of Castile and Le\u00f3n has also created a Plan de Prevenci\u00f3n del Ciberacoso y Promoci\u00f3n de la Navegaci\u00f3n Segura en Centro Escolares, and the government of the Canary Islands has created a portal on the phenomenon called Viveinternet.\n\n\n**** United States ****\nIn March 2007, the Advertising Council in the United States, in partnership with the National Crime Prevention Council, U.S. Department of Justice, and Crime Prevention Coalition of America, joined to announce the launch of a new public service advertising campaign designed to educate preteens and teens about how they can play a role in ending cyberbullying.\nAs of 2008, the Boy Scouts of America's 2008 edition of The Boy Scout Handbook addresses how to deal with online bullying. A new First Class rank requirements adds: \"Describe the three things you should avoid doing related to use of the Internet. Describe a cyberbully and how you should respond to one.\"In 2008, KTTV Fox 11 News in Los Angeles put out a report about organized cyberbullying on sites like Stickam by people who call themselves \"/b/rothas\". The site had put out a report on July 26, 2007, about a subject that partly featured cyberbullying, titled \"Hackers on Steroids\".On June 2, 2008, parents, teens, teachers, and Internet executives came together at Wired Safety's International Stop Cyberbullying Conference, a two-day gathering in White Plains, New York and New York City. Executives from Facebook, Verizon, MySpace, Microsoft, and many others talked with hundreds about how to better protect themselves and their personal reputations, children and businesses from online harassment. Sponsors of the conference included McAfee, AOL, Disney, Procter & Gamble, Girl Scouts of the USA, WiredTrust, Children's Safety Research and Innovation Centre, and KidZui.com. Cyberharassment versus cyberbullying was a forefront topic, where age makes a difference; abusive internet behavior by adults with the repeated clear intent to harm, ridicule or damage a person or business was classified as stalking harassment, versus bullying by teens and young adults.An organized movement to make revenge porn illegal began in August 2012: End Revenge Porn. Currently revenge porn is only illegal in two states, but the demand for its criminalization is on the rise as digital technology has increased in the past few generations. The organization seeks to provide support for victims, educate the public, and gain activist support to bring new legislation before the United States Government.In 2006, PACER.org created a week-long event that was held once a year in October. Today, the campaign is a month-long event and is now known as the National Bullying Prevention Awareness Month.\n\n\n**** Canada ****\nOriginating in Canada, Anti-Bullying Day is a day of celebration for those who choose to participate wearing a symbol of colors (pink, blue or purple) as a stance against bullying. A British Columbia teacher founded the Stop A Bully movement, which uses pink wristbands to represent the wearer's stance to stop bullying.\nPink Shirt Day was inspired by David Shepherd and Travis Price. Their high school friends organized a protest in sympathy for a Grade 9 boy who was bullied for wearing a pink shirt. Their stance from wearing pink has been a huge inspiration in the Great Vancouver Mainland. \"We know that victims of bullying, witnesses of bullying and bullies themselves all experience the very real and long term negative impacts of bullying regardless of its forms \u2013 physical, verbal, written, or on-line (cyberbullying)\".ERASE (Expect Respect and A Safe Education) is an initiative started by the province of British Columbia to foster safe schools and prevent bullying. It builds on already-effective programs set up by the provincial government to ensure consistent policies and practices regarding the prevention of bullying.\n\n\n*** Community support ***\nA number of organizations are in coalition to provide awareness, protection and recourse for this escalating problem. Some aim to inform and provide measures to avoid as well as effectively terminate cyberbullying and cyberharassment. Anti-bullying charity Act Against Bullying launched the CyberKind campaign in August 2009 to promote positive internet usage.\nIn 2007, YouTube introduced the first Anti-Bullying Channel for youth (BeatBullying), using the assistance of celebrities to tackle the problem.In March 2010, a 17-year-old girl named Alexis Skye Pilkington was found dead in her room by her parents. Her parents claimed that after repeated cyberbullying, she was driven to suicide. Shortly after her death, attacks resumed. Members of eBaums World began to troll teens' memorial pages on Facebook, with the comments including expressions of pleasure over the death, with pictures of what seemed to be a banana as their profile pictures. Family and friends of the deceased teen responded by creating Facebook groups denouncing cyberbullying and trolling, with logos of bananas behind a red circle with a diagonal line through it.In response and partnership to the 2011 film Bully, a grassroots effort to stop cyberbullying called the Bully Project was created. Their goal is to start \"a national movement to stop bullying that is transforming children's lives and changing a culture of bullying into one of empathy and action.\"\nAnswer this question: What is the role of the Advertising Council in the United States in addressing cyberbullying?",

      "context": "Cyberbullying\n\n==Introduction==\nCyberbullying or cyberharassment is a form of bullying or harassment using electronic means. Cyberbullying and cyberharassment are also known as online bullying. It has become increasingly common, especially among teenagers, as the digital sphere has expanded and technology has advanced. Cyberbullying is when someone, typically a teenager, bullies or harasses others on the internet and other digital spaces, particularly on social media sites. \n\n\n\n== Tactics ==\nHarmful bullying behavior can include posting rumors, threats, sexual remarks, a victims' personal information, or pejorative labels (i.e. hate speech). Bullying or harassment can be identified by repeated behavior and an intent to harm. Victims of cyberbullying may experience lower self-esteem, increased suicidal ideation, and various negative emotional responses, including being anxious, frustrated, angry, or depressed.\n\n== Overview ==\nCyberbullying is in many cases an extension of already existing traditional bullying. Students who are bullied via the Internet have, in most cases, also been bullied in other more traditional ways before (e.g., physically or verbally). There are few students who are bullied exclusively over the Internet; these cyber victims are often physically stronger students, which causes bullies to prefer online confrontations over face-to-face contact at school.Awareness in the United States has risen in the 2010s, due in part to high-profile cases. Several US states and other countries have passed laws to combat cyberbullying. Some are designed to specifically target teen cyberbullying, while others extend from the scope of physical harassment. In cases of adult cyberharassment, these reports are usually filed beginning with local police. The laws differ by area or state.\nResearch has demonstrated a number of serious consequences of cyberbullying victimisation. Specific statistics on the negative effects of cyberbullying differ by country and other demographics. Some researchers point out there could be some way to use modern computer techniques to determine and stopping cyberbullying.Other research has suggested an uptick in cyberbullying during the COVID-19 pandemic when many youth and adults were quarantined at home and, as a consequence, online more often than before the pandemic. For example, a study of adults published in the Journal of Social Psychology identified statistically significant increases in pro-cyberbullying attitudes as well as in cyberbullying offending behavior. However, another study involving over 6,500 Canadian youth in grades 4\u201312 did not find higher rates of cyberbullying involvement. The authors speculated that this might be a result of closer monitoring and involvement of online activities by parents while their children were at home.Internet trolling is a common form of bullying that takes place in an online community (such as online gaming or social media) in order to elicit a reaction or disruption, or simply just for someone's own personal amusement. Cyberstalking is another form of bullying or harassment that uses electronic communications to stalk a victim; this may pose a credible threat to the victim.Not all negative interaction online or on social media can be attributed to cyberbullying. Research suggests that there are also interactions online that result in peer pressure, which can have a negative, positive, or neutral impact on those involved.\n\n== Definitions ==\nA frequently used definition of cyberbullying is \"an aggressive, intentional act or behavior that is carried out by a group or an individual, using electronic forms of contact, repeatedly and over time against a victim who cannot easily defend him or herself.\" It is to be distinguished from normal conflicts between people of comparable power or status that often also occur online.There are many variations of the definition, such as the National Crime Prevention Council's more specific definition: \"the process of using the Internet, cell phones or other devices to send or post text or images intended to hurt or embarrass another person.\" Cyberbullying is often similar to traditional bullying, with some notable distinctions. Victims of cyberbullying may not know the identity of their bully, or why the bully is targeting them, based on the online nature of the interaction. The harassment can have wide-reaching effects on the victim, as the content used to harass the victim can be spread and shared easily among many people and often remains accessible long after the initial incident.The terms \"cyberharassment\" and \"cyberbullying\" are sometimes used synonymously, though some people use the latter to refer specifically to harassment among minors or in a school setting.\n\n\n*** Cyberstalking ***\n\nCyberstalking is a form of online harassment in which the perpetrator uses electronic communications to stalk a victim. This is considered more dangerous than other forms of cyberbullying because it generally involves a credible threat to the victim's safety. Cyberstalkers may send repeated messages intended to threaten or harass, and they may encourage others to do the same, either explicitly or by impersonating their victim and asking others to contact them.This can be a combination of most of the other methods in order to stalk someone using electronic means. This can include finding the victims location, harassing them with spam, or using sextortion. An example of this situation occurring is when Paris Deshaunte Evitt, a 30-year old from Tulsa cyberstalked one of his former partners. A news article on it states, \"Between October 2018 and continuing until October 2020, Evitt used email, Facebook, and text messages to control and threaten the victim. However, his abuse of the victim had started years before. Between 2012 and 2019, Evitt was convicted on 5 different occasions for physically abusing the victim including strangulation, assault, and interfering with reporting. Evitt was also on state supervision at the time of the current offenses.\"\"(The unidentified victim) explained that Evitt had destroyed her sense of security and became emotional when she discussed Evitt\u2019s statement that he would rather see her dead than happy. She also stated, 'the longer he is away from my children and I, the more time we have to try and heal and move on with our lives, if that is even possible.'\"\n\n\n*** Trolling ***\n\nInternet trolls intentionally try to provoke or offend others in order to elicit a reaction. Trolls and cyberbullies do not always have the same goals: while some trolls engage in cyberbullying, others may be engaged in comparatively harmless mischief. A troll may be disruptive either for their own amusement or because they are genuinely a combative person. Trolling can include insults, false news, or in this case, terrorist threats.\nAn example of this is when the Infamous Roblox troll, Ruben Sim (real name Benjamin Simon), has been banned from the popular game Roblox. This ban was court ordered, and Sim was ordered to pay Roblox $150,000 before the case was settled. \"The court\u2019s judgement 'permanently restrains the Defendant (Simon)' from 'Making, publishing, or re-publishing false threats of terrorist activity relating to Roblox; Knowingly making false statements of fact about Roblox; Glamorizing or encouraging violence against Roblox, its employees, or facilities;' and more...Simon is also barred from 'accessing the Roblox Platform other than those public portions of the Roblox website that do not require an account to access,' and must stay 100 feet away from any Roblox office or facility, as well.\"\n\n\n*** Hate raids ***\nOn Twitch and other livestreaming services, hate raids are situations where a stream is \"raided\" by multiple viewers simultaneously that flood the chat with harassing and hateful messages, preventing the streamer from executing their stream. These viewers are typically automated bots, making it difficult to moderate and block these viewers by the streamer and their moderators.\n\n\n*** Spam ***\nSpamming is the act of creating multiple accounts, and sending mass amounts of messages to a target-especially despite being blocked. A common situation where spam can occur is after a breakup. If one partner is obsessive, they may send their ex multiple messages through multiple means. This can include social media, email, and fake accounts. This is often despite being blocked. The article What Can Police Do About Harassing Texts? states, \"Keep in mind that harassment of any kind is illegal and includes in person, over the phone, via text messages, through social media, or any other method. Some laws are in place about cyberbullying that are designed to protect the public from this happening.\"\n\n\n*** Impersonation ***\n\nImpersonation is the act of pretending to either be the victim or another person. If the offender pretends to be the victim, they may say or do things to hurt the victim's reputation. This can include hacking into a Twitter account and posting harmful tweets. One famous example is when Sony Music's Twitter account was hacked and posted the following statement: \"Britney spears is dead by accident! we will tell you more soon. #RIPBRITNEY.\" Britney Spears was, in fact, alive and well.\n\n\n*** Doxing ***\nDoxing is the act of disclosing a victim's personal data, which can include their home address, phone number, real name, and other things that are private. Doxing can happen when fans in fandoms with large fanbases often go too far when protecting their idols and enter the realm of cyberbullying. Extreme fans of the music genre \"K-pop\" sometimes dox fans of rival music groups. This specifically was shown in an incident where fans of the group BlackPink doxed the owner of a Twice fan account, sending him to a hospital. This is allegedly because a member of the group Twice disrespected a member of the group BlackPink.\n\n\n*** Sexual harassment ***\nOnline sexual harassment, using means of cyberbullying, typically is committed by men targeting young females. Sextortion, a form of sexual harassment, is the act of coercing a person into sharing intimate images before threatening to release them unless money is paid. It is a specific type of blackmail. The line between sexual harassment and cyberbullying is blurred.Aldyn C (only identified by his first name due to Dutch privacy laws), a 38-year-old Dutchman, harassed 39 people in the context of sextortion. 34 were women and five were gay men. One victim, 15-year-old Amanda Todd was blackmailed by Aldyn to send pictures of her chest. She committed suicide after he published the pictures. Aldyn threatened he would send his victim's explicit pictures and videos to family and porn sites if they did not comply to his demands. Aldyn was arrested and sentenced to 11 years. He pleaded not guilty to 72 charges, many of which were sexual-related.\nOften, teenage boys will blackmail their girl classmates for nudes, threatening to release embarrassing information. They also use revenge porn and release nudes of girls to get payback. This was the case when a 16-year-old student of W.F. West High School in Chehalis exploited more than 100 victims, many of which were his classmates. He owned over 900 photos and videos of victims.\n\n== Methods used ==\nManuals intended to educate the public about cyberbullying summarize that cyberbullying is inclusive of acts of intended cruelty to others in the form of posting or sending material using an internet capable device. Research, legislation and education in the field are ongoing. Research has identified basic definitions and guidelines to help recognize and cope with what is regarded as abuse of electronic communications.\nCyberbullying involves repeated behavior with intent to harm.\nCyberbullying is perpetrated through harassment, cyberstalking, denigration (sending or posting cruel rumors and falsehoods to damage reputation and friendships), impersonation, and exclusion (intentionally and cruelly excluding someone from an online group)Cyberbullying can be as simple as continuing to send emails or text messages harassing someone who has said they want no further contact with the sender. It may also include public actions such as repeated threats, sexual remarks, pejorative labels (i.e. hate speech) or defamatory false accusations, ganging up on a victim by making the person the subject of ridicule in online forums, hacking into or vandalizing sites about a person, and posting false statements as fact aimed a discrediting or humiliating a targeted person. Cyberbullying could be limited to posting rumors about a person on the internet with the intention of bringing about hatred in others' minds or convincing others to dislike or participate in online denigration of a target. It may go to the extent of personally identifying victims of crime and publishing materials defaming or humiliating them.Cyberbullies may disclose victims' personal data (e.g. real name, home address, or workplace/schools) on websites or forums\u2014called doxing, or may use impersonation, creating fake accounts, comments or sites posing as their target for the purpose of publishing material in their name that defames, discredits or ridicules them. This can leave the cyberbully anonymous, which can make it difficult for them to be caught or punished for their behavior, although not all cyberbullies maintain their anonymity. Users of semi-anonymous chat websites are at high risk for cyberbullying, as it is also easy in this outlet for a cyberbully to remain anonymous. Text or instant messages and emails between friends can also constitute cyberbullying if what is said is hurtful.\n\nThe recent rise of smartphones and mobile apps have yielded a more accessible form of cyberbullying. It is expected that cyberbullying via these platforms will occur more often than through more stationary internet platforms because of constant access to the internet. In addition, the combination of cameras and Internet access and the instant availability of these modern smartphone technologies yield specific types of cyberbullying not found in other platforms. It is likely that those cyberbullied via mobile devices will experience a wider range of cyberbullying methods than those who are exclusively bullied elsewhere.Some teens argue that some events categorized as cyberbullying are simply drama. Danah Boyd writes, \"teens regularly used that word [drama] to describe various forms of interpersonal conflict that ranged from insignificant joking around to serious jealousy-driven relational aggression. Whereas adults might have labeled many of these practices as bullying, teens saw them as drama.\"\n\n\n*** In social media ***\nCyberbullying can take place on social media sites such as Facebook, Myspace, and Twitter. \"By 2008, 93% of young people between the ages of 12 and 17 were online. In fact, youth spend more time with media than any single other activity besides sleeping.\" The last decade has witnessed a surge of cyberbullying, which is categorized as bullying that occurs through the use of electronic communication technologies, such as e-mail, instant messaging, social media, online gaming, or through digital messages or images sent to a cellular phone.There are many risks attached to social media sites, and cyberbullying is one of the larger risks. One million children were harassed, threatened or subjected to other forms of cyberbullying on Facebook during the past year, while 90 percent of social-media-using teens who have witnessed online cruelty say they have ignored mean behavior on social media, and 35 percent have done so frequently. Ninety-five percent of social-media-using teens who have witnessed cruel behavior on social networking sites say they have seen others ignoring the mean behavior, and 55 percent have witnessed this frequently. Terms like \"Facebook depression\" have been coined specifically in regard to the result of extended social media use, with cyberbullying playing a large part in this.\n\nCyberbullying has become more common nowadays because of all the technology that children have access to. The most common apps that teenagers use to cyberbully are Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat. Cyberbullying has become harder to stop because parents and teachers are unaware of when and where it is happening. A 2006 study found that 45% of teens and 30% of adolescents were cyberbullied while at school. This was linked to the reason students had access to their online devices such as cell phones or computers. Teens will say awful things to one another online and what they do not realize is that once it is said and published online it will not go away. Home used to be a safe place for teens, but now a child is still within reach of becoming a victim of cyberbullying \u2013 whether it is through YouTube, Ask.fm, or a text message. Wherever you face, it is easy to come across Cyberbullying making it almost impossible to escape.\nAccording to a 2013 Pew Research study, eight out of ten teens who use social media now share more information about themselves than they have in the past. This includes their location, images, and contact information. In order to protect children, it is important that personal information such as age, birthday, school/church, phone number, etc. be kept confidential.Two studies from 2014 found that 80% of body-shaming tweets are sent by women, while they also accounted for 50% of misogynistic tweets.Cyberbullying can also take place through the use of websites belonging to certain groups to effectively request the targeting of another individual or group. An example of this is the bullying of climate scientists and activists.\n\n\n*** In gaming ***\n\nOf those who reported having experienced online harassment in a Pew Research poll, 16% said the most recent incident had occurred in an online game. A study from National Sun Yat-sen University observed that children who enjoyed violent video games were significantly more likely to both experience and perpetrate cyberbullying.Another study that discusses the direct correlation between exposure to violent video games and cyber bullying also took into account personal factors such as \"duration of playing online games, alcohol consumption in the last 3 months, parents drunk in the last 3 months, anger, hostility, ADHD, and a sense of belonging\" as potential contributing factors of cyberbullying.\nGaming was a more common venue for men in which to experience harassment, whereas women's harassment tended to occur more via social media. Most respondents considered gaming culture to be equally welcoming to both genders, though 44% thought it favored men. Sexual harassment in gaming generally involves slurs directed towards women, sex role stereotyping, and overaggressive language. Keza MacDonald writes in The Guardian that sexism exists in gaming culture, but is not mainstream within it. U.S. President Barack Obama made reference to the harassment of women gamers during his remarks in honor of Women's History Month.Competitive gaming scenes have been less welcoming of women than has broader gaming culture. In an internet-streamed fighting game competition, one female gamer forfeited a match after the coach of her team, Aris Bakhtanians, stated, \"The sexual harassment is part of the culture. If you remove that from the fighting game community, it's not the fighting game community.\" The comments were widely condemned by gamers, with comments in support of sexual harassment \"drowned out by a vocal majority of people expressing outrage, disappointment and sympathy.\" The incident built momentum for action to counter sexual harassment in gaming.Some game developers have been subjected to harassment and death threats by players upset by changes to a game or by a developer's online policies. Harassment also occurs in reaction to critics such as Jack Thompson or Anita Sarkeesian, whom some fans see as threats to the medium. Various people have been harassed in connection with the Gamergate controversy. Harassment related to gaming is not of a notably different severity or tenor compared to online harassment motivated by other subcultures or advocacy issues. Other developers have been harassed simply due to misogyny or anti-LGBTQ+ stances. A notable case was the death of \"Near\", the developer of Higan, a console emulator, who took their own life after becoming the subject to ridicule from members of the online Kiwi Farms board following their announcement of being nonbinary.Sabotage among rival crowdfunding campaigns is a recurring problem for projects related to gaming.Some instances of swatting in games such as Call of Duty and League of Legends have resulted in law enforcement SWAT units called on individuals' homes as a prank. On December 28, 2017, Wichita, Kansas, police officers killed Andrew Finch at his Kansas home in a reported swatting prank.\n\n\n*** In search engines ***\nInformation cascades happen when users start passing along information they assume to be true, but cannot know to be true, based on information on what other users are doing. This can be accelerated by search engines' ranking technologies and their tendency to return results relevant to a user's previous interests. This type of information spreading is hard to stop. Information cascades over social media and the Internet may also be harmless, and may contain truthful information.Bullies use Google bombs (a term applicable to any search engine) to increase the prominence of favored posts sorted by the most popular searches, done by linking to those posts from as many other web pages as possible. Examples include the campaign for the neologism \"santorum\" organized by the LGBT lobby. Google bombs can manipulate the Internet's search engines regardless of how authentic the pages are, but there is a way to counteract this type of manipulation as well.\n\n== Famous cyberbullying cases ==\nThere are many famous cases of cyberbullying online (eg. Daisy Coleman). \nAlthough most people may not realize it, some of these internet \"memes\" actually show cyberbullying in action.\n\n\n*** Greatest Freakout Ever videos ***\nAlthough it is not clear on whether the videos were faked or not, this YouTube series made a big impact on YouTube and the internet as a whole. The first and most famous video of the series aired on May 9, 2009. It shows 15-year-old Jack Quire (username \"wafflepwn\") secretly filming his older brother, Stephen, have a temper tantrum after their parents cancelled Stephen's World of Warcraft account. Stephen does many embarrassing things, including taking his shorts off and attempting to stick a TV remote up his butt. According to TV Tropes, \"Over the span of twelve years, the series is now over 40 videos long and has garnered over a total of 551 million views.\" Stephen is now known exclusively for his temper tantrums.\n\n\n*** Star Wars Kid ***\nUploaded in 2003, the star of the video, Ghyslain Raza (a 9th grader at the time) is shown messing around and waving around a golf ball retriever as if it is a real Jedi lightsaber. He was helping his friend parody the movie Star Wars. The video was uploaded to YouTube a few months later by Raza's classmates without his knowledge or permission. The video blew up and because one of the first viral internet memes. The video accumulated 900 million views.\nDespite trying to protect his privacy, Raza was mocked both online and in real life. He was body shamed, doxxed, and told to commit suicide, among other things. Students at school leaped onto tables to mock him, and his video was parodied on multiple shows including South Park. Raza had to move schools multiple times, and became homeschooled. He was harassed for years over a video he did not upload. Today, he is working on a documentary talking about his internet fame and the harassment that came along with it. He wants to focus on internet privacy and consent.\n\n== Ethical cyberbullying ==\nControversially, some internet users use cyberbullying for \"ethical\" means. Some reasons include justice for victims, activism, and persuading/scaring politicians. Committing moral actions for immoral causes is commonly seen in the realm of activism.\n\n\n*** Anonymous hacker group ***\nThe hacktivist group \"Anonymous\" uses cyberbullying tactics for activism. Its users are anonymous, even to each other. They have doxed numerous politicians and vandalized numerous governmental websites. Recently, they have doxed Supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, who was instrumental in overturning Roe v Wade (protecting rights to abortion). His Pornhub account has been posted on the database Doxbin.\nThe announcement posted on Anonymous' TikTok account (which is now banned) on April 11, 2023, stated as follows, \u201cThis is a message to the GOP from Anonymous. We gave you warnings. We gave you time to adjust your actions to meet the wants and needs of the people. In that time you have used the majorities you hold in states to expel members of Congress. You passed laws to inspect transgender children\u2019s genitalia. You have overstepped, and now we can share what we did with that time. Anonymous has a dark web database where information is posted to the world and the collective\u2026. We are going to call this dark web database \u2018the bin'...Remember, human rights and civil rights are not negotiable.\u201d\n\n\n*** Vigilantism ***\nYouTube account \"Scammer Payback\" creates videos hacking into scammers' web cameras and doxing scammers. He posts the videos to YouTube, exposing them, revealing their identities, and humiliating them. He uses some cyberbullying methods to get justice, such as doxing and trolling. His bio reads, \"Scammers are ruthless, and that is why I am here. My channel is all about bringing awareness to this critical problem with humor and fun. We will learn a lot of things along the way and if I help one person through this, it will be worth it.\"\n\n\n*** Predator catchers ***\nSome internet users pose as children online in order to catch online predators, child sex trafficking rings and pedophiles. One such user is Roo Powell, who poses as a 15-year-old girl online in order to catch sex offenders targeting children. She is the star of the show \"Undercover Underage,\" which documents her experiences exposing pedophiles and working with law enforcement. She is the founder of the nonprofit organization SOSA (Safe from Online Sex Abuse). Powell educates children on the dangers of online predators and talks to them about how to practice online safety.\n\n== Law enforcement ==\nA majority of states have laws that explicitly include electronic forms of communication within stalking or harassment laws. Most law enforcement agencies have cyber-crime units, and Internet stalking is often treated with more seriousness than reports of physical stalking. Help and resources can be searched by state or area.\n\n\n*** Schools ***\nThe safety of online privacy issues in schools is increasingly becoming a focus of state legislative action. There was an increase in cyberbullying enacted legislation between 2006 and 2010. Initiatives and curriculum requirements also exist in the UK (the Ofsted eSafety guidance) and Australia (Overarching Learning Outcome 13).\nIn 2012, a group of teenagers in a design class New Haven, Connecticut, developed an application to help fight bullying, \"Back Off Bully\" (BOB). This is an anonymous resource for computer, smart phone or iPad, designed so when someone witnesses or is the victim of bullying, they can immediately report the incident. The app asks questions about time, location and how the bullying is happening, as well as provides positive action and empowerment regarding the incident. The reported information goes to a database, where it may be studied by administrators. Common threads are spotted so others can intervene and break the bully's pattern. \"Back Off Bully\" is being considered as standard operating procedure at schools across Connecticut, while recent studies carried out among 66 high school teachers have concluded that prevention programs have proved ineffective to date.Teachers can also be cyberbullied by pupils, as well as by parents and other school staff.\n\n\n*** Protection ***\nThere are laws that only address online harassment of children or focus on child predators, as well as laws that protect adult cyberstalking victims, or victims of any age. Currently, there are 45 cyberstalking (and related) laws on the books. While some sites specialize in laws that protect victims age 18 and under, Working to Halt Online Abuse is a help resource containing a list of current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws. It also lists those states that do not yet have laws, and related laws from other countries. The Global Cyber Law Database (GCLD) aims to become the most comprehensive and authoritative source of cyber laws for all countries.Several states, including Florida, California, and Missouri have passed laws against cyberbullying. California prohibits the use of an electronic device to cause someone to fear for their life. In Florida, the \"Jeffrey Johnson Stand Up for All Students Act\" prohibits any type of bullying including cyberbullying. In Missouri, anyone who violently threatens someone over social media can be convicted with a Class A misdemeanor, but if the victim is seventeen years or younger, they can be convicted with a Class D felony.\n\n\n*** Age ***\nChildren report negative online behaviors occurring from the second grade. According to research, boys initiate negative online activity earlier than girls. However, by middle school, girls are more likely to engage in cyberbullying than boys. Whether the bully is male or female, the purpose of childhood bullying is to intentionally embarrass, harass, intimidate, or make threats online.\nStudies on the psycho-social effects of cyberspace have begun to monitor the effects cyberbullying may have on the victims. Consequences of cyberbullying are multi-faceted, and affect both online and offline behavior. Research on adolescents reported that changes in the victims' behavior as a result of cyberbullying could potentially be positive. Victims \"created a cognitive pattern of bullies, which consequently helped them to recognize aggressive people.\"However, the Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace abstract reports critical impacts in almost all of the respondents, taking the form of lower self-esteem, loneliness, disillusionment, and distrust of people. The more extreme effects included self-harm. Children have killed each other and committed suicide after cyberbullying incidents. Some cases of digital self-harm have been reported in which an individual engages in cyberbullying against themselves, or purposefully and knowingly exposes themselves to cyberbullying.\n\n\n*** Adults ***\nCyberstalking may be an extension of physical stalking and may have criminal consequences. A target's understanding of why cyberstalking is happening is helpful to remedy and take protective action. Among factors that motivate stalkers are envy, pathological obsession (professional or sexual), unemployment or failure with own job or life, or the desire to intimidate and cause others to feel inferior. The stalker may be delusional and believe they \"know\" the target. The stalker wants to instill fear in a person to justify their status, or may  believe they can get away with these actions due to online anonymity.The US federal cyberstalking law is designed to prosecute people for using electronic means to repeatedly harass or threaten someone online. There are resources dedicated to helping adult victims deal with cyberbullies legally and effectively. One of the steps recommended is to record everything and contact police. In Mexico, Olimpia Coral Melo,  promoted the creation of a law against digital harassment that took her name, the Olimpia Law.\n\n== Research ==\n\n\n*** Australia ***\nThe nationwide Australian Covert Bullying Prevalence Survey (Cross et al., 2009) assessed cyberbullying experiences among 7,418 students. The results indicated that rates of cyberbullying increased with age, with 4.9% of students in Year 4 reporting cyberbullying compared to 7.9% in year nine. Cross et al., (2009) reported that rates of bullying and harassing others were lower, but also increased with age. Only 1.2% of Year 4 students reported cyberbullying others compared to 5.6% of Year 9 students.\n\n\n*** China ***\nIn mainland China, cyberbullying has yet to receive adequate scholarly attention. A study investigating the risk factors of cyberbullying sampled 1,438 high school students from central China. Data  showed that 34.84% had participated in bullying and 56.88% had been bullied online.A study on cyberbullying in Hong Kong chose 48 out of 7,654 students from elementary school to high school who were classified as potential aggressors related to cyberbullying. 31 out of 48 students declared they barely participated in cyber-attacks. It is common among high school students (28 out of 36 students) to participate in social media platforms; 58% admitted to changing a nickname for others, 56.3% to humiliation, 54.2% to making fun of someone, and 54.2% to spreading rumors. The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups interviewed 1,820 teenagers, 17.5% of whom indicated having experienced cyberbullying. This included insults, abuse, and the publishing of personal private pictures on social media without permission.\n\n\n*** European Union ***\nIn a study published in 2011, across 25 EU member states studied, an average 6% of children (9\u201316 years old) had been bullied and only 3% of them confessed to having been a bully. However, in an earlier publication by Hasenbrink et al. (2009), reporting on the results from a meta analysis from European Union countries, the authors estimated (via median results) that approximately 18% of European young people had been \"bullied/harassed/stalked\" via the internet and mobile phones. Cyberharassment rates for young people across the EU member states ranged from 10% to 52%. \n\n\n*** Finland ***\nSourander et al. (2010) conducted a population-based cross-sectional study that took place in Finland. The authors of this study took the self-reports of 2,215 Finish adolescents between the ages of 13 and 16 about cyberbullying and cybervictimization during the previous six months. It was found that, amongst the total sample, 4.8% were victims only, 7.4% were cyberbullies only, and 5.4% were cyberbully-victims.\nThe authors of this study were able to conclude that cyberbullying, as well as cybervictimization, is associated not only with psychiatric issues, but with psychosomatic issues as well. Many adolescents in the study reported headaches or difficulty sleeping. The authors believe that their results indicate a greater need for new ideas on how to prevent cyberbullying and what to do when it occurs. It is clearly a worldwide problem that needs to be taken seriously.\n\n\n*** Ireland ***\nThe Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) pilot survey was carried out in eight post-primary schools across Ireland, including 318 students aged 15\u201318. 59% were boys and 41% were girls. Participation in this survey was voluntary for students, and consent had to be obtained from parents, students and the school itself. This survey was anonymous and confidential, and it took 40 minutes to complete. It asked questions on traditional forms of bullying, as well as cyberbullying, risk behaviors and self-reported health and life satisfaction.\n66% of the students said that they had never been bullied, 14% had been victims of traditional forms of bullying, 10% had been victims of cyberbullying, and the remaining 10% had been victims of both traditional forms of bullying and cyberbullying. Boys mostly said they were victims of traditional forms of bullying, and girls mostly were victims of both traditional forms of bullying and cyberbullying. 20% of the students in this survey said that they had been cyberbullied, showing that cyberbullying is on the rise.Arrow DIT claims that 23% of 9\u201316 year olds in Ireland have been bullied online or offline, compared to 19% in Europe. Although online bullying in Ireland stands at 4% according to Arrow DIT, this is lower than the European average, which stands at 6%, and half that of the UK where 8% reported being cyberbullied. Traditional forms of bullying in Ireland occur more often than in Europe.\nA 2018 study by Dublin City University (DCU)'s National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre (ABC) found that almost 10% of post-primary teachers were victims of cyberbullying, and 15% knew of a colleague who had experienced it in the previous 12 months. 59% of the bullying was by pupils, mainly on social media, with the rest perpetrated by parents and other school staff. Various effects on bullied teachers included increased stress and anxiety, \"negative impacts on their working environment, and a reluctance to report the issue and seek help from management\".\n\n\n*** Japan ***\nAccording to recent research, in Japan, 17 percent (compared with a 25-country average of 37 percent) of youth between the ages of 8 and 17 have been victims of online bullying. The number shows that online bullying is a serious concern in Japan. Teenagers who spend more than 10 hours a week on the Internet are more likely to become the targets of online bullying, though only 28 percent of the survey participants understood what cyberbullying is. However, they do know the severity of the issue; 63 percent of the surveyed students worried about being targeted as victims of cyberbullying.Since teenagers find themselves congregating socially on the internet via social media, they become easy targets for cyberbullying. Cyberbullying may occur via email, text, chat rooms, and social media websites. Some cyberbullies set up websites or blogs to post the target's images, publicize their personal information, gossip about the target, express why they hate the target, request people to agree with the bully's view, and send links to the target to make sure they are watching the activity.Much cyberbullying is an act of relational aggression, which involves alienating the victim from peers through gossip or ostracism. This kind of attack can be easily launched via texting or other online activities. One 19-year-old Japanese student was targeted by classmates who posted his photo online, insulted him constantly, and asked him to die. Because of the constant harassment, he did attempt suicide twice. Even when he quit school, the attacks did not stop.Cyberbullying can cause serious psychological impact to the victims. They often feel anxious, nervous, tired, and depressed. Other examples of negative psychological trauma include losing confidence as a result of being socially isolated from their schoolmates or friends. Psychological problems can also show up in the form of headaches, skin problems, abdominal pain, sleep problems, bed-wetting, and crying. It may also lead victims to commit suicide to end the bullying.\n\n\n*** United States ***\n\n\n**** 2000 ****\nA 2000 survey by the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire found that 6% of the young people who completed the survey had experienced some form of harassment, including threats and negative rumors, and 2% had suffered distressing harassment.\n\n\n**** 2004 ****\nThe 2004 I-Safe.org survey of 1,500 students between grades 4 and 8 found:\n42% of children had been bullied online. One in four had experienced it more than once.\n35% had been threatened online. Nearly one in five had experienced it more than once.\n21% had received mean or threatening e-mails or other messages.\n58% admitted that someone had said hurtful things to them online. More than four out of ten said this had happened more than once.\n58% had not told their parents or an adult about something hurtful that had happened to them online.\n\n\n**** 2005 ****\nThe Youth Internet Safety Survey-2, conducted by the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire in 2005, found that 9% of the young people in the survey had experienced some form of harassment. The survey was a nationally representative telephone survey of 1,500 youth 10\u201317 years old. One-third reported feeling distressed by the incident, with distress being more likely for younger respondents and those who were the victims of aggressive harassment (including being telephoned, sent gifts, or visited at home by the harasser). Compared to youth not harassed online, victims are more likely to have social problems. On the other hand, youth who harass others are more likely to have problems with rule breaking and aggression.Hinduja and Patchin completed a study in the summer of 2005 of approximately 1,500 Internet-using adolescents and found that over one-third of youth reported being victimized online, and over 16% of respondents admitted to cyberbullying others. While most of the instances of cyberbullying involved relatively minor behavior (41% were disrespected, 19% were called names), over 12% were physically threatened and about 5% were scared for their safety. Notably, fewer than 15% of victims told an adult about the incident. Additional research by Hinduja and Patchin in 2007 found that youth who report being victims of cyberbullying also experience stress or strain that is related to offline problem behaviors such as running away from home, cheating on a test, skipping school, or using alcohol or marijuana. The authors acknowledge that both of these studies provide only preliminary information about the nature and consequences of online bullying, due to the methodological challenges associated with an online survey.\nAccording to a 2005 survey by the National Children's Home charity and Tesco Mobile, of 770 youth between the ages of 11 and 19, 20% of respondents revealed that they had been bullied via electronic means. Almost three-quarters (73%) stated that they knew the bully, while 26% stated that the offender was a stranger. 10% of responders indicated that another person had taken a picture and/or video of them via a cellular phone camera, consequently making them feel uncomfortable, embarrassed, or threatened. Many youths are not comfortable telling an authority figure about their cyberbullying victimization for fear their access to technology will be taken from them; while 24% and 14% told a parent or teacher respectively, 28% did not tell anyone, and 41% told a friend.\n\n\n**** 2006 ****\nAccording to the 2006 Harris Interactive Cyberbullying Research Report, commissioned by the National Crime Prevention Council, cyberbullying is a problem that \"affects almost half of all American teens\".\n\n\n**** 2007 ****\n\nStudies published in 2007 in the Journal of Adolescent Health indicated young people reporting being victims of electronic aggression in a range of 9% to 35%.In 2007, Debbie Heimowitz, a Stanford University master's student, created Adina's Deck, a film based on Stanford-accredited research. She worked in focus groups for ten weeks in three schools to learn about the problem of cyberbullying in northern California. The findings determined that over 60% of students had been cyberbullied and were victims of cyberbullying. The film is now being used in classrooms nationwide as it was designed around learning goals pertaining to problems that students had understanding the topic. The middle school of Megan Meier is reportedly using the film as a solution to the crisis in their town.\n\n\n**** 2008 ****\nIn 2008, researchers Sameer Hinduja (Florida Atlantic University) and Justin Patchin (University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire) published a book on cyberbullying that summarized the current state of cyberbullying research (Bullying Beyond the Schoolyard: Preventing and Responding to Cyberbullying). Their research documented that cyberbullying instances had been increasing over the preceding several years. They also reported findings from a then-recent study of cyberbullying. In a random sample of approximately 2000 middle-school students from a large school district in the southern United States, about 10% of respondents reported being cyberbullied in the previous 30 days while over 17% reported having been cyberbullied at least once in their lifetime. While these rates are slightly lower than some of the findings from their previous research, Hinduja and Patchin pointed out that the earlier studies were predominantly conducted among older adolescents and Internet samples; that is, older youth use the Internet more frequently and are more likely to experience cyberbullying than younger children.\n\n\n**** 2011 ****\n\nAccording to the 2011 National Crime Victimization Survey, conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, School Crime Supplement (SCS), 9% of students age 12\u201318 admitted to having experienced cyberbullying during that school year (with a coefficient of variation between 30% and 50%).\n\n\n**** 2013 ****\nIn the Youth Risk Behavior Survey 2013, the Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published results of its survey as part of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) in June 2014, indicating the percentage of school children being bullied through e-mail, chat rooms, instant messaging, websites, or texting (\"electronically bullied\") during the course of 2013.\n\n\n**** 2014 ****\nIn 2014, Mehari, Farrell, and Le published a study that focused on the literature on cyberbullying among adolescents. They found that researchers have generally assumed that cyberbullying is distinct from aggression perpetrated in person. Mehari et al. suggest that the media through which aggression is perpetrated may be best conceptualized as a new classification of aggression, rather than considering cyberbullying as a distinct counterpart to existing forms of aggression. They suggest that future research on cyberbullying be considered within the context of theoretical and empirical knowledge of aggression in adolescence.Mary Howlett-Brandon's doctoral dissertation analyzed the National Crime Victimization Survey: Student Crime Supplement, 2009, to focus on the cyberbullying victimization of Black and White students in specific conditions.\n\n\n**** 2015 ****\nWalletHub's 2015's Best & Worst States at Controlling Bullying report measured the relative levels of bullying in 42 states. According to the report, North Dakota, Illinois, Louisiana, Rhode Island, and Washington, D.C., have the most attempted suicides by high school students. The five states with highest percentage of students being bullied on campus are Missouri, Michigan, Idaho, North Dakota, and Montana.Cyberbullying on social media has usually been student-to-student, but recently, students have been cyberbullying their teachers. High school students in Colorado created a Twitter site that bullies teachers. This ranges from obscenities to false accusations of inappropriate actions with students.\n\n\n*** Gender ***\nResearch conducted to try to determine differences in cyberbullying patterns comparing male to female and ages of each are relatively inconclusive. There are some factors that lean towards males being more involved in cyberbullying behaviors due to males tending to have more aggressive behaviors than females. This is not proven, but speculated based on literature reviews of research indicating that significant data is self-reported. Comparatively, the review of articles indicates that age differences have some indicators of cyberbullying; increasing age indicates increasing bullying behaviors. Gender differences have mixed results, but one finding indicated that younger females (10 or 11) and older males (13+) tend to engage in cyber bullying behaviors.Cyberbullies mostly have at least one common trait. Cyberbullies generally get angry and discouraged easily and usually have strong personalities. They connect with others belligerently and do not care for the feelings of their victims. Both males and females engage in cyberbullying. Females are involved in cyberbullying just as much as males, and females are sometimes even found more involved in cyberbullying than males are. The reason behind this is because of the way they respond; men will usually respond with physical retaliation, while women will use \"indirect forms such as gossiping.\" As cyberbullying is a more indirect form, women are more likely to be involved.Also, women tend to have less face-to-face confrontations than men, and since cyberbullying occurs online, this allows women to have a greater chance to be attacked. According to a 2017 Pew Research study on online harassment, 14% of Americans have been harassed because of their political views. Such harassment affects men and women differently; men are approximately twice as likely as women to have experienced online harassment because of their political views. However, women politicians are disproportionately more likely to be sexually harassed online. Women lawmakers are three times more likely than their male counterparts to receive sexually abusive comments, including threats of rape, beatings, death, or abduction.\n\n== Legislation ==\n\n\n*** Jurisdictions ***\n\n\n**** United States ****\nLegislation geared at penalizing cyberbullying has been introduced in a number of U.S. states including New York, Missouri, Rhode Island and Maryland. At least 45 states have passed laws against digital harassment. Dardenne Prairie of Springfield, Missouri, passed a city ordinance making online harassment a misdemeanor. The city of St. Charles, Missouri passed a similar ordinance. Missouri is among the states where lawmakers are pursuing state legislation, with task forces expected to have cyberbullying laws drafted and implemented. In June 2008, Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.) and Rep. Kenny Hulshof (R-Mo.) proposed a federal law that would criminalize acts of cyberbullying.Lawmakers are seeking to address cyberbullying with new legislation because there is currently no specific law on the books that deals with it. A fairly new federal cyberstalking law might address such acts, according to Parry Aftab, but no one has been prosecuted under it yet. The proposed federal law would make it illegal to use electronic means to \"coerce, intimidate, harass or cause other substantial emotional distress.\"\nIn August 2008, the California state legislature passed one of the first laws in the country to deal directly with cyberbullying. Assembly Bill 86 2008 gives school administrators the authority to discipline students for bullying, offline or online. This law took effect on January 1, 2009.A law in New York's Albany County that criminalized cyberbullying was struck down as unconstitutional by the New York Court of Appeals in People v. Marquan M.\nA recent ruling first seen in the UK determined that it is possible for an Internet service provider (ISP) to be liable for the content of the sites it hosts, setting a precedent that any ISP should treat a notice of complaint seriously and investigate it immediately.18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875(c) criminalizes the making of threats via the Internet.\nWhile some states have laws that require schools to mediate cyberbullying conflicts, several states have been sued on First Amendment grounds for doing so. By examining the decisions of three such lawsuits heard in lower courts, Alvin J. Primack and Kevin A. Johnson argued that current First Amendment doctrine, particularly the case of Morse v. Frederick (2007), may offer interpretive resources for justifying administrative reach to some online digital speech. They concluded, \"[w]ithout clearer standards, school administrators are likely to feel constrained and err on the side of inaction.\"\n\n\n**** United Kingdom ****\nIn early February 2022, ministers of the UK parliament planned to add to their proposed Online Safety Bill several criminal offences against those who send death threats online or deliberately share dangerous disinformation about fake Covid cures. Other new offences, such as revenge porn, posts advertising people-smuggling, and messages encouraging people to commit suicide, would fall under the responsibilities of online platforms like Facebook and Twitter to tackle.\n\n\n**** Philippines ****\n\nThe Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 defines cyberlibel as a punishable offence under Section 355 of the Revised Penal Code of 1930.\n\n\n**** European Union ****\nSince the 1990s, the United Kingdom and other European countries have been working to solve workplace bullying since there is no legislation regulating cyberbullying. The pervasive nature of technology has made the act of bullying online much easier. A 24-hour internet connection gives bullies a neverending opportunity to find and bully victims. Employers in the European Union have more legal responsibility to their employees than do those in other countries. Since employers do not have the ability to fire or hire an employee at will like in the United States, employers in Europe are held to a high standard in how their employees are treated.\nIn 2007, the European Union developed the Framework Agreement on Harassment and Violence at Work, a law that prevents bullying occurring in the workplace and holds employers accountable for providing fair working conditions. The law defines the responsibilities of an employer such as protecting their employees from bullies in a work environment and the psychological pain a victim faces from bullies during business hours. Lawyers pursuing cyberbullying cases use the Ordinance on Victimization at Work law, since there are not any laws specifically condemning cyberbullying.In 1993, Sweden was the first European Union country to have a law against cyberbullying. The Ordinance on Victimization at Work protected victims from \"recurrent reprehensible or distinctly negative actions which are directed which are directed against individual employees in an offensive manner and can result in those employees being placed outside the workplace community\".In 2002, France passed the Social Modernization Law, which added consequences to the French Labor Code for cyberbullying such as holding employers accountable for their involvement in harassment. The legislation defines \"moral harassment\" as \"repeated acts leading to a deterioration of the working conditions and that are likely to harm the dignity, the physical or psychological heath of the victim or his professional career.\"The United Kingdom does not have anti-bullying legislation. However, it does have the Protection From Harassment Act, an anti-stalking law. U.K. courts have used this legislation in bullying cases.\n\nThe United States and some other countries have more extensive legislation on cyberbullying than the European Union. Cyberbullying incidents on social media are widespread and have increased drastically in number. However, the process of getting a claim against a bully is not an easy one because of the victim's need to provide sufficient evidence to prove the existence of bullying.\nAs of mid-2015, countries in the European Union like the United Kingdom are in the process of creating laws specially related to cyberbullying. Since the process takes time, the government is supporting school programs to promote internet safety with the help of teachers and parents. This will allow the government to take the time it needs to create the cyberbullying laws while helping safeguard students from cyberbullying as much as possible.\n\n\n*** Research on preventive legislation ***\nResearchers suggest that programs be put in place for prevention of cyberbullying. These programs would be incorporated into school curricula and would include online safety and instruction on how to use the Internet properly. This could teach the victim proper methods of potentially avoiding the cyberbully, such as blocking messages or increasing the security of their computer.Even in a perfect world, no crime can be stopped fully. That is why it is suggested that within this prevention method, effective coping strategies should be introduced and adopted. People can adopt coping strategies to combat future cyberbullying. Coping strategies may include social support groups composed of victims of cyberbullying, which could allow students to share their stories, and remove the feeling of being alone.\nTeachers should be involved in all prevention educational models, as they are essentially the \"police\" of the classroom. Most cyberbullying often goes unreported as the victim feels nothing can be done to help in their current situation. However, if given the proper tools with preventive measures and more power in the classroom, teachers can be of assistance; if the parent, teacher, and victim can work together, solutions may be found.There have been many legislative attempts to facilitate the control of bullying and cyberbullying. Some existing legislation is incorrectly thought to be tied to bullying and cyberbullying (including terms such as \"libel\" and \"slander\"). The problem is that the existing legislation does not directly apply to bullying, nor define it as its own criminal behavior. Anti-cyberbullying advocates have even expressed concern about the broad scope of some of the bills attempted to be passed.In the United States, attempts have been made to pass legislation against cyberbullying. Few states attempted to pass broad sanctions in an effort to prohibit cyberbullying. Problems include how to define cyberbullying and cyberstalking, and, if charges are pressed, whether this violates the bully's freedom of speech. B. Walther said that \"Illinois is the only state to criminalize 'electronic communication(s) sent for the purpose of harassing another person' when the activity takes place outside a public school setting.\" This was criticized for infringement on freedom of speech.Preventing a child from being cyberbullied is hard, but now they are working to form programs and laws to help stop the issue from getting worse than it already is. They have created movies such as Cyberbully by Charles Biname and The Duff by Ari Sandel for teenagers to watch and see how cyberbullying can affect an individual. Children that are victims of this problem feel they can not go to an adult for help because they may feel embarrassed by the situation. Bullying online will not only hurt the teenager emotionally, but there is also a risk of the child hurting themselves physically as well; in 2017, suicide was the tenth leading cause of death among persons in the United States.Being able to tell if a child is being hurt from this issue can be tough, but there are certain things that a child will do that should give a red flag that they are being bullied. A cyberbully could have said nasty words to that child and the victim could be looking for compliments. If the victim is always online wondering when the bully will strike next that could also be a sign. Being an active parent in their children's lives will make a difference on whether their child is experiencing online bullying or not. Also bringing police involved in the case will be a problem solver too.\n\n== Harmful effects ==\nResearch has demonstrated a number of serious consequences of cyberbullying victimization. Victims may have lower self-esteem, increased suicidal ideation, and a variety of emotional responses, including being scared, frustrated, angry, and depressed. Cyberbullying may be more harmful than traditional bullying, because there is no escaping it. One of the most damaging effects is that a victim begins to avoid friends and activities, which is often the very intention of the bully.\nCyberbullying campaigns are sometimes so damaging that victims have committed suicide. There are at least four examples in the United States in which cyberbullying has been linked to the suicide of a teenager. The suicide of Megan Meier is an example that led to the conviction of the adult perpetrator of the attacks. Holly Grogan committed suicide by jumping off a 30-foot bridge near Gloucester in the UK. It was reported that a number of her schoolmates had posted a number of hateful messages on her Facebook page.According to Lucie Russell, director of campaigns, policy and participation at youth mental health charity Young Minds, young people who suffer from mental disorders are vulnerable to cyberbullying as they are sometimes unable to shrug it off:\n\nWhen someone says nasty things healthy people can filter that out, they're able to put a block between that and their self-esteem. But mentally unwell people don't have the strength and the self-esteem to do that, to separate it, and so it gets compiled with everything else. To them, it becomes the absolute truth \u2013 there's no filter, there's no block. That person will take that on, take it as fact.\nSocial media has allowed bullies to disconnect from the impact they may be having on others.\n\n\n*** Intimidation, emotional damage, and suicide ***\nAccording to the Cyberbullying Research Center, \"there have been several high\u2010profile cases involving teenagers taking their own lives in part because of being harassed and mistreated over the Internet, a phenomenon we have termed cyberbullicide \u2013 suicide indirectly or directly influenced by experiences with online aggression.\"\nCyberbullying is an intense form of psychological abuse, whose victims are more than twice as likely to suffer from mental disorders compared to traditional bullying.The reluctance youth have in telling an authority figure about instances of cyberbullying has led to fatal outcomes. At least three children between the ages of 12 and 13 have committed suicide due to depression brought on by cyberbullying, according to reports by USA Today and the Baltimore Examiner. These include the suicide of Ryan Halligan and the suicide of Megan Meier, the latter of which resulted in United States v. Lori Drew. Teen suicides tied to cyberbullying have recently become more prevalent. Rebecca Ann Sedwick committed suicide after being terrorized through mobile applications such as Ask.fm, Kik Messenger and Voxer.\n\n\n*** On youth and teenagers ***\nThe effects of cyberbullying vary, but research illustrates that cyberbullying adversely affects youth to a higher degree than adolescents and adults. Youth are more likely to suffer since they are still growing mentally and physically. Jennifer N. Caudle, a certified family physician, says, \"Kids that are bullied are likely to experience anxiety, depression, loneliness, unhappiness and poor sleep\".\n\nMost of the time cyberbullying goes unnoticed; the younger generation hides their bullying from anyone that can help to prevent the bullying from occurring and from getting worse. Between 20% and 40% of adolescents are victims of cyberbullying worldwide. The youth slowly change their behaviors and actions so they become more withdrawn and quiet, but this may go unnoticed since the change is subtle. Metin Deniz believes cyberbullying will \"become a serious problem in the future with an increase in the Internet and mobile phone usage among young people\".If preventive actions are not taken against cyberbullying, younger children in addition to teenagers will feel more lonely and depressed along with having significant changes in their eating and sleeping patterns as well as loss of interest in their normal activities. These changes will affect their growth and development into adulthood. Younger children and teenagers are 76.2% less likely to display suicidal behaviors and thoughts, but are still at risk depending on other factors such as mental health status, home care, and relationships with others. The risk of suicide increases by 35% to 45% when victims do not have any support from anyone in their life, and cyberbullying amplifies the situation.Young people seem particularly vulnerable to the effects of cyberbullying through anonymous social media, perhaps because adolescents are attracted to these platforms as a means of seeking validation from their peers. Abuse on these platforms, such as ASKfm, Yik Yak and Sarahah, can be particularly keenly felt by young people, leading to issues of loss of confidence. There have been a number of suicides related to bullying on these platforms in the US and Britain.\n\n\n*** Suppression of speech ***\nBy at least 2018, some doctors have been targets of online harassment from anti-vaccine activists responding to their social media posts, including hundreds of negative false reviews on doctor ratings sites. This made some of the doctors more reluctant to share information about vaccines, but others formed groups to spread factual information about vaccine safety on social media in response.\n\n== Awareness ==\n\n\n*** Campaigns ***\n\n\n**** International ****\nThe Cybersmile Foundation is a cyberbullying charity committed to tackling all forms of online bullying, abuse, and hate campaigns. It was founded in 2010 in response to the increasing number of cyberbullying related incidents of depression, eating disorders, social isolation, self-harm and suicides devastating lives around the world. Cybersmile provides support to victims and their friends and families through social media interaction, email and helpline support. They also run an annual event, Stop Cyberbullying Day, to draw attention to the issue.\n\n\n**** Spain ****\nMultiple non-profit organizations fight cyberbullying and cyberstalking. They advise victims, provide awareness campaigns, and report offenses to the police. These NGOs include the Prot\u00e9geles, PantallasAmigas, Foundation Alia2, the non-profit initiative Act\u00faa Contra el Ciberacoso, the National Communications Technology Institute (INTECO), the Agency of Internet quality, the Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Protecci\u00f3n de Datos, the Oficina de Seguridad del Internauta, the Spanish Internet users' Association, the Internauts' Association, and the Spanish Association of Mothers and Parents Internauts. The government of Castile and Le\u00f3n has also created a Plan de Prevenci\u00f3n del Ciberacoso y Promoci\u00f3n de la Navegaci\u00f3n Segura en Centro Escolares, and the government of the Canary Islands has created a portal on the phenomenon called Viveinternet.\n\n\n**** United States ****\nIn March 2007, the Advertising Council in the United States, in partnership with the National Crime Prevention Council, U.S. Department of Justice, and Crime Prevention Coalition of America, joined to announce the launch of a new public service advertising campaign designed to educate preteens and teens about how they can play a role in ending cyberbullying.\nAs of 2008, the Boy Scouts of America's 2008 edition of The Boy Scout Handbook addresses how to deal with online bullying. A new First Class rank requirements adds: \"Describe the three things you should avoid doing related to use of the Internet. Describe a cyberbully and how you should respond to one.\"In 2008, KTTV Fox 11 News in Los Angeles put out a report about organized cyberbullying on sites like Stickam by people who call themselves \"/b/rothas\". The site had put out a report on July 26, 2007, about a subject that partly featured cyberbullying, titled \"Hackers on Steroids\".On June 2, 2008, parents, teens, teachers, and Internet executives came together at Wired Safety's International Stop Cyberbullying Conference, a two-day gathering in White Plains, New York and New York City. Executives from Facebook, Verizon, MySpace, Microsoft, and many others talked with hundreds about how to better protect themselves and their personal reputations, children and businesses from online harassment. Sponsors of the conference included McAfee, AOL, Disney, Procter & Gamble, Girl Scouts of the USA, WiredTrust, Children's Safety Research and Innovation Centre, and KidZui.com. Cyberharassment versus cyberbullying was a forefront topic, where age makes a difference; abusive internet behavior by adults with the repeated clear intent to harm, ridicule or damage a person or business was classified as stalking harassment, versus bullying by teens and young adults.An organized movement to make revenge porn illegal began in August 2012: End Revenge Porn. Currently revenge porn is only illegal in two states, but the demand for its criminalization is on the rise as digital technology has increased in the past few generations. The organization seeks to provide support for victims, educate the public, and gain activist support to bring new legislation before the United States Government.In 2006, PACER.org created a week-long event that was held once a year in October. Today, the campaign is a month-long event and is now known as the National Bullying Prevention Awareness Month.\n\n\n**** Canada ****\nOriginating in Canada, Anti-Bullying Day is a day of celebration for those who choose to participate wearing a symbol of colors (pink, blue or purple) as a stance against bullying. A British Columbia teacher founded the Stop A Bully movement, which uses pink wristbands to represent the wearer's stance to stop bullying.\nPink Shirt Day was inspired by David Shepherd and Travis Price. Their high school friends organized a protest in sympathy for a Grade 9 boy who was bullied for wearing a pink shirt. Their stance from wearing pink has been a huge inspiration in the Great Vancouver Mainland. \"We know that victims of bullying, witnesses of bullying and bullies themselves all experience the very real and long term negative impacts of bullying regardless of its forms \u2013 physical, verbal, written, or on-line (cyberbullying)\".ERASE (Expect Respect and A Safe Education) is an initiative started by the province of British Columbia to foster safe schools and prevent bullying. It builds on already-effective programs set up by the provincial government to ensure consistent policies and practices regarding the prevention of bullying.\n\n\n*** Community support ***\nA number of organizations are in coalition to provide awareness, protection and recourse for this escalating problem. Some aim to inform and provide measures to avoid as well as effectively terminate cyberbullying and cyberharassment. Anti-bullying charity Act Against Bullying launched the CyberKind campaign in August 2009 to promote positive internet usage.\nIn 2007, YouTube introduced the first Anti-Bullying Channel for youth (BeatBullying), using the assistance of celebrities to tackle the problem.In March 2010, a 17-year-old girl named Alexis Skye Pilkington was found dead in her room by her parents. Her parents claimed that after repeated cyberbullying, she was driven to suicide. Shortly after her death, attacks resumed. Members of eBaums World began to troll teens' memorial pages on Facebook, with the comments including expressions of pleasure over the death, with pictures of what seemed to be a banana as their profile pictures. Family and friends of the deceased teen responded by creating Facebook groups denouncing cyberbullying and trolling, with logos of bananas behind a red circle with a diagonal line through it.In response and partnership to the 2011 film Bully, a grassroots effort to stop cyberbullying called the Bully Project was created. Their goal is to start \"a national movement to stop bullying that is transforming children's lives and changing a culture of bullying into one of empathy and action.\""

The message is usually a chain e-mail that tells the recipients to forward it to everyone they know, but it can also be in the form of a pop-up window.\n\n\n\n== Identification ==\nMost hoaxes are sensational in nature and easily identified by the fact that they indicate that the virus will do nearly impossible things, like blow up the recipient's computer and set it on fire, or less sensationally, delete everything on the user's computer. They often include fake announcements claimed to originate from reputable computer organizations together with mainstream news media. These bogus sources are quoted in order to give the hoax more credibility. Typically, the warnings use emotive language, stress the urgent nature of the threat and encourage readers to forward the message to other people as soon as possible.Virus hoaxes are usually harmless and accomplish nothing more than annoying people who identify it as a hoax and wasting the time of people who forward the message. Nevertheless, a number of hoaxes have warned users that vital system files are viruses and encourage the user to delete the file, possibly damaging the system. Examples of this type include the jdbgmgr.exe virus hoax and the SULFNBK.EXE hoax.Some consider virus hoaxes and other chain e-mails to be a computer worm in and of themselves. They replicate by social engineering\u2014exploiting users' concern, ignorance, and disinclination to investigate before acting.\nHoaxes are distinct from computer pranks, which are harmless programs that perform unwanted and annoying actions on a computer, such as randomly moving the mouse, turning the screen display upside down, etc.\n\n== Action ==\nAnti-virus specialists agree that recipients should delete virus hoaxes when they receive them, instead of forwarding them.McAfee says:\n\nWe are advising users who receive the email to delete it and DO NOT pass it on as this is how an email HOAX propagates. \nF-Secure recommends:\n\nDo not forward hoax messages.\nHoax warnings are typically scare alerts started by malicious people \u2013 and passed on by innocent individuals that think they are helping the community by spreading the warning.\n\nCorporate users can get rid of the hoax problem by simply setting a strict company guideline: End users must not forward virus alarms. Ever. It's not the job of an end user anyway. If such message is received, end users could forward it to the IT department but not to anyone else.\n\n== Comparison ==\n\n== Telephone scam ==\n\nA telephone scam, commonly operated from call centres based in India, has been active since 2008. The victim is quoted his or her name and address, and is told: \"I'm calling for Microsoft (or an entity that sounds like it is connected to Microsoft, such as the \"Windows Service Center\" or \"Windows Technical Department\"). We've had a report from your internet service provider of serious virus problems from your Windows computer.\" The victim is then directed to open the Windows event viewer, which displays apparently critical warnings, and is directed to a website to download an application to allow the scammer to control his or her computer remotely.  The caller supposedly fixes the problems and demands a fee for the service.  In addition to the fraudulent fee, the process usually enables malware to be uploaded to the victim's computer.\n\n== Parodies ==\nThe virus hoax has become part of the culture of the twenty-first century and the gullibility of novice computer users convinced to delete files on the basis of hoaxes has been parodied in several popular jokes and songs.\nOne such parody is \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's song \"Virus Alert\" from the album Straight Outta Lynwood. The song makes fun of the exaggerated claims that are made in virus hoaxes, such as legally changing your name or opening a rift in time and space.Another parody of virus hoaxes is the honor system virus which has been circulated under the name Amish Computer Virus, manual virus, the Blond Computer Virus, the Irish Computer Virus, the Syrian Computer Virus, the Norwegian Computer Virus, Albanian Virus, Newfie Virus, the Unix Computer Virus, the Mac OS 9 virus, Discount virus and many others. This joke email claims to be authored by the Amish or other similar low-technology populations who have no computers, programming skills or electricity to create viruses and thus ask users to delete their own hard drive contents manually after forwarding the message to their friends.The Tuxissa virus is another parody of the virus hoax, based on the concept of the Melissa virus, but with its aim of installing Linux on the victim's computer without the owner's permission. The story says that it was spread via e-mail, contained in a message titled \"Important Message About Windows Security\". It was supposed to first spread the virus to other computers, then download a stripped-down version of Slackware and uncompress it onto the hard disk.

    "instruction": "Visual cryptography\n\n==Introduction==\nVisual cryptography is a cryptographic technique  which allows visual information (pictures, text, etc.) to be encrypted in such a way that the decrypted information appears as a visual image.\nOne of the best-known techniques has been credited to Moni Naor and Adi Shamir, who developed it in 1994. They demonstrated a visual secret sharing scheme, where an image was broken up into n shares so that only someone with all n shares could decrypt the image, while any n \u2212 1 shares revealed no information about the original image. Each share was printed on a separate transparency, and decryption was performed by overlaying the shares. When all n shares were overlaid, the original image would appear. There are several generalizations of the basic scheme including k-out-of-n visual cryptography, and using opaque sheets but illuminating them by multiple sets of identical illumination patterns under the recording of only one single-pixel detector.Using a similar idea, transparencies can be used to implement a one-time pad encryption, where one transparency is a shared random pad, and another transparency acts as the ciphertext. Normally, there is an expansion of space requirement in visual cryptography. But if one of the two shares is structured recursively, the efficiency of visual cryptography can be increased to 100%.Some antecedents of visual cryptography are in patents from the 1960s.

Each component image has a pair of pixels for every pixel in the original image. These pixel pairs are shaded black or white according to the following rule: if the original image pixel was black, the pixel pairs in the component images must be complementary; randomly shade one \u25a0\u25a1, and the other \u25a1\u25a0. When these complementary pairs are overlapped, they will appear dark gray. On the other hand, if the original image pixel was white, the pixel pairs in the component images must match: both \u25a0\u25a1 or both \u25a1\u25a0. When these matching pairs are overlapped, they will appear light gray.\nSo, when the two component images are superimposed, the original image appears. However, without the other component, a component image reveals no information about the original image; it is indistinguishable from a random pattern of \u25a0\u25a1 / \u25a1\u25a0 pairs. Moreover, if you have one component image, you can use the shading rules above to produce a counterfeit component image that combines with it to produce any image at all.\n\n== (2, N) Visual Cryptography Sharing Case ==\nSharing a secret with an arbitrary number of people N such that at least 2 of them are required to decode the secret is one form of the visual secret sharing scheme presented by Moni Naor and Adi Shamir in 1994. In this scheme we have a secret image which is encoded into N shares printed on transparencies. The shares appear random and contain no decipherable information about the underlying secret image, however if any 2 of the shares are stacked on top of one another the secret image becomes decipherable by the human eye.\nEvery pixel from the secret image is encoded into multiple subpixels in each share image using a matrix to determine the color of the pixels. \nIn the (2,N) case a white pixel in the secret image is encoded using a matrix from the following set, where each row gives the subpixel pattern for one of the components:\n{all permutations of the columns of} : \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            C\n            \n              0\n\n== Cheating the (2,N) Visual Secret Sharing Scheme ==\nHorng et al. proposed a method that allows N \u2212 1 colluding parties to cheat an honest party in visual cryptography. They take advantage of knowing the underlying distribution of the pixels in the shares to create new shares that combine with existing shares to form a new secret message of the cheaters choosing.We know that 2 shares are enough to decode the secret image using the human visual system. But examining two shares also gives some information about the 3rd share. For instance, colluding participants may examine their shares to determine when they both have black pixels and use that information to determine that another participant will also have a black pixel in that location. Knowing where black pixels exist in another party's share allows them to create a new share that will combine with the predicted share to form a new secret message. In this way a set of colluding parties that have enough shares to access the secret code can cheat other honest parties.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn \"Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling\", a 1967 episode of TV series The Prisoner, the protagonist uses a visual cryptography overlay of multiple transparencies to reveal a secret message \u2013 the location of a scientist friend who had gone into hiding.\n\nWhat is the (2,N) visual secret sharing scheme presented by Moni Naor and Adi Shamir?",

      "context": "Visual cryptography\n\n==Introduction==\nVisual cryptography is a cryptographic technique  which allows visual information (pictures, text, etc.) to be encrypted in such a way that the decrypted information appears as a visual image.\nOne of the best-known techniques has been credited to Moni Naor and Adi Shamir, who developed it in 1994. They demonstrated a visual secret sharing scheme, where an image was broken up into n shares so that only someone with all n shares could decrypt the image, while any n \u2212 1 shares revealed no information about the original image. Each share was printed on a separate transparency, and decryption was performed by overlaying the shares. When all n shares were overlaid, the original image would appear. There are several generalizations of the basic scheme including k-out-of-n visual cryptography, and using opaque sheets but illuminating them by multiple sets of identical illumination patterns under the recording of only one single-pixel detector.Using a similar idea, transparencies can be used to implement a one-time pad encryption, where one transparency is a shared random pad, and another transparency acts as the ciphertext. Normally, there is an expansion of space requirement in visual cryptography. But if one of the two shares is structured recursively, the efficiency of visual cryptography can be increased to 100%.Some antecedents of visual cryptography are in patents from the 1960s. Other antecedents are in the work on perception and secure communication.Visual cryptography can be used to protect biometric templates in which decryption does not require any complex computations.\n\n\n\n== Example ==\n\nIn this example, the image has been split into two component images.

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nDisini v. Secretary of Justice\n\n==Introduction==\nDisini v. Secretary of Justice (G.R. Nos. 203335, et al.) is a landmark ruling of the Supreme Court of the Philippines handed down on February 18, 2014. When the Congress of the Philippines passed the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 the bill was immediately controversial, especially its strict penalties for the new crime of \"cyberlibel\", an upgraded form of the already existing criminal libel charge found in the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines.In the end, the Court declared that most of the law, including the cyberlibel provision, was constitutional. The ruling's abridgement of free expression has been widely criticized by critics of the law, including then attorney Harry Roque. The decision reached in Disini paved the way for the anti-fake news provisions of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.\n\n\n\n== Petition ==\nSeveral petitions were almost immediately submitted to the Supreme Court questioning the constitutionality of the Act upon its signing, including the petition of Jose Jesus M. Disini, Jr. on September 25, a Harvard-educated lawyer and law professor at the University of the Philippines College of Law from whose name the title of the case derives.\n\n== Initial deferment and protests ==\nOn October 2, the Supreme Court initially chose to defer action on the petitions, citing an absence of justices which prevented the Court from sitting en banc. The initial lack of a temporary restraining order meant that the law went into effect as scheduled on October 3.  In protest, Filipino netizens reacted by blacking out their Facebook profile pictures and trending the hashtag #NoToCybercrimeLaw on Twitter. \"Anonymous\" also defaced government websites, including those of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System and the Intellectual Property Office.\n\n== Temporary restraining order ==\nOn October 8, 2012, the Supreme Court decided to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO), pausing implementation of the law for 120 days. In early December 2012, the government requested the lifting of the TRO, which was denied. The TRO consolidated all fifteen petitions filed up to that point into one case.\n\n== Oral arguments ==\n\nOver four hours of oral arguments by petitioners were heard on January 15, 2013, followed by a three-hour rebuttal by the Office of the Solicitor General, representing the government, on January 29, 2013. This was the first time in Philippine history that oral arguments were uploaded online by the Supreme Court.\n\n== Ruling ==\nOn February 18, 2014, in a ruling penned by justice Roberto Abad, the Supreme Court ruled 12\u20131\u20132 that most of the law was constitutional, although it struck down other provisions, including the ones that violated double jeopardy. In total, \u00a74(c)(3), \u00a75 (only in relation to \u00a74(c)(2), \u00a74(c)(3), and \u00a74(c)(4)), \u00a77 (only in relation to sections \u00a74(c)(2) and \u00a74(c)(4)), \u00a712, and \u00a719 were struck down by the Court as unconstitutional.Notably, \"likes\" and \"retweets\" of libelous content, originally themselves also criminalized as libel under the law, were found to be legal, and this was the only instance in which the court modified the interpretation of section 4(c)(4). Only justice Marvic Leonen dissented from the ruling, writing that he believes the whole idea of criminal libel to be unconstitutional, and assailing the Court for not finding so.\nOf note also was the Court's justification for the higher penalties given to cybercrimes, such as prisi\u00f3n mayor (six to twelve years in prison) for cyberlibel:There exists a substantial distinction between crimes committed through the use of information and communications technology and similar crimes committed using other means. In using the technology in question, the offender often evades identification and is able to reach far more victims or cause greater harm. The distinction, therefore, creates a basis for higher penalties for cybercrimes.The Court's ruling also puts the burden of proof for whether or not there was malice on the defendant rather than the petitioner, even if the petitioner is a public figure. In his dissent in part, justice Antonio Carpio called this provision \"clearly repugnant to the Constitution.\"\n\n\n*** Motion for reconsideration ***\nWhile motions for reconsideration were immediately filed by numerous petitioners, including the Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility, they were all rejected with finality on April 22, 2014. However, justice Arturo Brion, who originally wrote a separate concurring opinion, changed his vote to dissent after reconsidering whether it was just to impose higher penalties for cyberlibel than for regular libel.\n\nWhat was the main reason for the controversy surrounding the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 in the Philippines?",

When the Congress of the Philippines passed the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 the bill was immediately controversial, especially its strict penalties for the new crime of \"cyberlibel\", an upgraded form of the already existing criminal libel charge found in the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines.In the end, the Court declared that most of the law, including the cyberlibel provision, was constitutional. The ruling's abridgement of free expression has been widely criticized by critics of the law, including then attorney Harry Roque. The decision reached in Disini paved the way for the anti-fake news provisions of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.\n\n\n\n== Petition ==\nSeveral petitions were almost immediately submitted to the Supreme Court questioning the constitutionality of the Act upon its signing, including the petition of Jose Jesus M. Disini, Jr. on September 25, a Harvard-educated lawyer and law professor at the University of the Philippines College of Law from whose name the title of the case derives.\n\n== Initial deferment and protests ==\nOn October 2, the Supreme Court initially chose to defer action on the petitions, citing an absence of justices which prevented the Court from sitting en banc. The initial lack of a temporary restraining order meant that the law went into effect as scheduled on October 3.  In protest, Filipino netizens reacted by blacking out their Facebook profile pictures and trending the hashtag #NoToCybercrimeLaw on Twitter. \"Anonymous\" also defaced government websites, including those of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System and the Intellectual Property Office.\n\n== Temporary restraining order ==\nOn October 8, 2012, the Supreme Court decided to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO), pausing implementation of the law for 120 days. In early December 2012, the government requested the lifting of the TRO, which was denied. The TRO consolidated all fifteen petitions filed up to that point into one case.\n\n== Oral arguments ==\n\nOver four hours of oral arguments by petitioners were heard on January 15, 2013, followed by a three-hour rebuttal by the Office of the Solicitor General, representing the government, on January 29, 2013. This was the first time in Philippine history that oral arguments were uploaded online by the Supreme Court.\n\n== Ruling ==\nOn February 18, 2014, in a ruling penned by justice Roberto Abad, the Supreme Court ruled 12\u20131\u20132 that most of the law was constitutional, although it struck down other provisions, including the ones that violated double jeopardy. In total, \u00a74(c)(3), \u00a75 (only in relation to \u00a74(c)(2), \u00a74(c)(3), and \u00a74(c)(4)), \u00a77 (only in relation to sections \u00a74(c)(2) and \u00a74(c)(4)), \u00a712, and \u00a719 were struck down by the Court as unconstitutional.Notably, \"likes\" and \"retweets\" of libelous content, originally themselves also criminalized as libel under the law, were found to be legal, and this was the only instance in which the court modified the interpretation of section 4(c)(4). Only justice Marvic Leonen dissented from the ruling, writing that he believes the whole idea of criminal libel to be unconstitutional, and assailing the Court for not finding so.\nOf note also was the Court's justification for the higher penalties given to cybercrimes, such as prisi\u00f3n mayor (six to twelve years in prison) for cyberlibel:There exists a substantial distinction between crimes committed through the use of information and communications technology and similar crimes committed using other means. In using the technology in question, the offender often evades identification and is able to reach far more victims or cause greater harm. The distinction, therefore, creates a basis for higher penalties for cybercrimes.The Court's ruling also puts the burden of proof for whether or not there was malice on the defendant rather than the petitioner, even if the petitioner is a public figure. In his dissent in part, justice Antonio Carpio called this provision \"clearly repugnant to the Constitution.\"\n\n\n*** Motion for reconsideration ***\nWhile motions for reconsideration were immediately filed by numerous petitioners, including the Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility, they were all rejected with finality on April 22, 2014. However, justice Arturo Brion, who originally wrote a separate concurring opinion, changed his vote to dissent after reconsidering whether it was just to impose higher penalties for cyberlibel than for regular libel."

The vulnerability has been exploited primarily in Mexico, but also Colombia and Peru, according to the Wall Street Journal, where it was used to track the location of mobile phone users without their knowledge. \n\n\n\n== Technical information ==\nThe attack works by exploiting a vulnerability in a UICC/SIM Card library called the S@T Browser. A specially formatted binary text message is sent to the victim handset, which contains a set of commands to be executed by the S@T Browser environment in the UICC. As the S@T Browser environment has access to a subset of SIM Toolkit commands, the attackers used this vulnerability to instruct the UICC to request IMEI and location information from the handset via SIM Toolkit commands. Once this was obtained the UICC then instructs the handset to exfiltrate this information to the attackers within another text message. Other types of attacks are also possible using the S@T Browser, such as forcing a mobile device to open a webpage or to make a phone call.The attack differed from previously reported SIM Card attacks as those required the SIM key to be obtained. The Simjacker attack does not require a SIM key, only that the SIM Card has the S@T Browser library installed on it, and that the binary messages containing the S@T Browser commands can be sent to the victim. \nSimjacker was registered in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database as CVE-2019-16256 and CVE-2019-16257, and by the GSM Association in its Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure process as CVD-2019-0026\n\n== Impact ==\nThe vulnerability was estimated to affect UICCs in at least 61 mobile operators in 29 countries, with estimates between a few hundred million to over a billion SIM cards affected.

    "instruction": "Advanced electronic signature\n\n==Introduction==\nAn advanced electronic signature (AES or AdES) is an electronic signature that has met the requirements set forth under EU Regulation No 910/2014 (eIDAS-regulation) on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European Single Market.\n\n\n\n== Description ==\neIDAS created standards for the use of electronic signatures so that they could be used in a secure manner when conducting business online, such as an electronic fund transfer or official business across borders with EU Member States. The advanced electronic signature is one of the standards outlined in eIDAS.\nFor an electronic signature to be considered as advanced, it must meet several requirements:\nThe signatory can be uniquely identified and linked to the signature\nThe signatory must have sole control of the signature creation data (typically a private key) that was used to create the electronic signature\nThe signature must be capable of identifying if its accompanying data has been tampered with after the message was signed\nIn the event that the accompanying data has been changed, the signature must be invalidatedAdvanced electronic signatures that are compliant with eIDAS may be technically implemented through the Ades Baseline Profiles that have been developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI):\nXAdES, XML Advanced Electronic Signatures is a set of extensions to XML-DSig recommendation making it suitable for Advanced Electronic Signatures.\nPAdES, PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures is a set of restrictions and extensions to PDF and ISO 32000-1 making it suitable for Advanced Electronic Signature.\nCAdES, CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures is a set of extensions to Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) signed data making it suitable for advanced electronic signatures.\nASiC Baseline Profile. ASiC (Associated Signature Containers) specifies the use of container structures to bind together one or more signed objects with either advanced electronic signatures or time-stamp tokens into one single digital (zip) container.\n\n== Vision ==\nThe implementation of advanced electronic signatures under the specification of eIDAS serves several purposes. Business and public services processes, even those that go across borders can be safely expedited by using electronic signing. With eIDAS, EU States are required to establish \u201cpoints of single contact\u201d (PSCs) for trust services that ensure the electronic ID schemes can be used in public sector transactions that occur cross-borders, including access to healthcare information across borders.In the past, when signing a document or message, the signatory would sign it and then return it to its intended recipient through the postal service, via facsimile service, or by scanning and attaching it to an email. This could lead to delays and of course, the possibility that signatures could be forged and documents altered, especially when multiple signatures from different people located in different locations are required. The process of using an advanced electronic signature saves time, is legally binding and assures a high level of technical security.\n\n== Legal implications ==\nFollowing Article 25 (1) of the eIDAS regulation, an advanced electronic signature shall \"not be denied legal effect and admissibility as evidence in legal proceedings\". However it will reach a higher probative value when enhanced to the level of a qualified electronic signature. By adding a certificate that has been issued by a qualified trust service provider that attests to the authenticity of the qualified signature, the upgraded advanced signature then carries according to Article 24 (2) of the eIDAS Regulation the same legal value as a handwritten signature. However, this is only regulated in the European Union and similarly through ZertES in Switzerland. A qualified electronic signature is not defined in the United States.\n\n== Long-term validation ==\nAdES formats are, from less quality to Long-term validation, with full juridic efects:\n\nBasic electronic signature (AdES  BES).\nAdES  T, adds TimeStamp.\nAdES  C, includes references to the certificates and their conditions.\nAdES  X, adds timestamps to the references in the previous step.\nAdES  XL, includes revocation certification and information, for their long-term validation.\nAdES  A, allows the addition of periodic timestamps to guarantee the integrity of the signature, stored for future verification.\n\nHow do advanced electronic signatures differ from basic electronic signatures?",

Additionally, they can identify if the accompanying data has been tampered with and are legally binding in the European Union and Switzerland.",
      "context": "Advanced electronic signature\n\n==Introduction==\nAn advanced electronic signature (AES or AdES) is an electronic signature that has met the requirements set forth under EU Regulation No 910/2014 (eIDAS-regulation) on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European Single Market.\n\n\n\n== Description ==\neIDAS created standards for the use of electronic signatures so that they could be used in a secure manner when conducting business online, such as an electronic fund transfer or official business across borders with EU Member States. The advanced electronic signature is one of the standards outlined in eIDAS.\nFor an electronic signature to be considered as advanced, it must meet several requirements:\nThe signatory can be uniquely identified and linked to the signature\nThe signatory must have sole control of the signature creation data (typically a private key) that was used to create the electronic signature\nThe signature must be capable of identifying if its accompanying data has been tampered with after the message was signed\nIn the event that the accompanying data has been changed, the signature must be invalidatedAdvanced electronic signatures that are compliant with eIDAS may be technically implemented through the Ades Baseline Profiles that have been developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI):\nXAdES, XML Advanced Electronic Signatures is a set of extensions to XML-DSig recommendation making it suitable for Advanced Electronic Signatures.\nPAdES, PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures is a set of restrictions and extensions to PDF and ISO 32000-1 making it suitable for Advanced Electronic Signature.\nCAdES, CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures is a set of extensions to Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) signed data making it suitable for advanced electronic signatures.\nASiC Baseline Profile. ASiC (Associated Signature Containers) specifies the use of container structures to bind together one or more signed objects with either advanced electronic signatures or time-stamp tokens into one single digital (zip) container.\n\n== Vision ==\nThe implementation of advanced electronic signatures under the specification of eIDAS serves several purposes. Business and public services processes, even those that go across borders can be safely expedited by using electronic signing. With eIDAS, EU States are required to establish \u201cpoints of single contact\u201d (PSCs) for trust services that ensure the electronic ID schemes can be used in public sector transactions that occur cross-borders, including access to healthcare information across borders.In the past, when signing a document or message, the signatory would sign it and then return it to its intended recipient through the postal service, via facsimile service, or by scanning and attaching it to an email. This could lead to delays and of course, the possibility that signatures could be forged and documents altered, especially when multiple signatures from different people located in different locations are required. The process of using an advanced electronic signature saves time, is legally binding and assures a high level of technical security.\n\n== Legal implications ==\nFollowing Article 25 (1) of the eIDAS regulation, an advanced electronic signature shall \"not be denied legal effect and admissibility as evidence in legal proceedings\". However it will reach a higher probative value when enhanced to the level of a qualified electronic signature. By adding a certificate that has been issued by a qualified trust service provider that attests to the authenticity of the qualified signature, the upgraded advanced signature then carries according to Article 24 (2) of the eIDAS Regulation the same legal value as a handwritten signature. However, this is only regulated in the European Union and similarly through ZertES in Switzerland. A qualified electronic signature is not defined in the United States.\n\n== Long-term validation ==\nAdES formats are, from less quality to Long-term validation, with full juridic efects:\n\nBasic electronic signature (AdES  BES).\nAdES  T, adds TimeStamp.\nAdES  C, includes references to the certificates and their conditions.\nAdES  X, adds timestamps to the references in the previous step.\nAdES  XL, includes revocation certification and information, for their long-term validation.\nAdES  A, allows the addition of periodic timestamps to guarantee the integrity of the signature, stored for future verification."

    "instruction": "Context: Private biometrics\n\n==Introduction==\nPrivate biometrics is a form of encrypted biometrics, also called privacy-preserving biometric authentication methods, in which the biometric payload is a one-way, homomorphically encrypted feature vector that is 0.05% the size of the original biometric template and can be searched with full accuracy, speed and privacy. The feature vector's homomorphic encryption allows search and match to be conducted in polynomial time on an encrypted dataset and the search result is returned as an encrypted match. One or more computing devices may use an encrypted feature vector to verify an individual person (1:1 verify) or identify an individual in a datastore (1:many identify) without storing, sending or receiving plaintext biometric data within or between computing devices or any other entity.  The purpose of private biometrics is to allow a person to be identified or authenticated while guaranteeing individual privacy and fundamental human rights by only operating on biometric data in the encrypted space. Some private biometrics including fingerprint authentication methods, face authentication methods, and identity-matching algorithms according to bodily features. Private biometrics are constantly evolving based on the changing nature of privacy needs, identity theft, and biotechnology.   \n\n\n\n== Background ==\nBiometric security strengthens user authentication but, until recently, also implied important risks to personal privacy.  Indeed, while compromised passwords can be easily replaced and are not personally identifiable information(PII), biometric data is considered highly sensitive due to its personal nature, unique association with users, and the fact that compromised biometrics (biometric templates) cannot be revoked or replaced. Private biometrics have been developed to address this challenge. Private Biometrics provide the necessary biometric authentication while simultaneously minimizing user's privacy exposure through the use of one-way, fully homomorphic encryption.\nThe Biometric Open Protocol Standard, IEEE 2410-2018, was updated in 2018 to include private biometrics and stated that the one-way fully homomorphic encrypted feature vectors, \u201c...bring a new level of consumer privacy assurance by keeping biometric data encrypted both at rest and in transit.\u201d  The Biometric Open Protocol Standard (BOPS III) also noted a key benefit of private biometrics was the new standard allowed for simplification of the API since the biometric payload was always one-way encrypted and therefore had no need for key management.\n\n== Fully homomorphic cryptosystems for biometrics ==\nHistorically, biometric matching techniques have been unable to operate in the encrypted space and have required the biometric to be visible (unencrypted) at specific points during search and match operations. This decrypt requirement made large-scale search across encrypted biometrics (\u201c1:many identify\u201d) infeasible due to both significant overhead issues (e.g. complex key management and significant data storage and processing requirements) and the substantial risk that the biometrics were vulnerable to loss when processed in plaintext within the application or operating system (see FIDO Alliance, for example).\nBiometric security vendors complying with data privacy laws and regulations (including Apple FaceID, Samsung, Google) therefore focused their efforts on the simpler 1:1 verify problem and were unable to overcome the large computational demands required for linear scan to solve the 1:many identify problem.Today, private biometric cryptosystems overcome these limitations and risks through the use of one-way, fully homomorphic encryption. This form of encryption allows computations to be carried out on ciphertext, allows the match to be conducted on an encrypted dataset without decrypting the reference biometric, and returns an encrypted match result. Matching in the encrypted space offers the highest levels of accuracy, speed and privacy and eliminates the risks associated with decrypting biometrics.\n\n\n*** Accuracy: same as plaintext (99%) ***\nThe private biometric feature vector is much smaller (0.05% the size of the original biometric template) but yet maintains the same accuracy as the original plaintext reference biometric.  In testing using Google's unified embedding for face recognition and clustering CNN (\u201cFacenet\u201d), Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) (source), and other open source faces, private biometric feature vectors returned the same accuracy as plaintext facial recognition. Using an 8MB facial biometric, one vendor reported an accuracy rate of 98.7%. The same vendor reported accuracy increased to 99.99% when using three 8MB facial biometrics and a vote algorithm (best two out of 3) to predict.As the quality of the facial biometric image declined, accuracy degraded very slowly. For 256kB facial images (3% the quality of an 8MB picture), the same vendor reported 96.3% accuracy and that the neural network was able to maintain similar accuracy through boundary conditions including extreme cases of light or background.\n\n\n*** Speed: polynomial search (same as plaintext) ***\nThe private biometric feature vector is 4kB and contains 128 floating point numbers. In contrast, plaintext biometric security instances (including Apple Face ID) currently use 7MB to 8MB reference facial biometrics (templates). By using the much smaller feature vector, the resulting search performance is less than one second per prediction using a datastore of 100 million open source faces (\u201cpolynomial search\u201d). The private biometric test model used for these results was Google's unified embedding for face recognition and clustering CNN (\u201cFacenet\u201d), Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) (source), and other open source faces.\n\n\n*** Privacy: full compliance with privacy regulations worldwide ***\nAs with all ideal one-way cryptographic hash functions, decrypt keys do not exist for private biometrics so it is infeasible to generate the original biometric message from the private biometric feature vector (its hash value) except by trying all possible messages. Unlike passwords, however, no two instances of a biometric are exactly the same or, stated in another way, there is no constant biometric value, so a brute force attack using all possible faces would only produce an approximate (fuzzy) match. Privacy and fundamental human rights are therefore guaranteed.\nSpecifically, the private biometric feature vector is produced by a one-way cryptographic hash algorithm that maps plaintext biometric data of arbitrary size to a small feature vector of a fixed size (4kB) that is mathematically impossible to invert. The one-way encryption algorithm is typically achieved using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), which takes a vector of arbitrary real-valued scores and squashes it to a 4kB vector of values between zero and one that sum to one. It is mathematically impossible to reconstruct the original plaintext image from a private biometric feature vector of 128 floating point numbers.\n\n== One-way encryption, history and modern use ==\nOne-way encryptions offer unlimited privacy by containing no mechanism to reverse the encryption and disclose the original data. Once a value is processed through a one-way hash, it is not possible to discover to the original value (hence the name \u201cone-way\u201d).\n\n\n*** History ***\nThe first one-way encryptions were likely developed by James H. Ellis, Clifford Cocks, and Malcolm Williamson at the UK intelligence agency GCHQ during the 1960s and 1970s and were published independently by Diffie and Hellman in 1976 (History of cryptography). Common modern one-way encryption algorithms, including MD5 (message digest) and SHA-512 (secure hash algorithm) are similar to the first such algorithms in that they also contain no mechanism to disclose the original data. The output of these modern one-way encryptions offer high privacy but are not homomorphic, meaning that the results of the one-way encryptions do not allow high order math operations (such as match). For example, we cannot use two SHA-512 sums to compare the closeness of two encrypted documents. This limitation makes it impossible for these one-way encryptions to be used to support classifying models in machine learning\u2014or nearly anything else.\n\n\n*** Modern use ***\nThe first one-way, homomorphically encrypted, Euclidean-measurable feature vector for biometric processing was proposed in a paper by Streit, Streit and Suffian in 2017.\n  \nIn this paper, the authors theorized and also demonstrated using a small sample size (n\n\nQuestion: How does private biometrics differ from traditional biometric methods in terms of data privacy?\n\nAnswer:",

    "instruction": "IDN homograph attack\n\n==Introduction==\nThe internationalized domain name (IDN) homograph attack is a way a malicious party may deceive computer users about what remote system they are communicating with, by exploiting the fact that many different characters look alike (i.e., they are homographs, hence the term for the attack, although technically homoglyph is the more accurate term for different characters that look alike). For example, a regular user of example.com may be lured to click a link where the Latin character \"a\" is replaced with the Cyrillic character \"\u0430\".\nThis kind of spoofing attack is also known as script spoofing. Unicode incorporates numerous writing systems, and, for a number of reasons, similar-looking characters such as Greek \u039f, Latin O, and Cyrillic \u041e were not assigned the same code. Their incorrect or malicious usage is a possibility for security attacks.\nThe registration of homographic domain names is akin to , in that both forms of attacks use a similar-looking name to a more established domain to fool a user. The major difference is that in typosquatting the perpetrator attracts victims by relying on natural typographical errors commonly made when manually entering a URL, while in homograph spoofing the perpetrator deceives the victims by presenting visually indistinguishable hyperlinks. Indeed, it would be a rare accident for a web user to type, for example, a Cyrillic letter within an otherwise English word such as \"citib\u0430nk\". There are cases in which a registration can be both typosquatting and homograph spoofing; the pairs of l/I, i/j, and 0/O are all both close together on keyboards and, depending on the typeface, may be difficult or impossible to distinguish.\n\n\n\n== Homographs in ASCII ==\nASCII has several characters or pairs of characters that look alike and are known as homographs (or homoglyphs). Spoofing attacks based on these similarities are known as homograph spoofing attacks. For example, 0 (the number) and O (the letter), \"l\" lowercase L, and \"I\" uppercase \"i\".\nIn a typical example of a hypothetical attack, someone could register a domain name that appears almost identical to an existing domain but goes somewhere else.  For example, the domain \"rnicrosoft.com\" begins with \"r\" and \"n\", not \"m\".\nOther examples are G00GLE.COM which looks much like GOOGLE.COM in some fonts.\nUsing a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters, googIe.com (capital i, not small L) looks much like google.com in some fonts.  PayPal was a target of a phishing scam exploiting this, using the domain PayPaI.com. In certain narrow-spaced fonts such as Tahoma (the default in the address bar in Windows XP), placing a c in front of a j, l or i will produce homoglyphs such as cl cj ci (d g a).\n\n== Homographs in internationalized domain names ==\nIn multilingual computer systems, different logical characters may have identical appearances.\nFor example, Unicode character U+0430, Cyrillic small letter a (\"\u0430\"), can look identical to Unicode character U+0061, Latin small letter a, (\"a\") which is the lowercase \"a\" used in English. Hence wikipedi\u0430.org (xn--wikipedi-86g.org; the Cyrillic version) instead of wikipedia.org (the Latin version).\nThe problem arises from the different treatment of the characters in the user's mind and the computer's programming. From the viewpoint of the user, a Cyrillic \"\u0430\" within a Latin string is a Latin \"a\"; there is no difference in the glyphs for these characters in most fonts. However, the computer treats them differently when processing the character string as an identifier. Thus, the user's assumption of a one-to-one correspondence between the visual appearance of a name and the named entity breaks down.\nInternationalized domain names provide a backward-compatible way for domain names to use the full Unicode character set, and this standard is already widely supported. However this system expanded the character repertoire from a few dozen characters in a single alphabet to many thousands of characters in many scripts; this greatly increased the scope for homograph attacks.\nThis opens a rich vein of opportunities for phishing and other varieties of fraud. An attacker could register a domain name that looks just like that of a legitimate website, but in which some of the letters have been replaced by homographs in another alphabet. The attacker could then send e-mail messages purporting to come from the original site, but directing people to the bogus site. The spoof site could then record information such as passwords or account details, while passing traffic through to the real site. The victims may never notice the difference, until suspicious or criminal activity occurs with their accounts.\nIn December 2001 Evgeniy Gabrilovich and Alex Gontmakher, both from Technion, Israel, published a paper titled \"The Homograph Attack\", which described an attack that used Unicode URLs to spoof a website URL. To prove the feasibility of this kind of attack, the researchers successfully registered a variant of the domain name microsoft.com which incorporated Cyrillic characters.\nProblems of this kind were anticipated before IDN was introduced, and guidelines were issued to registries to try to avoid or reduce the problem. For example, it was advised that registries only accept characters from the Latin alphabet and that of their own country, not all of Unicode characters, but this advice was neglected by major TLDs.On February 7, 2005, Slashdot reported that this exploit was disclosed by 3ric Johanson at the hacker conference Shmoocon.  Web browsers supporting IDNA appeared to direct the URL http://www.p\u0430ypal.com/, in which the first a character is replaced by a Cyrillic \u0430, to the site of the well known payment site PayPal, but actually led to a spoofed web site with different content. Popular browsers continued to have problems properly displaying international domain names through April 2017.The following alphabets have characters that can be used for spoofing attacks (please note, these are only the most obvious and common, given artistic license and how much risk the spoofer will take of getting caught; the possibilities are far more numerous than can be listed here):\n\n\n*** Cyrillic ***\nCyrillic is, by far, the most commonly used alphabet for homoglyphs, largely because it contains 11 lowercase glyphs that are identical or nearly identical to Latin counterparts.\nThe Cyrillic letters \u0430, \u0441, \u0435, \u043e, \u0440, \u0445 and \u0443 have optical counterparts in the basic Latin alphabet and look close or identical to a, c, e, o, p, x and y. Cyrillic \u0417, \u0427 and \u0431 resemble the numerals 3, 4 and 6. Italic type generates more homoglyphs: \u0434\u0442\u043f\u0438 or \u0434\u0442\u043f\u0438 (\u0434\u0442\u043f\u0438 in standard type), resembling dmnu (in some fonts \u0434 can be used, since its italic form resembles a lowercase g; however, in most mainstream fonts, \u0434 instead resembles a partial differential sign, \u2202).\nIf capital letters are counted, \u0410\u0412\u0421\u0415\u041d\u0406\u0408\u041a\u041c\u041e\u0420\u0405\u0422\u0425 can substitute ABCEHIJKMOPSTX, in addition to the capitals for the lowercase Cyrillic homoglyphs.\nCyrillic non-Russian problematic letters are \u0456 and i, \u0458 and j, \u051b and q, \u0455 and s, \u051d and w, \u04ae and Y, while \u0492 and F, \u050c and G bear some resemblance to each other. Cyrillic \u04d3\u0451\u0457\u04e7 can also be used if an IDN itself is being spoofed, to fake \u00e4\u00eb\u00ef\u00f6.\nWhile Komi De (\u0501), shha (\u04bb), palochka (\u04c0)  and izhitsa (\u0475) bear strong resemblance to Latin d, h, l and v, these letters are either rare or archaic and are not widely supported in most standard fonts (they are not included in the WGL-4). Attempting to use them could cause a ransom note effect.\n\n\n*** Greek ***\nFrom the Greek alphabet, only omicron \u03bf and sometimes nu \u03bd appear identical to a Latin alphabet letter in the lowercase used for URLs. Fonts that are in italic type will feature Greek alpha \u03b1 looking like a Latin a.\nThis list increases if close matches are also allowed (such as Greek \u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c9\u03c7\u03b3 for eiknptuwxy). Using capital letters, the list expands greatly. Greek \u0391\u0392\u0395\u0397\u0399\u039a\u039c\u039d\u039f\u03a1\u03a4\u03a7\u03a5\u0396 looks identical to Latin ABEHIKMNOPTXYZ. Greek \u0391\u0393\u0392\u0395\u0397\u039a\u039c\u039f\u03a0\u03a1\u03a4\u03a6\u03a7 looks similar to Cyrillic \u0410\u0413\u0412\u0415\u041d\u041a\u041c\u041e\u041f\u0420\u0422\u0424\u0425 (as do Cyrillic \u041b (\u041b) and Greek \u039b in certain geometric sans-serif fonts), Greek letters \u03ba and \u03bf look similar to Cyrillic \u043a and \u043e. Besides this Greek \u03c4, \u03c6 can be similar to Cyrillic \u0442, \u0444 in some fonts, Greek \u03b4 resembles Cyrillic \u0431 in the Serbian alphabet, and the Cyrillic \u0430 also italicizes the same as its Latin counterpart, making it possible to substitute it for alpha or vice versa. The lunate form of sigma, \u03f9\u03f2, resembles both Latin Cc and Cyrillic \u0421\u0441.\nIf an IDN itself is being spoofed, Greek beta \u03b2 can be a substitute for German eszett \u00df in some fonts (and in fact, code page 437 treats them as equivalent), as can Greek end-of-word-variant sigma \u03c2 for \u00e7; accented Greek substitutes \u03cc\u03af\u03ac can usually be used for \u00f3\u00ed\u00e1 in many fonts, with the last of these (alpha) again only resembling a in italic type.\n\n\n*** Armenian ***\nThe Armenian alphabet can also contribute critical characters: several Armenian characters like \u0585, \u0578, \u057d, as well capital \u054f and \u053c are often completely identical to Latin characters in modern fonts, and symbols which similar enough to pass off, such as \u0581\u0570\u0578\u0585\u0566\u057d which look like ghnoqu, \u0575 which resembles j (albeit dotless), and \u0584, which can either resemble p or f depending on the font; \u0561 can resemble Cyrillic \u0448. However, the use of Armenian is, luckily, a bit less reliable: Not all standard fonts feature Armenian glyphs (whereas the Greek and Cyrillic scripts are); Windows prior to Windows 7 rendered Armenian in a distinct font, Sylfaen, of which the mixing of Armenian with Latin would appear obviously different if using a font other than Sylfaen or a Unicode typeface. (This is known as a ransom note effect.) The current version of Tahoma, used in Windows 7, supports Armenian (previous versions did not). Furthermore, this font differentiates Latin g from Armenian \u0581.\nTwo letters in Armenian (\u0541\u0577) also can resemble the number 2, \u0545 resembles 3, while another (\u057e) sometimes resembles the number 4.\n\n\n*** Hebrew ***\nHebrew spoofing is generally rare. Only three letters from that alphabet can reliably be used: samekh (\u05e1), which sometimes resembles o, vav with diacritic (\u05d5\u05b9), which resembles an i, and heth (\u05d7), which resembles the letter n. Less accurate approximants for some other alphanumerics can also be found, but these are usually only accurate enough to use for the purposes of foreign branding and not for substitution. Furthermore, the Hebrew alphabet is written from right to left and trying to mix it with left-to-right glyphs may cause problems.\n\n\n*** Thai ***\n\nThough the Thai script has historically had a distinct look with numerous loops and small flourishes, modern Thai typography, beginning with Manoptica in 1973 and continuing through IBM Plex in the modern era, has increasingly adopted a simplified style in which Thai characters are represented with glyphs strongly resembling Latin letters. \u0e04 (A), \u0e17 (n), \u0e19 (u), \u0e1a (U), \u0e1b (J), \u0e1e (W), \u0e23 (S), and \u0e25 (a) are among the Thai glyphs that can closely resemble Latin.\n\n\n*** Chinese ***\nThe Chinese language can be problematic for homographs as many characters exist as both traditional (regular script) and simplified Chinese characters. In the .org domain, registering one variant renders the other unavailable to anyone; in .biz a single Chinese-language IDN registration delivers both variants as active domains (which must have the same domain name server and the same registrant). .hk (.\u9999\u6e2f) also adopts this policy.\n\n\n*** Other scripts ***\nOther Unicode scripts in which homographs can be found include Number Forms (Roman numerals), CJK Compatibility and Enclosed CJK Letters and Months (certain abbreviations), Latin (certain digraphs), Currency Symbols, Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols, and Alphabetic Presentation Forms (typographic ligatures).\n\n\n*** Accented characters ***\nTwo names which differ only in an accent on one character may look very similar, particularly when the substitution involves the dotted letter i; the tittle (dot) on the i can be replaced with a diacritic (such as a grave accent or acute accent; both \u00ec and \u00ed are included in most standard character sets and fonts) that can only be detected with close inspection. In most top-level domain registries, w\u00edkipedia.tld (xn--wkipedia-c2a.tld) and wikipedia.tld are two different names which may be held by different registrants. One exception is .ca, where reserving the plain-ASCII version of the domain prevents another registrant from claiming an accented version of the same name.\n\n\n*** Non-displayable characters ***\nUnicode includes many characters which are not displayed by default, such as the zero-width space. In general, ICANN prohibits any domain with these characters from being registered, regardless of TLD.\n\n\n*** Known homograph attacks ***\nIn 2011, an unknown source (registering under the name \"Completely Anonymous\") registered a domain name homographic to television station KBOI-TV's to create a fake news website. The sole purpose of the site was to spread an April Fool's Day joke regarding the Governor of Idaho issuing a supposed ban on the sale of music by Justin Bieber.In September 2017, security researcher Ankit Anubhav discovered an IDN homograph attack where the attackers registered ado\u1e05e.com to deliver the Betabot trojan.\n\n== Defending against the attack ==\n\n\n*** Client-side mitigation ***\nThe simplest defense is for web browsers not to support IDNA or other similar mechanisms, or for users to turn off whatever support their browsers have. That could mean blocking access to IDNA sites, but generally browsers permit access and just display IDNs in Punycode. Either way, this amounts to abandoning non-ASCII domain names.\n\nGoogle Chrome versions 51 and later use an algorithm similar to the one used by Firefox. Previous versions display an IDN only if all of its characters belong to one (and only one) of the user's preferred languages. Chromium and Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge (since 2019) and Opera also use the same algorithm. \nSafari's approach is to render problematic character sets as Punycode. This can be changed by altering the settings in Mac OS X's system files.\nMozilla Firefox versions 22 and later display IDNs if either the TLD prevents homograph attacks by restricting which characters can be used in domain names or labels do not mix scripts for different languages. Otherwise IDNs are displayed in Punycode.\nInternet Explorer versions 7 and later allow IDNs except for labels that mix scripts for different languages. Labels that mix scripts are displayed in Punycode. There are exceptions to locales where ASCII characters are commonly mixed with localized scripts. Internet Explorer 7 was capable of using IDNs, but it imposes restrictions on displaying non-ASCII domain names based on a user-defined list of allowed languages and provides an anti-phishing filter that checks suspicious Web sites against a remote database of known phishing sites.\nOld Microsoft Edge converts all Unicode into Punycode.As an additional defense, Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 2.0 and above, and Opera 9.10 include phishing filters that attempt to alert users when they visit malicious websites. As of April 2017, several browsers (including Chrome, Firefox and Opera) were displaying IDNs consisting purely of Cyrillic characters normally (not as punycode), allowing spoofing attacks. Chrome tightened IDN restrictions in version 59 to prevent this attack.Browser extensions like No Homo-Graphs are available for Google Chrome and Firefox that check whether the user is visiting a website which is a homograph of another domain from a user-defined list.These methods of defense only extend to within a browser. Homographic URLs that house malicious software can still be distributed, without being displayed as Punycode, through e-mail, social networking or other Web sites without being detected until the user actually clicks the link. While the fake link will show in Punycode when it is clicked, by this point the page has already begun loading into the browser and the malicious software may have already been downloaded onto the computer.\n\n\n*** Server-side/registry operator mitigation ***\nThe IDN homographs database is a Python library that allows developers to defend against this using machine learning-based character recognition.ICANN has implemented a policy prohibiting any potential internationalized TLD from choosing letters that could resemble an existing Latin TLD and thus be used for homograph attacks. Proposed IDN TLDs .\u0431\u0433 (Bulgaria), .\u0443\u043a\u0440 (Ukraine) and .\u03b5\u03bb (Greece) have been rejected or stalled because of their perceived resemblance to Latin letters. All three (and Serbian .\u0441\u0440\u0431 and Mongolian .\u043c\u043e\u043d) have later been accepted. Three-letter TLD are considered safer than two-letter TLD, since they are harder to match to normal Latin ISO-3166 country domains; although the potential to match new generic domains remains, such generic domains are far more expensive than registering a second- or third-level domain address, making it cost-prohibitive to try to register a homoglyphic TLD for the sole purpose of making fraudulent domains (which itself would draw ICANN scrutiny).\nThe Russian registry operator Coordination Center for TLD RU only accepts Cyrillic names for the top-level domain .\u0440\u0444, forbidding a mix with Latin or Greek characters. However the problem in .com and other gTLDs remains open.\n\nHow does Thai typography contribute to homograph attacks?",

This makes it possible for attackers to create fake domain names that use Thai characters to mimic legitimate Latin domain names.",
      "context": "IDN homograph attack\n\n==Introduction==\nThe internationalized domain name (IDN) homograph attack is a way a malicious party may deceive computer users about what remote system they are communicating with, by exploiting the fact that many different characters look alike (i.e., they are homographs, hence the term for the attack, although technically homoglyph is the more accurate term for different characters that look alike). For example, a regular user of example.com may be lured to click a link where the Latin character \"a\" is replaced with the Cyrillic character \"\u0430\".\nThis kind of spoofing attack is also known as script spoofing. Unicode incorporates numerous writing systems, and, for a number of reasons, similar-looking characters such as Greek \u039f, Latin O, and Cyrillic \u041e were not assigned the same code. Their incorrect or malicious usage is a possibility for security attacks.\nThe registration of homographic domain names is akin to , in that both forms of attacks use a similar-looking name to a more established domain to fool a user. The major difference is that in typosquatting the perpetrator attracts victims by relying on natural typographical errors commonly made when manually entering a URL, while in homograph spoofing the perpetrator deceives the victims by presenting visually indistinguishable hyperlinks. Indeed, it would be a rare accident for a web user to type, for example, a Cyrillic letter within an otherwise English word such as \"citib\u0430nk\". There are cases in which a registration can be both typosquatting and homograph spoofing; the pairs of l/I, i/j, and 0/O are all both close together on keyboards and, depending on the typeface, may be difficult or impossible to distinguish.\n\n\n\n== Homographs in ASCII ==\nASCII has several characters or pairs of characters that look alike and are known as homographs (or homoglyphs). Spoofing attacks based on these similarities are known as homograph spoofing attacks. For example, 0 (the number) and O (the letter), \"l\" lowercase L, and \"I\" uppercase \"i\".\nIn a typical example of a hypothetical attack, someone could register a domain name that appears almost identical to an existing domain but goes somewhere else.  For example, the domain \"rnicrosoft.com\" begins with \"r\" and \"n\", not \"m\".\nOther examples are G00GLE.COM which looks much like GOOGLE.COM in some fonts.\nUsing a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters, googIe.com (capital i, not small L) looks much like google.com in some fonts.  PayPal was a target of a phishing scam exploiting this, using the domain PayPaI.com. In certain narrow-spaced fonts such as Tahoma (the default in the address bar in Windows XP), placing a c in front of a j, l or i will produce homoglyphs such as cl cj ci (d g a).\n\n== Homographs in internationalized domain names ==\nIn multilingual computer systems, different logical characters may have identical appearances.\nFor example, Unicode character U+0430, Cyrillic small letter a (\"\u0430\"), can look identical to Unicode character U+0061, Latin small letter a, (\"a\") which is the lowercase \"a\" used in English. Hence wikipedi\u0430.org (xn--wikipedi-86g.org; the Cyrillic version) instead of wikipedia.org (the Latin version).\nThe problem arises from the different treatment of the characters in the user's mind and the computer's programming. From the viewpoint of the user, a Cyrillic \"\u0430\" within a Latin string is a Latin \"a\"; there is no difference in the glyphs for these characters in most fonts. However, the computer treats them differently when processing the character string as an identifier. Thus, the user's assumption of a one-to-one correspondence between the visual appearance of a name and the named entity breaks down.\nInternationalized domain names provide a backward-compatible way for domain names to use the full Unicode character set, and this standard is already widely supported. However this system expanded the character repertoire from a few dozen characters in a single alphabet to many thousands of characters in many scripts; this greatly increased the scope for homograph attacks.\nThis opens a rich vein of opportunities for phishing and other varieties of fraud. An attacker could register a domain name that looks just like that of a legitimate website, but in which some of the letters have been replaced by homographs in another alphabet. The attacker could then send e-mail messages purporting to come from the original site, but directing people to the bogus site. The spoof site could then record information such as passwords or account details, while passing traffic through to the real site. The victims may never notice the difference, until suspicious or criminal activity occurs with their accounts.\nIn December 2001 Evgeniy Gabrilovich and Alex Gontmakher, both from Technion, Israel, published a paper titled \"The Homograph Attack\", which described an attack that used Unicode URLs to spoof a website URL. To prove the feasibility of this kind of attack, the researchers successfully registered a variant of the domain name microsoft.com which incorporated Cyrillic characters.\nProblems of this kind were anticipated before IDN was introduced, and guidelines were issued to registries to try to avoid or reduce the problem. For example, it was advised that registries only accept characters from the Latin alphabet and that of their own country, not all of Unicode characters, but this advice was neglected by major TLDs.On February 7, 2005, Slashdot reported that this exploit was disclosed by 3ric Johanson at the hacker conference Shmoocon.  Web browsers supporting IDNA appeared to direct the URL http://www.p\u0430ypal.com/, in which the first a character is replaced by a Cyrillic \u0430, to the site of the well known payment site PayPal, but actually led to a spoofed web site with different content. Popular browsers continued to have problems properly displaying international domain names through April 2017.The following alphabets have characters that can be used for spoofing attacks (please note, these are only the most obvious and common, given artistic license and how much risk the spoofer will take of getting caught; the possibilities are far more numerous than can be listed here):\n\n\n*** Cyrillic ***\nCyrillic is, by far, the most commonly used alphabet for homoglyphs, largely because it contains 11 lowercase glyphs that are identical or nearly identical to Latin counterparts.\nThe Cyrillic letters \u0430, \u0441, \u0435, \u043e, \u0440, \u0445 and \u0443 have optical counterparts in the basic Latin alphabet and look close or identical to a, c, e, o, p, x and y.

Italic type generates more homoglyphs: \u0434\u0442\u043f\u0438 or \u0434\u0442\u043f\u0438 (\u0434\u0442\u043f\u0438 in standard type), resembling dmnu (in some fonts \u0434 can be used, since its italic form resembles a lowercase g; however, in most mainstream fonts, \u0434 instead resembles a partial differential sign, \u2202).\nIf capital letters are counted, \u0410\u0412\u0421\u0415\u041d\u0406\u0408\u041a\u041c\u041e\u0420\u0405\u0422\u0425 can substitute ABCEHIJKMOPSTX, in addition to the capitals for the lowercase Cyrillic homoglyphs.\nCyrillic non-Russian problematic letters are \u0456 and i, \u0458 and j, \u051b and q, \u0455 and s, \u051d and w, \u04ae and Y, while \u0492 and F, \u050c and G bear some resemblance to each other. Cyrillic \u04d3\u0451\u0457\u04e7 can also be used if an IDN itself is being spoofed, to fake \u00e4\u00eb\u00ef\u00f6.\nWhile Komi De (\u0501), shha (\u04bb), palochka (\u04c0)  and izhitsa (\u0475) bear strong resemblance to Latin d, h, l and v, these letters are either rare or archaic and are not widely supported in most standard fonts (they are not included in the WGL-4). Attempting to use them could cause a ransom note effect.\n\n\n*** Greek ***\nFrom the Greek alphabet, only omicron \u03bf and sometimes nu \u03bd appear identical to a Latin alphabet letter in the lowercase used for URLs. Fonts that are in italic type will feature Greek alpha \u03b1 looking like a Latin a.\nThis list increases if close matches are also allowed (such as Greek \u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03b7\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c9\u03c7\u03b3 for eiknptuwxy). Using capital letters, the list expands greatly. Greek \u0391\u0392\u0395\u0397\u0399\u039a\u039c\u039d\u039f\u03a1\u03a4\u03a7\u03a5\u0396 looks identical to Latin ABEHIKMNOPTXYZ. Greek \u0391\u0393\u0392\u0395\u0397\u039a\u039c\u039f\u03a0\u03a1\u03a4\u03a6\u03a7 looks similar to Cyrillic \u0410\u0413\u0412\u0415\u041d\u041a\u041c\u041e\u041f\u0420\u0422\u0424\u0425 (as do Cyrillic \u041b (\u041b) and Greek \u039b in certain geometric sans-serif fonts), Greek letters \u03ba and \u03bf look similar to Cyrillic \u043a and \u043e. Besides this Greek \u03c4, \u03c6 can be similar to Cyrillic \u0442, \u0444 in some fonts, Greek \u03b4 resembles Cyrillic \u0431 in the Serbian alphabet, and the Cyrillic \u0430 also italicizes the same as its Latin counterpart, making it possible to substitute it for alpha or vice versa. The lunate form of sigma, \u03f9\u03f2, resembles both Latin Cc and Cyrillic \u0421\u0441.\nIf an IDN itself is being spoofed, Greek beta \u03b2 can be a substitute for German eszett \u00df in some fonts (and in fact, code page 437 treats them as equivalent), as can Greek end-of-word-variant sigma \u03c2 for \u00e7; accented Greek substitutes \u03cc\u03af\u03ac can usually be used for \u00f3\u00ed\u00e1 in many fonts, with the last of these (alpha) again only resembling a in italic type.\n\n\n*** Armenian ***\nThe Armenian alphabet can also contribute critical characters: several Armenian characters like \u0585, \u0578, \u057d, as well capital \u054f and \u053c are often completely identical to Latin characters in modern fonts, and symbols which similar enough to pass off, such as \u0581\u0570\u0578\u0585\u0566\u057d which look like ghnoqu, \u0575 which resembles j (albeit dotless), and \u0584, which can either resemble p or f depending on the font; \u0561 can resemble Cyrillic \u0448.

That could mean blocking access to IDNA sites, but generally browsers permit access and just display IDNs in Punycode. Either way, this amounts to abandoning non-ASCII domain names.\n\nGoogle Chrome versions 51 and later use an algorithm similar to the one used by Firefox. Previous versions display an IDN only if all of its characters belong to one (and only one) of the user's preferred languages. Chromium and Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge (since 2019) and Opera also use the same algorithm. \nSafari's approach is to render problematic character sets as Punycode. This can be changed by altering the settings in Mac OS X's system files.\nMozilla Firefox versions 22 and later display IDNs if either the TLD prevents homograph attacks by restricting which characters can be used in domain names or labels do not mix scripts for different languages. Otherwise IDNs are displayed in Punycode.\nInternet Explorer versions 7 and later allow IDNs except for labels that mix scripts for different languages. Labels that mix scripts are displayed in Punycode. There are exceptions to locales where ASCII characters are commonly mixed with localized scripts. Internet Explorer 7 was capable of using IDNs, but it imposes restrictions on displaying non-ASCII domain names based on a user-defined list of allowed languages and provides an anti-phishing filter that checks suspicious Web sites against a remote database of known phishing sites.\nOld Microsoft Edge converts all Unicode into Punycode.As an additional defense, Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 2.0 and above, and Opera 9.10 include phishing filters that attempt to alert users when they visit malicious websites. As of April 2017, several browsers (including Chrome, Firefox and Opera) were displaying IDNs consisting purely of Cyrillic characters normally (not as punycode), allowing spoofing attacks. Chrome tightened IDN restrictions in version 59 to prevent this attack.Browser extensions like No Homo-Graphs are available for Google Chrome and Firefox that check whether the user is visiting a website which is a homograph of another domain from a user-defined list.These methods of defense only extend to within a browser. Homographic URLs that house malicious software can still be distributed, without being displayed as Punycode, through e-mail, social networking or other Web sites without being detected until the user actually clicks the link. While the fake link will show in Punycode when it is clicked, by this point the page has already begun loading into the browser and the malicious software may have already been downloaded onto the computer.\n\n\n*** Server-side/registry operator mitigation ***\nThe IDN homographs database is a Python library that allows developers to defend against this using machine learning-based character recognition.ICANN has implemented a policy prohibiting any potential internationalized TLD from choosing letters that could resemble an existing Latin TLD and thus be used for homograph attacks. Proposed IDN TLDs .\u0431\u0433 (Bulgaria), .\u0443\u043a\u0440 (Ukraine) and .\u03b5\u03bb (Greece) have been rejected or stalled because of their perceived resemblance to Latin letters. All three (and Serbian .\u0441\u0440\u0431 and Mongolian .\u043c\u043e\u043d) have later been accepted. Three-letter TLD are considered safer than two-letter TLD, since they are harder to match to normal Latin ISO-3166 country domains; although the potential to match new generic domains remains, such generic domains are far more expensive than registering a second- or third-level domain address, making it cost-prohibitive to try to register a homoglyphic TLD for the sole purpose of making fraudulent domains (which itself would draw ICANN scrutiny).\nThe Russian registry operator Coordination Center for TLD RU only accepts Cyrillic names for the top-level domain .\u0440\u0444, forbidding a mix with Latin or Greek characters. However the problem in .com and other gTLDs remains open."

    "instruction": "Context: IEC 62443\n\n==Introduction==\nIEC 62443 is an international series of standards that address cybersecurity for operational technology in automation and control systems. The standard is divided into different sections and describes both technical and process-related aspects of automation and control systems cybersecurity. \nIt divides the cybersecurity topics by stakeholder category / roles including: \n\nthe operator,\nthe service providers (service providers for integration and for maintenance)\nthe component/system manufacturers.The different roles each follow a risk-based approach to prevent and manage security risks in their activities.\n\n== Structure ==\nIEC 62443 Industrial communication networks - Network and system security series of standards is organized into four parts:\nGeneral: This part covers topics that are common to the entire series.\nPolicies and Procedures: This part focuses on methods and processes associated with IACS security.\nSystem: This part is about requirements at the system level.\nComponents and Requirements: This part provides detailed requirements for IACS products.The following table lists the parts of the IEC 62443 series of standards published to date with their status and title.\n\nPart 2-1: This part of the standard is aimed at operators of automation solutions and defines requirements for how security during the operation of plants is to be considered (see ISO/IEC 27001).\nPart 2-4: This part defines requirements (\"capabilities\") for integrators. These requirements are divided into 12 topics: Assurance, architecture, wireless, security engineering systems, configuration management, remote access, event management and logging, user management, malware protection, patch management, backup & recovery, and project staffing.\nPart 4-1: This part defines how a secure product development process should look like. It is divided into eight areas (\"Practices\"): management of development, definition of security requirements, design of security solutions, secure development, testing of security features, handling of security vulnerabilities, creation and publication of updates and documentation of security features.\nPart 4-2: This part defines technical requirements for products or components. Like the requirements for systems (Section -3-3), the requirements are divided into 12 subject areas and refer to them. In addition to the technical requirements, common component security constraints (CCSC) are defined, which must be met by components to be compliant with IEC 62443-4-2:\nCCSC 1 describes that components must take into account the general security characteristics of the system in which they are used.\nCCSC 2 specifies that the technical requirements that the component cannot meet itself can be met by compensating countermeasures at system level (see IEC 62443-3-3). For this purpose, the countermeasures must be described in the documentation of the component.\nCCSC 3 requires that the \"Least Privilege\" principle is applied in the component.\nCCSC 4 requires that the component is developed and supported by IEC 62443-4-1 compliant development processes.\n\n== Maturity and Security Level ==\nIEC 62443 describes different levels of maturity for processes and technical requirements. The maturity levels for processes are based on the maturity levels from the CMMI framework.\n\n\n*** Maturity Level ***\nBased on CMMI, IEC 62443 describes different maturity levels for processes through so-called \"maturity levels\". To fulfill a certain level of a maturity level, all process-related requirements must always be practiced during product development or integration, i.e. the selection of only individual criteria (\"cherry picking\") is not standard-compliant.\nThe maturity levels are described as follows:\n\nMaturity Level 1 - Initial: Product suppliers usually carry out product development ad hoc and often undocumented (or not fully documented).\nMaturity Level 2 - Managed: The product supplier is able to manage the development of a product according to written guidelines. It must be demonstrated that the personnel who carry out the process have the appropriate expertise, are trained and/or follow written procedures. The processes are repeatable.\nMaturity Level 3 - Defined (practiced): The process is repeatable throughout the supplier's organization. The processes have been practiced and there is evidence that this has been done.\nMaturity Level 4 - Improving: Product suppliers use appropriate process metrics to monitor the effectiveness and performance of the process and demonstrate continuous improvement in these areas.\n\n\n*** Security Level ***\nTechnical requirements for systems (IEC 62443-3-3) and products (IEC 62443-4-2) are evaluated in the standard by four so-called Security Levels (SL). The different levels indicate the resistance against different classes of attackers. The standard emphasizes that the levels should be evaluated per technical requirement (see IEC 62443-1-1) and are not suitable for the general classification of products.\nThe levels are:\n\nSecurity Level 0: No special requirement or protection required.\nSecurity Level 1: Protection against unintentional or accidental misuse.\nSecurity Level 2: Protection against intentional misuse by simple means with few resources, general skills and low motivation.\nSecurity Level 3: Protection against intentional misuse by sophisticated means with moderate resources, IACS-specific knowledge and moderate motivation.\nSecurity Level 4: Protection against intentional misuse using sophisticated means with extensive resources, IACS-specific knowledge and high motivation.\n\n== Concepts ==\nThe standard explains various basic principles that should be considered for all roles in all activities.\n\n\n*** Defense in depth ***\nDefense in Depth is a concept in which several levels of security (defense) are distributed throughout the system. The goal is to provide redundancy in case a security measure fails or a vulnerability is exploited.\n\n\n*** Zones and conduits ***\nZones divide a system into homogeneous zones by grouping the (logical or physical) assets with common security requirements. The security requirements are defined by Security Level (SL). The level required for a zone is determined by the risk analysis.\nZones have boundaries that separate the elements inside the zone from those outside. Information moves within and between zones. Zones can be divided into sub-zones that define different security levels (Security Level) and thus enable defense-in-depth.\nConduits group the elements that allow communication between two zones. They provide security functions that enable secure communication and allow the coexistence of zones with different security levels.\n\n== Certification to standards ==\nProcesses, systems and products used in industrial automation environments can be certified according to IEC 62443. Many testing, inspection, and certification (TIC) companies offer product and process certifications based on IEC 62443. By accrediting according to the ISO/IEC 17000 series of standards, the companies share a single, consistent set of certification requirements for IEC 62443 certifications which elevates the usefulness of the resulting certificates of conformance.\n\n\n*** Accredited certification schemes ***\nIEC 62443 certification schemes have been established by several global testing, inspection, and certification (TIC) companies. The schemes are based on the referenced standards and define test methods, surveillance audit policies, public documentation policies, and other specific aspects of their program. Cybersecurity certification programs for IEC 62443 standards are being offered globally by many recognized Certification Bodies (CB), including Bureau Veritas, Intertek, SGS-T\u00dcV Saar, T\u00dcV Nord, T\u00dcV Rheinland, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD and UL.\nA global infrastructure of national accreditation bodies (AB) ensures consistent evaluation of the IEC 62443. The ABs operate per the requirements of ISO/IEC 17011, a standard that contains requirements for the competence, consistency, and impartiality of accreditation bodies when accrediting conformity assessment bodies. ABs are members of the IAF for work in management systems, products, services, and personnel accreditation or the ILAC for laboratory accreditation. A Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) between ABs will ensure global recognition of accredited CBs.\nTIC companies are accredited by an AB to provide inspection according to the ISO/IEC 17020, testing laboratories according to ISO/IEC 17025 and certification of products, processes, and services according to ISO/IEC 17065.\n\n\n*** IECEE CB Scheme ***\nThe IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components (IECEE) Certification Body Scheme (CB Scheme) is a multilateral agreement that facilitates market access for manufacturers of electrical and electronic products. Under the CB Scheme processes, products and systems can be certified according to IEC 62443.\nThe origin of the CB Scheme comes from the CEE (former European \"Commission for Conformity Testing of Electrical Equipment\") and was integrated into the IEC in 1985. Currently, 54 Member Bodies are in the IECEE, 88 NCBs (National Certification Bodies), and 534 CB Test Laboratories (CBTL). In the field of product certification, this procedure is used to reduce the complexity in the approval procedure for manufacturers of products tested and certified according to harmonized standards. A product that has been tested by a CBTL (certified testing laboratory) according to a harmonized standard such as the IEC 62443, can use the CB report as a basis for a later national certification and approval such as GS, PSE, CCC, NOM, GOST/R, BSMI.\n\n\n*** ISCI ISASecure ***\nThe ISA Security Compliance Institute (ISCI), a subsidiary of the ISA, created a proprietary conformity assessment scheme aligned with the IEC 62443 standards. This scheme is used to certify industrial automation control systems, components and processes. Companies certifying to the ISASecure certification scheme are accredited to the ISASecure technical readiness requirements and have their Test Laboratories and Certification Body accredited to the ISO 17025 and ISO 17065 standards, respectively.\nThe ISCI offers multiple certifications under the ISASecure brand:\n\nSSA (System Security Assurance) certification of systems according to IEC 62443-3-3 and IEC 62443-4-1\nCSA (Component Security Assurance) certification of automation components according to IEC 62443-4-1 and IEC 62443-4-2\nSDLA (Secure Development Lifecycle Assurance) certification of automation systems development organizations according to the IEC 62443-4-1\nEDSA (Embedded Device Security Assurance) certification of components based on the IEC 62443-4-2. This certification was offered in 2010 and phased out when the IEC 62443-4-2 standard was formally approved and published in 2018.\nAnswer this question: What is the role of Accredited Certification Schemes in IEC 62443?",

For this purpose, the countermeasures must be described in the documentation of the component.\nCCSC 3 requires that the \"Least Privilege\" principle is applied in the component.\nCCSC 4 requires that the component is developed and supported by IEC 62443-4-1 compliant development processes.\n\n== Maturity and Security Level ==\nIEC 62443 describes different levels of maturity for processes and technical requirements. The maturity levels for processes are based on the maturity levels from the CMMI framework.\n\n\n*** Maturity Level ***\nBased on CMMI, IEC 62443 describes different maturity levels for processes through so-called \"maturity levels\". To fulfill a certain level of a maturity level, all process-related requirements must always be practiced during product development or integration, i.e. the selection of only individual criteria (\"cherry picking\") is not standard-compliant.\nThe maturity levels are described as follows:\n\nMaturity Level 1 - Initial: Product suppliers usually carry out product development ad hoc and often undocumented (or not fully documented).\nMaturity Level 2 - Managed: The product supplier is able to manage the development of a product according to written guidelines. It must be demonstrated that the personnel who carry out the process have the appropriate expertise, are trained and/or follow written procedures. The processes are repeatable.\nMaturity Level 3 - Defined (practiced): The process is repeatable throughout the supplier's organization. The processes have been practiced and there is evidence that this has been done.\nMaturity Level 4 - Improving: Product suppliers use appropriate process metrics to monitor the effectiveness and performance of the process and demonstrate continuous improvement in these areas.\n\n\n*** Security Level ***\nTechnical requirements for systems (IEC 62443-3-3) and products (IEC 62443-4-2) are evaluated in the standard by four so-called Security Levels (SL). The different levels indicate the resistance against different classes of attackers. The standard emphasizes that the levels should be evaluated per technical requirement (see IEC 62443-1-1) and are not suitable for the general classification of products.\nThe levels are:\n\nSecurity Level 0: No special requirement or protection required.\nSecurity Level 1: Protection against unintentional or accidental misuse.\nSecurity Level 2: Protection against intentional misuse by simple means with few resources, general skills and low motivation.\nSecurity Level 3: Protection against intentional misuse by sophisticated means with moderate resources, IACS-specific knowledge and moderate motivation.\nSecurity Level 4: Protection against intentional misuse using sophisticated means with extensive resources, IACS-specific knowledge and high motivation.\n\n== Concepts ==\nThe standard explains various basic principles that should be considered for all roles in all activities.\n\n\n*** Defense in depth ***\nDefense in Depth is a concept in which several levels of security (defense) are distributed throughout the system. The goal is to provide redundancy in case a security measure fails or a vulnerability is exploited.\n\n\n*** Zones and conduits ***\nZones divide a system into homogeneous zones by grouping the (logical or physical) assets with common security requirements. The security requirements are defined by Security Level (SL). The level required for a zone is determined by the risk analysis.\nZones have boundaries that separate the elements inside the zone from those outside. Information moves within and between zones. Zones can be divided into sub-zones that define different security levels (Security Level) and thus enable defense-in-depth.\nConduits group the elements that allow communication between two zones. They provide security functions that enable secure communication and allow the coexistence of zones with different security levels.\n\n== Certification to standards ==\nProcesses, systems and products used in industrial automation environments can be certified according to IEC 62443. Many testing, inspection, and certification (TIC) companies offer product and process certifications based on IEC 62443. By accrediting according to the ISO/IEC 17000 series of standards, the companies share a single, consistent set of certification requirements for IEC 62443 certifications which elevates the usefulness of the resulting certificates of conformance.\n\n\n*** Accredited certification schemes ***\nIEC 62443 certification schemes have been established by several global testing, inspection, and certification (TIC) companies. The schemes are based on the referenced standards and define test methods, surveillance audit policies, public documentation policies, and other specific aspects of their program. Cybersecurity certification programs for IEC 62443 standards are being offered globally by many recognized Certification Bodies (CB), including Bureau Veritas, Intertek, SGS-T\u00dcV Saar, T\u00dcV Nord, T\u00dcV Rheinland, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD and UL.\nA global infrastructure of national accreditation bodies (AB) ensures consistent evaluation of the IEC 62443. The ABs operate per the requirements of ISO/IEC 17011, a standard that contains requirements for the competence, consistency, and impartiality of accreditation bodies when accrediting conformity assessment bodies. ABs are members of the IAF for work in management systems, products, services, and personnel accreditation or the ILAC for laboratory accreditation. A Multilateral Recognition Arrangement (MLA) between ABs will ensure global recognition of accredited CBs.\nTIC companies are accredited by an AB to provide inspection according to the ISO/IEC 17020, testing laboratories according to ISO/IEC 17025 and certification of products, processes, and services according to ISO/IEC 17065.\n\n\n*** IECEE CB Scheme ***\nThe IEC System for Conformity Assessment Schemes for Electrotechnical Equipment and Components (IECEE) Certification Body Scheme (CB Scheme) is a multilateral agreement that facilitates market access for manufacturers of electrical and electronic products. Under the CB Scheme processes, products and systems can be certified according to IEC 62443.\nThe origin of the CB Scheme comes from the CEE (former European \"Commission for Conformity Testing of Electrical Equipment\") and was integrated into the IEC in 1985. Currently, 54 Member Bodies are in the IECEE, 88 NCBs (National Certification Bodies), and 534 CB Test Laboratories (CBTL). In the field of product certification, this procedure is used to reduce the complexity in the approval procedure for manufacturers of products tested and certified according to harmonized standards. A product that has been tested by a CBTL (certified testing laboratory) according to a harmonized standard such as the IEC 62443, can use the CB report as a basis for a later national certification and approval such as GS, PSE, CCC, NOM, GOST/R, BSMI.\n\n\n*** ISCI ISASecure ***\nThe ISA Security Compliance Institute (ISCI), a subsidiary of the ISA, created a proprietary conformity assessment scheme aligned with the IEC 62443 standards. This scheme is used to certify industrial automation control systems, components and processes. Companies certifying to the ISASecure certification scheme are accredited to the ISASecure technical readiness requirements and have their Test Laboratories and Certification Body accredited to the ISO 17025 and ISO 17065 standards, respectively.\nThe ISCI offers multiple certifications under the ISASecure brand:\n\nSSA (System Security Assurance) certification of systems according to IEC 62443-3-3 and IEC 62443-4-1\nCSA (Component Security Assurance) certification of automation components according to IEC 62443-4-1 and IEC 62443-4-2\nSDLA (Secure Development Lifecycle Assurance) certification of automation systems development organizations according to the IEC 62443-4-1\nEDSA (Embedded Device Security Assurance) certification of components based on the IEC 62443-4-2. This certification was offered in 2010 and phased out when the IEC 62443-4-2 standard was formally approved and published in 2018."

    "instruction": "Spam email delivery\n\n==Introduction==\nSince Internet users and system administrators have deployed a vast array of techniques to block, filter, or otherwise banish spam from users' mailboxes and almost all Internet service providers forbid the use of their services to send spam or to operate spam-support services, special techniques are employed to deliver spam emails. Both commercial firms and volunteers run subscriber services dedicated to blocking or filtering spam.\n\n== Webmail ==\nA common practice of spammers is to create accounts on free web-mail services, such as Hotmail, to send spam or to receive e-mailed responses from potential customers. Because of the amount of mail sent by spammers, they require several e-mail accounts, and use web bots to automate the creation of these accounts.\nIn an effort to cut down on this abuse, many of these services have adopted a system called Captcha: users attempting to create a new account are presented with a graphic of a word, which uses a strange font, on a difficult to read background. Humans are able to read these graphics, and are required to enter the word to complete the application for a new account, while computers are unable to get accurate readings of the words using standard OCR techniques. Blind users of captchas typically get an audio sample.\nSpammers have, however, found a means of circumventing this measure. Reportedly, they have set up sites offering free pornography: to get access to the site, a user displays a graphic from one of these webmail sites, and must enter the word. Spammers can equip pornography-carrying emails (and any email type in general) to enter searches into the search engine so a larger number of windows can be opened. For example, by simply inputting the word \"porn\" into Google's search engine, spam messages can open up several sites related to the word \"porn.\" These messages make it very hard to trace the spammer as the search word(s) make it appear as if the spam receiver entered the word themselves. The search word will not appear in the recent searches and the windows will not appear in the History page unless a link is clicked on the site. Some porn-emails will link to specific sites and ask for the user to create an account and enter payment information. Once the user has successfully created the account, the user gains access to the pornographic material. Furthermore, standard image processing techniques work well against many Captchas.\n\n== Third-party computers ==\nEarly on, spammers discovered that if they sent large quantities of spam directly from their ISP accounts, recipients would complain and ISP's would shut their accounts down. Thus, one of the basic techniques of sending spam has become to send it from someone else's computer and network connection. By doing this, spammers protect themselves in several ways: they hide their tracks, get others' systems to do most of the work of delivering messages, and direct the efforts of investigators towards the other systems rather than the spammers themselves. Spammers may equip messages so they put in selected searches in search engines (I.E. Google) to open a greater amount of search windows. As long as the server's computer is open and on, the range of windows can increase. The increasing broadband usage gave rise to a great number of computers that are online as long as they are turned on, and whose owners do not always take steps to protect them from malware.  A botnet consisting of several hundred compromised machines can effortlessly churn out millions of messages per day.  This also complicates the tracing of spammers.\n\n\n*** Open relays ***\nIn the 1990s, the most common way spammers did this was to use open mail relays. An open relay is an MTA, or mail server, which is configured to pass along messages sent to it from any location, to any recipient. In the original SMTP mail architecture, this was the default behavior: a user could send mail to practically any mail server, which would pass it along towards the intended recipient's mail server.The standard was written in an era before spamming when there were few hosts on the internet, and those on the internet abide by a certain level of conduct. While this cooperative, and open approach was useful in ensuring that mail was delivered, it was vulnerable to abuse by spammers. Spammers could forward batches of spam through open relays, leaving the job of delivering the messages up to the relays.\nIn response, mail system administrators concerned about spam began to demand that other mail operators configure MTAs to cease being open relays. The first DNSBLs, such as MAPS RBL and the now-defunct ORBS, aimed chiefly at allowing mail sites to refuse mail from known open relays. By 2003 less than 1% of corporate mail servers were available as open relays, down from 91% in 1997.\n\n\n*** Open proxies ***\nWithin a few years, open relays became rare and spammers resorted to other tactics, most prominently the use of open proxies. A proxy is a network service for making indirect connections to other network services. The client connects to the proxy and instructs it to connect to a server. The server perceives an incoming connection from the proxy, not the original client. Proxies have many purposes, including Web-page caching, protection of privacy, filtering of Web content, and selectively bypassing firewalls.An open proxy is one which will create connections for any client to any server, without authentication. Like open relays, open proxies were once relatively common, as many administrators did not see a need to restrict access to them.\nA spammer can direct an open proxy to connect to a mail server, and send spam through it. The mail server logs a connection from the proxy\u2014not the spammer's own computer. This provides an even greater degree of concealment for the spammer than an open relay, since most relays log the client address in the headers of messages they pass. Open proxies have also been used to conceal the sources of attacks against other services besides mail, such as Web sites or IRC servers. As spam from proxies and other \"spammable\" resources grew, DNSBL operators started listing their IP addresses, as well as open relays.\n\n\n*** Web scripts ***\nBesides relays and proxies, spammers have used other insecure services to send spam. One example is FormMail.pl, a CGI script to allow Web-site users to send e-mail feedback from an HTML form. Several versions of this program, and others like it, allowed the user to redirect e-mail to arbitrary addresses. Spam sent through open FormMail scripts is frequently marked by the program's characteristic opening line: \"Below is the result of your feedback form.\"\nThe \u2018tell a friend about this page\u2019 features some websites offer may be vulnerable by design in that they allow the visitor to add their message to the email that is sent. Consequently, such scripts are often abused to send spam, particularly so-called 419 scams.\n\n\n*** Spammer viruses ***\nIn 2003, spam investigators saw a radical change in the way spammers sent spam. Rather than searching the global network for exploitable services such as open relays and proxies, spammers began creating \"services\" of their own. By commissioning computer viruses designed to deploy proxies and other spam-sending tools, spammers could harness hundreds of thousands of end-user computers.  The widespread change from Windows 9x to Windows XP for many home computers, which started in early 2002 and was well under way by 2003, greatly accelerated the use of home computers to act as remotely controlled spam proxies.  The original version of Windows XP as well as XP-SP1 had several major vulnerabilities that allowed the machines to be compromised over a network connection without requiring actions on the part of the user or owner.Most of the major Windows e-mail viruses of 2003, including the Sobig and Mimail virus families, functioned as spammer viruses: viruses designed expressly to make infected computers available as spamming tools.Besides sending spam, spammer viruses serve spammers in other ways. Beginning in July 2003, spammers started using some of these same viruses to perpetrate distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks upon DNSBLs and other anti-spam resources. Although this was by no means the first time that illegal attacks have been used against anti-spam sites, it was perhaps the first wave of effective attacks.\nIn August of that year, engineering company Osirusoft ceased providing DNSBL mirrors of the SPEWS and other blocklists, after several days of unceasing attack from virus-infected hosts. The very next month, DNSBL operator Monkeys.com succumbed to the attacks as well. Other DNSBL operators, such as Spamhaus, have deployed global mirroring and other anti-DDoS methods to resist these attacks.\nZombie networks are particularly active in North America where about half of the Internet users are on a broadband connection and many leave their computers on all the time. In January, 2008, 8% of all e-mail spam was sent by the Storm botnet, created by the Storm Worm, first released in January, 2007. It is estimated that as many as 1 million or more computers have been infected and their owners are unwilling and unknowing participants. In the 3rd quarter of 2008 almost one in every 400 email messages contained a dangerous attachment, designed to infect the recipient's computer, eight times as often as in the previous quarter.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question.

The DCII standard was originally developed in 1997 by General Instrument, which then became the Home and Network Mobility division of Motorola, then bought by Google in Aug 2011, and lastly became the Home portion of the division to Arris.The original attempt for a North American digital signal encryption and compression standard was DigiCipher 1, which was used most notably in the now-defunct PrimeStar medium-power direct broadcast satellite (DBS) system during the early 1990s. The DCII standard predates wide acceptance of DVB-based digital terrestrial television compression (although not cable or satellite DVB) and therefore is incompatible with the DVB standard.\nApproximately 70% of newer first-generation digital cable networks in North America use the 4DTV/DigiCipher 2 format. The use of DCII is most prevalent in North American digital cable television set-top boxes. DCII is also used on Motorola's 4DTV digital satellite television tuner and Shaw Direct's DBS receiver.\nThe DigiCipher 2 encryption standard was reverse engineered in 2016.\n\n\n\n== Technical specifications ==\nDigiCipher II uses QPSK and BPSK at the same time. The primary difference between DigiCipher 2 and DVB lies in how each standard handles SI metadata, or System Information, where DVB reserves packet identifiers from 16 to 31 for metadata, DigiCipher reserves only packet identifier 8187 for its  master guide table which acts as a look-up table for all other metadata tables. DigiCipher 2 also extends the MPEG program number that is assigned for each service in a transport stream with the concept of a virtual channel number, whereas the DVB system never defined this type of remapping preferring to use a registry of network identifiers to further differentiate program numbers from those used in other transport streams.  There are also private non-standard additions to DVB that add virtual channel remapping using logical channel numbers. Also unlike DVB, all text used in descriptors can be compressed using standard Huffman coding which saves on broadcast bandwidth and loading times. DigiCipher II uses Dolby Digital AC-3 audio for all channels, although MPEG-1 Level 2 audio is not supported.\n\nQuestion: How does DigiCipher 2 extend the MPEG program number that is assigned for each service in a transport stream?\n\nAnswer:",

The DCII standard predates wide acceptance of DVB-based digital terrestrial television compression (although not cable or satellite DVB) and therefore is incompatible with the DVB standard.\nApproximately 70% of newer first-generation digital cable networks in North America use the 4DTV/DigiCipher 2 format. The use of DCII is most prevalent in North American digital cable television set-top boxes. DCII is also used on Motorola's 4DTV digital satellite television tuner and Shaw Direct's DBS receiver.\nThe DigiCipher 2 encryption standard was reverse engineered in 2016.\n\n\n\n== Technical specifications ==\nDigiCipher II uses QPSK and BPSK at the same time. The primary difference between DigiCipher 2 and DVB lies in how each standard handles SI metadata, or System Information, where DVB reserves packet identifiers from 16 to 31 for metadata, DigiCipher reserves only packet identifier 8187 for its  master guide table which acts as a look-up table for all other metadata tables. DigiCipher 2 also extends the MPEG program number that is assigned for each service in a transport stream with the concept of a virtual channel number, whereas the DVB system never defined this type of remapping preferring to use a registry of network identifiers to further differentiate program numbers from those used in other transport streams.  There are also private non-standard additions to DVB that add virtual channel remapping using logical channel numbers. Also unlike DVB, all text used in descriptors can be compressed using standard Huffman coding which saves on broadcast bandwidth and loading times. DigiCipher II uses Dolby Digital AC-3 audio for all channels, although MPEG-1 Level 2 audio is not supported."

    "instruction": "Data remanence\n\n==Introduction==\nData remanence is the residual representation of digital data that remains even after attempts have been made to remove or erase the data.  This residue may result from data being left intact by a nominal file deletion operation, by reformatting of storage media that does not remove data previously written to the media, or through physical properties of the storage media that allow previously written data to be recovered.  Data remanence may make inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information possible should the storage media be released into an uncontrolled environment (e.g., thrown in the bin (trash) or lost). \nVarious techniques have been developed to counter data remanence.  These techniques are classified as clearing,  purging/sanitizing, or destruction.  Specific methods include overwriting, degaussing, encryption, and media destruction.\nEffective application of countermeasures can be complicated by several factors, including media that are inaccessible, media that cannot effectively be erased, advanced storage systems that maintain histories of data throughout the data's life cycle, and persistence of data in memory that is typically considered volatile.\nSeveral standards exist for the secure removal of data and the elimination of data remanence.\n\n\n\n== Causes ==\nMany operating systems, file managers, and other software provide a facility where a file is not immediately deleted when the user requests that action.  Instead, the file is moved to a holding area (i.e. the \"trash\"), making it easy for  the user to undo a mistake.  Similarly, many software products automatically create backup copies of files that are being edited, to allow the user to restore the original version, or to recover from a possible crash (autosave feature).\nEven when an explicit deleted file retention facility is not provided or when the user does not use it, operating systems do not actually remove the contents of a file when it is deleted unless they are aware that explicit erasure commands are required, like on a solid-state drive.  (In such cases, the operating system will issue the Serial ATA TRIM command or the SCSI UNMAP command to let the drive know to no longer maintain the deleted data.)  Instead, they simply remove the file's entry from the file system directory because this requires less work and is therefore faster, and the contents of the file\u2014the actual data\u2014remain on the storage medium.  The data will remain there until the operating system reuses the space for new data.  In some systems, enough filesystem metadata are also left behind to enable easy undeletion by commonly available utility software.  Even when undelete has become impossible, the data, until it has been overwritten, can be read by software that reads disk sectors directly. Computer forensics often employs such software.\nLikewise, reformatting, repartitioning, or reimaging a system is unlikely to write to every area of the disk, though all will cause the disk to appear empty or, in the case of reimaging, empty except for the files present in the image, to most software.\nFinally, even when the storage media is overwritten, physical properties of the media may permit recovery of the previous contents. In most cases however, this recovery is not possible by just reading from the storage device in the usual way, but requires using laboratory techniques such as disassembling the device and directly accessing/reading from its components.\nThe section on complications gives further explanations for causes of data remanence.\n\n== Countermeasures ==\n\nThere are three levels commonly recognized for eliminating remnant data:\n\n\n*** Clearing ***\nClearing is the removal of sensitive data from storage devices in such a way that there is assurance that the data may not be reconstructed using normal system functions or software file/data recovery utilities. The data may still be recoverable, but not without special laboratory techniques.Clearing is typically an administrative protection against accidental disclosure within an organization.  For example, before a hard drive is re-used within an organization, its contents may be cleared to prevent their accidental disclosure to the next user.\n\n\n*** Purging ***\nPurging or sanitizing is the physical rewrite of sensitive data from a system or storage device with the intent that the data cannot be recovered.  Purging, proportional to the sensitivity of the data, is generally done before releasing media beyond control, such as before discarding old media, or moving media to a computer with different security requirements.\n\n\n*** Destruction ***\nThe storage media is made unusable for conventional equipment.  Effectiveness of destroying the media varies by medium and method.  Depending on recording density of the media, and/or the destruction technique, this may leave data recoverable by laboratory methods.  Conversely, destruction using appropriate techniques is the most secure method of preventing retrieval.\n\n== Specific methods ==\n\n\n*** Overwriting ***\nA common method used to counter data remanence is to overwrite the storage media with new data.  This is often called wiping or shredding a file or disk, by analogy to common methods of destroying print media, although the mechanism bears no similarity to these.  Because such a method can often be implemented in software alone, and may be able to selectively target only part of the media, it is a popular, low-cost option for some applications.  Overwriting is generally an acceptable method of clearing, as long as the media is writable and not damaged.\nThe simplest overwrite technique writes the same data everywhere\u2014often just a pattern of all zeros.  At a minimum, this will prevent the data from being retrieved simply by reading from the media again using standard system functions.\nIn an attempt to counter more advanced data recovery techniques, specific overwrite patterns and multiple passes have often been prescribed.  These may be generic patterns intended to eradicate any trace signatures, for example, the seven-pass pattern: 0xF6, 0x00, 0xFF, random, 0x00, 0xFF, random; sometimes erroneously attributed to the US standard DOD 5220.22-M.\nOne challenge with overwriting is that some areas of the disk may be inaccessible, due to media degradation or other errors.  Software overwrite may also be problematic in high-security environments, which require stronger controls on data commingling than can be provided by the software in use.  The use of advanced storage technologies may also make file-based overwrite ineffective (see the discussion below under Complications).\nThere are specialized machines and software that are capable of doing overwriting. The software can sometimes be a standalone operating system specifically designed for data destruction. There are also machines specifically designed to wipe hard drives to the department of defense specifications DOD 5220.22-M.\n\n\n**** Feasibility of recovering overwritten data ****\nPeter Gutmann investigated data recovery from nominally overwritten media in the mid-1990s.  He suggested magnetic force microscopy may be able to recover such data, and developed specific patterns, for specific drive technologies, designed to counter such.  These patterns have come to be known as the Gutmann method.\nDaniel Feenberg, an economist at the private National Bureau of Economic Research, claims that the chances of overwritten data being recovered from a modern hard drive amount to \"urban legend\". He also points to the \"18+1\u20442-minute gap\" Rose Mary Woods created on a tape of Richard Nixon discussing the Watergate break-in. Erased information in the gap has not been recovered, and Feenberg claims doing so would be an easy task compared to recovery of a modern high density digital signal.\nAs of November 2007, the United States Department of Defense considers overwriting acceptable for clearing magnetic media within the same security area/zone, but not as a sanitization method.  Only degaussing or physical destruction is acceptable for the latter.On the other hand, according to the 2014 NIST Special Publication 800-88 Rev. 1 (p. 7): \"For storage devices containing magnetic media, a single overwrite pass with a fixed pattern such as binary zeros typically hinders recovery of data even if state of the art laboratory techniques are applied to attempt to retrieve the data.\" An analysis by Wright et al. of recovery techniques, including magnetic force microscopy, also concludes that a single wipe is all that is required for modern drives. They point out that the long time required for multiple wipes \"has created a situation where many organizations ignore the issue [altogether] \u2013 resulting in data leaks and loss.\"\n\n\n*** Degaussing ***\nDegaussing is the removal or reduction of a magnetic field of a disk or drive, using a device called a degausser that has been designed for the media being erased.  Applied to magnetic media, degaussing may purge an entire media element quickly and effectively.\nDegaussing often renders hard disks inoperable, as it erases low-level formatting that is only done at the factory during manufacturing.  In some cases, it is possible to return the drive to a functional state by having it serviced at the manufacturer. However, some modern degaussers use such a strong magnetic pulse that the motor that spins the platters may be destroyed in the degaussing process, and servicing may not be cost-effective. Degaussed computer tape such as DLT can generally be reformatted and reused with standard consumer hardware.\nIn some high-security environments, one may be required to use a degausser that has been approved for the task.  For example, in US government and military jurisdictions, one may be required to use a degausser from the NSA's \"Evaluated Products List\".\n\n\n*** Encryption ***\nEncrypting data before it is stored on the media may mitigate concerns about data remanence.  If the decryption key is strong and carefully controlled, it may effectively make any data on the media unrecoverable.  Even if the key is stored on the media, it may prove easier or quicker to overwrite just the key, versus the entire disk. This process is called crypto-shredding.\nEncryption may be done on a file-by-file basis, or on the whole disk. Cold boot attacks are one of the few possible methods for subverting a full-disk encryption method, as there is no possibility of storing the plain text key in an unencrypted section of the medium. See the section Complications: Data in RAM for further discussion.\nOther side-channel attacks (such as keyloggers, acquisition of a written note containing the decryption key, or rubber-hose cryptanalysis) may offer a greater chance of success, but do not rely on weaknesses in the cryptographic method employed. As such, their relevance for this article is minor.\n\n\n*** Media destruction ***\n\nThorough destruction of the underlying storage media is the most certain way to counter data remanence.  However, the process is generally time-consuming, cumbersome, and may require extremely thorough methods, as even a small fragment of the media may contain large amounts of data.\nSpecific destruction techniques include:\n\nPhysically breaking the media apart (e.g., by grinding or shredding)\nChemically altering the media into a non-readable, non-reverse-constructible state (e.g., through incineration or exposure to caustic/corrosive chemicals)\nPhase transition (e.g., liquefaction or vaporization of a solid disk)\nFor magnetic media, raising its temperature above the Curie point\nFor many electric/electronic volatile and non-volatile storage media, exposure to electromagnetic fields greatly exceeding safe operational specifications (e.g., high-voltage electric current or high-amplitude microwave or ionizing radiation)\n\n== Complications ==\n\n\n*** Inaccessible media areas ***\nStorage media may have areas which become inaccessible by normal means.  For example, magnetic disks may develop new bad sectors after data has been written, and tapes require inter-record gaps. Modern hard disks often feature reallocation of marginal sectors or tracks, automated in a way that the operating system would not need to work with it. The problem is especially significant in solid-state drives (SSDs) that rely on relatively large relocated bad block tables. Attempts to counter data remanence by overwriting may not be successful in such situations, as data remnants may persist in such nominally inaccessible areas.\n\n\n*** Advanced storage systems ***\nData storage systems with more sophisticated features may make overwrite ineffective, especially on a per-file basis. For example, journaling file systems increase the integrity of data by recording write operations in multiple locations, and applying transaction-like semantics; on such systems, data remnants may exist in locations \"outside\" the nominal file storage location.  Some file systems also implement copy-on-write or built-in revision control, with the intent that writing to a file never overwrites data in-place.  Furthermore, technologies such as RAID and anti-fragmentation techniques may result in file data being written to multiple locations, either by design (for fault tolerance), or as data remnants.\nWear leveling can also defeat data erasure, by relocating blocks between the time when they are originally written and the time when they are overwritten.  For this reason, some security protocols tailored to operating systems or other software featuring automatic wear leveling recommend conducting a free-space wipe of a given drive and then copying many small, easily identifiable \"junk\" files or files containing other nonsensitive data to fill as much of that drive as possible, leaving only the amount of free space necessary for satisfactory operation of system hardware and software.  As storage and system demands grow, the \"junk data\" files can be deleted as necessary to free up space; even if the deletion of \"junk data\" files is not secure, their initial nonsensitivity reduces to near zero the consequences of recovery of data remanent from them.\n\n\n*** Optical media ***\nAs optical media are not magnetic, they are not erased by conventional degaussing. Write-once optical media (CD-R, DVD-R, etc.) also cannot be purged by overwriting.  Rewritable optical media, such as CD-RW and DVD-RW, may be receptive to overwriting. Methods for successfully sanitizing optical discs include delaminating or abrading the metallic data layer, shredding, incinerating, destructive electrical arcing (as by exposure to microwave energy), and submersion in a polycarbonate solvent (e.g., acetone).\n\n\n*** Data on solid-state drives ***\nResearch from the Center for Magnetic Recording and Research, University of California, San Diego has uncovered problems inherent in erasing data stored on solid-state drives (SSDs). Researchers discovered three problems with file storage on SSDs:\nFirst, built-in commands are effective, but manufacturers sometimes implement them incorrectly. Second, overwriting the entire visible address space of an SSD twice is usually, but not always, sufficient to sanitize the drive. Third, none of the existing hard drive-oriented techniques for individual file sanitization are effective on SSDs.:\u200a1\u200a \nSolid-state drives, which are flash-based, differ from hard-disk drives in two ways: first, in the way data is stored; and second, in the way the algorithms are used to manage and access that data. These differences can be exploited to recover previously erased data. SSDs maintain a layer of indirection between the logical addresses used by computer systems to access data and the internal addresses that identify physical storage. This layer of indirection hides idiosyncratic media interfaces and enhances SSD performance, reliability, and lifespan (see wear leveling), but it can also produce copies of the data that are invisible to the user and that a sophisticated attacker could recover. For sanitizing entire disks, sanitize commands built into the SSD hardware have been found to be effective when implemented correctly, and software-only techniques for sanitizing entire disks have been found to work most, but not all, of the time.:\u200asection 5\u200a In testing, none of the  software techniques were effective for sanitizing individual files. These included well-known algorithms such as the Gutmann method, US DoD 5220.22-M, RCMP TSSIT OPS-II, Schneier 7 Pass, and Secure Empty Trash on macOS (a feature included in versions OS X 10.3-10.9).:\u200asection 5\u200aThe TRIM feature in many SSD devices, if properly implemented, will eventually erase data after it is deleted, but the process can take some time, typically several minutes. Many older operating systems do not support this feature, and not all combinations of drives and operating systems work.\n\n\n*** Data in RAM ***\nData remanence has been observed in static random-access memory (SRAM), which is typically considered volatile (i.e., the contents degrade with loss of external power).  In one study, data retention was observed even at room temperature.Data remanence has also been observed in dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). Modern DRAM chips have a built-in self-refresh module, as they not only require a power supply to retain data, but must also be periodically refreshed to prevent their data contents from fading away from the capacitors in their integrated circuits. A study found data remanence in DRAM with data retention of seconds to minutes at room temperature and \"a full week without refresh when cooled with liquid nitrogen.\" The study authors were able to use a cold boot attack to recover cryptographic keys for several popular full disk encryption systems, including Microsoft BitLocker, Apple FileVault, dm-crypt for Linux, and TrueCrypt.:\u200a12\u200aDespite some memory degradation, authors of the above described study were able to take advantage of redundancy in the way keys are stored after they have been expanded for efficient use, such as in key scheduling.

      "context": "Data remanence\n\n==Introduction==\nData remanence is the residual representation of digital data that remains even after attempts have been made to remove or erase the data.  This residue may result from data being left intact by a nominal file deletion operation, by reformatting of storage media that does not remove data previously written to the media, or through physical properties of the storage media that allow previously written data to be recovered.  Data remanence may make inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information possible should the storage media be released into an uncontrolled environment (e.g., thrown in the bin (trash) or lost). \nVarious techniques have been developed to counter data remanence.  These techniques are classified as clearing,  purging/sanitizing, or destruction.  Specific methods include overwriting, degaussing, encryption, and media destruction.\nEffective application of countermeasures can be complicated by several factors, including media that are inaccessible, media that cannot effectively be erased, advanced storage systems that maintain histories of data throughout the data's life cycle, and persistence of data in memory that is typically considered volatile.\nSeveral standards exist for the secure removal of data and the elimination of data remanence.\n\n\n\n== Causes ==\nMany operating systems, file managers, and other software provide a facility where a file is not immediately deleted when the user requests that action.  Instead, the file is moved to a holding area (i.e. the \"trash\"), making it easy for  the user to undo a mistake.  Similarly, many software products automatically create backup copies of files that are being edited, to allow the user to restore the original version, or to recover from a possible crash (autosave feature).\nEven when an explicit deleted file retention facility is not provided or when the user does not use it, operating systems do not actually remove the contents of a file when it is deleted unless they are aware that explicit erasure commands are required, like on a solid-state drive.  (In such cases, the operating system will issue the Serial ATA TRIM command or the SCSI UNMAP command to let the drive know to no longer maintain the deleted data.)  Instead, they simply remove the file's entry from the file system directory because this requires less work and is therefore faster, and the contents of the file\u2014the actual data\u2014remain on the storage medium.  The data will remain there until the operating system reuses the space for new data.  In some systems, enough filesystem metadata are also left behind to enable easy undeletion by commonly available utility software.  Even when undelete has become impossible, the data, until it has been overwritten, can be read by software that reads disk sectors directly. Computer forensics often employs such software.\nLikewise, reformatting, repartitioning, or reimaging a system is unlikely to write to every area of the disk, though all will cause the disk to appear empty or, in the case of reimaging, empty except for the files present in the image, to most software.\nFinally, even when the storage media is overwritten, physical properties of the media may permit recovery of the previous contents. In most cases however, this recovery is not possible by just reading from the storage device in the usual way, but requires using laboratory techniques such as disassembling the device and directly accessing/reading from its components.\nThe section on complications gives further explanations for causes of data remanence.\n\n== Countermeasures ==\n\nThere are three levels commonly recognized for eliminating remnant data:\n\n\n*** Clearing ***\nClearing is the removal of sensitive data from storage devices in such a way that there is assurance that the data may not be reconstructed using normal system functions or software file/data recovery utilities. The data may still be recoverable, but not without special laboratory techniques.Clearing is typically an administrative protection against accidental disclosure within an organization.  For example, before a hard drive is re-used within an organization, its contents may be cleared to prevent their accidental disclosure to the next user.\n\n\n*** Purging ***\nPurging or sanitizing is the physical rewrite of sensitive data from a system or storage device with the intent that the data cannot be recovered.  Purging, proportional to the sensitivity of the data, is generally done before releasing media beyond control, such as before discarding old media, or moving media to a computer with different security requirements.\n\n\n*** Destruction ***\nThe storage media is made unusable for conventional equipment.  Effectiveness of destroying the media varies by medium and method.  Depending on recording density of the media, and/or the destruction technique, this may leave data recoverable by laboratory methods.  Conversely, destruction using appropriate techniques is the most secure method of preventing retrieval.\n\n== Specific methods ==\n\n\n*** Overwriting ***\nA common method used to counter data remanence is to overwrite the storage media with new data.  This is often called wiping or shredding a file or disk, by analogy to common methods of destroying print media, although the mechanism bears no similarity to these.  Because such a method can often be implemented in software alone, and may be able to selectively target only part of the media, it is a popular, low-cost option for some applications.  Overwriting is generally an acceptable method of clearing, as long as the media is writable and not damaged.\nThe simplest overwrite technique writes the same data everywhere\u2014often just a pattern of all zeros.  At a minimum, this will prevent the data from being retrieved simply by reading from the media again using standard system functions.\nIn an attempt to counter more advanced data recovery techniques, specific overwrite patterns and multiple passes have often been prescribed.  These may be generic patterns intended to eradicate any trace signatures, for example, the seven-pass pattern: 0xF6, 0x00, 0xFF, random, 0x00, 0xFF, random; sometimes erroneously attributed to the US standard DOD 5220.22-M.\nOne challenge with overwriting is that some areas of the disk may be inaccessible, due to media degradation or other errors.  Software overwrite may also be problematic in high-security environments, which require stronger controls on data commingling than can be provided by the software in use.  The use of advanced storage technologies may also make file-based overwrite ineffective (see the discussion below under Complications).\nThere are specialized machines and software that are capable of doing overwriting. The software can sometimes be a standalone operating system specifically designed for data destruction. There are also machines specifically designed to wipe hard drives to the department of defense specifications DOD 5220.22-M.\n\n\n**** Feasibility of recovering overwritten data ****\nPeter Gutmann investigated data recovery from nominally overwritten media in the mid-1990s.  He suggested magnetic force microscopy may be able to recover such data, and developed specific patterns, for specific drive technologies, designed to counter such.  These patterns have come to be known as the Gutmann method.\nDaniel Feenberg, an economist at the private National Bureau of Economic Research, claims that the chances of overwritten data being recovered from a modern hard drive amount to \"urban legend\". He also points to the \"18+1\u20442-minute gap\" Rose Mary Woods created on a tape of Richard Nixon discussing the Watergate break-in. Erased information in the gap has not been recovered, and Feenberg claims doing so would be an easy task compared to recovery of a modern high density digital signal.\nAs of November 2007, the United States Department of Defense considers overwriting acceptable for clearing magnetic media within the same security area/zone, but not as a sanitization method.  Only degaussing or physical destruction is acceptable for the latter.On the other hand, according to the 2014 NIST Special Publication 800-88 Rev. 1 (p. 7): \"For storage devices containing magnetic media, a single overwrite pass with a fixed pattern such as binary zeros typically hinders recovery of data even if state of the art laboratory techniques are applied to attempt to retrieve the data.\" An analysis by Wright et al. of recovery techniques, including magnetic force microscopy, also concludes that a single wipe is all that is required for modern drives. They point out that the long time required for multiple wipes \"has created a situation where many organizations ignore the issue [altogether] \u2013 resulting in data leaks and loss.\"\n\n\n*** Degaussing ***\nDegaussing is the removal or reduction of a magnetic field of a disk or drive, using a device called a degausser that has been designed for the media being erased.  Applied to magnetic media, degaussing may purge an entire media element quickly and effectively.\nDegaussing often renders hard disks inoperable, as it erases low-level formatting that is only done at the factory during manufacturing.  In some cases, it is possible to return the drive to a functional state by having it serviced at the manufacturer. However, some modern degaussers use such a strong magnetic pulse that the motor that spins the platters may be destroyed in the degaussing process, and servicing may not be cost-effective. Degaussed computer tape such as DLT can generally be reformatted and reused with standard consumer hardware.\nIn some high-security environments, one may be required to use a degausser that has been approved for the task.  For example, in US government and military jurisdictions, one may be required to use a degausser from the NSA's \"Evaluated Products List\".\n\n\n*** Encryption ***\nEncrypting data before it is stored on the media may mitigate concerns about data remanence.  If the decryption key is strong and carefully controlled, it may effectively make any data on the media unrecoverable.  Even if the key is stored on the media, it may prove easier or quicker to overwrite just the key, versus the entire disk. This process is called crypto-shredding.\nEncryption may be done on a file-by-file basis, or on the whole disk. Cold boot attacks are one of the few possible methods for subverting a full-disk encryption method, as there is no possibility of storing the plain text key in an unencrypted section of the medium. See the section Complications: Data in RAM for further discussion.\nOther side-channel attacks (such as keyloggers, acquisition of a written note containing the decryption key, or rubber-hose cryptanalysis) may offer a greater chance of success, but do not rely on weaknesses in the cryptographic method employed. As such, their relevance for this article is minor.\n\n\n*** Media destruction ***\n\nThorough destruction of the underlying storage media is the most certain way to counter data remanence.  However, the process is generally time-consuming, cumbersome, and may require extremely thorough methods, as even a small fragment of the media may contain large amounts of data.\nSpecific destruction techniques include:\n\nPhysically breaking the media apart (e.g., by grinding or shredding)\nChemically altering the media into a non-readable, non-reverse-constructible state (e.g., through incineration or exposure to caustic/corrosive chemicals)\nPhase transition (e.g., liquefaction or vaporization of a solid disk)\nFor magnetic media, raising its temperature above the Curie point\nFor many electric/electronic volatile and non-volatile storage media, exposure to electromagnetic fields greatly exceeding safe operational specifications (e.g., high-voltage electric current or high-amplitude microwave or ionizing radiation)\n\n== Complications ==\n\n\n*** Inaccessible media areas ***\nStorage media may have areas which become inaccessible by normal means.  For example, magnetic disks may develop new bad sectors after data has been written, and tapes require inter-record gaps. Modern hard disks often feature reallocation of marginal sectors or tracks, automated in a way that the operating system would not need to work with it. The problem is especially significant in solid-state drives (SSDs) that rely on relatively large relocated bad block tables. Attempts to counter data remanence by overwriting may not be successful in such situations, as data remnants may persist in such nominally inaccessible areas.\n\n\n*** Advanced storage systems ***\nData storage systems with more sophisticated features may make overwrite ineffective, especially on a per-file basis. For example, journaling file systems increase the integrity of data by recording write operations in multiple locations, and applying transaction-like semantics; on such systems, data remnants may exist in locations \"outside\" the nominal file storage location.  Some file systems also implement copy-on-write or built-in revision control, with the intent that writing to a file never overwrites data in-place.  Furthermore, technologies such as RAID and anti-fragmentation techniques may result in file data being written to multiple locations, either by design (for fault tolerance), or as data remnants.\nWear leveling can also defeat data erasure, by relocating blocks between the time when they are originally written and the time when they are overwritten.  For this reason, some security protocols tailored to operating systems or other software featuring automatic wear leveling recommend conducting a free-space wipe of a given drive and then copying many small, easily identifiable \"junk\" files or files containing other nonsensitive data to fill as much of that drive as possible, leaving only the amount of free space necessary for satisfactory operation of system hardware and software.  As storage and system demands grow, the \"junk data\" files can be deleted as necessary to free up space; even if the deletion of \"junk data\" files is not secure, their initial nonsensitivity reduces to near zero the consequences of recovery of data remanent from them.\n\n\n*** Optical media ***\nAs optical media are not magnetic, they are not erased by conventional degaussing. Write-once optical media (CD-R, DVD-R, etc.) also cannot be purged by overwriting.  Rewritable optical media, such as CD-RW and DVD-RW, may be receptive to overwriting. Methods for successfully sanitizing optical discs include delaminating or abrading the metallic data layer, shredding, incinerating, destructive electrical arcing (as by exposure to microwave energy), and submersion in a polycarbonate solvent (e.g., acetone).\n\n\n*** Data on solid-state drives ***\nResearch from the Center for Magnetic Recording and Research, University of California, San Diego has uncovered problems inherent in erasing data stored on solid-state drives (SSDs). Researchers discovered three problems with file storage on SSDs:\nFirst, built-in commands are effective, but manufacturers sometimes implement them incorrectly. Second, overwriting the entire visible address space of an SSD twice is usually, but not always, sufficient to sanitize the drive. Third, none of the existing hard drive-oriented techniques for individual file sanitization are effective on SSDs.:\u200a1\u200a \nSolid-state drives, which are flash-based, differ from hard-disk drives in two ways: first, in the way data is stored; and second, in the way the algorithms are used to manage and access that data. These differences can be exploited to recover previously erased data. SSDs maintain a layer of indirection between the logical addresses used by computer systems to access data and the internal addresses that identify physical storage. This layer of indirection hides idiosyncratic media interfaces and enhances SSD performance, reliability, and lifespan (see wear leveling), but it can also produce copies of the data that are invisible to the user and that a sophisticated attacker could recover. For sanitizing entire disks, sanitize commands built into the SSD hardware have been found to be effective when implemented correctly, and software-only techniques for sanitizing entire disks have been found to work most, but not all, of the time.:\u200asection 5\u200a In testing, none of the  software techniques were effective for sanitizing individual files. These included well-known algorithms such as the Gutmann method, US DoD 5220.22-M, RCMP TSSIT OPS-II, Schneier 7 Pass, and Secure Empty Trash on macOS (a feature included in versions OS X 10.3-10.9).:\u200asection 5\u200aThe TRIM feature in many SSD devices, if properly implemented, will eventually erase data after it is deleted, but the process can take some time, typically several minutes. Many older operating systems do not support this feature, and not all combinations of drives and operating systems work.\n\n\n*** Data in RAM ***\nData remanence has been observed in static random-access memory (SRAM), which is typically considered volatile (i.e., the contents degrade with loss of external power).  In one study, data retention was observed even at room temperature.Data remanence has also been observed in dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). Modern DRAM chips have a built-in self-refresh module, as they not only require a power supply to retain data, but must also be periodically refreshed to prevent their data contents from fading away from the capacitors in their integrated circuits. A study found data remanence in DRAM with data retention of seconds to minutes at room temperature and \"a full week without refresh when cooled with liquid nitrogen.\" The study authors were able to use a cold boot attack to recover cryptographic keys for several popular full disk encryption systems, including Microsoft BitLocker, Apple FileVault, dm-crypt for Linux, and TrueCrypt.:\u200a12\u200aDespite some memory degradation, authors of the above described study were able to take advantage of redundancy in the way keys are stored after they have been expanded for efficient use, such as in key scheduling. The authors recommend that computers be powered down, rather than be left in a \"sleep\" state, when not in physical control of the owner. In some cases, such as certain modes of the software program BitLocker, the authors recommend that a boot password or a key on a removable USB device be used.:\u200a12\u200a TRESOR is a kernel patch for Linux specifically intended to prevent cold boot attacks on RAM by ensuring that encryption keys are not accessible from user space and are stored in the CPU rather than system RAM whenever possible. Newer versions of the disk encryption software VeraCrypt can encrypt in-RAM keys and passwords on 64-bit Windows.\n\n== Standards ==\nAustraliaASD ISM 2014, Australian Government Information Security Manual, 2014 CanadaRCMP B2-002, IT Media Overwrite and Secure Erase Products, May 2009 \nCommunications Security Establishment Clearing and Declassifying Electronic Data Storage Devices, July 2006 New ZealandGCSB NZISM 2016, New Zealand Information Security Manual v2.5, July 2016 \nNZSIS PSM 2009, Protective Security ManualUnited KingdomAsset Disposal and Information Security Alliance (ADISA), ADISA IT Asset Disposal Security StandardUnited StatesNIST Special Publication 800-88, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, September 2006 \nDoD 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), February 2006 Current editions no longer contain any references to specific sanitization methods.

    "instruction": "Context: IP address spoofing\n\n==Introduction==\nIn computer networking, IP address spoofing or IP spoofing is the creation of Internet Protocol (IP) packets with a false source IP address, for the purpose of impersonating another computing system.\n\n== Background ==\nThe basic protocol for sending data over the Internet network and many other computer networks is the Internet Protocol (IP). The protocol specifies that each IP packet must have a header which contains (among other things) the IP address of the sender of the packet. The source IP address is normally the address that the packet was sent from, but the sender's address in the header can be altered, so that to the recipient it appears that the packet came from another source. \nThe protocol requires the receiving computer to send back a response to the source IP address therefore spoofing is mainly used when the sender can anticipate the network response or does not care about the response.\nThe source IP address provides only limited information about the sender. It may provide general information on the region, city and town when on the packet was sent. It does not provide information on the identity of the sender or the computer being used.\n\n== Applications ==\nIP address spoofing involving the use of a trusted IP address can be used by network intruders to overcome network security measures, such as authentication based on IP addresses. This type of attack is most effective where trust relationships exist between machines. For example, it is common on some corporate networks to have internal systems trust each other, so that users can log in without a username or password provided they are connecting from another machine on the internal network \u2013 which would require them already being logged in. By spoofing a connection from a trusted machine, an attacker on the same network may be able to access the target machine without authentication.\nIP address spoofing is most frequently used in denial-of-service attacks, where the objective is to flood the target with an overwhelming volume of traffic, and the attacker does not care about receiving responses to the attack packets. Packets with spoofed IP addresses are more difficult to filter since each spoofed packet appears to come from a different address, and they hide the true source of the attack. Denial of service attacks that use spoofing typically randomly choose addresses from the entire IP address space, though more sophisticated spoofing mechanisms might avoid non-routable addresses or unused portions of the IP address space. The proliferation of large botnets makes spoofing less important in denial of service attacks, but attackers typically have spoofing available as a tool, if they want to use it, so defenses against denial-of-service attacks that rely on the validity of the source IP address in attack packets might have trouble with spoofed packets. Backscatter, a technique used to observe denial-of-service attack activity in the Internet, relies on attackers' use of IP spoofing for its effectiveness.\n\n== Legitimate uses ==\nThe use of packets with a false source IP address is not always evidence of malicious intent. For example, in performance testing of websites, hundreds or even thousands of \"vusers\" (virtual users) may be created, each executing a test script against the website under test, in order to simulate what will happen when the system goes \"live\" and a large number of users log in simultaneously.\nSince each user will normally have its own IP address, commercial testing products (such as HP LoadRunner, WebLOAD, and others) can use IP spoofing, allowing each user its own \"return address\" as well.\nIP spoofing is also used in some server-side load balancing. It lets the load balancer spray incoming traffic, but not need to be in the return path from the servers to the client. This saves a networking hop through switches and the load balancer as well as outbound message processing load on the load balancer. Output usually has more packets and bytes, so the savings are significant.\n\n== Services vulnerable to IP spoofing ==\nConfiguration and services that are vulnerable to IP spoofing:\n\nRPC (Remote procedure call services)\nAny service that uses IP address authentication\nThe R services suite (rlogin, rsh, etc.)\n\n== Defense against spoofing attacks ==\nPacket filtering is one defense against IP spoofing attacks. The gateway to a network usually performs ingress filtering, which is blocking of packets from outside the network with a source address inside the network. This prevents an outside attacker spoofing the address of an internal machine. Ideally, the gateway would also perform egress filtering on outgoing packets, which is blocking of packets from inside the network with a source address that is not inside. This prevents an attacker within the network performing filtering from launching IP spoofing attacks against external machines. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a common use of packet filtering, which has been used to secure the environments for sharing data over network and host-based IDS approaches.It is also recommended to design network protocols and services so that they do not rely on the source IP address for authentication.\n\n\n*** Upper layers ***\nSome upper layer protocols have their own defense against IP spoofing attacks. For example, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) uses sequence numbers negotiated with the remote machine to ensure that arriving packets are part of an established connection. Since the attacker normally cannot see any reply packets, the sequence number must be guessed in order to hijack the connection. The poor implementation in many older operating systems and network devices, however, means that TCP sequence numbers can be predicted.\n\n== Other definitions ==\nThe term spoofing is also sometimes used to refer to header forgery, the insertion of false or misleading information in e-mail or netnews headers. Falsified headers are used to mislead the recipient, or network applications, as to the origin of a message. This is a common technique of spammers and sporgers, who wish to conceal the origin of their messages to avoid being tracked.\nAnswer this question: How is IP address spoofing used in denial-of-service attacks?",

Output usually has more packets and bytes, so the savings are significant.\n\n== Services vulnerable to IP spoofing ==\nConfiguration and services that are vulnerable to IP spoofing:\n\nRPC (Remote procedure call services)\nAny service that uses IP address authentication\nThe R services suite (rlogin, rsh, etc.)\n\n== Defense against spoofing attacks ==\nPacket filtering is one defense against IP spoofing attacks. The gateway to a network usually performs ingress filtering, which is blocking of packets from outside the network with a source address inside the network. This prevents an outside attacker spoofing the address of an internal machine. Ideally, the gateway would also perform egress filtering on outgoing packets, which is blocking of packets from inside the network with a source address that is not inside. This prevents an attacker within the network performing filtering from launching IP spoofing attacks against external machines. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a common use of packet filtering, which has been used to secure the environments for sharing data over network and host-based IDS approaches.It is also recommended to design network protocols and services so that they do not rely on the source IP address for authentication.\n\n\n*** Upper layers ***\nSome upper layer protocols have their own defense against IP spoofing attacks. For example, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) uses sequence numbers negotiated with the remote machine to ensure that arriving packets are part of an established connection. Since the attacker normally cannot see any reply packets, the sequence number must be guessed in order to hijack the connection. The poor implementation in many older operating systems and network devices, however, means that TCP sequence numbers can be predicted.\n\n== Other definitions ==\nThe term spoofing is also sometimes used to refer to header forgery, the insertion of false or misleading information in e-mail or netnews headers. Falsified headers are used to mislead the recipient, or network applications, as to the origin of a message. This is a common technique of spammers and sporgers, who wish to conceal the origin of their messages to avoid being tracked."

    "instruction": "Cyberwarfare\n\n==Introduction==\nCyberwarfare is the use of cyber attacks against an enemy state, causing comparable harm to actual warfare and/or disrupting vital computer systems. Some intended outcomes could be espionage, sabotage, propaganda, manipulation or economic warfare.\nThere is significant debate among experts regarding the definition of cyberwarfare, and even if such a thing exists. One view is that the term is a misnomer, since no cyber attacks to date could be described as war. An alternative view is that it is a suitable label for cyber attacks which cause physical damage to people and objects in the real world.Many countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Russia, China, Israel, Iran, and North Korea have active cyber capabilities for offensive and defensive operations. As states explore the use of cyber operations and combine capabilities, the likelihood of physical confrontation and violence playing out as a result of, or part of, a cyber operation is increased. However, meeting the scale and protracted nature of war is unlikely, thus ambiguity remains.The first instance of kinetic military action used in response to a cyber-attack resulting in the loss of human life was observed on 5 May 2019, when the Israel Defense Forces targeted and destroyed a building associated with an ongoing cyber-attack.\n\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThere is ongoing debate over how cyberwarfare should be defined and no absolute definition is widely agreed upon. While the majority of scholars, militaries and governments use definitions which refer to state and state-sponsored actors, other definitions may include non-state actors, such as terrorist groups, companies, political or ideological extremist groups, hacktivists, and transnational criminal organizations depending on the context of the work.Examples of definitions proposed by experts in the field are as follows.\n\n'Cyberwarfare' is used in a broad context to denote interstate use of technological force within computer networks in which information is stored, shared or communicated online.Parks and Duggan focused on analyzing cyberwarfare in terms of computer networks and pointed out that \"Cyberwarfare is a combination of computer network attack and defense and special technical operations.\" According to this perspective, the notion of cyberwarfare brings a new paradigm into the military doctrine. Paulo Shakarian and colleagues, put forward the following definition in 2013 drawing from various works including Clausewitz's definition of war: \"War is the continuation of politics by other means\":Cyberwarfare is an extension of policy by actions taken in cyberspace by state actors (or by non-state actors with significant state direction or support) that constitute a serious threat to another state's security, or an action of the same nature taken in response to a serious threat to a state's security (actual or perceived).\nTaddeo offered the following definition in 2012:\n\nThe warfare grounded on certain uses of ICTs within an offensive or defensive military strategy endorsed by a state and aiming at the immediate disruption or control of the enemy's resources, and which is waged within the informational environment, with agents and targets ranging both on the physical and non-physical domains and whose level of violence may vary upon circumstances.\nRobinson et al. proposed in 2015, that the intent of the attacker dictates whether an attack is warfare or not, defining cyber warfare as \"the use of cyber attacks with a warfare-like intent.\"In 2010, the former US National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection and Counter-terrorism, Richard A. Clarke, defined cyberwarfare as \"actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption.\" Own cyber-physical infrastructure may be weaponized and used by the adversary in case of a cyber conflict, thus turning such infrastructure into tactical weapons.\n\n\n*** Controversy of term ***\nThere is debate on whether the term \"cyberwarfare\" is accurate. In 2012, Eugene Kaspersky, founder of Kaspersky Lab, concludes that \"cyberterrorism\" is a more accurate term than \"cyberwar.\" He states that \"with today's attacks, you are clueless about who did it or when they will strike again. It's not cyber-war, but cyberterrorism.\" Howard Schmidt, former Cyber Security Coordinator of the Obama Administration, said that \"there is no cyberwar... I think that is a terrible metaphor and I think that is a terrible concept. There are no winners in that environment.\"Some experts take issue with the possible consequences linked to the warfare analogy. In 2011, Ron Deibert, of Canada's Citizen Lab, has warned of a \"militarization of cyberspace\", as militaristic responses may not be appropriate. Although, to date, even serious cyber attacks which have disrupted large parts of a nations electrical grids (230,000 customers, Ukraine, 2015) or affected access to medical care, thus endangering life (NHS, WannaCry, 2017) have not led to military action.In 2017, Oxford academic Lucas Kello proposed a new term \u2013 \"Unpeace\" \u2013 to denote highly damaging cyber actions whose non-violent effects do not rise to the level of traditional war. Such actions are neither warlike nor peace-like. Although they are non-violent, and thus not acts of war, their damaging effects on the economy and society may be greater than even some armed attacks. This term is closely related to the concept of the \"grey zone\" which has come to prominence in 2017, describing actions which fall below the traditional threshold of war.\n\n\n*** Cyberwarfare vs. cyber war ***\nThe term \"cyberwarfare\" is distinct from the term \"cyber war.\" \"Cyberwarfare\" does not imply scale, protraction or violence which are typically associated with the term \"war\". Cyber warfare includes techniques, tactics and procedures which may be involved in a cyber war. The term war inherently refers to a large scale action, typically over a protracted period of time and may include objectives seeking to utilize violence or the aim to kill. A cyber war could accurately describe a protracted period of back-and-forth cyber attacks (including in combination with traditional military action) between warring states. To date, no such action is known to have occurred. Instead, tit-for-tat military-cyber actions are more commonplace. For example, in June 2019, the United States launched a cyber attack against Iranian weapons systems in retaliation to the shooting down of a US drone being in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\n\n*** Cyberwarfare and cyber sanctions ***\nThe use of digital attacks, as described by the concept of cyberwarfare, in this page can be a retaliatory response to the cyber attacks. In addition, countries can use cyber sanctions as a reaction to being the targets of the cyber attacks. Sometimes, it is not easy to detect the attacker; however, it might be the case that suspicions can focus on a certain country or group of countries. In these cases, unilateral and multilateral economic sanctions can be used instead of cyberwarfare. For example, economic sanctions related to cyber attacks have been frequently used by the United States government. There are two Executive Orders, EO 13694 in 2015 and EO 13757 in 2016, issued during the Obama administration specifically focused on the implementation of the cyber sanctions. Later on, these Executive Orders have been frequently used by the following US presidents. Furthermore, the Congress is an important actor when it comes to the cyber sanctions. For example, Iran Cyber Sanctions Act of 2016 is a bill that imposes sanctions on specific individuals responsible for the cyber attacks.\n\n== Types of threat ==\n\n== Types of warfare ==\nCyber warfare can present a multitude of threats towards a nation. At the most basic level, cyber attacks can be used to support traditional warfare. For example, tampering with the operation of air defenses via cyber means in order to facilitate an air attack. Aside from these \"hard\" threats, cyber warfare can also contribute towards \"soft\" threats such as espionage and propaganda.\nEugene Kaspersky, founder of Kaspersky Lab, equates large-scale cyber weapons, such as Flame and NetTraveler which his company discovered, to biological weapons, claiming that in an interconnected world, they have the potential to be equally destructive.\n\n\n*** Espionage ***\n\nTraditional espionage is not an act of war, nor is cyber-espionage, and both are generally assumed to be ongoing between major powers. Despite this assumption, some incidents can cause serious tensions between nations, and are often described as \"attacks\". For example:\nMassive spying by the US on many countries, revealed by Edward Snowden.\nAfter the NSA's spying on Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel was revealed, the Chancellor compared the NSA with the Stasi.\nThe NSA recording nearly every cell phone conversation in the Bahamas, without the Bahamian government's permission, and similar programs in Kenya, the Philippines, Mexico and Afghanistan.\nThe \"Titan Rain\" probes of American defense contractors computer systems since 2003.\nThe Office of Personnel Management data breach, in the US, widely attributed to China.\nThe security firm Area 1 published details of a breach that compromised one of the European Union's diplomatic communication channels for three years.Out of all cyber attacks, 25% of them are espionage based.\n\n\n*** Sabotage ***\nComputers and satellites that coordinate other activities are vulnerable components of a system and could lead to the disruption of equipment. Compromise of military systems, such as C4ISTAR components that are responsible for orders and communications could lead to their interception or malicious replacement. Power, water, fuel, communications, and transportation infrastructure all may be vulnerable to disruption. According to Clarke, the civilian realm is also at risk, noting that the security breaches have already gone beyond stolen credit card numbers, and that potential targets can also include the electric power grid, trains, or the stock market.In mid-July 2010, security experts discovered a malicious software program called Stuxnet that had infiltrated factory computers and had spread to plants around the world. It is considered \"the first attack on critical industrial infrastructure that sits at the foundation of modern economies,\" notes The New York Times.Stuxnet, while extremely effective in delaying Iran's nuclear program for the development of nuclear weaponry, came at a high cost. For the first time, it became clear that not only could cyber weapons be defensive but they could be offensive. The large decentralization and scale of cyberspace makes it extremely difficult to direct from a policy perspective. Non-state actors can play as large a part in the cyberwar space as state actors, which leads to dangerous, sometimes disastrous, consequences. Small groups of highly skilled malware developers are able to as effectively impact global politics and cyber warfare as large governmental agencies. A major aspect of this ability lies in the willingness of these groups to share their exploits and developments on the web as a form of arms proliferation. This allows lesser hackers to become more proficient in creating the large scale attacks that once only a small handful were skillful enough to manage. In addition, thriving black markets for these kinds of cyber weapons are buying and selling these cyber capabilities to the highest bidder without regard for consequences.\n\n\n**** Denial-of-service attack ****\n\nIn computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. Perpetrators of DoS attacks typically target sites or services hosted on high-profile web servers such as banks, credit card payment gateways, and even root nameservers. DoS attacks often leverage internet-connected devices with vulnerable security measures to carry out these large-scale attacks. DoS attacks may not be limited to computer-based methods, as strategic physical attacks against infrastructure can be just as devastating. For example, cutting undersea communication cables may severely cripple some regions and countries with regards to their information warfare ability.\n\n\n**** Electrical power grid ****\nThe federal government of the United States admits that the electric power grid is susceptible to cyberwarfare. The United States Department of Homeland Security works with industries to identify vulnerabilities and to help industries enhance the security of control system networks. The federal government is also working to ensure that security is built in as the next generation of \"smart grid\" networks are developed. In April 2009, reports surfaced that China and Russia had infiltrated the U.S. electrical grid and left behind software programs that could be used to disrupt the system, according to current and former national security officials. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) has issued a public notice that warns that the electrical grid is not adequately protected from cyber attack. China denies intruding into the U.S. electrical grid. One countermeasure would be to disconnect the power grid from the Internet and run the net with droop speed control only. Massive power outages caused by a cyber attack could disrupt the economy, distract from a simultaneous military attack, or create a national trauma.Iranian hackers, possibly Iranian Cyber Army pushed a massive power outage for 12 hours in 44 of 81 provinces of Turkey, impacting 40 million people. Istanbul and Ankara were among the places suffering blackout.Howard Schmidt, former Cyber-Security Coordinator of the US, commented on those possibilities:\nIt's possible that hackers have gotten into administrative computer systems of utility companies, but says those aren't linked to the equipment controlling the grid, at least not in developed countries. [Schmidt] has never heard that the grid itself has been hacked.\nIn June 2019, Russia said that its electrical grid has been under cyber-attack by the United States. The New York Times reported that American hackers from the United States Cyber Command planted malware potentially capable of disrupting the Russian electrical grid.\n\n\n*** Propaganda ***\nCyber propaganda is an effort to control information in whatever form it takes, and influence public opinion. It is a form of psychological warfare, except it uses social media, fake news websites and other digital means. In 2018, Sir Nicholas Carter, Chief of the General Staff of the British Army stated that this kind of attack from actors such as Russia \"is a form of system warfare that seeks to de-legitimize the political and social system on which our military strength is based\".Jowell and O'Donnell (2006) state that \"propaganda is the deliberate, systematic attempt to shape perceptions, manipulate cognitions, and direct behavior to achieve a response that furthers the desired intent of the propagandist\" (p. 7). The internet is the most important means of communication today. People can convey their messages quickly across to a huge audience, and this can open a window for evil. Terrorist organizations can exploit this and may use this medium to brainwash people. It has been suggested that restricted media coverage of terrorist attacks would in turn decrease the number of terrorist attacks that occur afterwards.\n\n\n*** Economic disruption ***\nIn 2017, the WannaCry and Petya (NotPetya) cyber attacks, masquerading as ransomware, caused large-scale disruptions in Ukraine as well as to the U.K.'s National Health Service, pharmaceutical giant Merck, Maersk shipping company and other organizations around the world. These attacks are also categorized as cybercrimes, specifically financial crime because they negatively affect a company or group.\n\n\n*** Surprise cyber attack ***\nThe idea of a \"cyber Pearl Harbor\" has been debated by scholars, drawing an analogy to the historical act of war. Others have used \"cyber 9/11\" to draw attention to the nontraditional, asymmetric, or irregular aspect of cyber action against a state.\n\n== Motivations ==\nThere are a number of reasons nations undertake offensive cyber operations. Sandro Gaycken, a cyber security expert and adviser to NATO, advocates that states take cyber warfare seriously as they are viewed as an attractive activity by many nations, in times of war and peace. Offensive cyber operations offer a large variety of cheap and risk-free options to weaken other countries and strengthen their own positions. Considered from a long-term, geostrategic perspective, cyber offensive operations can cripple whole economies, change political views, agitate conflicts within or among states, reduce their military efficiency and equalize the capacities of high-tech nations to that of low-tech nations, and use access to their critical infrastructures to blackmail them.\n\n\n*** Military ***\nWith the emergence of cyber as a substantial threat to national and global security, cyber war, warfare and/or attacks also became a domain of interest and purpose for the military.In the U.S., General Keith B. Alexander, first head of USCYBERCOM, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that computer network warfare is evolving so rapidly that there is a \"mismatch between our technical capabilities to conduct operations and the governing laws and policies. Cyber Command is the newest global combatant and its sole mission is cyberspace, outside the traditional battlefields of land, sea, air and space.\" It will attempt to find and, when necessary, neutralize cyberattacks and to defend military computer networks.Alexander sketched out the broad battlefield envisioned for the computer warfare command, listing the kind of targets that his new headquarters could be ordered to attack, including \"traditional battlefield prizes \u2013 command-and-control systems at military headquarters, air defense networks and weapons systems that require computers to operate.\"One cyber warfare scenario, Cyber-ShockWave, which was wargamed on the cabinet level by former administration officials, raised issues ranging from the National Guard to the power grid to the limits of statutory authority.The distributed nature of internet based attacks means that it is difficult to determine motivation and attacking party, meaning that it is unclear when a specific act should be considered an act of war.Examples of cyberwarfare driven by political motivations can be found worldwide. In 2008, Russia began a cyber attack on the Georgian government website, which was carried out along with Georgian military operations in South Ossetia. In 2008, Chinese \"nationalist hackers\" attacked CNN as it reported on Chinese repression on Tibet. Hackers from Armenia and Azerbaijan have actively participated in cyberwarfare as part of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, with Azerbaijani hackers targeting Armenian websites and posting Ilham Aliyev's statements.Jobs in cyberwarfare have become increasingly popular in the military. All four branches of the United States military actively recruit for cyber warfare positions.As the military have become more and more entangled into the national and global threat proposed by the utilization of the cyber domain, a new research field within the Military Science field have slowly emerged. In essence, its focus is centered towards describing, understanding and explaining what Military Cyber Operations is, can do and be tackled. In the Handbook of Military Sciences Aaron Brantly and Max Smeets define Military Cyber Operations to be \"those cyber operations which a military entity of a nation-state plans and conducts to achieve strategic, operational, or tactical gain.\" More so, they argue these types of military operations are commonly divided into three types of operations.\n\nDefensive Cyber Operations: Encompassing \"those actions taken through the use of computer networks to protect, monitor, analyze, detect, and respond to unauthorized activity within a governments information systems and computer networks\".\nCyber Espionage Operations: Encompassing \"those actions taken through the use of computer networks to gather data from target or adversary information systems or network\".\"\nOffensive Cyber Operations: Encompassing \"those actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, or in basic, operations designed to achieve tangible effects\".\"\n\n\n*** Civil ***\nPotential targets in internet sabotage include all aspects of the Internet from the backbones of the web, to the internet service providers, to the varying types of data communication mediums and network equipment. This would include: web servers, enterprise information systems, client server systems, communication links, network equipment, and the desktops and laptops in businesses and homes. Electrical grids, financial networks, and telecommunication systems are also deemed vulnerable, especially due to current trends in computerization and automation.\n\n\n*** Hacktivism ***\nPolitically motivated hacktivism involves the subversive use of computers and computer networks to promote an agenda, and can potentially extend to attacks, theft and virtual sabotage that could be seen as cyberwarfare \u2013 or mistaken for it.\nHacktivists use their knowledge and software tools to gain unauthorized access to computer systems they seek to manipulate or damage not for material gain or to cause widespread destruction, but to draw attention to their cause through well-publicized disruptions of select targets. Anonymous and other hacktivist groups are often portrayed in the media as cyber-terrorists, wreaking havoc by hacking websites, posting sensitive information about their victims, and threatening further attacks if their demands are not met. However, hacktivism is more than that. Actors are politically motivated to change the world, through the use of fundamentalism. Groups like Anonymous, however, have divided opinion with their methods.\n\n\n*** Income generation ***\nCyber attacks, including ransomware, can be used to generate income. States can use these techniques to generate significant sources of income, which can evade sanctions and perhaps while simultaneously harming adversaries (depending on targets). This tactic was observed in August 2019 when it was revealed North Korea had generated $2 billion to fund its weapons program, avoiding the blanket of sanctions levied by the United States, United Nations and the European Union.\n\n\n*** Private sector ***\n\nComputer hacking represents a modern threat in ongoing global conflicts and industrial espionage and as such is presumed to widely occur. It is typical that this type of crime is underreported to the extent they are known. According to McAfee's George Kurtz, corporations around the world face millions of cyberattacks a day. \"Most of these attacks don't gain any media attention or lead to strong political statements by victims.\" This type of crime is usually financially motivated.\n\n\n*** Non-profit research ***\nBut not all those who engage in cyberwarfare do so for financial or ideological reasons. There are institutes and companies like the University of Cincinnati or the Kaspersky Security Lab which engage in cyberwarfare so as to better understand the field through actions like the researching and publishing of new security threats.\n\n== Preparedness ==\nA number of countries conduct exercise to increase preparedness and explore the strategy, tactics and operations involved in conducting and defending against cyber attacks against hostile states, this is typically done in the form of war games.The Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCE), part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), have conducted a yearly war game called Locked Shields since 2010 designed to test readiness and improve skills, strategy tactics and operational decision making of participating national organizations. Locked Shields 2019 saw 1200 participants from 30 countries compete in a red team vs. blue team exercise. The war game involved a fictional country, Berylia, which was \"experiencing a deteriorating security situation, where a number of hostile events coincide with coordinated cyber attacks against a major civilian internet service provider and maritime surveillance system. The attacks caused severe disruptions in the power generation and distribution, 4G communication systems, maritime surveillance, water purification plant and other critical infrastructure components\". CCDCE describe the aim of the exercise was to \"maintain the operation of various systems under intense pressure, the strategic part addresses the capability to understand the impact of decisions made at the strategic and policy level.\" Ultimately, France was the winner of Locked Shields 2019.The European Union conducts cyber war game scenarios with member states and foreign partner states to improve readiness, skills and observe how strategic and tactical decisions may affect the scenario.As well as war games which serve a broader purpose to explore options and improve skills, cyber war games are targeted at preparing for specific threats. In 2018 the Sunday Times reported the UK government was conducting cyber war games which could \"blackout Moscow\". These types of war games move beyond defensive preparedness, as previously described above and onto preparing offensive capabilities which can be used as deterrence, or for \"war\".\n\n== Cyber activities by nation ==\n\nApproximately 120 countries have been developing ways to use the Internet as a weapon and target financial markets, government computer systems and utilities.\n\n\n*** Asia ***\n\n\n**** China ****\n\nForeign Policy magazine puts the size of China's \"hacker army\" at anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 individuals.Diplomatic cables highlight US concerns that China is using access to Microsoft source code and 'harvesting the talents of its private sector' to boost its offensive and defensive capabilities.The 2018 cyberattack on the Marriott hotel chain that collected personal details of roughly 500 million guests is now known to be a part of a Chinese intelligence-gathering effort that also hacked health insurers and the security clearance files of millions more Americans, The hackers, are suspected of working on behalf of the Ministry of State Security (MSS), the country's Communist-controlled civilian spy agency.  \"The information is exactly what the Chinese use to root out spies, recruit intelligence agents and build a rich repository of Americans' personal data for future targeting.\"\nA 2008 article in the Culture Mandala: The Bulletin of the Centre for East-West Cultural and Economic Studies by Jason Fritz alleges that the Chinese government from 1995 to 2008 was involved in a number of high-profile cases of espionage, primarily through the use of a \"decentralized network of students, business people, scientists, diplomats, and engineers from within the Chinese Diaspora\". A defector in Belgium, purportedly an agent, claimed that there were hundreds of spies in industries throughout Europe, and on his defection to Australia Chinese diplomat Chen Yonglin said there were over 1,000 such in that country.  In 2007, a Russian executive was sentenced to 11 years for passing information about the rocket and space technology organization to China. Targets in the United States have included \"aerospace engineering programs, space shuttle design, C4ISR data, high-performance computers, Nuclear weapon design, cruise missile data, semiconductors, integrated circuit design, and details of US arms sales to Taiwan\".While China continues to be held responsible for a string of cyber-attacks on a number of public and private institutions in the United States, India, Russia, Canada, and France, the Chinese government denies any involvement in cyber-spying campaigns. The administration maintains the position that China is not the threat but rather the victim of an increasing number of cyber-attacks. Most reports about China's cyber warfare capabilities have yet to be confirmed by the Chinese government.According to Fritz, China has expanded its cyber capabilities and military technology by acquiring foreign military technology. Fritz states that the Chinese government uses \"new space-based surveillance and intelligence gathering systems, Anti-satellite weapon, anti-radar, infrared decoys, and false target generators\" to assist in this quest, and that they support their \"Informatisation\" of their military through \"increased education of soldiers in cyber warfare; improving the information network for military training, and has built more virtual laboratories, digital libraries and digital campuses.\" Through this informatisation, they hope to prepare their forces to engage in a different kind of warfare, against technically capable adversaries. Many recent news reports link China's technological capabilities to the beginning of a new \"cyber cold war.\"Operation Shady RAT is an ongoing series of cyber attacks starting mid-2006, reported by Internet security company McAfee in August 2011. China is widely believed to be the state actor behind these attacks which hit at least 72 organizations including governments and defense contractors.On 14 September 2020, a database showing personal details of about 2.4 million people around the world was leaked and published.  A Chinese company, Zhenhua Data compiled the database. According to the information from \"National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System\", which is run by State Administration for Market Regulation in China, the shareholders of Zhenhua Data Information Technology Co., Ltd. are two natural persons and one general partnership enterprise whose partners are natural persons. Wang Xuefeng, who is the chief executive and the shareholder of Zhenhua Data, has publicly boasted that he supports \"hybrid warfare\" through manipulation of public opinion and \"psychological warfare\".\n\n\n**** India ****\n\nThe Department of Information Technology created the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) in 2004 to thwart cyber attacks in India. That year, there were 23 reported cyber security breaches. In 2011, there were 13,301. That year, the government created a new subdivision, the National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC) to thwart attacks against energy, transport, banking, telecom, defense, space and other sensitive areas.The executive director of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) stated in February 2013 that his company alone was forced to block up to ten targeted attacks a day. CERT-In was left to protect less critical sectors.A high-profile cyber attack on 12 July 2012 breached the email accounts of about 12,000 people, including those of officials from the Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Home Affairs, Defense Research and Development Organizations (DRDO), and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP). A government-private sector plan being overseen by National Security Advisor (NSA) Shivshankar Menon began in October 2012, and intends to boost up India's cyber security capabilities in the light of a group of experts findings that India faces a 470,000 shortfall of such experts despite the country's reputation of being an IT and software powerhouse.In February 2013, Information Technology Secretary J. Satyanarayana stated that the NCIIPC was finalizing policies related to national cyber security that would focus on domestic security solutions, reducing exposure through foreign technology. Other steps include the isolation of various security agencies to ensure that a synchronised attack could not succeed on all fronts and the planned appointment of a National Cyber Security Coordinator. As of that month, there had been no significant economic or physical damage to India related to cyber attacks.\nOn 26 November 2010, a group calling itself the Indian Cyber Army hacked the websites belonging to the Pakistan Army and the others belong to different ministries, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance, Pakistan Computer Bureau, Council of Islamic Ideology, etc. The attack was done as a revenge for the Mumbai terrorist attacks.On 4 December 2010, a group calling itself the Pakistan Cyber Army hacked the website of India's top investigating agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The National Informatics Center (NIC) has begun an inquiry.In July 2016, Cymmetria researchers discovered and revealed the cyber attack dubbed 'Patchwork', which compromised an estimated 2500 corporate and government agencies using code stolen from GitHub and the dark web. Examples of weapons used are an exploit for the Sandworm vulnerability (CVE-2014-4114), a compiled AutoIt script, and UAC bypass code dubbed UACME. Targets are believed to be mainly military and political assignments around Southeast Asia and the South China Sea and the attackers are believed to be of Indian origin and gathering intelligence from influential parties.The Defence Cyber Agency, which is the Indian Military agency responsible for Cyberwarfare, is expected to become operational by November 2019.\n\n\n**** Iran ****\nThe Iranian state sponsored group MuddyWater is active since at least 2017 and is responsible for many cyber attacks on various sectors.\n\n\n**** Philippines ****\nThe Chinese are being blamed after a cybersecurity company, F-Secure Labs, found a malware, NanHaiShu, which targeted the Philippines Department of Justice. It sent information in an infected machine to a server with a Chinese IP address. The malware which is considered particularly sophisticated in nature was introduced by phishing emails that were designed to look like they were coming from an authentic sources. The information sent is believed to be relating to the South China Sea legal case.\n\n\n**** South Korea ****\n\nIn July 2009, there were a series of coordinated denial of service attacks against major government, news media, and financial websites in South Korea and the United States. While many thought the attack was directed by North Korea, one researcher traced the attacks to the United Kingdom. Security researcher Chris Kubecka presented evidence multiple European Union and United Kingdom companies unwittingly helped attack South Korea due to a W32.Dozer infections, malware used in part of the attack. Some of the companies used in the attack were partially owned by several governments, further complicating attribution.\n\nIn July 2011, the South Korean company SK Communications was hacked, resulting in the theft of the personal details (including names, phone numbers, home and email addresses and resident registration numbers) of up to 35 million people. A trojaned software update was used to gain access to the SK Communications network. Links exist between this hack and other malicious activity and it is believed to be part of a broader, concerted hacking effort.With ongoing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, South Korea's defense ministry stated that South Korea was going to improve cyber-defense strategies in hopes of preparing itself from possible cyber attacks. In March 2013, South Korea's major banks \u2013 Shinhan Bank, Woori Bank and NongHyup Bank \u2013 as well as many broadcasting stations \u2013 KBS, YTN and MBC \u2013 were hacked and more than 30,000 computers were affected; it is one of the biggest attacks South Korea has faced in years. Although it remains uncertain as to who was involved in this incident, there has been immediate assertions that North Korea is connected, as it threatened to attack South Korea's government institutions, major national banks and traditional newspapers numerous times \u2013 in reaction to the sanctions it received from nuclear testing and to the continuation of Foal Eagle, South Korea's annual joint military exercise with the United States. North Korea's cyber warfare capabilities raise the alarm for South Korea, as North Korea is increasing its manpower through military academies specializing in hacking. Current figures state that South Korea only has 400 units of specialized personnel, while North Korea has more than 3,000 highly trained hackers; this portrays a huge gap in cyber warfare capabilities and sends a message to South Korea that it has to step up and strengthen its Cyber Warfare Command forces. Therefore, in order to be prepared from future attacks, South Korea and the United States will discuss further about deterrence plans at the Security Consultative Meeting (SCM). At SCM, they plan on developing strategies that focuses on accelerating the deployment of ballistic missiles as well as fostering its defense shield program, known as the Korean Air and Missile Defense.\n\n\n**** Sri Lanka ****\n\n\n**** North Korea ****\n\n\n*** Africa ***\n\n\n**** Egypt ****\nIn an extension of a bilateral dispute between Ethiopia and Egypt over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, Ethiopian government websites have been hacked by the Egypt-based hackers in June 2020.\n\n\n*** Europe ***\n\n\n**** Cyprus ****\nThe New York Times published an expos\u00e9 revealing an extensive three-year phishing campaign aimed against diplomats based in Cyprus. After accessing the state system the hackers had access to the European Union's entire exchange database. By login into Coreu, hackers accessed communications linking all EU states, on both sensitive and not so sensitive matters. The event exposed poor protection of routine exchanges among European Union officials and a coordinated effort from a foreign entity to spy on another country. \"After over a decade of experience countering Chinese cyberoperations and extensive technical analysis, there is no doubt this campaign is connected to the Chinese government\", said Blake Darche, one of the Area 1 Security experts - the company revealing the stolen documents. The Chinese Embassy in the US did not return calls for comment. In 2019, another coordinated effort took place that allowed hackers to gain access to government (gov.cy) emails. Cisco's Talos Security Department revealed that \"Sea Turtle\" hackers carried out a broad piracy campaign in the DNS countries, hitting 40 different organizations, including Cyprus.\n\n\n**** Estonia ****\nIn April 2007, Estonia came under cyber attack in the wake of relocation of the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn. The largest part of the attacks were coming from Russia and from official servers of the authorities of Russia. In the attack, ministries, banks, and media were targeted. This attack on Estonia, a seemingly small Baltic state, was so effective because of how most of Estonian government services are run online. Estonia has implemented an e-government, where banking services, political elections, taxes, and other components of a modern society are now all done online.\n\n\n**** France ****\n\nIn 2013, the French Minister of Defense, Mr Jean-Yves Le Drian, ordered the creation of a cyber army, representing its fourth national army corps (along with ground, naval and air forces) under the French Ministry of Defense, to protect French and European interests on its soil and abroad. A contract was made with French firm EADS (Airbus) to identify and secure its main elements susceptible to cyber threats. In 2016 France had planned 2600 \"cyber-soldiers\" and a 440 million euros investment for cybersecurity products for this new army corps. An additional 4400 reservists constitute the heart of this army from 2019.\n\n\n**** Germany ****\nIn 2013, Germany revealed the existence of their 60-person Computer Network Operation unit. The German intelligence agency, BND, announced it was seeking to hire 130 \"hackers\" for a new \"cyber defence station\" unit.  In March 2013, BND president Gerhard Schindler announced that his agency had observed up to five attacks a day on government authorities, thought mainly to originate in China.  He confirmed the attackers had so far only accessed data and expressed concern that the stolen information could be used as the basis of future sabotage attacks against arms manufacturers, telecommunications companies and government and military agencies. Shortly after Edward Snowden leaked details of the U.S. National Security Agency's cyber surveillance system, German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich announced that the BND would be given an additional budget of 100 million Euros to increase their cyber surveillance capability from 5% of total internet traffic in Germany to 20% of total traffic, the maximum amount allowed by German law.\n\n\n**** Netherlands ****\n\nIn the Netherlands, Cyber Defense is nationally coordinated by the National Cyber Security Centrum (NCSC). The Dutch Ministry of Defense laid out a cyber strategy in 2011. The first focus is to improve the cyber defense handled by the Joint IT branch (JIVC). To improve intel operations, the intel community in the Netherlands (including the military intel organization, MIVD) has set up the Joint Sigint Cyber Unit (JSCU). The Ministry of Defense oversees an offensive cyber force, called Defensive Cyber Command (DCC).\n\n\n**** Norway ****\n\n\n**** Russia ****\n\nRussian, South Ossetian, Georgian and Azerbaijani sites were attacked by hackers during the 2008 South Ossetia War.American-led cyberattacks against Soviet Union and Russia\n\nWhen Russia was still a part of the Soviet Union in 1982, a portion of a Trans-Siberia pipeline within its territory exploded, allegedly due to a Trojan Horse computer malware implanted in the pirated Canadian software by the Central Intelligence Agency. The malware caused the SCADA system running the pipeline to malfunction. The \"Farewell Dossier\" provided information on this attack, and wrote that compromised computer chips would become a part of Soviet military equipment, flawed turbines would be placed in the gas pipeline, and defective plans would disrupt the output of chemical plants and a tractor factory. This caused the \"most monumental nonnuclear explosion and fire ever seen from space.\" However, the Soviet Union did not blame the United States for the attack.In June 2019, the New York Times reported that American hackers from the United States Cyber Command planted malware potentially capable of disrupting the Russian electrical grid.Russian-led cyberattacks\n\nIt has been claimed that Russian security services organized a number of denial of service attacks as a part of their cyber-warfare against other countries, most notably the 2007 cyberattacks on Estonia and the 2008 cyberattacks on Russia, South Ossetia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. One identified young Russian hacker said that he was paid by Russian state security services to lead hacking attacks on NATO computers. He was studying computer sciences at the Department of the Defense of Information. His tuition was paid for by the FSB.\n\n\n**** Sweden ****\nIn January 2017, Sweden's armed forces were subjected to a cyber-attack that caused them to shutdown a so-called Caxcis IT system used in military exercises.\n\n\n**** Ukraine ****\nAccording to CrowdStrike from 2014 to 2016, the Russian APT Fancy Bear used Android malware to target the Ukrainian Army's Rocket Forces and Artillery. They distributed an infected version of an Android app whose original purpose was to control targeting data for the D-30 Howitzer artillery. The app, used by Ukrainian officers, was loaded with the X-Agent spyware and posted online on military forums. The attack was claimed by Crowd-Strike to be successful, with more than 80% of Ukrainian D-30 Howitzers destroyed, the highest percentage loss of any artillery pieces in the army (a percentage that had never been previously reported and would mean the loss of nearly the entire arsenal of the biggest artillery piece of the Ukrainian Armed Forces). According to the Ukrainian army this number is incorrect and that losses in artillery weapons \"were way below those reported\" and that these losses \"have nothing to do with the stated cause\".In 2014, the Russians were suspected to use a cyber weapon called \"Snake\", or \"Ouroboros,\" to conduct a cyber attack on Ukraine during a period of political turmoil. The Snake tool kit began spreading into Ukrainian computer systems in 2010. It performed Computer Network Exploitation (CNE), as well as highly sophisticated Computer Network Attacks (CNA).On 23 December 2015 the Black-Energy malware was used in a cyberattack on Ukraine's power-grid that left more than 200,000 people temporarily without power. A mining company and a large railway operator were also victims of the attack.Ukraine saw a massive surge in cyber attacks during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Several websites belonging to Ukrainian banks and government departments became inaccessible.\n\n\n**** United Kingdom ****\nMI6 reportedly infiltrated an Al Qaeda website and replaced the instructions for making a pipe bomb with the recipe for making cupcakes.In October 2010, Iain Lobban, the director of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), said the UK faces a \"real and credible\" threat from cyber attacks by hostile states and criminals and government systems are targeted 1,000 times each month, such attacks threatened the UK's economic future, and some countries were already using cyber assaults to put pressure on other nations.On 12 November 2013, financial organizations in London conducted cyber war games dubbed \"Waking Shark 2\" to simulate massive internet-based attacks against bank and other financial organizations. The Waking Shark 2 cyber war games followed a similar exercise in Wall Street.\n\n\n*** Middle East ***\n\n\n**** Iran ****\n\nIran has been both victim and perpetrator of several cyberwarfare operations. Iran is considered an emerging military power in the field.\n\nIn September 2010, Iran was attacked by the Stuxnet worm, thought to specifically target its Natanz nuclear enrichment facility. It was a 500-kilobyte computer worm that infected at least 14 industrial sites in Iran, including the Natanz uranium-enrichment plant. Although the official authors of Stuxnet haven't been officially identified, Stuxnet is believed to be developed and deployed by the United States and Israel. The worm is said to be the most advanced piece of malware ever discovered and significantly increases the profile of cyberwarfare.Iranian Cyber Police department, FATA, was dismissed one year after its creation in 2011 because of the arrest and death of Sattar Behesti, a blogger, in the custody of FATA. Since then, the main responsible institution for the cyberwarfare in Iran is the \"Cyber Defense Command\" operating under the Joint Staff of Iranian Armed Forces.\n\n\n**** Israel ****\nIn the 2006 war against Hezbollah, Israel alleges that cyber-warfare was part of the conflict, where the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) intelligence estimates several countries in the Middle East used Russian hackers and scientists to operate on their behalf. As a result, Israel attached growing importance to cyber-tactics, and became, along with the U.S., France and a couple of other nations, involved in cyber-war planning. Many international high-tech companies are now locating research and development operations in Israel, where local hires are often veterans of the IDF's elite computer units. Richard A. Clarke adds that \"our Israeli friends have learned a thing or two from the programs we have been working on for more than two decades.\":\u200a8\u200aIn September 2007, Israel carried out an airstrike on a suspected nuclear reactor in Syria dubbed Operation Orchard. U.S. industry and military sources speculated that the Israelis may have used cyberwarfare to allow their planes to pass undetected by radar into Syria.Following US President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018, cyber warfare units in the United States and Israel monitoring internet traffic out of Iran noted a surge in retaliatory cyber attacks from Iran. Security firms warned that Iranian hackers were sending emails containing malware to diplomats who work in the foreign affairs offices of US allies and employees at telecommunications companies, trying to infiltrate their computer systems.\n\n\n**** Saudi Arabia ****\nOn 15 August 2012 at 11:08 am local time, the Shamoon virus began destroying over 35,000 computer systems, rendering them inoperable. The virus used to target the Saudi government by causing destruction to the state owned national oil company Saudi Aramco. The attackers posted a pastie on PasteBin.com hours prior to the wiper logic bomb occurring, citing oppression and the Al-Saud regime as a reason behind the attack.  The attack was well staged according to Chris Kubecka, a former security advisor to Saudi Aramco after the attack and group leader of security for Aramco Overseas. It was an unnamed Saudi Aramco employee on the Information Technology team which opened a malicious phishing email, allowing initial entry into the computer network around mid-2012.\nKubecka also detailed in her Black Hat USA talk Saudi Aramco placed the majority of their security budget on the ICS control network, leaving the business network at risk for a major incident. \"When you realize most of your security budget was spent on ICS & IT gets Pwnd\". The virus has been noted to have behavior differing from other malware attacks, due to the destructive nature and the cost of the attack and recovery. US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called the attack a \"Cyber Pearl Harbor\". Known years later as the \"Biggest hack in history\" and intended for cyber warfare. Shamoon can spread from an infected machine to other computers on the network. Once a system is infected, the virus continues to compile a list of files from specific locations on the system, upload them to the attacker, and erase them. Finally the virus overwrites the master boot record of the infected computer, making it unusable. The virus has been used for cyber warfare against the national oil companies Saudi Aramco and Qatar's RasGas.Saudi Aramco announced the attack on their Facebook page and went offline again until a company statement was issued on 25 August 2012. The statement falsely reported normal business was resumed on 25 August 2012. However a Middle Eastern journalist leaked photographs taken on 1 September 2012 showing kilometers of petrol trucks unable to be loaded due to backed business systems still inoperable. \n\nOn 29 August 2012 the same attackers behind Shamoon posted another pastie on PasteBin.com, taunting Saudi Aramco with proof they still retained access to the company network. The post contained the username and password on security and network equipment and the new password for the CEO Khalid Al- Falih The attackers also referenced a portion of the Shamoon malware as further proof in the pastie.According to Kubecka, in order to restore operations. Saudi Aramco used its large private fleet of aircraft and available funds to purchase much of the world's hard drives, driving the price up. New hard drives were required as quickly as possible so oil prices were not affected by speculation. By 1 September 2012 gasoline resources were dwindling for the public of Saudi Arabia 17 days after the 15 August attack. RasGas was also affected by a different variant, crippling them in a similar manner.\n\n\n**** Qatar ****\nIn March 2018 American Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy filed a lawsuit against Qatar, alleging that Qatar's government stole and leaked his emails in order to discredit him because he was viewed \"as an impediment to their plan to improve the country's standing in Washington.\" In May 2018, the lawsuit named Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, brother of the Emir of Qatar, and his associate Ahmed Al-Rumaihi, as allegedly orchestrating Qatar's cyber warfare campaign against Broidy. Further litigation revealed that the same cybercriminals who targeted Broidy had targeted as many as 1,200 other individuals, some of whom are also \"well-known enemies of Qatar\" such as senior officials of the U.A.E., Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain. While these hackers almost always obscured their location, some of their activity was traced to a telecommunication network in Qatar.\n\n\n**** United Arab Emirates ****\nThe United Arab Emirates has launched several cyber-attacks in the past targeting dissidents. Ahmed Mansoor, an Emirati citizen, was jailed for sharing his thoughts on Facebook and Twitter. He was given the code name Egret under the state-led covert project called Raven, which spied on top political opponents, dissidents, and journalists. Project Raven deployed a secret hacking tool called Karma, to spy without requiring the target to engage with any web links.In September 2021, three of the former American intelligence officers, Marc Baier, Ryan Adams, and Daniel Gericke, admitted to assisting the UAE in hacking crimes by providing them with advanced technology and violating US laws. Under a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department, the three defendants also agreed to pay nearly $1.7 million in fines to evade prison sentences. The court documents revealed that the Emirates hacked into the computers and mobile phones of dissidents, activists, and journalists. They also attempted to break into the systems of the US and rest of the world.\n\n\n*** North America ***\n\n\n**** United States ****\n\nCyberwarfare in the United States is a part of the American military strategy of proactive cyber defence and the use of cyberwarfare as a platform for attack. The new United States military strategy makes explicit that a cyberattack is casus belli just as a traditional act of war.U.S. government security expert Richard A. Clarke, in his book Cyber War (May 2010), had defined \"cyberwarfare\" as \"actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption.\":\u200a6\u200a The Economist describes cyberspace as \"the fifth domain of warfare,\" and William J. Lynn, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, states that \"as a doctrinal matter, the Pentagon has formally recognized cyberspace as a new domain in warfare . . . [which] has become just as critical to military operations as land, sea, air, and space.\"In 2009, president Barack Obama declared America's digital infrastructure to be a \"strategic national asset,\" and in May 2010 the Pentagon set up its new U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), headed by General Keith B. Alexander, director of the National Security Agency (NSA), to defend American military networks and attack other countries' systems. The EU has set up ENISA (European Union Agency for Network and Information Security) which is headed by Prof. Udo Helmbrecht and there are now further plans to significantly expand ENISA's capabilities. The United Kingdom has also set up a cyber-security and \"operations centre\" based in Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British equivalent of the NSA. In the U.S. however, Cyber Command is only set up to protect the military, whereas the government and corporate infrastructures are primarily the responsibility respectively of the Department of Homeland Security and private companies.In February 2010, top American lawmakers warned that the \"threat of a crippling attack on telecommunications and computer networks was sharply on the rise.\" According to The Lipman Report, numerous key sectors of the U.S. economy along with that of other nations, are currently at risk, including cyber threats to public and private facilities, banking and finance, transportation, manufacturing, medical, education and government, all of which are now dependent on computers for daily operations. In 2009, president Obama stated that \"cyber intruders have probed our electrical grids.\"On 19 June 2010, United States Senator Joe Lieberman (I-CT) introduced a bill called \"Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of 2010\", which he co-wrote with Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) and Senator Thomas Carper (D-DE). If signed into law, this controversial bill, which the American media dubbed the \"Kill switch bill\", would grant the president emergency powers over parts of the Internet. However, all three co-authors of the bill issued a statement that instead, the bill \"[narrowed] existing broad presidential authority to take over telecommunications networks\".\nIn June 2012 the New York Times reported that president Obama had ordered the cyber attack on Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities.In July 2010, The Economist wrote that China had plans of \"winning informationised wars by the mid-21st century\",  that other countries were likewise organizing for cyberwar, among them Russia, Israel and North Korea, and that Iran boasted of having the world's second-largest cyber-army. James Gosler, a government cybersecurity specialist, worried that the U.S. has a severe shortage of computer security specialists, estimating that there are only about 1,000 qualified people in the country today, but needs a force of 20,000 to 30,000 skilled experts. At the July 2010 Black Hat computer security conference, Michael Hayden, former deputy director of national intelligence, challenged thousands of attendees to help devise ways to \"reshape the Internet's security architecture\", explaining, \"You guys made the cyberworld look like the north German plain.\"In August 2010, the U.S. for the first time warned publicly about the Chinese military's use of civilian computer experts in clandestine cyber attacks aimed at American companies and government agencies. The Pentagon also pointed to an alleged China-based computer spying network dubbed GhostNet which was revealed in a 2009 research report. The Pentagon stated:\n\nThe People's Liberation Army is using \"information warfare units\" to develop viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks, and those units include civilian computer professionals. Commander Bob Mehal, will monitor the PLA's buildup of its cyberwarfare capabilities and will continue to develop capabilities to counter any potential threat.\n\nThe United States Department of Defense sees the use of computers and the Internet to conduct warfare in cyberspace as a threat to national security. The United States Joint Forces Command describes some of its attributes:\n\nCyberspace technology is emerging as an \"instrument of power\" in societies, and is becoming more available to a country's opponents, who may use it to attack, degrade, and disrupt communications and the flow of information. With low barriers to entry, coupled with the anonymous nature of activities in cyberspace, the list of potential adversaries is broad.  Furthermore, the globe-spanning range of cyberspace and its disregard for national borders will challenge legal systems and complicate a nation's ability to deter threats and respond to contingencies.\n\nIn February 2010, the United States Joint Forces Command released a study which included a summary of the threats posed by the internet:\nWith very little investment, and cloaked in a veil of anonymity, our adversaries will inevitably attempt to harm our national interests. Cyberspace will become a main front in both irregular and traditional conflicts. Enemies in cyberspace will include both states and non-states and will range from the unsophisticated amateur to highly trained professional hackers. Through cyberspace, enemies will target industry, academia, government, as well as the military in the air, land, maritime, and space domains. In much the same way that airpower transformed the battlefield of World War II, cyberspace has fractured the physical barriers that shield a nation from attacks on its commerce and communication. Indeed, adversaries have already taken advantage of computer networks and the power of information technology not only to plan and execute savage acts of terrorism, but also to influence directly the perceptions and will of the U.S. Government and the American population.\nOn 6 October 2011, it was announced that Creech AFB's drone and Predator fleet's command and control data stream had been keylogged, resisting all attempts to reverse the exploit, for the past two weeks. The Air Force issued a statement that the virus had \"posed no threat to our operational mission\".On 21 November 2011, it was widely reported in the U.S. media that a hacker had destroyed a water pump at the Curran-Gardner Township Public Water District in Illinois. However, it later turned out that this information was not only false, but had been inappropriately leaked from the Illinois Statewide Terrorism and Intelligence Center.In 2012, the US used cyberattacks for tactical advantage in Afghanistan.According to a 2013 Foreign Policy magazine article, NSA's Tailored Access Operations (TAO) unit \"has successfully penetrated Chinese computer and telecommunications systems for almost 15 years, generating some of the best and most reliable intelligence information about what is going on inside the People's Republic of China.\"In 2013 cyberwarfare was, for the first time, considered a larger threat than Al Qaeda or terrorism, by many U.S. intelligence officials. In 2017, Representative Mike Rogers, chairman of the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, for instance, said that \n\"We are in a cyber war in this country, and most Americans don't know it. And we are not necessarily winning. We have got huge challenges when it comes to cybersecurity.\"In 2014, Barack Obama ordered an intensification of cyberwarfare against North Korea's missile program for sabotaging test launches in their opening seconds. \nOn 24 November 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment hack was a release of confidential data belonging to Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE).\nIn June 2015, the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced that it had been the target of a data breach targeting the records of as many as four million people. Later, FBI Director James Comey put the number at 18 million. The Washington Post has reported that the attack originated in China, citing unnamed government officials.In October 2016, Jeh Johnson the United States Secretary of Homeland Security and James Clapper the U.S. Director of National Intelligence issued a joint statement accusing Russia of interfering with the 2016 United States presidential election. The New York Times reported the Obama administration formally accused Russia of stealing and disclosing Democratic National Committee emails. Under U.S. law (50 U.S.C.Title 50 \u2013 War and National Defense, Chapter 15 \u2013 National Security, Subchapter III Accountability for Intelligence Activities) there must be a formal Presidential finding prior to authorizing a covert attack. Then U.S. vice president Joe Biden said on the American news interview program Meet The Press that the United States will respond. The New York Times noted that Biden's comment \"seems to suggest that Mr. Obama is prepared to order \u2013 or has already ordered \u2013 some kind of covert action\". \nIn 2016 President Barack Obama authorized the planting of cyber weapons in Russian infrastructure in the final weeks of his presidency in response to Moscow's interference in the 2016 presidential election. On 29 December 2016 United States imposed the most extensive sanctions against Russia since the Cold War, expelling 35 Russian diplomats from the United States.Economic sanctions are the most frequently used the foreign policy instruments by the United States today Thus, it is not surprising to see that economic sanctions are also used as counter policies against cyberattacks. According to Onder (2021), economic sanctions are also information gathering mechanisms for the sanctioning states about the capabilities of the sanctioned states.In March 2017, WikiLeaks published more than 8,000 documents on the CIA. The confidential documents, codenamed Vault 7 and dated from 2013 to 2016, include details on CIA's software capabilities, such as the ability to compromise cars, smart TVs, web browsers (including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera Software ASA), and the operating systems of most smartphones (including Apple's iOS and Google's Android), as well as other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.For a global perspective of countries and other actors engaged in cyber warfare, see the George Washington University-based National Security Archive's CyberWar map.\n\n== Cyberpeace ==\n\nThe rise of cyber as a warfighting domain has led to efforts to determine how cyberspace can be used to foster peace.  For example, the German civil rights panel FIfF runs a campaign for cyberpeace \u2212 for the control of cyberweapons and surveillance technology and against the militarization of cyberspace and the development and stockpiling of offensive exploits and malware. Measures for cyberpeace include policymakers developing new rules and norms for warfare, individuals and organizations building new tools and secure infrastructures, promoting open source, the establishment of cyber security centers, auditing of critical infrastructure cybersecurity, obligations to disclose vulnerabilities, disarmament, defensive security strategies, decentralization, education and widely applying relevant tools and infrastructures, encryption and other cyberdefenses.The topics of cyber peacekeeping and cyber peacemaking have also been studied by researchers, as a way to restore and strengthen peace in the aftermath of both cyber and traditional warfare.\n\n== Cyber counterintelligence ==\nCyber counter-intelligence are measures to identify, penetrate, or neutralize foreign operations that use cyber means as the primary tradecraft methodology, as well as foreign intelligence service collection efforts that use traditional methods to gauge cyber capabilities and intentions.\nOn 7 April 2009, The Pentagon announced they spent more than $100 million in the last six months responding to and repairing damage from cyber attacks and other computer network problems.\nOn 1 April 2009, U.S. lawmakers pushed for the appointment of a White House cyber security \"czar\" to dramatically escalate U.S. defenses against cyber attacks, crafting proposals that would empower the government to set and enforce security standards for private industry for the first time.\nOn 9 February 2009, the White House announced that it will conduct a review of the country's cyber security to ensure that the Federal government of the United States cyber security initiatives are appropriately integrated, resourced and coordinated with the United States Congress and the private sector.\nIn the wake of the 2007 cyberwar waged against Estonia, NATO established the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD CoE) in Tallinn, Estonia, in order to enhance the organization's cyber defence capability. The center was formally established on 14 May 2008, and it received full accreditation by NATO and attained the status of International Military Organization on 28 October 2008. Since Estonia has led international efforts to fight cybercrime, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation says it will permanently base a computer crime expert in Estonia in 2009 to help fight international threats against computer systems.\nIn 2015, the Department of Defense released an updated cyber strategy memorandum detailing the present and future tactics deployed in the service of defense against cyberwarfare.  In this memorandum, three cybermissions are laid out.  The first cybermission seeks to arm and maintain existing capabilities in the area of cyberspace, the second cybermission focuses on prevention of cyberwarfare, and the third cybermission includes strategies for retaliation and preemption (as distinguished from prevention).One of the hardest issues in cyber counterintelligence is the problem of attribution. Unlike conventional warfare, figuring out who is behind an attack can be very difficult. However Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has claimed that the United States has the capability to trace attacks back to their sources and hold the attackers \"accountable\".\n\n== Doubts about existence ==\nIn October 2011 the Journal of Strategic Studies, a leading journal in that field, published an article by Thomas Rid, \"Cyber War Will Not Take Place\" which argued that all politically motivated cyber attacks are merely sophisticated versions of sabotage, espionage, or subversion \u2013 and that it is unlikely that cyber war will occur in the future.\n\n== Legal perspective ==\nNIST, a cyberwarfare framework, was published in 2014 in the US.S.The Tallinn Manual, published in 2013, is an academic, non-binding study on how international law, in particular the jus ad bellum and international humanitarian law, apply to cyber conflicts and cyber warfare. It was written at the invitation of the Tallinn-based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence by an international group of approximately twenty experts between 2009 and 2012.The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (members of which include China and Russia) defines cyberwar to include dissemination of information \"harmful to the spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other states\". In September 2011, these countries proposed to the UN Secretary General a document called \"International code of conduct for information security\".In contrast, the United approach focuses on physical and economic damage and injury, putting political concerns under freedom of speech. This difference of opinion has led to reluctance in the West to pursue global cyber arms control agreements. However, American General Keith B. Alexander did endorse talks with Russia over a proposal to limit military attacks in cyberspace. In June 2013, Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin agreed to install a secure Cyberwar-Hotline providing \"a direct secure voice communications line between the US cybersecurity coordinator and the Russian deputy secretary of the security council, should there be a need to directly manage a crisis situation arising from an ICT security incident\" (White House quote).A Ukrainian international law scholar, Alexander Merezhko, has developed a project called the International Convention on Prohibition of Cyberwar in Internet. According to this project, cyberwar is defined as the use of Internet and related technological means by one state against the political, economic, technological and information sovereignty and independence of another state. Professor Merezhko's project suggests that the Internet ought to remain free from warfare tactics and be treated as an international landmark. He states that the Internet (cyberspace) is a \"common heritage of mankind\".On the February 2017 RSA Conference Microsoft president Brad Smith suggested global rules \u2013 a \"Digital Geneva Convention\" \u2013 for cyber attacks that \"ban the nation-state hacking of all the civilian aspects of our economic and political infrastructures\". He also stated that an independent organization could investigate and publicly disclose evidence that attributes nation-state attacks to specific countries. Furthermore, he said that the technology sector should collectively and neutrally work together to protect Internet users and pledge to remain neutral in conflict and not aid governments in offensive activity and to adopt a coordinated disclosure process for software and hardware vulnerabilities. A fact-binding body has also been proposed to regulate cyber operations.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n*** In films ***\n\nIndependence Day (1996)\nTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)\nLive Free or Die Hard (2007)\nTerminator Genisys (2015)\nSnowden (2016)\nTerminator: Dark Fate (2019)Documentaries\nHacking the Infrastructure: Cyber Warfare (2016) by Viceland\nCyber War Threat (2015)\nDarknet, Hacker, Cyberwar (2017)\nZero Days (2016)\nThe Perfect Weapon (2020)\n\n\n*** In television ***\n\"Cancelled\", an episode of the animated sitcom South Park\nSeries 2 of COBRA, a British thriller series, revolves around a sustained campaign of cyberwar against the United Kingdom and the British government's response to it.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question.

      "context": "Cyberwarfare\n\n==Introduction==\nCyberwarfare is the use of cyber attacks against an enemy state, causing comparable harm to actual warfare and/or disrupting vital computer systems. Some intended outcomes could be espionage, sabotage, propaganda, manipulation or economic warfare.\nThere is significant debate among experts regarding the definition of cyberwarfare, and even if such a thing exists. One view is that the term is a misnomer, since no cyber attacks to date could be described as war. An alternative view is that it is a suitable label for cyber attacks which cause physical damage to people and objects in the real world.Many countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Russia, China, Israel, Iran, and North Korea have active cyber capabilities for offensive and defensive operations. As states explore the use of cyber operations and combine capabilities, the likelihood of physical confrontation and violence playing out as a result of, or part of, a cyber operation is increased. However, meeting the scale and protracted nature of war is unlikely, thus ambiguity remains.The first instance of kinetic military action used in response to a cyber-attack resulting in the loss of human life was observed on 5 May 2019, when the Israel Defense Forces targeted and destroyed a building associated with an ongoing cyber-attack.\n\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThere is ongoing debate over how cyberwarfare should be defined and no absolute definition is widely agreed upon. While the majority of scholars, militaries and governments use definitions which refer to state and state-sponsored actors, other definitions may include non-state actors, such as terrorist groups, companies, political or ideological extremist groups, hacktivists, and transnational criminal organizations depending on the context of the work.Examples of definitions proposed by experts in the field are as follows.\n\n'Cyberwarfare' is used in a broad context to denote interstate use of technological force within computer networks in which information is stored, shared or communicated online.Parks and Duggan focused on analyzing cyberwarfare in terms of computer networks and pointed out that \"Cyberwarfare is a combination of computer network attack and defense and special technical operations.\" According to this perspective, the notion of cyberwarfare brings a new paradigm into the military doctrine. Paulo Shakarian and colleagues, put forward the following definition in 2013 drawing from various works including Clausewitz's definition of war: \"War is the continuation of politics by other means\":Cyberwarfare is an extension of policy by actions taken in cyberspace by state actors (or by non-state actors with significant state direction or support) that constitute a serious threat to another state's security, or an action of the same nature taken in response to a serious threat to a state's security (actual or perceived).\nTaddeo offered the following definition in 2012:\n\nThe warfare grounded on certain uses of ICTs within an offensive or defensive military strategy endorsed by a state and aiming at the immediate disruption or control of the enemy's resources, and which is waged within the informational environment, with agents and targets ranging both on the physical and non-physical domains and whose level of violence may vary upon circumstances.\nRobinson et al. proposed in 2015, that the intent of the attacker dictates whether an attack is warfare or not, defining cyber warfare as \"the use of cyber attacks with a warfare-like intent.\"In 2010, the former US National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection and Counter-terrorism, Richard A. Clarke, defined cyberwarfare as \"actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption.\" Own cyber-physical infrastructure may be weaponized and used by the adversary in case of a cyber conflict, thus turning such infrastructure into tactical weapons.\n\n\n*** Controversy of term ***\nThere is debate on whether the term \"cyberwarfare\" is accurate. In 2012, Eugene Kaspersky, founder of Kaspersky Lab, concludes that \"cyberterrorism\" is a more accurate term than \"cyberwar.\" He states that \"with today's attacks, you are clueless about who did it or when they will strike again. It's not cyber-war, but cyberterrorism.\" Howard Schmidt, former Cyber Security Coordinator of the Obama Administration, said that \"there is no cyberwar... I think that is a terrible metaphor and I think that is a terrible concept. There are no winners in that environment.\"Some experts take issue with the possible consequences linked to the warfare analogy. In 2011, Ron Deibert, of Canada's Citizen Lab, has warned of a \"militarization of cyberspace\", as militaristic responses may not be appropriate. Although, to date, even serious cyber attacks which have disrupted large parts of a nations electrical grids (230,000 customers, Ukraine, 2015) or affected access to medical care, thus endangering life (NHS, WannaCry, 2017) have not led to military action.In 2017, Oxford academic Lucas Kello proposed a new term \u2013 \"Unpeace\" \u2013 to denote highly damaging cyber actions whose non-violent effects do not rise to the level of traditional war. Such actions are neither warlike nor peace-like. Although they are non-violent, and thus not acts of war, their damaging effects on the economy and society may be greater than even some armed attacks. This term is closely related to the concept of the \"grey zone\" which has come to prominence in 2017, describing actions which fall below the traditional threshold of war.\n\n\n*** Cyberwarfare vs. cyber war ***\nThe term \"cyberwarfare\" is distinct from the term \"cyber war.\" \"Cyberwarfare\" does not imply scale, protraction or violence which are typically associated with the term \"war\". Cyber warfare includes techniques, tactics and procedures which may be involved in a cyber war. The term war inherently refers to a large scale action, typically over a protracted period of time and may include objectives seeking to utilize violence or the aim to kill. A cyber war could accurately describe a protracted period of back-and-forth cyber attacks (including in combination with traditional military action) between warring states. To date, no such action is known to have occurred. Instead, tit-for-tat military-cyber actions are more commonplace. For example, in June 2019, the United States launched a cyber attack against Iranian weapons systems in retaliation to the shooting down of a US drone being in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\n\n*** Cyberwarfare and cyber sanctions ***\nThe use of digital attacks, as described by the concept of cyberwarfare, in this page can be a retaliatory response to the cyber attacks. In addition, countries can use cyber sanctions as a reaction to being the targets of the cyber attacks. Sometimes, it is not easy to detect the attacker; however, it might be the case that suspicions can focus on a certain country or group of countries. In these cases, unilateral and multilateral economic sanctions can be used instead of cyberwarfare. For example, economic sanctions related to cyber attacks have been frequently used by the United States government. There are two Executive Orders, EO 13694 in 2015 and EO 13757 in 2016, issued during the Obama administration specifically focused on the implementation of the cyber sanctions. Later on, these Executive Orders have been frequently used by the following US presidents. Furthermore, the Congress is an important actor when it comes to the cyber sanctions. For example, Iran Cyber Sanctions Act of 2016 is a bill that imposes sanctions on specific individuals responsible for the cyber attacks.\n\n== Types of threat ==\n\n== Types of warfare ==\nCyber warfare can present a multitude of threats towards a nation. At the most basic level, cyber attacks can be used to support traditional warfare. For example, tampering with the operation of air defenses via cyber means in order to facilitate an air attack. Aside from these \"hard\" threats, cyber warfare can also contribute towards \"soft\" threats such as espionage and propaganda.\nEugene Kaspersky, founder of Kaspersky Lab, equates large-scale cyber weapons, such as Flame and NetTraveler which his company discovered, to biological weapons, claiming that in an interconnected world, they have the potential to be equally destructive.\n\n\n*** Espionage ***\n\nTraditional espionage is not an act of war, nor is cyber-espionage, and both are generally assumed to be ongoing between major powers. Despite this assumption, some incidents can cause serious tensions between nations, and are often described as \"attacks\". For example:\nMassive spying by the US on many countries, revealed by Edward Snowden.\nAfter the NSA's spying on Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel was revealed, the Chancellor compared the NSA with the Stasi.\nThe NSA recording nearly every cell phone conversation in the Bahamas, without the Bahamian government's permission, and similar programs in Kenya, the Philippines, Mexico and Afghanistan.\nThe \"Titan Rain\" probes of American defense contractors computer systems since 2003.\nThe Office of Personnel Management data breach, in the US, widely attributed to China.\nThe security firm Area 1 published details of a breach that compromised one of the European Union's diplomatic communication channels for three years.Out of all cyber attacks, 25% of them are espionage based.\n\n\n*** Sabotage ***\nComputers and satellites that coordinate other activities are vulnerable components of a system and could lead to the disruption of equipment. Compromise of military systems, such as C4ISTAR components that are responsible for orders and communications could lead to their interception or malicious replacement. Power, water, fuel, communications, and transportation infrastructure all may be vulnerable to disruption. According to Clarke, the civilian realm is also at risk, noting that the security breaches have already gone beyond stolen credit card numbers, and that potential targets can also include the electric power grid, trains, or the stock market.In mid-July 2010, security experts discovered a malicious software program called Stuxnet that had infiltrated factory computers and had spread to plants around the world. It is considered \"the first attack on critical industrial infrastructure that sits at the foundation of modern economies,\" notes The New York Times.Stuxnet, while extremely effective in delaying Iran's nuclear program for the development of nuclear weaponry, came at a high cost. For the first time, it became clear that not only could cyber weapons be defensive but they could be offensive. The large decentralization and scale of cyberspace makes it extremely difficult to direct from a policy perspective. Non-state actors can play as large a part in the cyberwar space as state actors, which leads to dangerous, sometimes disastrous, consequences. Small groups of highly skilled malware developers are able to as effectively impact global politics and cyber warfare as large governmental agencies. A major aspect of this ability lies in the willingness of these groups to share their exploits and developments on the web as a form of arms proliferation. This allows lesser hackers to become more proficient in creating the large scale attacks that once only a small handful were skillful enough to manage. In addition, thriving black markets for these kinds of cyber weapons are buying and selling these cyber capabilities to the highest bidder without regard for consequences.\n\n\n**** Denial-of-service attack ****\n\nIn computing, a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. Perpetrators of DoS attacks typically target sites or services hosted on high-profile web servers such as banks, credit card payment gateways, and even root nameservers. DoS attacks often leverage internet-connected devices with vulnerable security measures to carry out these large-scale attacks. DoS attacks may not be limited to computer-based methods, as strategic physical attacks against infrastructure can be just as devastating. For example, cutting undersea communication cables may severely cripple some regions and countries with regards to their information warfare ability.\n\n\n**** Electrical power grid ****\nThe federal government of the United States admits that the electric power grid is susceptible to cyberwarfare. The United States Department of Homeland Security works with industries to identify vulnerabilities and to help industries enhance the security of control system networks. The federal government is also working to ensure that security is built in as the next generation of \"smart grid\" networks are developed. In April 2009, reports surfaced that China and Russia had infiltrated the U.S. electrical grid and left behind software programs that could be used to disrupt the system, according to current and former national security officials. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) has issued a public notice that warns that the electrical grid is not adequately protected from cyber attack. China denies intruding into the U.S. electrical grid. One countermeasure would be to disconnect the power grid from the Internet and run the net with droop speed control only. Massive power outages caused by a cyber attack could disrupt the economy, distract from a simultaneous military attack, or create a national trauma.Iranian hackers, possibly Iranian Cyber Army pushed a massive power outage for 12 hours in 44 of 81 provinces of Turkey, impacting 40 million people. Istanbul and Ankara were among the places suffering blackout.Howard Schmidt, former Cyber-Security Coordinator of the US, commented on those possibilities:\nIt's possible that hackers have gotten into administrative computer systems of utility companies, but says those aren't linked to the equipment controlling the grid, at least not in developed countries. [Schmidt] has never heard that the grid itself has been hacked.\nIn June 2019, Russia said that its electrical grid has been under cyber-attack by the United States. The New York Times reported that American hackers from the United States Cyber Command planted malware potentially capable of disrupting the Russian electrical grid.\n\n\n*** Propaganda ***\nCyber propaganda is an effort to control information in whatever form it takes, and influence public opinion. It is a form of psychological warfare, except it uses social media, fake news websites and other digital means. In 2018, Sir Nicholas Carter, Chief of the General Staff of the British Army stated that this kind of attack from actors such as Russia \"is a form of system warfare that seeks to de-legitimize the political and social system on which our military strength is based\".Jowell and O'Donnell (2006) state that \"propaganda is the deliberate, systematic attempt to shape perceptions, manipulate cognitions, and direct behavior to achieve a response that furthers the desired intent of the propagandist\" (p. 7). The internet is the most important means of communication today. People can convey their messages quickly across to a huge audience, and this can open a window for evil. Terrorist organizations can exploit this and may use this medium to brainwash people. It has been suggested that restricted media coverage of terrorist attacks would in turn decrease the number of terrorist attacks that occur afterwards.\n\n\n*** Economic disruption ***\nIn 2017, the WannaCry and Petya (NotPetya) cyber attacks, masquerading as ransomware, caused large-scale disruptions in Ukraine as well as to the U.K.'s National Health Service, pharmaceutical giant Merck, Maersk shipping company and other organizations around the world. These attacks are also categorized as cybercrimes, specifically financial crime because they negatively affect a company or group.\n\n\n*** Surprise cyber attack ***\nThe idea of a \"cyber Pearl Harbor\" has been debated by scholars, drawing an analogy to the historical act of war. Others have used \"cyber 9/11\" to draw attention to the nontraditional, asymmetric, or irregular aspect of cyber action against a state.\n\n== Motivations ==\nThere are a number of reasons nations undertake offensive cyber operations. Sandro Gaycken, a cyber security expert and adviser to NATO, advocates that states take cyber warfare seriously as they are viewed as an attractive activity by many nations, in times of war and peace. Offensive cyber operations offer a large variety of cheap and risk-free options to weaken other countries and strengthen their own positions. Considered from a long-term, geostrategic perspective, cyber offensive operations can cripple whole economies, change political views, agitate conflicts within or among states, reduce their military efficiency and equalize the capacities of high-tech nations to that of low-tech nations, and use access to their critical infrastructures to blackmail them.\n\n\n*** Military ***\nWith the emergence of cyber as a substantial threat to national and global security, cyber war, warfare and/or attacks also became a domain of interest and purpose for the military.In the U.S., General Keith B. Alexander, first head of USCYBERCOM, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that computer network warfare is evolving so rapidly that there is a \"mismatch between our technical capabilities to conduct operations and the governing laws and policies. Cyber Command is the newest global combatant and its sole mission is cyberspace, outside the traditional battlefields of land, sea, air and space.\" It will attempt to find and, when necessary, neutralize cyberattacks and to defend military computer networks.Alexander sketched out the broad battlefield envisioned for the computer warfare command, listing the kind of targets that his new headquarters could be ordered to attack, including \"traditional battlefield prizes \u2013 command-and-control systems at military headquarters, air defense networks and weapons systems that require computers to operate.\"One cyber warfare scenario, Cyber-ShockWave, which was wargamed on the cabinet level by former administration officials, raised issues ranging from the National Guard to the power grid to the limits of statutory authority.The distributed nature of internet based attacks means that it is difficult to determine motivation and attacking party, meaning that it is unclear when a specific act should be considered an act of war.Examples of cyberwarfare driven by political motivations can be found worldwide. In 2008, Russia began a cyber attack on the Georgian government website, which was carried out along with Georgian military operations in South Ossetia. In 2008, Chinese \"nationalist hackers\" attacked CNN as it reported on Chinese repression on Tibet. Hackers from Armenia and Azerbaijan have actively participated in cyberwarfare as part of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, with Azerbaijani hackers targeting Armenian websites and posting Ilham Aliyev's statements.Jobs in cyberwarfare have become increasingly popular in the military. All four branches of the United States military actively recruit for cyber warfare positions.As the military have become more and more entangled into the national and global threat proposed by the utilization of the cyber domain, a new research field within the Military Science field have slowly emerged. In essence, its focus is centered towards describing, understanding and explaining what Military Cyber Operations is, can do and be tackled. In the Handbook of Military Sciences Aaron Brantly and Max Smeets define Military Cyber Operations to be \"those cyber operations which a military entity of a nation-state plans and conducts to achieve strategic, operational, or tactical gain.\" More so, they argue these types of military operations are commonly divided into three types of operations.\n\nDefensive Cyber Operations: Encompassing \"those actions taken through the use of computer networks to protect, monitor, analyze, detect, and respond to unauthorized activity within a governments information systems and computer networks\".\nCyber Espionage Operations: Encompassing \"those actions taken through the use of computer networks to gather data from target or adversary information systems or network\".\"\nOffensive Cyber Operations: Encompassing \"those actions taken through the use of computer networks to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves, or in basic, operations designed to achieve tangible effects\".\"\n\n\n*** Civil ***\nPotential targets in internet sabotage include all aspects of the Internet from the backbones of the web, to the internet service providers, to the varying types of data communication mediums and network equipment. This would include: web servers, enterprise information systems, client server systems, communication links, network equipment, and the desktops and laptops in businesses and homes. Electrical grids, financial networks, and telecommunication systems are also deemed vulnerable, especially due to current trends in computerization and automation.\n\n\n*** Hacktivism ***\nPolitically motivated hacktivism involves the subversive use of computers and computer networks to promote an agenda, and can potentially extend to attacks, theft and virtual sabotage that could be seen as cyberwarfare \u2013 or mistaken for it.\nHacktivists use their knowledge and software tools to gain unauthorized access to computer systems they seek to manipulate or damage not for material gain or to cause widespread destruction, but to draw attention to their cause through well-publicized disruptions of select targets. Anonymous and other hacktivist groups are often portrayed in the media as cyber-terrorists, wreaking havoc by hacking websites, posting sensitive information about their victims, and threatening further attacks if their demands are not met. However, hacktivism is more than that. Actors are politically motivated to change the world, through the use of fundamentalism. Groups like Anonymous, however, have divided opinion with their methods.\n\n\n*** Income generation ***\nCyber attacks, including ransomware, can be used to generate income. States can use these techniques to generate significant sources of income, which can evade sanctions and perhaps while simultaneously harming adversaries (depending on targets). This tactic was observed in August 2019 when it was revealed North Korea had generated $2 billion to fund its weapons program, avoiding the blanket of sanctions levied by the United States, United Nations and the European Union.\n\n\n*** Private sector ***\n\nComputer hacking represents a modern threat in ongoing global conflicts and industrial espionage and as such is presumed to widely occur. It is typical that this type of crime is underreported to the extent they are known. According to McAfee's George Kurtz, corporations around the world face millions of cyberattacks a day. \"Most of these attacks don't gain any media attention or lead to strong political statements by victims.\" This type of crime is usually financially motivated.\n\n\n*** Non-profit research ***\nBut not all those who engage in cyberwarfare do so for financial or ideological reasons. There are institutes and companies like the University of Cincinnati or the Kaspersky Security Lab which engage in cyberwarfare so as to better understand the field through actions like the researching and publishing of new security threats.\n\n== Preparedness ==\nA number of countries conduct exercise to increase preparedness and explore the strategy, tactics and operations involved in conducting and defending against cyber attacks against hostile states, this is typically done in the form of war games.The Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCE), part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), have conducted a yearly war game called Locked Shields since 2010 designed to test readiness and improve skills, strategy tactics and operational decision making of participating national organizations. Locked Shields 2019 saw 1200 participants from 30 countries compete in a red team vs. blue team exercise. The war game involved a fictional country, Berylia, which was \"experiencing a deteriorating security situation, where a number of hostile events coincide with coordinated cyber attacks against a major civilian internet service provider and maritime surveillance system. The attacks caused severe disruptions in the power generation and distribution, 4G communication systems, maritime surveillance, water purification plant and other critical infrastructure components\". CCDCE describe the aim of the exercise was to \"maintain the operation of various systems under intense pressure, the strategic part addresses the capability to understand the impact of decisions made at the strategic and policy level.\" Ultimately, France was the winner of Locked Shields 2019.The European Union conducts cyber war game scenarios with member states and foreign partner states to improve readiness, skills and observe how strategic and tactical decisions may affect the scenario.As well as war games which serve a broader purpose to explore options and improve skills, cyber war games are targeted at preparing for specific threats. In 2018 the Sunday Times reported the UK government was conducting cyber war games which could \"blackout Moscow\". These types of war games move beyond defensive preparedness, as previously described above and onto preparing offensive capabilities which can be used as deterrence, or for \"war\".\n\n== Cyber activities by nation ==\n\nApproximately 120 countries have been developing ways to use the Internet as a weapon and target financial markets, government computer systems and utilities.\n\n\n*** Asia ***\n\n\n**** China ****\n\nForeign Policy magazine puts the size of China's \"hacker army\" at anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 individuals.Diplomatic cables highlight US concerns that China is using access to Microsoft source code and 'harvesting the talents of its private sector' to boost its offensive and defensive capabilities.The 2018 cyberattack on the Marriott hotel chain that collected personal details of roughly 500 million guests is now known to be a part of a Chinese intelligence-gathering effort that also hacked health insurers and the security clearance files of millions more Americans, The hackers, are suspected of working on behalf of the Ministry of State Security (MSS), the country's Communist-controlled civilian spy agency.  \"The information is exactly what the Chinese use to root out spies, recruit intelligence agents and build a rich repository of Americans' personal data for future targeting.\"\nA 2008 article in the Culture Mandala: The Bulletin of the Centre for East-West Cultural and Economic Studies by Jason Fritz alleges that the Chinese government from 1995 to 2008 was involved in a number of high-profile cases of espionage, primarily through the use of a \"decentralized network of students, business people, scientists, diplomats, and engineers from within the Chinese Diaspora\". A defector in Belgium, purportedly an agent, claimed that there were hundreds of spies in industries throughout Europe, and on his defection to Australia Chinese diplomat Chen Yonglin said there were over 1,000 such in that country.  In 2007, a Russian executive was sentenced to 11 years for passing information about the rocket and space technology organization to China. Targets in the United States have included \"aerospace engineering programs, space shuttle design, C4ISR data, high-performance computers, Nuclear weapon design, cruise missile data, semiconductors, integrated circuit design, and details of US arms sales to Taiwan\".While China continues to be held responsible for a string of cyber-attacks on a number of public and private institutions in the United States, India, Russia, Canada, and France, the Chinese government denies any involvement in cyber-spying campaigns. The administration maintains the position that China is not the threat but rather the victim of an increasing number of cyber-attacks. Most reports about China's cyber warfare capabilities have yet to be confirmed by the Chinese government.According to Fritz, China has expanded its cyber capabilities and military technology by acquiring foreign military technology. Fritz states that the Chinese government uses \"new space-based surveillance and intelligence gathering systems, Anti-satellite weapon, anti-radar, infrared decoys, and false target generators\" to assist in this quest, and that they support their \"Informatisation\" of their military through \"increased education of soldiers in cyber warfare; improving the information network for military training, and has built more virtual laboratories, digital libraries and digital campuses.\" Through this informatisation, they hope to prepare their forces to engage in a different kind of warfare, against technically capable adversaries. Many recent news reports link China's technological capabilities to the beginning of a new \"cyber cold war.\"Operation Shady RAT is an ongoing series of cyber attacks starting mid-2006, reported by Internet security company McAfee in August 2011. China is widely believed to be the state actor behind these attacks which hit at least 72 organizations including governments and defense contractors.On 14 September 2020, a database showing personal details of about 2.4 million people around the world was leaked and published.  A Chinese company, Zhenhua Data compiled the database. According to the information from \"National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System\", which is run by State Administration for Market Regulation in China, the shareholders of Zhenhua Data Information Technology Co., Ltd. are two natural persons and one general partnership enterprise whose partners are natural persons. Wang Xuefeng, who is the chief executive and the shareholder of Zhenhua Data, has publicly boasted that he supports \"hybrid warfare\" through manipulation of public opinion and \"psychological warfare\".\n\n\n**** India ****\n\nThe Department of Information Technology created the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) in 2004 to thwart cyber attacks in India. That year, there were 23 reported cyber security breaches. In 2011, there were 13,301. That year, the government created a new subdivision, the National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC) to thwart attacks against energy, transport, banking, telecom, defense, space and other sensitive areas.The executive director of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) stated in February 2013 that his company alone was forced to block up to ten targeted attacks a day. CERT-In was left to protect less critical sectors.A high-profile cyber attack on 12 July 2012 breached the email accounts of about 12,000 people, including those of officials from the Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Home Affairs, Defense Research and Development Organizations (DRDO), and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP). A government-private sector plan being overseen by National Security Advisor (NSA) Shivshankar Menon began in October 2012, and intends to boost up India's cyber security capabilities in the light of a group of experts findings that India faces a 470,000 shortfall of such experts despite the country's reputation of being an IT and software powerhouse.In February 2013, Information Technology Secretary J. Satyanarayana stated that the NCIIPC was finalizing policies related to national cyber security that would focus on domestic security solutions, reducing exposure through foreign technology. Other steps include the isolation of various security agencies to ensure that a synchronised attack could not succeed on all fronts and the planned appointment of a National Cyber Security Coordinator. As of that month, there had been no significant economic or physical damage to India related to cyber attacks.\nOn 26 November 2010, a group calling itself the Indian Cyber Army hacked the websites belonging to the Pakistan Army and the others belong to different ministries, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance, Pakistan Computer Bureau, Council of Islamic Ideology, etc. The attack was done as a revenge for the Mumbai terrorist attacks.On 4 December 2010, a group calling itself the Pakistan Cyber Army hacked the website of India's top investigating agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The National Informatics Center (NIC) has begun an inquiry.In July 2016, Cymmetria researchers discovered and revealed the cyber attack dubbed 'Patchwork', which compromised an estimated 2500 corporate and government agencies using code stolen from GitHub and the dark web. Examples of weapons used are an exploit for the Sandworm vulnerability (CVE-2014-4114), a compiled AutoIt script, and UAC bypass code dubbed UACME. Targets are believed to be mainly military and political assignments around Southeast Asia and the South China Sea and the attackers are believed to be of Indian origin and gathering intelligence from influential parties.The Defence Cyber Agency, which is the Indian Military agency responsible for Cyberwarfare, is expected to become operational by November 2019.\n\n\n**** Iran ****\nThe Iranian state sponsored group MuddyWater is active since at least 2017 and is responsible for many cyber attacks on various sectors.\n\n\n**** Philippines ****\nThe Chinese are being blamed after a cybersecurity company, F-Secure Labs, found a malware, NanHaiShu, which targeted the Philippines Department of Justice. It sent information in an infected machine to a server with a Chinese IP address. The malware which is considered particularly sophisticated in nature was introduced by phishing emails that were designed to look like they were coming from an authentic sources. The information sent is believed to be relating to the South China Sea legal case.\n\n\n**** South Korea ****\n\nIn July 2009, there were a series of coordinated denial of service attacks against major government, news media, and financial websites in South Korea and the United States. While many thought the attack was directed by North Korea, one researcher traced the attacks to the United Kingdom. Security researcher Chris Kubecka presented evidence multiple European Union and United Kingdom companies unwittingly helped attack South Korea due to a W32.Dozer infections, malware used in part of the attack. Some of the companies used in the attack were partially owned by several governments, further complicating attribution.\n\nIn July 2011, the South Korean company SK Communications was hacked, resulting in the theft of the personal details (including names, phone numbers, home and email addresses and resident registration numbers) of up to 35 million people. A trojaned software update was used to gain access to the SK Communications network. Links exist between this hack and other malicious activity and it is believed to be part of a broader, concerted hacking effort.With ongoing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, South Korea's defense ministry stated that South Korea was going to improve cyber-defense strategies in hopes of preparing itself from possible cyber attacks. In March 2013, South Korea's major banks \u2013 Shinhan Bank, Woori Bank and NongHyup Bank \u2013 as well as many broadcasting stations \u2013 KBS, YTN and MBC \u2013 were hacked and more than 30,000 computers were affected; it is one of the biggest attacks South Korea has faced in years. Although it remains uncertain as to who was involved in this incident, there has been immediate assertions that North Korea is connected, as it threatened to attack South Korea's government institutions, major national banks and traditional newspapers numerous times \u2013 in reaction to the sanctions it received from nuclear testing and to the continuation of Foal Eagle, South Korea's annual joint military exercise with the United States. North Korea's cyber warfare capabilities raise the alarm for South Korea, as North Korea is increasing its manpower through military academies specializing in hacking. Current figures state that South Korea only has 400 units of specialized personnel, while North Korea has more than 3,000 highly trained hackers; this portrays a huge gap in cyber warfare capabilities and sends a message to South Korea that it has to step up and strengthen its Cyber Warfare Command forces. Therefore, in order to be prepared from future attacks, South Korea and the United States will discuss further about deterrence plans at the Security Consultative Meeting (SCM). At SCM, they plan on developing strategies that focuses on accelerating the deployment of ballistic missiles as well as fostering its defense shield program, known as the Korean Air and Missile Defense.\n\n\n**** Sri Lanka ****\n\n\n**** North Korea ****\n\n\n*** Africa ***\n\n\n**** Egypt ****\nIn an extension of a bilateral dispute between Ethiopia and Egypt over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, Ethiopian government websites have been hacked by the Egypt-based hackers in June 2020.\n\n\n*** Europe ***\n\n\n**** Cyprus ****\nThe New York Times published an expos\u00e9 revealing an extensive three-year phishing campaign aimed against diplomats based in Cyprus. After accessing the state system the hackers had access to the European Union's entire exchange database. By login into Coreu, hackers accessed communications linking all EU states, on both sensitive and not so sensitive matters. The event exposed poor protection of routine exchanges among European Union officials and a coordinated effort from a foreign entity to spy on another country. \"After over a decade of experience countering Chinese cyberoperations and extensive technical analysis, there is no doubt this campaign is connected to the Chinese government\", said Blake Darche, one of the Area 1 Security experts - the company revealing the stolen documents. The Chinese Embassy in the US did not return calls for comment. In 2019, another coordinated effort took place that allowed hackers to gain access to government (gov.cy) emails. Cisco's Talos Security Department revealed that \"Sea Turtle\" hackers carried out a broad piracy campaign in the DNS countries, hitting 40 different organizations, including Cyprus.\n\n\n**** Estonia ****\nIn April 2007, Estonia came under cyber attack in the wake of relocation of the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn. The largest part of the attacks were coming from Russia and from official servers of the authorities of Russia. In the attack, ministries, banks, and media were targeted. This attack on Estonia, a seemingly small Baltic state, was so effective because of how most of Estonian government services are run online. Estonia has implemented an e-government, where banking services, political elections, taxes, and other components of a modern society are now all done online.\n\n\n**** France ****\n\nIn 2013, the French Minister of Defense, Mr Jean-Yves Le Drian, ordered the creation of a cyber army, representing its fourth national army corps (along with ground, naval and air forces) under the French Ministry of Defense, to protect French and European interests on its soil and abroad. A contract was made with French firm EADS (Airbus) to identify and secure its main elements susceptible to cyber threats. In 2016 France had planned 2600 \"cyber-soldiers\" and a 440 million euros investment for cybersecurity products for this new army corps. An additional 4400 reservists constitute the heart of this army from 2019.\n\n\n**** Germany ****\nIn 2013, Germany revealed the existence of their 60-person Computer Network Operation unit. The German intelligence agency, BND, announced it was seeking to hire 130 \"hackers\" for a new \"cyber defence station\" unit.  In March 2013, BND president Gerhard Schindler announced that his agency had observed up to five attacks a day on government authorities, thought mainly to originate in China.  He confirmed the attackers had so far only accessed data and expressed concern that the stolen information could be used as the basis of future sabotage attacks against arms manufacturers, telecommunications companies and government and military agencies. Shortly after Edward Snowden leaked details of the U.S. National Security Agency's cyber surveillance system, German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich announced that the BND would be given an additional budget of 100 million Euros to increase their cyber surveillance capability from 5% of total internet traffic in Germany to 20% of total traffic, the maximum amount allowed by German law.\n\n\n**** Netherlands ****\n\nIn the Netherlands, Cyber Defense is nationally coordinated by the National Cyber Security Centrum (NCSC). The Dutch Ministry of Defense laid out a cyber strategy in 2011. The first focus is to improve the cyber defense handled by the Joint IT branch (JIVC). To improve intel operations, the intel community in the Netherlands (including the military intel organization, MIVD) has set up the Joint Sigint Cyber Unit (JSCU). The Ministry of Defense oversees an offensive cyber force, called Defensive Cyber Command (DCC).\n\n\n**** Norway ****\n\n\n**** Russia ****\n\nRussian, South Ossetian, Georgian and Azerbaijani sites were attacked by hackers during the 2008 South Ossetia War.American-led cyberattacks against Soviet Union and Russia\n\nWhen Russia was still a part of the Soviet Union in 1982, a portion of a Trans-Siberia pipeline within its territory exploded, allegedly due to a Trojan Horse computer malware implanted in the pirated Canadian software by the Central Intelligence Agency. The malware caused the SCADA system running the pipeline to malfunction. The \"Farewell Dossier\" provided information on this attack, and wrote that compromised computer chips would become a part of Soviet military equipment, flawed turbines would be placed in the gas pipeline, and defective plans would disrupt the output of chemical plants and a tractor factory. This caused the \"most monumental nonnuclear explosion and fire ever seen from space.\" However, the Soviet Union did not blame the United States for the attack.In June 2019, the New York Times reported that American hackers from the United States Cyber Command planted malware potentially capable of disrupting the Russian electrical grid.Russian-led cyberattacks\n\nIt has been claimed that Russian security services organized a number of denial of service attacks as a part of their cyber-warfare against other countries, most notably the 2007 cyberattacks on Estonia and the 2008 cyberattacks on Russia, South Ossetia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. One identified young Russian hacker said that he was paid by Russian state security services to lead hacking attacks on NATO computers. He was studying computer sciences at the Department of the Defense of Information. His tuition was paid for by the FSB.\n\n\n**** Sweden ****\nIn January 2017, Sweden's armed forces were subjected to a cyber-attack that caused them to shutdown a so-called Caxcis IT system used in military exercises.\n\n\n**** Ukraine ****\nAccording to CrowdStrike from 2014 to 2016, the Russian APT Fancy Bear used Android malware to target the Ukrainian Army's Rocket Forces and Artillery. They distributed an infected version of an Android app whose original purpose was to control targeting data for the D-30 Howitzer artillery. The app, used by Ukrainian officers, was loaded with the X-Agent spyware and posted online on military forums. The attack was claimed by Crowd-Strike to be successful, with more than 80% of Ukrainian D-30 Howitzers destroyed, the highest percentage loss of any artillery pieces in the army (a percentage that had never been previously reported and would mean the loss of nearly the entire arsenal of the biggest artillery piece of the Ukrainian Armed Forces). According to the Ukrainian army this number is incorrect and that losses in artillery weapons \"were way below those reported\" and that these losses \"have nothing to do with the stated cause\".In 2014, the Russians were suspected to use a cyber weapon called \"Snake\", or \"Ouroboros,\" to conduct a cyber attack on Ukraine during a period of political turmoil. The Snake tool kit began spreading into Ukrainian computer systems in 2010. It performed Computer Network Exploitation (CNE), as well as highly sophisticated Computer Network Attacks (CNA).On 23 December 2015 the Black-Energy malware was used in a cyberattack on Ukraine's power-grid that left more than 200,000 people temporarily without power. A mining company and a large railway operator were also victims of the attack.Ukraine saw a massive surge in cyber attacks during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Several websites belonging to Ukrainian banks and government departments became inaccessible.\n\n\n**** United Kingdom ****\nMI6 reportedly infiltrated an Al Qaeda website and replaced the instructions for making a pipe bomb with the recipe for making cupcakes.In October 2010, Iain Lobban, the director of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), said the UK faces a \"real and credible\" threat from cyber attacks by hostile states and criminals and government systems are targeted 1,000 times each month, such attacks threatened the UK's economic future, and some countries were already using cyber assaults to put pressure on other nations.On 12 November 2013, financial organizations in London conducted cyber war games dubbed \"Waking Shark 2\" to simulate massive internet-based attacks against bank and other financial organizations. The Waking Shark 2 cyber war games followed a similar exercise in Wall Street.\n\n\n*** Middle East ***\n\n\n**** Iran ****\n\nIran has been both victim and perpetrator of several cyberwarfare operations. Iran is considered an emerging military power in the field.\n\nIn September 2010, Iran was attacked by the Stuxnet worm, thought to specifically target its Natanz nuclear enrichment facility. It was a 500-kilobyte computer worm that infected at least 14 industrial sites in Iran, including the Natanz uranium-enrichment plant. Although the official authors of Stuxnet haven't been officially identified, Stuxnet is believed to be developed and deployed by the United States and Israel. The worm is said to be the most advanced piece of malware ever discovered and significantly increases the profile of cyberwarfare.Iranian Cyber Police department, FATA, was dismissed one year after its creation in 2011 because of the arrest and death of Sattar Behesti, a blogger, in the custody of FATA. Since then, the main responsible institution for the cyberwarfare in Iran is the \"Cyber Defense Command\" operating under the Joint Staff of Iranian Armed Forces.\n\n\n**** Israel ****\nIn the 2006 war against Hezbollah, Israel alleges that cyber-warfare was part of the conflict, where the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) intelligence estimates several countries in the Middle East used Russian hackers and scientists to operate on their behalf. As a result, Israel attached growing importance to cyber-tactics, and became, along with the U.S., France and a couple of other nations, involved in cyber-war planning. Many international high-tech companies are now locating research and development operations in Israel, where local hires are often veterans of the IDF's elite computer units. Richard A. Clarke adds that \"our Israeli friends have learned a thing or two from the programs we have been working on for more than two decades.\":\u200a8\u200aIn September 2007, Israel carried out an airstrike on a suspected nuclear reactor in Syria dubbed Operation Orchard. U.S. industry and military sources speculated that the Israelis may have used cyberwarfare to allow their planes to pass undetected by radar into Syria.Following US President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018, cyber warfare units in the United States and Israel monitoring internet traffic out of Iran noted a surge in retaliatory cyber attacks from Iran. Security firms warned that Iranian hackers were sending emails containing malware to diplomats who work in the foreign affairs offices of US allies and employees at telecommunications companies, trying to infiltrate their computer systems.\n\n\n**** Saudi Arabia ****\nOn 15 August 2012 at 11:08 am local time, the Shamoon virus began destroying over 35,000 computer systems, rendering them inoperable. The virus used to target the Saudi government by causing destruction to the state owned national oil company Saudi Aramco. The attackers posted a pastie on PasteBin.com hours prior to the wiper logic bomb occurring, citing oppression and the Al-Saud regime as a reason behind the attack.  The attack was well staged according to Chris Kubecka, a former security advisor to Saudi Aramco after the attack and group leader of security for Aramco Overseas. It was an unnamed Saudi Aramco employee on the Information Technology team which opened a malicious phishing email, allowing initial entry into the computer network around mid-2012.\nKubecka also detailed in her Black Hat USA talk Saudi Aramco placed the majority of their security budget on the ICS control network, leaving the business network at risk for a major incident. \"When you realize most of your security budget was spent on ICS & IT gets Pwnd\". The virus has been noted to have behavior differing from other malware attacks, due to the destructive nature and the cost of the attack and recovery. US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called the attack a \"Cyber Pearl Harbor\". Known years later as the \"Biggest hack in history\" and intended for cyber warfare. Shamoon can spread from an infected machine to other computers on the network. Once a system is infected, the virus continues to compile a list of files from specific locations on the system, upload them to the attacker, and erase them. Finally the virus overwrites the master boot record of the infected computer, making it unusable. The virus has been used for cyber warfare against the national oil companies Saudi Aramco and Qatar's RasGas.Saudi Aramco announced the attack on their Facebook page and went offline again until a company statement was issued on 25 August 2012. The statement falsely reported normal business was resumed on 25 August 2012. However a Middle Eastern journalist leaked photographs taken on 1 September 2012 showing kilometers of petrol trucks unable to be loaded due to backed business systems still inoperable. \n\nOn 29 August 2012 the same attackers behind Shamoon posted another pastie on PasteBin.com, taunting Saudi Aramco with proof they still retained access to the company network. The post contained the username and password on security and network equipment and the new password for the CEO Khalid Al- Falih The attackers also referenced a portion of the Shamoon malware as further proof in the pastie.According to Kubecka, in order to restore operations. Saudi Aramco used its large private fleet of aircraft and available funds to purchase much of the world's hard drives, driving the price up. New hard drives were required as quickly as possible so oil prices were not affected by speculation. By 1 September 2012 gasoline resources were dwindling for the public of Saudi Arabia 17 days after the 15 August attack. RasGas was also affected by a different variant, crippling them in a similar manner.\n\n\n**** Qatar ****\nIn March 2018 American Republican fundraiser Elliott Broidy filed a lawsuit against Qatar, alleging that Qatar's government stole and leaked his emails in order to discredit him because he was viewed \"as an impediment to their plan to improve the country's standing in Washington.\" In May 2018, the lawsuit named Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, brother of the Emir of Qatar, and his associate Ahmed Al-Rumaihi, as allegedly orchestrating Qatar's cyber warfare campaign against Broidy. Further litigation revealed that the same cybercriminals who targeted Broidy had targeted as many as 1,200 other individuals, some of whom are also \"well-known enemies of Qatar\" such as senior officials of the U.A.E., Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain. While these hackers almost always obscured their location, some of their activity was traced to a telecommunication network in Qatar.\n\n\n**** United Arab Emirates ****\nThe United Arab Emirates has launched several cyber-attacks in the past targeting dissidents. Ahmed Mansoor, an Emirati citizen, was jailed for sharing his thoughts on Facebook and Twitter. He was given the code name Egret under the state-led covert project called Raven, which spied on top political opponents, dissidents, and journalists. Project Raven deployed a secret hacking tool called Karma, to spy without requiring the target to engage with any web links.In September 2021, three of the former American intelligence officers, Marc Baier, Ryan Adams, and Daniel Gericke, admitted to assisting the UAE in hacking crimes by providing them with advanced technology and violating US laws. Under a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department, the three defendants also agreed to pay nearly $1.7 million in fines to evade prison sentences. The court documents revealed that the Emirates hacked into the computers and mobile phones of dissidents, activists, and journalists. They also attempted to break into the systems of the US and rest of the world.\n\n\n*** North America ***\n\n\n**** United States ****\n\nCyberwarfare in the United States is a part of the American military strategy of proactive cyber defence and the use of cyberwarfare as a platform for attack. The new United States military strategy makes explicit that a cyberattack is casus belli just as a traditional act of war.U.S. government security expert Richard A. Clarke, in his book Cyber War (May 2010), had defined \"cyberwarfare\" as \"actions by a nation-state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the purposes of causing damage or disruption.\":\u200a6\u200a The Economist describes cyberspace as \"the fifth domain of warfare,\" and William J. Lynn, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, states that \"as a doctrinal matter, the Pentagon has formally recognized cyberspace as a new domain in warfare . . . [which] has become just as critical to military operations as land, sea, air, and space.\"In 2009, president Barack Obama declared America's digital infrastructure to be a \"strategic national asset,\" and in May 2010 the Pentagon set up its new U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), headed by General Keith B. Alexander, director of the National Security Agency (NSA), to defend American military networks and attack other countries' systems. The EU has set up ENISA (European Union Agency for Network and Information Security) which is headed by Prof. Udo Helmbrecht and there are now further plans to significantly expand ENISA's capabilities. The United Kingdom has also set up a cyber-security and \"operations centre\" based in Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British equivalent of the NSA. In the U.S. however, Cyber Command is only set up to protect the military, whereas the government and corporate infrastructures are primarily the responsibility respectively of the Department of Homeland Security and private companies.In February 2010, top American lawmakers warned that the \"threat of a crippling attack on telecommunications and computer networks was sharply on the rise.\" According to The Lipman Report, numerous key sectors of the U.S. economy along with that of other nations, are currently at risk, including cyber threats to public and private facilities, banking and finance, transportation, manufacturing, medical, education and government, all of which are now dependent on computers for daily operations. In 2009, president Obama stated that \"cyber intruders have probed our electrical grids.\"On 19 June 2010, United States Senator Joe Lieberman (I-CT) introduced a bill called \"Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of 2010\", which he co-wrote with Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) and Senator Thomas Carper (D-DE). If signed into law, this controversial bill, which the American media dubbed the \"Kill switch bill\", would grant the president emergency powers over parts of the Internet. However, all three co-authors of the bill issued a statement that instead, the bill \"[narrowed] existing broad presidential authority to take over telecommunications networks\".\nIn June 2012 the New York Times reported that president Obama had ordered the cyber attack on Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities.In July 2010, The Economist wrote that China had plans of \"winning informationised wars by the mid-21st century\",  that other countries were likewise organizing for cyberwar, among them Russia, Israel and North Korea, and that Iran boasted of having the world's second-largest cyber-army. James Gosler, a government cybersecurity specialist, worried that the U.S. has a severe shortage of computer security specialists, estimating that there are only about 1,000 qualified people in the country today, but needs a force of 20,000 to 30,000 skilled experts. At the July 2010 Black Hat computer security conference, Michael Hayden, former deputy director of national intelligence, challenged thousands of attendees to help devise ways to \"reshape the Internet's security architecture\", explaining, \"You guys made the cyberworld look like the north German plain.\"In August 2010, the U.S. for the first time warned publicly about the Chinese military's use of civilian computer experts in clandestine cyber attacks aimed at American companies and government agencies. The Pentagon also pointed to an alleged China-based computer spying network dubbed GhostNet which was revealed in a 2009 research report. The Pentagon stated:\n\nThe People's Liberation Army is using \"information warfare units\" to develop viruses to attack enemy computer systems and networks, and those units include civilian computer professionals. Commander Bob Mehal, will monitor the PLA's buildup of its cyberwarfare capabilities and will continue to develop capabilities to counter any potential threat.\n\nThe United States Department of Defense sees the use of computers and the Internet to conduct warfare in cyberspace as a threat to national security. The United States Joint Forces Command describes some of its attributes:\n\nCyberspace technology is emerging as an \"instrument of power\" in societies, and is becoming more available to a country's opponents, who may use it to attack, degrade, and disrupt communications and the flow of information. With low barriers to entry, coupled with the anonymous nature of activities in cyberspace, the list of potential adversaries is broad.  Furthermore, the globe-spanning range of cyberspace and its disregard for national borders will challenge legal systems and complicate a nation's ability to deter threats and respond to contingencies.\n\nIn February 2010, the United States Joint Forces Command released a study which included a summary of the threats posed by the internet:\nWith very little investment, and cloaked in a veil of anonymity, our adversaries will inevitably attempt to harm our national interests. Cyberspace will become a main front in both irregular and traditional conflicts. Enemies in cyberspace will include both states and non-states and will range from the unsophisticated amateur to highly trained professional hackers. Through cyberspace, enemies will target industry, academia, government, as well as the military in the air, land, maritime, and space domains. In much the same way that airpower transformed the battlefield of World War II, cyberspace has fractured the physical barriers that shield a nation from attacks on its commerce and communication. Indeed, adversaries have already taken advantage of computer networks and the power of information technology not only to plan and execute savage acts of terrorism, but also to influence directly the perceptions and will of the U.S. Government and the American population.\nOn 6 October 2011, it was announced that Creech AFB's drone and Predator fleet's command and control data stream had been keylogged, resisting all attempts to reverse the exploit, for the past two weeks. The Air Force issued a statement that the virus had \"posed no threat to our operational mission\".On 21 November 2011, it was widely reported in the U.S. media that a hacker had destroyed a water pump at the Curran-Gardner Township Public Water District in Illinois. However, it later turned out that this information was not only false, but had been inappropriately leaked from the Illinois Statewide Terrorism and Intelligence Center.In 2012, the US used cyberattacks for tactical advantage in Afghanistan.According to a 2013 Foreign Policy magazine article, NSA's Tailored Access Operations (TAO) unit \"has successfully penetrated Chinese computer and telecommunications systems for almost 15 years, generating some of the best and most reliable intelligence information about what is going on inside the People's Republic of China.\"In 2013 cyberwarfare was, for the first time, considered a larger threat than Al Qaeda or terrorism, by many U.S. intelligence officials. In 2017, Representative Mike Rogers, chairman of the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, for instance, said that \n\"We are in a cyber war in this country, and most Americans don't know it. And we are not necessarily winning. We have got huge challenges when it comes to cybersecurity.\"In 2014, Barack Obama ordered an intensification of cyberwarfare against North Korea's missile program for sabotaging test launches in their opening seconds. \nOn 24 November 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment hack was a release of confidential data belonging to Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE).\nIn June 2015, the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced that it had been the target of a data breach targeting the records of as many as four million people. Later, FBI Director James Comey put the number at 18 million. The Washington Post has reported that the attack originated in China, citing unnamed government officials.In October 2016, Jeh Johnson the United States Secretary of Homeland Security and James Clapper the U.S. Director of National Intelligence issued a joint statement accusing Russia of interfering with the 2016 United States presidential election. The New York Times reported the Obama administration formally accused Russia of stealing and disclosing Democratic National Committee emails. Under U.S. law (50 U.S.C.Title 50 \u2013 War and National Defense, Chapter 15 \u2013 National Security, Subchapter III Accountability for Intelligence Activities) there must be a formal Presidential finding prior to authorizing a covert attack. Then U.S. vice president Joe Biden said on the American news interview program Meet The Press that the United States will respond. The New York Times noted that Biden's comment \"seems to suggest that Mr. Obama is prepared to order \u2013 or has already ordered \u2013 some kind of covert action\". \nIn 2016 President Barack Obama authorized the planting of cyber weapons in Russian infrastructure in the final weeks of his presidency in response to Moscow's interference in the 2016 presidential election. On 29 December 2016 United States imposed the most extensive sanctions against Russia since the Cold War, expelling 35 Russian diplomats from the United States.Economic sanctions are the most frequently used the foreign policy instruments by the United States today Thus, it is not surprising to see that economic sanctions are also used as counter policies against cyberattacks. According to Onder (2021), economic sanctions are also information gathering mechanisms for the sanctioning states about the capabilities of the sanctioned states.In March 2017, WikiLeaks published more than 8,000 documents on the CIA. The confidential documents, codenamed Vault 7 and dated from 2013 to 2016, include details on CIA's software capabilities, such as the ability to compromise cars, smart TVs, web browsers (including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera Software ASA), and the operating systems of most smartphones (including Apple's iOS and Google's Android), as well as other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.For a global perspective of countries and other actors engaged in cyber warfare, see the George Washington University-based National Security Archive's CyberWar map.\n\n== Cyberpeace ==\n\nThe rise of cyber as a warfighting domain has led to efforts to determine how cyberspace can be used to foster peace.  For example, the German civil rights panel FIfF runs a campaign for cyberpeace \u2212 for the control of cyberweapons and surveillance technology and against the militarization of cyberspace and the development and stockpiling of offensive exploits and malware. Measures for cyberpeace include policymakers developing new rules and norms for warfare, individuals and organizations building new tools and secure infrastructures, promoting open source, the establishment of cyber security centers, auditing of critical infrastructure cybersecurity, obligations to disclose vulnerabilities, disarmament, defensive security strategies, decentralization, education and widely applying relevant tools and infrastructures, encryption and other cyberdefenses.The topics of cyber peacekeeping and cyber peacemaking have also been studied by researchers, as a way to restore and strengthen peace in the aftermath of both cyber and traditional warfare.\n\n== Cyber counterintelligence ==\nCyber counter-intelligence are measures to identify, penetrate, or neutralize foreign operations that use cyber means as the primary tradecraft methodology, as well as foreign intelligence service collection efforts that use traditional methods to gauge cyber capabilities and intentions.\nOn 7 April 2009, The Pentagon announced they spent more than $100 million in the last six months responding to and repairing damage from cyber attacks and other computer network problems.\nOn 1 April 2009, U.S. lawmakers pushed for the appointment of a White House cyber security \"czar\" to dramatically escalate U.S. defenses against cyber attacks, crafting proposals that would empower the government to set and enforce security standards for private industry for the first time.\nOn 9 February 2009, the White House announced that it will conduct a review of the country's cyber security to ensure that the Federal government of the United States cyber security initiatives are appropriately integrated, resourced and coordinated with the United States Congress and the private sector.\nIn the wake of the 2007 cyberwar waged against Estonia, NATO established the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD CoE) in Tallinn, Estonia, in order to enhance the organization's cyber defence capability. The center was formally established on 14 May 2008, and it received full accreditation by NATO and attained the status of International Military Organization on 28 October 2008. Since Estonia has led international efforts to fight cybercrime, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation says it will permanently base a computer crime expert in Estonia in 2009 to help fight international threats against computer systems.\nIn 2015, the Department of Defense released an updated cyber strategy memorandum detailing the present and future tactics deployed in the service of defense against cyberwarfare.  In this memorandum, three cybermissions are laid out.  The first cybermission seeks to arm and maintain existing capabilities in the area of cyberspace, the second cybermission focuses on prevention of cyberwarfare, and the third cybermission includes strategies for retaliation and preemption (as distinguished from prevention).One of the hardest issues in cyber counterintelligence is the problem of attribution. Unlike conventional warfare, figuring out who is behind an attack can be very difficult. However Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has claimed that the United States has the capability to trace attacks back to their sources and hold the attackers \"accountable\".\n\n== Doubts about existence ==\nIn October 2011 the Journal of Strategic Studies, a leading journal in that field, published an article by Thomas Rid, \"Cyber War Will Not Take Place\" which argued that all politically motivated cyber attacks are merely sophisticated versions of sabotage, espionage, or subversion \u2013 and that it is unlikely that cyber war will occur in the future.\n\n== Legal perspective ==\nNIST, a cyberwarfare framework, was published in 2014 in the US.S.The Tallinn Manual, published in 2013, is an academic, non-binding study on how international law, in particular the jus ad bellum and international humanitarian law, apply to cyber conflicts and cyber warfare. It was written at the invitation of the Tallinn-based NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence by an international group of approximately twenty experts between 2009 and 2012.The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (members of which include China and Russia) defines cyberwar to include dissemination of information \"harmful to the spiritual, moral and cultural spheres of other states\". In September 2011, these countries proposed to the UN Secretary General a document called \"International code of conduct for information security\".In contrast, the United approach focuses on physical and economic damage and injury, putting political concerns under freedom of speech. This difference of opinion has led to reluctance in the West to pursue global cyber arms control agreements. However, American General Keith B. Alexander did endorse talks with Russia over a proposal to limit military attacks in cyberspace. In June 2013, Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin agreed to install a secure Cyberwar-Hotline providing \"a direct secure voice communications line between the US cybersecurity coordinator and the Russian deputy secretary of the security council, should there be a need to directly manage a crisis situation arising from an ICT security incident\" (White House quote).A Ukrainian international law scholar, Alexander Merezhko, has developed a project called the International Convention on Prohibition of Cyberwar in Internet. According to this project, cyberwar is defined as the use of Internet and related technological means by one state against the political, economic, technological and information sovereignty and independence of another state. Professor Merezhko's project suggests that the Internet ought to remain free from warfare tactics and be treated as an international landmark. He states that the Internet (cyberspace) is a \"common heritage of mankind\".On the February 2017 RSA Conference Microsoft president Brad Smith suggested global rules \u2013 a \"Digital Geneva Convention\" \u2013 for cyber attacks that \"ban the nation-state hacking of all the civilian aspects of our economic and political infrastructures\". He also stated that an independent organization could investigate and publicly disclose evidence that attributes nation-state attacks to specific countries. Furthermore, he said that the technology sector should collectively and neutrally work together to protect Internet users and pledge to remain neutral in conflict and not aid governments in offensive activity and to adopt a coordinated disclosure process for software and hardware vulnerabilities. A fact-binding body has also been proposed to regulate cyber operations.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n*** In films ***\n\nIndependence Day (1996)\nTerminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)\nLive Free or Die Hard (2007)\nTerminator Genisys (2015)\nSnowden (2016)\nTerminator: Dark Fate (2019)Documentaries\nHacking the Infrastructure: Cyber Warfare (2016) by Viceland\nCyber War Threat (2015)\nDarknet, Hacker, Cyberwar (2017)\nZero Days (2016)\nThe Perfect Weapon (2020)\n\n\n*** In television ***\n\"Cancelled\", an episode of the animated sitcom South Park\nSeries 2 of COBRA, a British thriller series, revolves around a sustained campaign of cyberwar against the United Kingdom and the British government's response to it."

These are the countries which have the greatest threat to Islamic terrorism and its aforementioned digital version.Around the time of the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay, which was marred by unrest in Tibet, Chinese hackers claim to have hacked the websites of CNN (accused of selective reporting on the 2008 Lhasa riots) and Carrefour (a French shopping chain, allegedly supporting Tibetan independence),  while websites and forums gave tutorials on how to launch a DDoS attack specifically on the CNN website.Indian hackers in 2015 took down thousands of Pakistani websites including pakistan.gov.pk and Right To Information Pakistan under the attack named as #OPvijaya under the leadership of In73ct0r d3vil. This attack is considered to be a patriotic move by Indian hackers. Government of India and India's NSA Ajit Dhoval showed support to the attack on his Twitter account.The official websites of 10 different Indian universities were hacked and defaced in 2017. A group going by the name of \u2018Pakistan Haxor Crew\u2019 (PFC) claimed responsibility for the breach, saying it was retaliation for Pakistan\u2019s railway ministry website being hacked by an Indian crew few days before this breach."

    "instruction": "Context: Pass the hash\n\n==Introduction==\nIn computer security, pass the hash is a hacking technique that allows an attacker to authenticate to a remote server or service by using the underlying NTLM or LanMan hash of a user's password, instead of requiring the associated plaintext password as is normally the case. It replaces the need for stealing the plaintext password to gain access with stealing the hash. \nThe attack exploits an implementation weakness in the authentication protocol, where password hashes remain static from session to session until the password is next changed.\nThis technique can be performed against any server or service accepting LM or NTLM authentication, whether it runs on a machine with Windows, Unix, or any other operating system.\n\n== Description ==\nOn systems or services using NTLM authentication, users' passwords are never sent in cleartext over the wire. Instead, they are provided to the requesting system, like a domain controller, as a hash in a response to a challenge\u2013response authentication scheme.Native Windows applications ask users for the cleartext password, then call APIs like LsaLogonUser that convert that password to one or two hash values (the LM or NT hashes) and then send that to the remote server during NTLM authentication.If an attacker has the hashes of a user's password, they do not need the cleartext password; they can simply use the hash to authenticate with a server and impersonate that user. In other words, from an attacker's perspective, hashes are functionally equivalent to the original passwords that they were generated from.\n\n== Hash harvesting ==\nBefore an attacker can carry out a pass-the-hash attack, they must obtain the password hashes of the target user accounts. To this end, penetration testers and attackers can harvest password hashes using a number of different methods:\n\nCached hashes or credentials of users who have previously logged onto a machine (for example at the console or via RDP) can be read from the SAM by anyone who has Administrator-level privileges. The default behavior of caching hashes or credentials for offline use can be disabled by administrators, so this technique may not always work if a machine has been sufficiently hardened.\nDumping the local user's account database (SAM). This database only contains user accounts local to the particular machine that was compromised. For example, in a domain environment, the SAM database of a machine will not contain domain users, only users local to that machine that more likely will not be very useful to authenticate to other services on the domain. However, if the same local administrative account passwords are used across multiple systems the attacker can remotely access those systems using the local user account hashes.\nSniffing LM and NTLM challenge\u2013response dialogues between client and servers, and later brute-forcing captured encrypted hashes (since the hashes obtained in this way are encrypted, it is necessary to perform a brute-force attack to obtain the actual hashes).\nDumping authenticated users' credentials stored by Windows in the memory of the lsass.exe process. The credentials dumped in this way may include those of domain users or administrators, such as those logged in via RDP. This technique may therefore be used to obtain credentials of user accounts that are not local to the compromised computer, but rather originate from the security domain that the machine is a member of.\n\n== Mitigations ==\nAny system using LM or NTLM authentication in combination with any communication protocol (SMB, FTP, RPC, HTTP etc.) is at risk from this attack. The exploit is very difficult to defend against, due to possible exploits in Windows and applications running on Windows that can be used by an attacker to elevate their privileges and then carry out the hash harvesting that facilitates the attack. Furthermore, it may only require one machine in a Windows domain to not be configured correctly or be missing a security patch for an attacker to find a way in. A wide range of penetration testing tools are furthermore available to automate the process of discovering a weakness on a machine.\nThere is no single defense against the technique, thus standard defense in depth practices apply \u2013 for example use of firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, 802.1x authentication, IPsec, antivirus software, reducing the number of people with elevated privileges, pro-active security patching etc.  Preventing Windows from storing cached credentials may limit attackers to obtaining hashes from memory, which usually means that the target account must be logged into the machine when the attack is executed. Allowing domain administrators to log into systems that may be compromised or untrusted will create a scenario where the administrators' hashes become the targets of attackers; limiting domain administrator logons to trusted domain controllers can therefore limit the opportunities for an attacker. The principle of least privilege suggests that a least user access (LUA) approach should be taken, in that users should not use accounts with more privileges than necessary to complete the task at hand. Configuring systems not to use LM or NTLM can also strengthen security, but newer exploits are able to forward Kerberos tickets in a similar way. Limiting the scope of debug privileges on system may frustrate some attacks that inject code or steal hashes from the memory of sensitive processes.Restricted Admin Mode is a new Windows operating system feature introduced in 2014 via security bulletin 2871997, which is designed to reduce the effectiveness of the attack.\n\nQuestion: How can an attacker obtain the password hashes of the target user accounts in order to carry out a pass the hash attack?\n\nAnswer:",

    "instruction": "Open mail relay\n\n==Introduction==\nAn open mail relay is a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server configured in such a way that it allows anyone on the Internet to send e-mail through it, not just mail destined to or originating from known users. This used to be the default configuration in many mail servers; indeed, it was the way the Internet was initially set up, but open mail relays have become unpopular because of their exploitation by spammers and worms. Many relays were closed, or were placed on blacklists by other servers.\n\n== History and technology ==\nUntil the 1990s, mail servers were commonly intentionally configured as open relays; in fact, this was frequently the installation default setting. The traditional store and forward method of relaying e-mail to its destination required that it was passed from computer to computer (through and beyond the Internet) via modems on telephone lines. For many early networks, such as UUCPNET, FidoNet and BITNET, lists of machines that were open relays were a core part of those networks. Filtering and speed of e-mail delivery were not priorities at that time and in any case the government and educational servers that were initially on the Internet were covered by a federal edict forbidding the transfer of commercial messages.\n\n== Abuse by spammers ==\nIn the mid-1990s, with the rise of spamming, spammers resorted to re-routing their e-mail through third party e-mail servers to avoid detection and to exploit the additional resources of these open relay servers. Spammers would send one e-mail to the open relay and (effectively) include a large blind carbon copy list, then the open relay would relay that spam to the entire list. While this greatly reduced the bandwidth requirements for spammers at a time when Internet connections were limited, it forced each spam to be an exact copy and thus easier to detect. After abuse by spammers became widespread, operating an open relay came to be frowned upon among the majority of Internet server administrators and other prominent users. Open relays are recommended against in RFC 2505 and RFC 5321 (which defines SMTP). The exact copy nature of spam using open relays made it easy to create bulk e-mail detection systems such as Vipul's Razor and the Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse. To counter this, spammers were forced to switch to using hash busters to make them less effective and the advantage of using open relays was removed since every copy of spam was \"unique\" and had to be sent individually.\nSince open mail relays make no effort to authenticate the sender of an e-mail, open mail relays are vulnerable to address spoofing.\n\n== Anti-spam efforts ==\nMany Internet service providers use Domain Name System-based Blackhole Lists (DNSBL) to disallow mail from open relays. Once a mail server is detected or reported that allows third parties to send mail through them, they will be added to one or more such lists, and other e-mail servers using those lists will reject any mail coming from those sites. The relay need not actually be used for sending spam to be blacklisted; instead, it may be blacklisted after a simple test that just confirms open access.This trend reduced the percentage of mail senders that were open relays from over 90% down to well under 1% over several years. This led spammers to adopt other techniques, such as the use of botnets of zombie computers to send spam.\nOne consequence of the new unacceptability of open relays was an inconvenience for some end users and certain Internet service providers. To allow customers to use their e-mail addresses at Internet locations other than the company's systems (such as at school or work), many mail sites explicitly allowed open relaying so that customers could send e-mail via the ISP from any location. Once open relay became unacceptable because of abuse (and unusable because of blocking of open relays), ISPs and other sites had to adopt new protocols to allow remote users to send mail. These include smart hosts, SMTP-AUTH, POP before SMTP, and the use of virtual private networks (VPNs). The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has written a best current practices covering Email Submission Operations in RFC 5068.\nNote that the above only becomes an issue if the user wishes to (or has to) continue to send e-mail remotely, using the same SMTP server which they were previously accessing locally. If they have valid access to some other SMTP server from their new, remote location, then they will typically be able to use that new server to send e-mails as if from their old address, even when this server is properly secured. (Although this may involve some reconfiguration of the user's email client which may not be entirely straightforward.)\nThe CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 makes it illegal to send spam through an open relay in the United States, but makes no provision on their use for personal e-mail or their operation in general; the effectiveness of the act has been questioned.\n\n== Modern-day proponents ==\nThe most famous open mail relay operating today is probably that of John Gilmore, who argues that running an open relay is a freedom of speech issue. His server is included on many open relay blacklists (many of which are generated by \"automatic detection\", that is, by anti-spam blacklisters sending an (unsolicited) test e-mail to other servers to see if they will be relayed). These measures cause much of his outgoing e-mail to be blocked. Along with his further deliberate configuration of the server, his open relay enables people to send e-mail without their IP address being directly visible to the recipient and thereby send e-mail anonymously. In 2002, his open relay, along with 24 others, was used by a computer worm to propagate itself.John Gilmore and other open relay proponents declare that they do not support spam and spamming, but see bigger threat in attempts to limit Web capabilities that may block evolution of the new, next generation technologies. They compare the network communication restrictions with restrictions that some phone companies tried to place on their lines in the past, preventing transferring of computer data rather than speech.\n\n== Closing relays ==\nIn order not to be considered \"open\", an e-mail relay should be secure and configured to accept and forward only the following messages (details will vary from system to system \u2014 in particular, further restrictions may well apply):\nMessages from local IP addresses to local mailboxes\nMessages from local IP addresses to non-local mailboxes\nMessages from non-local IP addresses to local mailboxes\nMessages from clients that are authenticated and authorizedIn particular, a properly secured SMTP mail relay should not accept and forward arbitrary e-mails from non-local IP addresses to non-local mailboxes by an unauthenticated or unauthorized user.\nIn general, any other rules an administrator chooses to enforce (for instance, based on what an e-mail gives as its own envelope from address) must be in addition to, rather than instead of, the above. If not, the relay is still effectively open (for instance, by the above rules): it is easy to forge e-mail header and envelope information, it is considerably harder to successfully forge an IP address in a TCP/IP transaction because of the three-way handshake that occurs as a connection is started.\nOpen relays have also resulted from security flaws in software, rather than misconfiguration by system administrators. In these cases, security patches need to be applied to close the relay.\nInternet initiatives to close open relays have ultimately missed their intended purpose, because spammers have created distributed botnets of zombie computers that contain malware with mail relaying capability. The number of clients under spammers' control is now so great that previous anti-spam countermeasures that focused on closing open relays are no longer effective.\n\nAnswer this question based on the above context: How does John Gilmore's open relay enable anonymous email sending?",

(Although this may involve some reconfiguration of the user's email client which may not be entirely straightforward.)\nThe CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 makes it illegal to send spam through an open relay in the United States, but makes no provision on their use for personal e-mail or their operation in general; the effectiveness of the act has been questioned.\n\n== Modern-day proponents ==\nThe most famous open mail relay operating today is probably that of John Gilmore, who argues that running an open relay is a freedom of speech issue. His server is included on many open relay blacklists (many of which are generated by \"automatic detection\", that is, by anti-spam blacklisters sending an (unsolicited) test e-mail to other servers to see if they will be relayed). These measures cause much of his outgoing e-mail to be blocked. Along with his further deliberate configuration of the server, his open relay enables people to send e-mail without their IP address being directly visible to the recipient and thereby send e-mail anonymously. In 2002, his open relay, along with 24 others, was used by a computer worm to propagate itself.John Gilmore and other open relay proponents declare that they do not support spam and spamming, but see bigger threat in attempts to limit Web capabilities that may block evolution of the new, next generation technologies. They compare the network communication restrictions with restrictions that some phone companies tried to place on their lines in the past, preventing transferring of computer data rather than speech.\n\n== Closing relays ==\nIn order not to be considered \"open\", an e-mail relay should be secure and configured to accept and forward only the following messages (details will vary from system to system \u2014 in particular, further restrictions may well apply):\nMessages from local IP addresses to local mailboxes\nMessages from local IP addresses to non-local mailboxes\nMessages from non-local IP addresses to local mailboxes\nMessages from clients that are authenticated and authorizedIn particular, a properly secured SMTP mail relay should not accept and forward arbitrary e-mails from non-local IP addresses to non-local mailboxes by an unauthenticated or unauthorized user.\nIn general, any other rules an administrator chooses to enforce (for instance, based on what an e-mail gives as its own envelope from address) must be in addition to, rather than instead of, the above. If not, the relay is still effectively open (for instance, by the above rules): it is easy to forge e-mail header and envelope information, it is considerably harder to successfully forge an IP address in a TCP/IP transaction because of the three-way handshake that occurs as a connection is started.\nOpen relays have also resulted from security flaws in software, rather than misconfiguration by system administrators. In these cases, security patches need to be applied to close the relay.\nInternet initiatives to close open relays have ultimately missed their intended purpose, because spammers have created distributed botnets of zombie computers that contain malware with mail relaying capability. The number of clients under spammers' control is now so great that previous anti-spam countermeasures that focused on closing open relays are no longer effective."

    "instruction": "Context: Scrambler\n\n==Introduction==\nIn telecommunications, a scrambler is a device that transposes or inverts signals or otherwise encodes a message at the sender's side to make the message unintelligible at a receiver not equipped with an appropriately set descrambling device. Whereas encryption usually refers to operations carried out in the digital domain, scrambling usually refers to operations carried out in the analog domain. Scrambling is accomplished by the addition of components to the original signal or the changing of some important component of the original signal in order to make extraction of the original signal difficult. Examples of the latter might include removing or changing vertical or horizontal sync pulses in television signals; televisions will not be able to display a picture from such a signal.  Some modern scramblers are actually encryption devices, the name remaining due to the similarities in use, as opposed to internal operation.\nIn telecommunications and recording, a scrambler (also referred to as a randomizer) is a device that manipulates a data stream before transmitting. The manipulations are reversed by a descrambler at the receiving side. Scrambling is widely used in satellite, radio relay communications and PSTN modems. A scrambler can be placed just before a FEC coder, or it can be placed after the FEC, just before the modulation or line code. A scrambler in this context has nothing to do with encrypting, as the intent is not to render the message unintelligible, but to give the transmitted data useful engineering properties.\nA scrambler replaces sequences (referred to as whitening sequences) with other sequences without removing undesirable sequences, and as a result it changes the probability of occurrence of vexatious sequences. Clearly it is not foolproof as there are input sequences that yield all-zeros, all-ones, or other undesirable periodic output sequences. A scrambler is therefore not a good substitute for a line code, which, through a coding step, removes unwanted sequences.\n\n== Purposes of scrambling ==\nA scrambler (or randomizer) can be either:\n\nAn algorithm that converts an input string into a seemingly random output string of the same length (e.g., by pseudo-randomly selecting bits to invert), thus avoiding long sequences of bits of the same value; in this context, a randomizer is also referred to as a scrambler.\nAn analog or digital source of unpredictable (i.e., high entropy), unbiased, and usually independent (i.e., random) output bits. A \"truly\" random generator may be used to feed a (more practical) deterministic pseudo-random random number generator, which extends the random seed value.There are two main reasons why scrambling is used:\n\nTo enable accurate timing recovery on receiver equipment without resorting to redundant line coding.  It facilitates the work of a timing recovery circuit (see also clock recovery), an automatic gain control and other adaptive circuits of the receiver (eliminating long sequences consisting of '0' or '1' only).\nFor energy dispersal on the carrier, reducing inter-carrier signal interference.  It eliminates the dependence of a signal's power spectrum upon the actual transmitted data, making it more dispersed to meet maximum power spectral density requirements (because if the power is concentrated in a narrow frequency band, it can interfere with adjacent channels due to the intermodulation (also known as cross-modulation) caused by non-linearities of the receiving tract).Scramblers are essential components of physical layer system standards besides interleaved coding and modulation. They are usually defined based on linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs) due to their good statistical properties and ease of implementation in hardware.\nIt is common for physical layer standards bodies to refer to lower-layer (physical layer and link layer) encryption as scrambling as well. This may well be because (traditional) mechanisms employed are based on feedback shift registers as well.\nSome standards for digital television, such as DVB-CA and MPE, refer to encryption at the link layer as scrambling.\n\n== Types of scramblers ==\n\n\n*** Additive (synchronous) scramblers ***\n\nAdditive scramblers (they are also referred to as synchronous) transform the input data stream by applying a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) (by modulo-two addition). Sometimes a pre-calculated PRBS stored in the read-only memory is used, but more often it is generated by a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR).\nIn order to assure a synchronous operation of the transmitting and receiving LFSR (that is, scrambler and descrambler), a sync-word must be used.\nA sync-word is a pattern that is placed in the data stream through equal intervals (that is, in each frame). A receiver searches for a few sync-words in adjacent frames and hence determines the place when its LFSR must be reloaded with a pre-defined initial state.\nThe additive descrambler is just the same device as the additive scrambler.\nAdditive scrambler/descrambler is defined by the polynomial of its LFSR (for the scrambler on the picture above, it is \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        +\n        \n          z\n          \n            \u2212\n            14\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          z\n          \n            \u2212\n            15\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1+z^{-14}+z^{-15}}\n  ) and its initial state.\n\n\n*** Multiplicative (self-synchronizing) scramblers ***\n\nMultiplicative scramblers (also known as feed-through) are called so because they perform a multiplication of the input signal by the scrambler's transfer function in Z-space. They are discrete linear time-invariant systems.\nA multiplicative scrambler is recursive, and a multiplicative descrambler is non-recursive. Unlike additive scramblers, multiplicative scramblers do not need the frame synchronization, that is why they are also called self-synchronizing.

      "context": "Scrambler\n\n==Introduction==\nIn telecommunications, a scrambler is a device that transposes or inverts signals or otherwise encodes a message at the sender's side to make the message unintelligible at a receiver not equipped with an appropriately set descrambling device. Whereas encryption usually refers to operations carried out in the digital domain, scrambling usually refers to operations carried out in the analog domain. Scrambling is accomplished by the addition of components to the original signal or the changing of some important component of the original signal in order to make extraction of the original signal difficult. Examples of the latter might include removing or changing vertical or horizontal sync pulses in television signals; televisions will not be able to display a picture from such a signal.  Some modern scramblers are actually encryption devices, the name remaining due to the similarities in use, as opposed to internal operation.\nIn telecommunications and recording, a scrambler (also referred to as a randomizer) is a device that manipulates a data stream before transmitting. The manipulations are reversed by a descrambler at the receiving side. Scrambling is widely used in satellite, radio relay communications and PSTN modems. A scrambler can be placed just before a FEC coder, or it can be placed after the FEC, just before the modulation or line code. A scrambler in this context has nothing to do with encrypting, as the intent is not to render the message unintelligible, but to give the transmitted data useful engineering properties.\nA scrambler replaces sequences (referred to as whitening sequences) with other sequences without removing undesirable sequences, and as a result it changes the probability of occurrence of vexatious sequences. Clearly it is not foolproof as there are input sequences that yield all-zeros, all-ones, or other undesirable periodic output sequences. A scrambler is therefore not a good substitute for a line code, which, through a coding step, removes unwanted sequences.\n\n== Purposes of scrambling ==\nA scrambler (or randomizer) can be either:\n\nAn algorithm that converts an input string into a seemingly random output string of the same length (e.g., by pseudo-randomly selecting bits to invert), thus avoiding long sequences of bits of the same value; in this context, a randomizer is also referred to as a scrambler.\nAn analog or digital source of unpredictable (i.e., high entropy), unbiased, and usually independent (i.e., random) output bits. A \"truly\" random generator may be used to feed a (more practical) deterministic pseudo-random random number generator, which extends the random seed value.There are two main reasons why scrambling is used:\n\nTo enable accurate timing recovery on receiver equipment without resorting to redundant line coding.  It facilitates the work of a timing recovery circuit (see also clock recovery), an automatic gain control and other adaptive circuits of the receiver (eliminating long sequences consisting of '0' or '1' only).\nFor energy dispersal on the carrier, reducing inter-carrier signal interference.  It eliminates the dependence of a signal's power spectrum upon the actual transmitted data, making it more dispersed to meet maximum power spectral density requirements (because if the power is concentrated in a narrow frequency band, it can interfere with adjacent channels due to the intermodulation (also known as cross-modulation) caused by non-linearities of the receiving tract).Scramblers are essential components of physical layer system standards besides interleaved coding and modulation. They are usually defined based on linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs) due to their good statistical properties and ease of implementation in hardware.\nIt is common for physical layer standards bodies to refer to lower-layer (physical layer and link layer) encryption as scrambling as well. This may well be because (traditional) mechanisms employed are based on feedback shift registers as well.\nSome standards for digital television, such as DVB-CA and MPE, refer to encryption at the link layer as scrambling.\n\n== Types of scramblers ==\n\n\n*** Additive (synchronous) scramblers ***\n\nAdditive scramblers (they are also referred to as synchronous) transform the input data stream by applying a pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) (by modulo-two addition). Sometimes a pre-calculated PRBS stored in the read-only memory is used, but more often it is generated by a linear-feedback shift register (LFSR).\nIn order to assure a synchronous operation of the transmitting and receiving LFSR (that is, scrambler and descrambler), a sync-word must be used.\nA sync-word is a pattern that is placed in the data stream through equal intervals (that is, in each frame). A receiver searches for a few sync-words in adjacent frames and hence determines the place when its LFSR must be reloaded with a pre-defined initial state.\nThe additive descrambler is just the same device as the additive scrambler.\nAdditive scrambler/descrambler is defined by the polynomial of its LFSR (for the scrambler on the picture above, it is \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        +\n        \n          z\n          \n            \u2212\n            14\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          z\n          \n            \u2212\n            15\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1+z^{-14}+z^{-15}}\n  ) and its initial state.\n\n\n*** Multiplicative (self-synchronizing) scramblers ***\n\nMultiplicative scramblers (also known as feed-through) are called so because they perform a multiplication of the input signal by the scrambler's transfer function in Z-space. They are discrete linear time-invariant systems.\nA multiplicative scrambler is recursive, and a multiplicative descrambler is non-recursive. Unlike additive scramblers, multiplicative scramblers do not need the frame synchronization, that is why they are also called self-synchronizing. Multiplicative scrambler/descrambler is defined similarly by a polynomial (for the scrambler on the picture it is \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        +\n        \n          z\n          \n            \u2212\n            18\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          z\n          \n            \u2212\n            23\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1+z^{-18}+z^{-23}}\n  ), which is also a transfer function of the descrambler.\n\n\n*** Comparison of scramblers ***\nScramblers have certain drawbacks: \n\nBoth types may fail to generate random sequences under worst-case input conditions.\nMultiplicative scramblers lead to error multiplication during descrambling (i.e. a single-bit error at the descrambler's input will result in w errors at its output, where w equals the number of the scrambler's feedback taps).\nAdditive scramblers must be reset by the frame sync; if this fails, massive error propagation will result, as a complete frame cannot be descrambled.

    "instruction": "Network mapping\n\n==Introduction==\nNetwork mapping is the study of the physical connectivity of networks e.g. the Internet. Network mapping discovers the devices on the network and their connectivity. It is not to be confused with network discovery or network enumerating which discovers devices on the network and their characteristics such as (operating system, open ports, listening network services, etc.). The field of automated network mapping has taken on greater importance as networks become more dynamic and complex in nature.\n\n\n\n== Large-scale mapping project ==\nImages of some of the first attempts at a large scale map of the internet were produced by the Internet Mapping Project and appeared in Wired magazine. The maps produced by this project were based on the layer 3 or IP level connectivity of the Internet (see OSI model), but there are different aspects of internet structure that have also been mapped.\nMore recent efforts to map the internet have been improved by more sophisticated methods, allowing them to make faster and more sensible maps.  An example of such an effort is the OPTE project, which is attempting to develop a system capable of mapping the internet in a single day.\nThe \"Map of the Internet Project\" maps over 4 billion internet locations as cubes in 3D cyberspace.  Users can add URLs as cubes and re-arrange objects on the map.\nIn early 2011 Canadian based ISP PEER 1 Hosting created their own Map of the Internet that depicts a graph of 19,869 autonomous system nodes connected by 44,344 connections. The sizing and layout of the autonomous systems was calculated based on their eigenvector centrality, which is a measure of how central to the network each autonomous system is.\nGraph theory can be used to better understand maps of the internet and to help choose between the many ways to visualize internet maps. Some projects have attempted to incorporate geographical data into their internet maps (for example, to draw locations of routers and nodes on a map of the world), but others are only concerned with representing the more abstract structures of the internet, such as the allocation, structure, and purpose of IP space.\n\n== Enterprise network mapping ==\nMany organizations create network maps of their network system. These maps can be made manually using simple tools such as Microsoft Visio, or the mapping process can be simplified by using tools that integrate auto network discovery with Network mapping, one such example being the Fabric platform. Many of the vendors from the Notable network mappers list enable you to customize the maps and include your own labels, add un-discoverable items and background images. Sophisticated mapping is used to help visualize the network and understand relationships between end devices and the transport layers that provide service. Mostly, network scanners detect the network with all its components and deliver a list which is used for creating charts and maps using network mapping software. Items such as bottlenecks and root cause analysis can be easier to spot using these tools.\nThere are three main techniques used for network mapping: SNMP based approaches, active probing and route analytics.\nThe SNMP based approach retrieves data from Router and Switch MIBs in order to build the network map. The active probing approach relies on a series of traceroute-like probe packets in order to build the network map. The route analytics approach relies on information from the routing protocols to build the network map. Each of the three approaches have advantages and disadvantages in the methods that they use.\n\n== Internet mapping techniques ==\nThere are two prominent techniques used today to create Internet maps.  The first works on the data plane of the Internet and is called active probing.  It is used to infer Internet topology based on router adjacencies.  The second works on the control plane and infers autonomous system connectivity based on BGP data. A BGP speaker sends 19-byte keep-alive messages every 60 seconds to maintain the connection.\n\n\n*** Active probing ***\nThis technique relies on traceroute-like probing on the IP address space. These probes report back IP forwarding paths to the destination address.  By combining these paths one can infer router level topology for a given POP.  Active probing is advantageous in that the paths returned by probes constitute the actual forwarding path that data takes through networks.  It is also more likely to find peering links between ISPs. However, active probing requires massive amounts of probes to map the entire Internet. It is more likely to infer false topologies due to load balancing routers and routers with multiple IP address aliases.  Decreased global support for enhanced probing mechanisms such as source-route probing, ICMP Echo Broadcasting, and IP Address Resolution techniques leaves this type of probing in the realm of network diagnosis.\n\n\n*** AS PATH inference ***\nThis technique relies on various BGP collectors who collect routing updates and tables and provide this information publicly.  Each BGP entry contains a Path Vector attribute called the AS Path.  This path represents an autonomous system forwarding path from a given origin for a given set of prefixes.  These paths can be used to infer AS-level connectivity and in turn be used to build AS topology graphs.  However, these paths do not necessarily reflect how data is actually forwarded and adjacencies between AS nodes only represent a policy relationship between them.  A single AS link can in reality be several router links.  It is also much harder to infer peerings between two AS nodes as these peering relationships are only propagated to an ISP's customer networks.  Nevertheless, support for this type of mapping is increasing as more and more ISP's offer to peer with public route collectors such as Route-Views and RIPE. New toolsets are emerging such as Cyclops and NetViews that take advantage of a new experimental BGP collector BGPMon. NetViews can not only build topology maps in seconds but visualize topology changes moments after occurring at the actual router.  Hence, routing dynamics can be visualized in real time. \nIn comparison to what the tools using BGPMon does there is another tool netTransformer able to discover and generate BGP peering maps either through SNMP polling or by converting MRT dumps to a graphml file format. netTransformer allows us also to perform network diffs between any two dumps and thus to reason how does the BGP peering has evolved through the years.

In contrast, other internet mapping tools may not provide as comprehensive a view of the network infrastructure and may not include features for monitoring and managing network performance.",
      "context": "Network mapping\n\n==Introduction==\nNetwork mapping is the study of the physical connectivity of networks e.g. the Internet. Network mapping discovers the devices on the network and their connectivity. It is not to be confused with network discovery or network enumerating which discovers devices on the network and their characteristics such as (operating system, open ports, listening network services, etc.). The field of automated network mapping has taken on greater importance as networks become more dynamic and complex in nature.\n\n\n\n== Large-scale mapping project ==\nImages of some of the first attempts at a large scale map of the internet were produced by the Internet Mapping Project and appeared in Wired magazine. The maps produced by this project were based on the layer 3 or IP level connectivity of the Internet (see OSI model), but there are different aspects of internet structure that have also been mapped.\nMore recent efforts to map the internet have been improved by more sophisticated methods, allowing them to make faster and more sensible maps.  An example of such an effort is the OPTE project, which is attempting to develop a system capable of mapping the internet in a single day.\nThe \"Map of the Internet Project\" maps over 4 billion internet locations as cubes in 3D cyberspace.  Users can add URLs as cubes and re-arrange objects on the map.\nIn early 2011 Canadian based ISP PEER 1 Hosting created their own Map of the Internet that depicts a graph of 19,869 autonomous system nodes connected by 44,344 connections. The sizing and layout of the autonomous systems was calculated based on their eigenvector centrality, which is a measure of how central to the network each autonomous system is.\nGraph theory can be used to better understand maps of the internet and to help choose between the many ways to visualize internet maps. Some projects have attempted to incorporate geographical data into their internet maps (for example, to draw locations of routers and nodes on a map of the world), but others are only concerned with representing the more abstract structures of the internet, such as the allocation, structure, and purpose of IP space.\n\n== Enterprise network mapping ==\nMany organizations create network maps of their network system. These maps can be made manually using simple tools such as Microsoft Visio, or the mapping process can be simplified by using tools that integrate auto network discovery with Network mapping, one such example being the Fabric platform. Many of the vendors from the Notable network mappers list enable you to customize the maps and include your own labels, add un-discoverable items and background images. Sophisticated mapping is used to help visualize the network and understand relationships between end devices and the transport layers that provide service. Mostly, network scanners detect the network with all its components and deliver a list which is used for creating charts and maps using network mapping software. Items such as bottlenecks and root cause analysis can be easier to spot using these tools.\nThere are three main techniques used for network mapping: SNMP based approaches, active probing and route analytics.\nThe SNMP based approach retrieves data from Router and Switch MIBs in order to build the network map. The active probing approach relies on a series of traceroute-like probe packets in order to build the network map. The route analytics approach relies on information from the routing protocols to build the network map. Each of the three approaches have advantages and disadvantages in the methods that they use.\n\n== Internet mapping techniques ==\nThere are two prominent techniques used today to create Internet maps.  The first works on the data plane of the Internet and is called active probing.  It is used to infer Internet topology based on router adjacencies.  The second works on the control plane and infers autonomous system connectivity based on BGP data. A BGP speaker sends 19-byte keep-alive messages every 60 seconds to maintain the connection.\n\n\n*** Active probing ***\nThis technique relies on traceroute-like probing on the IP address space. These probes report back IP forwarding paths to the destination address.  By combining these paths one can infer router level topology for a given POP.  Active probing is advantageous in that the paths returned by probes constitute the actual forwarding path that data takes through networks.  It is also more likely to find peering links between ISPs. However, active probing requires massive amounts of probes to map the entire Internet. It is more likely to infer false topologies due to load balancing routers and routers with multiple IP address aliases.  Decreased global support for enhanced probing mechanisms such as source-route probing, ICMP Echo Broadcasting, and IP Address Resolution techniques leaves this type of probing in the realm of network diagnosis.\n\n\n*** AS PATH inference ***\nThis technique relies on various BGP collectors who collect routing updates and tables and provide this information publicly.  Each BGP entry contains a Path Vector attribute called the AS Path.  This path represents an autonomous system forwarding path from a given origin for a given set of prefixes.  These paths can be used to infer AS-level connectivity and in turn be used to build AS topology graphs.  However, these paths do not necessarily reflect how data is actually forwarded and adjacencies between AS nodes only represent a policy relationship between them.  A single AS link can in reality be several router links.  It is also much harder to infer peerings between two AS nodes as these peering relationships are only propagated to an ISP's customer networks.  Nevertheless, support for this type of mapping is increasing as more and more ISP's offer to peer with public route collectors such as Route-Views and RIPE. New toolsets are emerging such as Cyclops and NetViews that take advantage of a new experimental BGP collector BGPMon. NetViews can not only build topology maps in seconds but visualize topology changes moments after occurring at the actual router.  Hence, routing dynamics can be visualized in real time. \nIn comparison to what the tools using BGPMon does there is another tool netTransformer able to discover and generate BGP peering maps either through SNMP polling or by converting MRT dumps to a graphml file format. netTransformer allows us also to perform network diffs between any two dumps and thus to reason how does the BGP peering has evolved through the years. WhatsUp Gold, an IT monitoring tool, tracks networks, servers, applications, storage devices, virtual devices and incorporates infrastructure management, application performance management."

Second, it always relies on voluntary crowd sourcing: Web users gather together to share information, conduct investigations, and perform other actions concerning people or events of common interest.Human flesh search engine is similar to the concept of \"doxing.\" Both human flesh search engine and doxing have generally been stigmatized as being for the purpose of identifying and exposing individuals to public humiliation, sometimes out of vigilantism, nationalist or patriotic sentiments, or to break the Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China.

News agencies categorized this group's acts as \u201ca new form of protest in Iran.\u201d\n\n\n\n== Hacking history ==\nHacking attacks in Iran have been on the rise recently. In August 2016, Internet security experts warned that hackers have found access to banking and contact details of millions of Iranians by hacking into their Telegram accounts. However, it is not yet clear whether this was a genuine warning or an attempt by hardliners in the Iranian government to convince people to leave Telegram and migrate to home-grown messaging services, where the government has easy access to users\u2019 private information and can intercept their communications.\n\n\n*** First hack: The Mashhad International Airport ***\nAccording to The Associated Press\u2019 report from Tehran, Iran\u2019s official IRNA news agency reported that The Tapandegan \u201cmanaged to interrupt routine broadcasts on monitors\u201d at the Mashhad International Airport on Thursday evening, May 24, 2018,  \u201creplacing them with images of anti-government protests from January [2018]\u201d\u201cfor several hours.\u201dSources report that according to a statement posted by the hackers on the monitors, the group protested to \u201cwasting Iranians lives and financial resources in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria by the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC).\u201d  The message posted on sign boards also protested against the IRGC's presence in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere in the region. The group also hacked the email of Mashhad airport civil aviation head, Mohsen Eidizadeh and sent the news of its hack from his account.Mashhad is the city where massive anti-government demonstrations started on December 28 and spread to over 100 other Iranians cities. It is a religious city where the holy shrine of the 8th Shiite Imam is located. Local authorities and clerics in the city are among the staunchest hardliners. The group expressed support for the people of Kazeroon, a city in Fars Province, where people have been demonstrating against the state of months.\n\n\n*** Second hack: The Tabriz International Airport ***\nAccording to The Associated Press\u2019 report from Tehran, Iran's official IRNA news agency reported that on June 6, 2018, the hackers \u201chave disrupted the arrival and departure monitors in the Tabriz international airport in the country\u2019s northwest.\u201d The hackers defaced sign boards in the evening, showing a protest message against \u201cwasting Iranians\u2019 resources\" and expressing support for Iranian truckers who have been on strike across Iran for several weeks.Iranian truck drivers went on strike for more than a week beginning May 22 in several parts of Iran, using social media to mobilize and share images of themselves protesting low wages and rising business costs.The Iranian state-run site, Young Journalists\u2019 Club (YJC), \u201cquoted Tabriz Governor Aliyar Rastgoo as saying the incident happened Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. local time.\u201d A Tabriz airport official Mostafa Safaei confirmed the day after the cyber-attack that the monitors turned off following the hack and engineers quickly restored the system, and the incident was under investigation.Translation of the message posted by the hackers on the monitors in Persian reads:\nAttention, attention. We, Tapandegan, in another protest action, are currently taking control of the computer systems of this airport. Two weeks ago, in protest against the wastage of the Iranian people\u2019s money and lives by (Iran\u2019s) Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, we took control of the computer systems in Mashhad airport. Today, by voicing our support for Iranian strikers, we are doing the same thing. Until when will this regime deprive people of their rights to have a better livelihood and economic situation?! Until when?! We will not choke off our voices. We will continue these actions. If you support us, take a photo of this and share it\nThe Tapandegan assumed responsibility for the hacking in a tweet on June 7. News of the hacking broke almost immediately on social media as Iranians posted tweets and pictures of the incident. However, the posts came under pseudonyms as users inside Iran fear a heavy-handed clampdown by the government.Sources report that The Tapandegan sent an email to Iranian journalists saying, \u201cTwo weeks ago, we took over the computer systems of Mashhad Airport in support of the national protests. We protested against wasting Iranian lives and assets by IRGC [The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]. And, today, we support the truck drivers, the bazar, and the strikers\u201d.\n\n\n*** Third Attack: Hacking into the Islamic Republic International Broadcasting (IRIB) and the Iranian Embassy in Berlin ***\nChief of Iran's cyber police, Seyed Kamal Hadianfar, claimed that the hackers who attacked Mashhad and Tabriz airports have been identified and arrested. According to a report by AsiaOnline, on January 17, 2019, the Tapandegan hacked allegedly into IRIB's computer systems, including IRIB's director Mr. Asgari, his deputy Mr. Abutalebi, and IRIB's political news director Mr. Seyyed Mehdi, and the email of the Iranian counselor in Berlin Mr. Zamani, and sent out emails and SMS through them to IRIB's employees, the Majlis speaker Ali Larijani and other Majlis members, as well as journalists. This email, according to this report, claims that top secret information is leaked regarding the transfer of two Trillion Touman each year in USD, double to Iran's Foreign Ministry annual budget, by Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to the Lebanese Hizballah, via his advisor Shirkhodaei, his special team, and the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon. The group claims that they got hold of documents related to this information while hacking into IRIB's computer systems and the email of the Iranian counselor in Berlin. Tapandegan blamed Zarif for money laundering while he himself had been accusing other offices in Iran of money laundering. AsiaOnline.ir published the entire email allegedly sent by The Tapandegan.\n\n\n*** Documents Exposed ***\nThis group hacked the emails of the Islamic Republic's authorities.  They hacked Tehran Municipality's Gmail account, and this way entered the Municipality's Twitter and Instagram accounts, and sent an email through the municipality's email system to the members of the Iranian Parliament Majlis including the Speaker Ali Larijani, Ali Motahari, Mahmoud-Sadeghi and ten other Majlis members, complained concerning the economic mismanagement and absence of social justice, and asked for the trial of the corrupt individuals and for putting an end to the rampant corruption in the country. The Tapandegan calls to stop corruption by the Iranian leadership through exposing allegedly top-secret related information received from insiders and whistleblowers. August 2, 2018, the Tapadengan exposed a letter received from a whistleblower, which claimed that ministries and IRGC have been ignoring the direct order, by Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei to limit and downsize IRGC's involvement and control over the private sector and the economy.  The leaked information included names of IRGC's subsidiaries, which operated as private companies. August 20, 2018: The Tapandegan exposed a top secret document, which was leaked to the group, regarding the purchase of a 5-star-hotel in the city of Mashhad for a price of US$28 million for the vacation of IRGC officers.  The purchase was taking place in 2018 as the national protests broke out throughout Iran protesting the deteriorating economic conditions.In a video posted on YouTube, The Tapandegan released information concerning its claimed infiltration to Iran's computer systems and claimed that it has hacked the email accounts of senior managers and employees of all the airports in the country. Documents released by the group show that Iranian authorities are concerned about Tapandegan's ability to hack the computer systems of the government agencies, financial institutions, and the military and \"called upon the relevant responsible personnel to check them out quickly.\nQuestion: How have the Tapandegan used social media in their protest activities?",

They have also posted tweets and pictures of their hacking incidents on social media, although these posts often come under pseudonyms due to fear of government repercussions.",
      "context": "Tapandegan\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Tapandegan (Palpitaters in Persian (Persian: \u062a\u067e\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646)) is an Iranian hacker group known for hacking twice the arrival and departure monitors at two major international airports in Iran (Mashhad and Tabriz) on May 24, 2018 and June 6, 2018 respectively, posting anti-government messages and images, forcing the airports\u2019 authorities to turn off manually those monitors one-by-one.The Tapandegan refers to its acts as an act of protest demanding from the Iranian leadership to improve the economy and to stop ignoring the demands of the Iranian people. News agencies categorized this group's acts as \u201ca new form of protest in Iran.\u201d\n\n\n\n== Hacking history ==\nHacking attacks in Iran have been on the rise recently. In August 2016, Internet security experts warned that hackers have found access to banking and contact details of millions of Iranians by hacking into their Telegram accounts. However, it is not yet clear whether this was a genuine warning or an attempt by hardliners in the Iranian government to convince people to leave Telegram and migrate to home-grown messaging services, where the government has easy access to users\u2019 private information and can intercept their communications.\n\n\n*** First hack: The Mashhad International Airport ***\nAccording to The Associated Press\u2019 report from Tehran, Iran\u2019s official IRNA news agency reported that The Tapandegan \u201cmanaged to interrupt routine broadcasts on monitors\u201d at the Mashhad International Airport on Thursday evening, May 24, 2018,  \u201creplacing them with images of anti-government protests from January [2018]\u201d\u201cfor several hours.\u201dSources report that according to a statement posted by the hackers on the monitors, the group protested to \u201cwasting Iranians lives and financial resources in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria by the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC).\u201d  The message posted on sign boards also protested against the IRGC's presence in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere in the region. The group also hacked the email of Mashhad airport civil aviation head, Mohsen Eidizadeh and sent the news of its hack from his account.Mashhad is the city where massive anti-government demonstrations started on December 28 and spread to over 100 other Iranians cities. It is a religious city where the holy shrine of the 8th Shiite Imam is located. Local authorities and clerics in the city are among the staunchest hardliners. The group expressed support for the people of Kazeroon, a city in Fars Province, where people have been demonstrating against the state of months.\n\n\n*** Second hack: The Tabriz International Airport ***\nAccording to The Associated Press\u2019 report from Tehran, Iran's official IRNA news agency reported that on June 6, 2018, the hackers \u201chave disrupted the arrival and departure monitors in the Tabriz international airport in the country\u2019s northwest.\u201d The hackers defaced sign boards in the evening, showing a protest message against \u201cwasting Iranians\u2019 resources\" and expressing support for Iranian truckers who have been on strike across Iran for several weeks.Iranian truck drivers went on strike for more than a week beginning May 22 in several parts of Iran, using social media to mobilize and share images of themselves protesting low wages and rising business costs.The Iranian state-run site, Young Journalists\u2019 Club (YJC), \u201cquoted Tabriz Governor Aliyar Rastgoo as saying the incident happened Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. local time.\u201d A Tabriz airport official Mostafa Safaei confirmed the day after the cyber-attack that the monitors turned off following the hack and engineers quickly restored the system, and the incident was under investigation.Translation of the message posted by the hackers on the monitors in Persian reads:\nAttention, attention. We, Tapandegan, in another protest action, are currently taking control of the computer systems of this airport. Two weeks ago, in protest against the wastage of the Iranian people\u2019s money and lives by (Iran\u2019s) Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, we took control of the computer systems in Mashhad airport. Today, by voicing our support for Iranian strikers, we are doing the same thing. Until when will this regime deprive people of their rights to have a better livelihood and economic situation?! Until when?! We will not choke off our voices. We will continue these actions. If you support us, take a photo of this and share it\nThe Tapandegan assumed responsibility for the hacking in a tweet on June 7. News of the hacking broke almost immediately on social media as Iranians posted tweets and pictures of the incident. However, the posts came under pseudonyms as users inside Iran fear a heavy-handed clampdown by the government.Sources report that The Tapandegan sent an email to Iranian journalists saying, \u201cTwo weeks ago, we took over the computer systems of Mashhad Airport in support of the national protests. We protested against wasting Iranian lives and assets by IRGC [The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]. And, today, we support the truck drivers, the bazar, and the strikers\u201d.\n\n\n*** Third Attack: Hacking into the Islamic Republic International Broadcasting (IRIB) and the Iranian Embassy in Berlin ***\nChief of Iran's cyber police, Seyed Kamal Hadianfar, claimed that the hackers who attacked Mashhad and Tabriz airports have been identified and arrested. According to a report by AsiaOnline, on January 17, 2019, the Tapandegan hacked allegedly into IRIB's computer systems, including IRIB's director Mr. Asgari, his deputy Mr. Abutalebi, and IRIB's political news director Mr. Seyyed Mehdi, and the email of the Iranian counselor in Berlin Mr. Zamani, and sent out emails and SMS through them to IRIB's employees, the Majlis speaker Ali Larijani and other Majlis members, as well as journalists. This email, according to this report, claims that top secret information is leaked regarding the transfer of two Trillion Touman each year in USD, double to Iran's Foreign Ministry annual budget, by Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to the Lebanese Hizballah, via his advisor Shirkhodaei, his special team, and the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon. The group claims that they got hold of documents related to this information while hacking into IRIB's computer systems and the email of the Iranian counselor in Berlin. Tapandegan blamed Zarif for money laundering while he himself had been accusing other offices in Iran of money laundering. AsiaOnline.ir published the entire email allegedly sent by The Tapandegan.\n\n\n*** Documents Exposed ***\nThis group hacked the emails of the Islamic Republic's authorities.  They hacked Tehran Municipality's Gmail account, and this way entered the Municipality's Twitter and Instagram accounts, and sent an email through the municipality's email system to the members of the Iranian Parliament Majlis including the Speaker Ali Larijani, Ali Motahari, Mahmoud-Sadeghi and ten other Majlis members, complained concerning the economic mismanagement and absence of social justice, and asked for the trial of the corrupt individuals and for putting an end to the rampant corruption in the country. The Tapandegan calls to stop corruption by the Iranian leadership through exposing allegedly top-secret related information received from insiders and whistleblowers. August 2, 2018, the Tapadengan exposed a letter received from a whistleblower, which claimed that ministries and IRGC have been ignoring the direct order, by Iran's Supreme Leader Khamenei to limit and downsize IRGC's involvement and control over the private sector and the economy.  The leaked information included names of IRGC's subsidiaries, which operated as private companies. August 20, 2018: The Tapandegan exposed a top secret document, which was leaked to the group, regarding the purchase of a 5-star-hotel in the city of Mashhad for a price of US$28 million for the vacation of IRGC officers.  The purchase was taking place in 2018 as the national protests broke out throughout Iran protesting the deteriorating economic conditions.In a video posted on YouTube, The Tapandegan released information concerning its claimed infiltration to Iran's computer systems and claimed that it has hacked the email accounts of senior managers and employees of all the airports in the country. Documents released by the group show that Iranian authorities are concerned about Tapandegan's ability to hack the computer systems of the government agencies, financial institutions, and the military and \"called upon the relevant responsible personnel to check them out quickly."

    "instruction": "Fileless malware\n\n==Introduction==\nFileless malware is a variant of computer related malicious software that exists exclusively as a computer memory-based artifact i.e. in RAM. It does not write any part of its activity to the computer's hard drive, thus increasing its ability to evade antivirus software that incorporate file-based whitelisting, signature detection, hardware verification, pattern-analysis, time-stamping, etc., and leaving very little evidence that could be used by digital forensic investigators to identify illegitimate activity. Malware of this type is designed to work in-memory, so its existence on the system lasts only until the system is rebooted.\n\n\n\n== Definition ==\nFileless malware is sometimes considered synonymous with in-memory malware as both perform their core functionalities without writing data to disk during the lifetime of their operation. This has led some commentators to claim that this variant strain is nothing new and simply a \u201credefinition of the well-known term, memory resident virus\u201d, whose pedigree can be traced back to the 1980s with the birth of the Lehigh Virus that was developed by the originator of the term, Fred Cohen, and became influential with his paper on the topic.This synonymy is however incorrect. Although the aforementioned behavioral execution environment is the same, in both cases i.e. both malware variants are executed in system memory, the crucial differentiation is the method of inception and prolongation. Most malware's infection vector involves some writing to the hard disk, in order for it to be executed, whose origin could take the form of an infected file attachment, external media device e.g. USB, peripheral, mobile phone etc., browser drive-by, side-channel etc.\nEach of the aforementioned methods has to have contact with the host system's hard drive, in some form or another, meaning that even when employing the stealthiest anti-forensic methods, some form of the infected residue will be left on the host media.\nFileless malware on the other hand, from the point of inception until process termination (usually by way of a system reboot), aims never to have its contents written to disk. Its purpose is to reside in volatile system areas such as the system registry, in-memory processes and service areas.\n\n== Recent developments ==\nOn February 8, 2017, Kaspersky Lab's Global Research & Analysis Team published a report titled: \"Fileless attacks against enterprise networks\" which implicates variants of this type of malware, and its latest incarnations, affecting 140 enterprise networks across the globe with banks, telecommunication companies and government organisations being the top targets.\nThe report details how a variant of fileless malware is using PowerShell scripts (located within the Microsoft Windows Registry system) to launch an attack against a target's machine leveraging a common attack framework called Metasploit with supporting attack tools such as Mimikatz, and leveraging standard Windows utilities such as \u2018SC\u2019 and \u2018NETSH\u2019 to assist with lateral movement.\nThe malware was only detected after a bank identified the Metasploit Meterpreter code running in physical memory on a central domain controller (DC).Kaspersky Labs is not the only company to have identified such emerging trends, with most of the principal IT security anti-malware companies coming forward with similar findings: Symantec, Trend Micro, McAfee Labs, Cybereason, etc.\n\n== Digital forensics ==\nThe emergence of malware that operate in a fileless way presents a major problem to digital forensic investigators, whose reliance on being able to obtain digital artifacts from a crime scene is critical to ensuring chain of custody and producing evidence that is admissible in a court of law.\nMany well-known digital forensic process models such as: Casey 2004, DFRWS 2001, NIJ 2004, Cohen 2009, all embed either an examination and/or analysis phase into their respective models, implying that evidence can be obtained/collected/preserved by some mechanism.\nThe difficulty becomes apparent when considering the standard operating procedures of digital investigators and how they should deal with a computer at a crime scene. Traditional methods direct the investigator to:\nDo not, in any circumstances, switch the computer on\nMake sure that the computer is switched off \u2013 some screen savers may give the appearance that the computer is switched off, but hard drive and monitor activity lights may indicate that the machine is switched on.\nRemove the main power source battery from laptop computers.\nUnplug the power and other devices from sockets on the computer itselfFileless malware subverts the forensics models, as evidence acquisition can only take place against a memory image that has been obtained from a live running system that is to be investigated. This method, however, can itself compromise the acquired host's memory image and render legal admissibility questionable, or at the very least, instill enough reasonable doubt that the weight of the evidence presented may be drastically reduced, increasing the chances that Trojan horse or \"some other dude done it\" defences may be used more effectively.\nThis renders this type of malware extremely attractive to adversaries wishing to secure a foothold in a network, perform difficult to trace lateral movement and do so in a quick and silent manner, when standard forensic investigatory practices are ill-prepared for the threat.\n\nHow does fileless malware affect the ability of digital forensic investigators to collect and preserve evidence?",

    "instruction": "Amazon Virtual Private Cloud\n\n==Introduction==\nAmazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a commercial cloud computing service that provides a virtual private cloud, by \u201cprovisioning a logically isolated section of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud\u201d. Enterprise customers are able to access the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) over an IPsec based virtual private network. Unlike traditional EC2 instances which are allocated internal and external IP numbers by Amazon, the customer can assign IP numbers of their choosing from one or more subnets. By giving the user the option of selecting which AWS resources are public facing and which are not, VPC provides much more granular control over security. For Amazon it is \u201can endorsement of the hybrid approach, but it's also meant to combat the growing interest in private clouds\u201d.\n\n\n\n== Comparison to private clouds ==\nAmazon Virtual Private Cloud aims to provide a service similar to private clouds using technology such as OpenStack or HPE Helion Eucalyptus.  However, private clouds typically use technology such as OpenShift application hosting and various database systems.  Cloud security experts warn that there can be compliance risks, such as a loss of control or service cancellation in using public resources which do not exist with in-house systems.  If transaction records are requested from Amazon about a VPC using a national security letter they may not be legally allowed to inform the customer of the breach of the security of their system.  This would be true even if the actual VPC resources were in another country.  The API used by AWS is only partly compatible with that of HPE Helion Eucalyptus and is not compatible with other private cloud systems, so migration from AWS may be difficult.  This has led to warnings of the possibility of lock-in to a specific technology.\n\n== IP Addressing ==\nIP Addressing in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) refers to the assignment of IP addresses to the resources within a VPC. VPC is Amazon Web Services' (AWS) solution for providing isolated network environments for AWS resources. IP addresses in a VPC are used for communication between resources within the VPC, as well as for communication between the VPC and the Internet.\nThere are two types of IP addresses used in a VPC: private IP addresses and public IP addresses. Private IP addresses are used for communication between instances within the VPC, while public IP addresses are used for communication between the VPC and the Internet.\nAmazon VPC provides several options for IP address management, including the use of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, automatic assignment of private IP addresses, and the ability to assign static private IP addresses. Additionally, Amazon VPC provides the option to associate Elastic IP addresses with instances to ensure persistent public IP addresses.\nBy using Amazon VPC, customers can have full control over the network configuration of their AWS resources, providing increased security and isolation compared to the traditional shared-tenancy model of public cloud computing.\n\n== Connectivity ==\nAWS VPC allows users to connect to the Internet, a user's corporate data center, and other users' VPCs.Users are able to connect to the Internet by adding an Internet Gateway to their VPC, which assigns the VPC a public IPv4 Address.Users are able to connect to a data center by setting up a hardware virtual private network connection between the data center and the VPC. This connection allows the user to \u201cinteract with Amazon EC2 instances within a VPC as if they were within [the user's] existing network.\u201dUsers are also able to route traffic from one VPC to another VPC using private IP addresses, and are able to communicate as if they were on the same network. Peering can be achieved by connecting a route between two VPCs on the same account or two VPCs on different accounts in the same region. VPC peering is a one-to-one connection, but users are able to connect to more than one VPC at a time.To achieve a one-to-many connection between VPCs, you can deploy a transit gateway (TGW). In addition, you can connect your VPCs to your on premise systems by employing the transit gateway.\n\n== Security ==\nAWS VPC's security is two-fold: firstly, AWS VPC uses security groups as a firewall to control traffic at the instance level, while it also uses network access control lists as a firewall to control traffic at the subnet level. As another measure of privacy, AWS VPC provides users with ability to create \u201cdedicated instances\u201d on hardware, physically isolating the dedicated instances from non-dedicated instances and instances owned by other accounts.AWS VPC is free, with users only paying for the consumption of EC2 resources.

In the case of high-quality block ciphers, such a small change in either the key or the plaintext should cause a drastic change in the ciphertext. The actual term was first used by Horst Feistel, although the concept dates back to at least Shannon's diffusion.\n\nIf a block cipher or cryptographic hash function does not exhibit the avalanche effect to a significant degree, then it has poor randomization, and thus a cryptanalyst can make predictions about the input, being given only the output. This may be sufficient to partially or completely break the algorithm. Thus, the avalanche effect is a desirable condition from the point of view of the designer of the cryptographic algorithm or device.\nConstructing a cipher or hash to exhibit a substantial avalanche effect is one of the primary design objectives, and mathematically the construction takes advantage of the butterfly effect. This is why most block ciphers are product ciphers. It is also why hash functions have large data blocks.

    "instruction": "Social engineering (security)\n\n==Introduction==\nIn the context of information security, social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. A type of confidence trick for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or system access, it differs from a traditional \"con\" in that it is often one of many steps in a more complex fraud scheme. It has also been defined as \"any act that influences a person to take an action that may or may not be in their best interests.\"An example of social engineering is an attacker calling a help desk, impersonating someone else, and claiming to have forgotten their password. If the help desk worker resets the password, it grants the attacker full access to the account.\n\n== Information security culture ==\nEmployee behaviour can have a big impact on information security in organizations. Cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness towards information security within an organization. \"Exploring the Relationship between Organizational Culture and Information Security Culture\" provides the following definition of information security culture: \"ISC is the totality of patterns of behavior in an organization that contribute to the protection of information of all kinds.\"Andersson and Reimers (2014) found that employees often do not see themselves as part of the organization Information Security \"effort\" and often take actions that ignore organizational information security best interests. Research shows Information security culture needs to be improved continuously. In \"Information Security Culture from Analysis to Change,\" authors commented that \"it's a never ending process, a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance.\" They suggest that to manage information security culture, five steps should be taken: Pre-evaluation, strategic planning, operative planning, implementation, and post-evaluation.\nPre-Evaluation: to identify the awareness of information security within employees and to analyse current security policy.\nStrategic Planning: to come up with a better awareness-program, we need to set clear targets. Clustering people is helpful to achieve it.\nOperative Planning: set a good security culture based on internal communication, management-buy-in, and security awareness and training program.\nImplementation: four stages should be used to implement the information security culture. They are commitment of the management, communication with organizational members, courses for all organizational members, and commitment of the employees.\n\n== Techniques and terms ==\nAll social engineering techniques are based on specific attributes of human decision-making known as cognitive biases. These biases, sometimes called \"bugs in the human hardware,\u201d are exploited in various combinations to create attack techniques, some of which are listed below. The attacks used in social engineering can be used to steal employees' confidential information. The most common type of social engineering happens over the phone. Other examples of social engineering attacks are criminals posing as exterminators, fire marshals and technicians to go unnoticed as they steal company secrets.\nOne example of social engineering is an individual who walks into a building and posts an official-looking announcement to the company bulletin that says the number for the help desk has changed. So, when employees call for help the individual asks them for their passwords and IDs thereby gaining the ability to access the company's private information.\nAnother example of social engineering would be that the hacker contacts the target on a social networking site and starts a conversation with the target. Gradually the hacker gains the trust of the target and then uses that trust to get access to sensitive information like password or bank account details.Social engineering relies heavily on the six principles of influence established by Robert Cialdini. Cialdini's theory of influence is based on six key principles: reciprocity, commitment and consistency, social proof, authority, liking, scarcity.\n\n\n*** Six key principles ***\n\n\n**** Authority ****\nIn social engineering, the attacker may pose as authority to increase the likelihood of adherence from the victim.\n\n\n**** Intimidation ****\n\nAttacker (potentially disguised) informs or implies that there will be negative consequences if certain actions are not performed. Consequences could include subtle intimidation phrases such as \"I'll tell your manager\" to much worse.\n\n\n**** Consensus / Social proof ****\n\nPeople will do things that they see other people are doing. For example, in one experiment, one or more confederates would look up into the sky; bystanders would then look up into the sky to see what they were missing. At one point this experiment was aborted, as so many people were looking up that they stopped traffic. See conformity, and the Asch conformity experiments.\n\n\n**** Scarcity ****\n\nPerceived scarcity will generate demand. The common advertising phrase \"while supplies last\" capitalizes on a sense of scarcity. \n\n\n**** Urgency ****\nLinked to scarcity, attackers use urgency as a time-based psychological principle of social engineering. For example, saying offers are available for a \"limited time only\" encourages sales through a sense of urgency.\n\n\n**** Familiarity / Liking ****\n\nPeople are easily persuaded by other people whom they like. Cialdini cites the marketing of Tupperware in what might now be called viral marketing. People were more likely to buy if they liked the person selling it to them. Some of the many biases favoring more attractive people are discussed. See physical attractiveness stereotype.\n\n\n*** Four social engineering vectors ***\n\n\n**** Vishing ****\nVishing, otherwise known as \"voice phishing\", is the criminal practice of using social engineering over a telephone system to gain access to private personal and financial information from the public for the purpose of financial reward. It is also employed by attackers for reconnaissance purposes to gather more detailed intelligence on a target organization.\n\n\n**** Phishing ****\n\nPhishing is a technique of fraudulently obtaining private information. Typically, the phisher sends an e-mail that appears to come from a legitimate business\u2014a bank, or credit card company\u2014requesting \"verification\" of information and warning of some dire consequence if it is not provided. The e-mail usually contains a link to a fraudulent web page that seems legitimate\u2014with company logos and content\u2014and has a form requesting everything from a home address to an ATM card's PIN or a credit card number. For example, in 2003, there was a phishing scam in which users received emails supposedly from eBay claiming that the user's account was about to be suspended unless a link provided was clicked to update a credit card (information that the genuine eBay already had). By mimicking a legitimate organization's HTML code and logos, it is relatively simple to make a fake Website look authentic. The scam tricked some people into thinking that eBay was requiring them to update their account information by clicking on the link provided. By indiscriminately spamming extremely large groups of people, the \"phisher\" counted on gaining sensitive financial information from the small percentage (yet large number) of recipients who already have eBay accounts and also fall prey to the scam.\n\n\n**** Smishing ****\nThe act of using SMS text messaging to lure victims into a specific course of action, also known as \"smishing\". Like phishing it can be clicking on a malicious link or divulging information. Examples are text messages that claim to be from a common carrier (like FedEx) stating a package is in transit, with a link provided.\n\n\n**** Impersonation ****\nPretending or pretexting to be another person with the goal of gaining access physically to a system or building. Impersonation is used in the \"SIM swap scam\" fraud.\n\n== Other concepts ==\n\n\n*** Pretexting ***\n\nPretexting (adj. pretextual) is the act of creating and using an invented scenario (the pretext) to engage a targeted victim in a manner that increases the chance the victim will divulge information or perform actions that would be unlikely in ordinary circumstances. An elaborate lie, it most often involves some prior research or setup and the use of this information for impersonation (e.g., date of birth, Social Security number, last bill amount) to establish legitimacy in the mind of the target. As a background, pretexting can be interpreted as the first evolution of social engineering, and continued to develop as social engineering incorporated current-day technologies. Current and past examples of pretexting demonstrate this development.\nThis technique can be used to fool a business into disclosing customer information as well as by private investigators to obtain telephone records, utility records, banking records and other information directly from company service representatives. The information can then be used to establish even greater legitimacy under tougher questioning with a manager, e.g., to make account changes, get specific balances, etc.\nPretexting can also be used to impersonate co-workers, police, bank, tax authorities, clergy, insurance investigators\u2014or any other individual who could have perceived authority or right-to-know in the mind of the targeted victim. The pretexter must simply prepare answers to questions that might be asked by the victim. In some cases, all that is needed is a voice that sounds authoritative, an earnest tone, and an ability to think on one's feet to create a pretextual scenario.\n\n\n*** Vishing ***\n\nPhone phishing (or \"vishing\") uses a rogue interactive voice response (IVR) system to recreate a legitimate-sounding copy of a bank or other institution's IVR system. The victim is prompted (typically via a phishing e-mail) to call in to the \"bank\" via a (ideally toll free) number provided in order to \"verify\" information. A typical \"vishing\" system will reject log-ins continually, ensuring the victim enters PINs or passwords multiple times, often disclosing several different passwords. More advanced systems transfer the victim to the attacker/defrauder, who poses as a customer service agent or security expert for further questioning of the victim.\n\n\n*** Spear phishing ***\n\nAlthough similar to \"phishing\", spear phishing is a technique that fraudulently obtains private information by sending highly customized emails to few end users. It is the main difference between phishing attacks because phishing campaigns focus on sending out high volumes of generalized emails with the expectation that only a few people will respond. On the other hand, spear-phishing emails require the attacker to perform additional research on their targets in order to \"trick\" end users into performing requested activities. The success rate of spear-phishing attacks is considerably higher than phishing attacks with people opening roughly 3% of phishing emails when compared to roughly 70% of potential attempts. When users actually open the emails phishing emails have a relatively modest 5% success rate to have the link or attachment clicked when compared to a spear-phishing attack's 50% success rate.Spear-phishing success is heavily dependent on the amount and quality of OSINT (open-source intelligence) that the attacker can obtain. Social media account activity is one example of a source of OSINT.\n\n\n*** Water holing ***\n\nWater holing is a targeted social engineering strategy that capitalizes on the trust users have in websites they regularly visit. The victim feels safe to do things they would not do in a different situation. A wary person might, for example, purposefully avoid clicking a link in an unsolicited email, but the same person would not hesitate to follow a link on a website they often visit. So, the attacker prepares a trap for the unwary prey at a favored watering hole. This strategy has been successfully used to gain access to some (supposedly) very secure systems.The attacker may set out by identifying a group or individuals to target. The preparation involves gathering information about websites the targets often visit from the secure system. The information gathering confirms that the targets visit the websites and that the system allows such visits. The attacker then tests these websites for vulnerabilities to inject code that may infect a visitor's system with malware. The injected code trap and malware may be tailored to the specific target group and the specific systems they use. In time, one or more members of the target group will get infected and the attacker can gain access to the secure system.\n\n\n*** Baiting ***\nBaiting is like the real-world Trojan horse that uses physical media and relies on the curiosity or greed of the victim. In this attack, attackers leave malware-infected floppy disks, CD-ROMs, or USB flash drives in locations people will find them (bathrooms, elevators, sidewalks, parking lots, etc.), give them legitimate and curiosity-piquing labels, and wait for victims.\nFor example, an attacker may create a disk featuring a corporate logo, available from the target's website, and label it \"Executive Salary Summary Q2 2012\". The attacker then leaves the disk on the floor of an elevator or somewhere in the lobby of the target company. An unknowing employee may find it and insert the disk into a computer to satisfy their curiosity, or a good Samaritan may find it and return it to the company. In any case, just inserting the disk into a computer installs malware, giving attackers access to the victim's PC and, perhaps, the target company's internal computer network.\nUnless computer controls block infections, insertion compromises PCs \"auto-running\" media. Hostile devices can also be used. For instance, a \"lucky winner\" is sent a free digital audio player compromising any computer it is plugged to. A \"road apple\" (the colloquial term for horse manure, suggesting the device's undesirable nature) is any removable media with malicious software left in opportunistic or conspicuous places. It may be a CD, DVD, or USB flash drive, among other media. Curious people take it and plug it into a computer, infecting the host and any attached networks. Again, hackers may give them enticing labels, such as \"Employee Salaries\" or \"Confidential\".One study done in 2016 had researchers drop 297 USB drives around the campus of the University of Illinois. The drives contained files on them that linked to webpages owned by the researchers. The researchers were able to see how many of the drives had files on them opened, but not how many were inserted into a computer without having a file opened. Of the 297 drives that were dropped, 290 (98%) of them were picked up and 135 (45%) of them \"called home\".\n\n\n*** Quid pro quo ***\nQuid pro quo means something for something:\n\nAn attacker calls random numbers at a company, claiming to be calling back from technical support. Eventually this person will hit someone with a legitimate problem, grateful that someone is calling back to help them. The attacker will \"help\" solve the problem and, in the process, have the user type commands that give the attacker access or launch malware.\nIn a 2003 information security survey, 91% of office workers gave researchers what they claimed was their password in answer to a survey question in exchange for a cheap pen. Similar surveys in later years obtained similar results using chocolates and other cheap lures, although they made no attempt to validate the passwords.\n\n\n*** Tailgating ***\n\nAn attacker, seeking entry to a restricted area secured by unattended, electronic access control, e.g. by RFID card, simply walks in behind a person who has legitimate access. Following common courtesy, the legitimate person will usually hold the door open for the attacker or the attackers themselves may ask the employee to hold it open for them. The attacker will often purport to be on a phone call using a mobile to prevent questioning by an employee. The legitimate person may fail to ask for identification for any of several reasons, or may accept an assertion that the attacker has forgotten or lost the appropriate identity token. The attacker may also fake the action of presenting an identity token. \n\n\n*** Other types ***\nCommon confidence tricksters or fraudsters also could be considered \"social engineers\" in the wider sense, in that they deliberately deceive and manipulate people, exploiting human weaknesses to obtain personal benefit. They may, for example, use social engineering techniques as part of an IT fraud.\nAs of the early 2000s, another type of social engineering technique includes spoofing or hacking IDs of people having popular e-mail IDs such as Yahoo!, Gmail, or Hotmail. Additionally, some spoofing attempts included emails from major online service providers, like PayPal. This led to the \"proposed standard\" of Sender Policy Framework RFC 7208 dated April 2014, in combination with DMARC, as means to combat spoofing. Among the many motivations for this deception are:\n\nPhishing credit-card account numbers and their passwords.\nCracking private e-mails and chat histories, and manipulating them by using common editing techniques before using them to extort money and creating distrust among individuals.\nCracking websites of companies or organizations and destroying their reputation.\nComputer virus hoaxes\nConvincing users to run malicious code within the web browser via self-XSS attack to allow access to their web accountAnother type is to read sensitive information of unshielded or unprotected Displays and input devices, called Shoulder surfing.\n\n\n*** Countermeasures ***\nOrganizations reduce their security risks by:\nTraining to Employees: Training employees in security protocols relevant to their position. (e.g., in situations such as tailgating, if a person's identity cannot be verified, then employees must be trained to politely refuse.)\nStandard Framework: Establishing frameworks of trust on an employee/personnel level (i.e., specify and train personnel when/where/why/how sensitive information should be handled)\nScrutinizing Information: Identifying which information is sensitive and evaluating its exposure to social engineering and breakdowns in security systems (building, computer system, etc.)\nSecurity Protocols: Establishing security protocols, policies, and procedures for handling sensitive information.\nEvent Test: Performing unannounced, periodic tests of the security framework.\nInoculation: Preventing social engineering and other fraudulent tricks or traps by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempts through exposure to similar or related attempts.Review: Reviewing the above steps regularly: no solutions to information integrity are perfect.Waste Management: Using a waste management service that has dumpsters with locks on them, with keys to them limited only to the waste management company and the cleaning staff. Locating the dumpster either in view of employees so that trying to access it carries a risk of being seen or caught, or behind a locked gate or fence where the person must trespass before they can attempt to access the dumpster.\n\n== The lifecycle of social engineering ==\nInformation gathering: Information gathering is the first and foremost step of the lifecycle. It requires much patience and keenly watching habits of the victim. This step gathering data about the victim's interests, personal information. It determines the success rate of the overall attack.\nEngaging with victim: After gathering required amount of information, the attacker opens a conversation with the victim smoothly without the victim finding anything inappropriate.\nAttacking: This step generally occurs after a long period of engaging with the target and during this information from the target is retrieved by using social engineering. In phase, the attacker gets the results from the target.\nClosing interaction: This is the last step which includes slowly shutting down the communication by the attacker without arising any suspicion in the victim. In this way, the motive is fulfilled as well as the victim rarely realizes the attack even happened.\n\n== Notable social engineers ==\n\n\n*** Frank Abagnale Jr. ***\nFrank Abagnale Jr. is an American security consultant known for his background as a former con man, check forger, and impostor while he was between the ages of 15 and 21. He became one of the most notorious impostors, claiming to have assumed no fewer than eight identities, including an airline pilot, a physician, a U.S. Bureau of Prisons agent, and a lawyer. Abagnale escaped from police custody twice (once from a taxiing airliner and once from a U.S. federal penitentiary) before turning 22 years old. The popular Steven Spielberg movie Catch Me If You Can is based on his life.\n\n\n*** Kevin Mitnick ***\nKevin Mitnick is an American computer security consultant, author and hacker, best known for his high-profile 1995 arrest and later five-year conviction for various computer and communications-related crimes.\n\n\n*** Susan Headley ***\nSusan Headley was an American hacker active during the late 1970s and early 1980s widely respected for her expertise in social engineering, pretexting, and psychological subversion. She was known for her specialty in breaking into military computer systems, which often involved going to bed with military personnel and going through their clothes for usernames and passwords while they slept. She became heavily involved in phreaking with Kevin Mitnick and Lewis de Payne in Los Angeles, but later framed them for erasing the system files at US Leasing after a falling out, leading to Mitnick's first conviction. She retired to professional poker.\n\n\n*** James Linton ***\nJames Linton is a British hacker and social engineer who in 2017 used OSINT and spear phishing techniques to trick a variety of targets over email including the CEOs of Major Banks, and members of the Trump White House Administration. He then went to work in email security where he socially engineered BEC (Business Email Compromise) threat actors to collect specific threat intelligence.\n\n\n*** Mike Ridpath ***\nMike Ridpath Security consultant, published author, and speaker. Previous member of w00w00. Emphasizes techniques and tactics for social engineering cold calling. Became notable after his talks where he would play recorded calls and explain his thought process on what he was doing to get passwords through the phone and his live demonstrations. As a child Ridpath was connected with Badir Brothers and was widely known within the phreaking and hacking community for his articles with popular underground ezines, such as, Phrack, B4B0 and 9x on modifying Oki 900s, blueboxing, satellite hacking and RCMAC.\n\n\n*** Badir Brothers ***\nBrothers Ramy, Muzher, and Shadde Badir\u2014all of whom were blind from birth\u2014managed to set up an extensive phone and computer fraud scheme in Israel in the 1990s using social engineering, voice impersonation, and Braille-display computers.\n\n\n*** Christopher J. Hadnagy ***\nChristopher J. Hadnagy is an American social engineer and information technology security consultant.  He is best known as an author of 4 books on social engineering and cyber security and founder of Innocent Lives Foundation, an organization that helps tracking and identifying child trafficking using various security techniques such as seeking the assistance of information security specialists, utilizing data from open-source intelligence (OSINT) and collaborating with law enforcement.\n\n== Law ==\nIn common law, pretexting is an invasion of privacy tort of appropriation.\n\n\n*** Pretexting of telephone records ***\nIn December 2006, United States Congress approved a Senate sponsored bill making the pretexting of telephone records a federal felony with fines of up to $250,000 and ten years in prison for individuals (or fines of up to $500,000 for companies). It was signed by President George W. Bush on 12 January 2007.\n\n\n*** Federal legislation ***\nThe 1999 \"GLBA\" is a U.S. Federal law that specifically addresses pretexting of banking records as an illegal act punishable under federal statutes. When a business entity such as a private investigator, SIU insurance investigator, or an adjuster conducts any type of deception, it falls under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). This federal agency has the obligation and authority to ensure that consumers are not subjected to any unfair or deceptive business practices. US Federal Trade Commission Act, Section 5 of the FTCA states, in part:\n\"Whenever the Commission shall have reason to believe that any such person, partnership, or corporation has been or is using any unfair method of competition or unfair or deceptive act or practice in or affecting commerce, and if it shall appear to the Commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public, it shall issue and serve upon such person, partnership, or corporation a complaint stating its charges in that respect.\"\nThe statute states that when someone obtains any personal, non-public information from a financial institution or the consumer, their action is subject to the statute. It relates to the consumer's relationship with the financial institution. For example, a pretexter using false pretenses either to get a consumer's address from the consumer's bank, or to get a consumer to disclose the name of their bank, would be covered. The determining principle is that pretexting only occurs when information is obtained through false pretenses.\nWhile the sale of cell telephone records has gained significant media attention, and telecommunications records are the focus of the two bills currently before the United States Senate, many other types of private records are being bought and sold in the public market. Alongside many advertisements for cell phone records, wireline records and the records associated with calling cards are advertised. As individuals shift to VoIP telephones, it is safe to assume that those records will be offered for sale as well. Currently, it is legal to sell telephone records, but illegal to obtain them.\n\n\n*** 1st Source Information Specialists ***\nU.S. Rep. Fred Upton (R-Kalamazoo, Michigan), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, expressed concern over the easy access to personal mobile phone records on the Internet during a House Energy & Commerce Committee hearing on \"Phone Records For Sale: Why Aren't Phone Records Safe From Pretexting?\" Illinois became the first state to sue an online records broker when Attorney General Lisa Madigan sued 1st Source Information Specialists, Inc. A spokeswoman for Madigan's office said. The Florida-based company operates several Web sites that sell mobile telephone records, according to a copy of the suit. The attorneys general of Florida and Missouri quickly followed Madigan's lead, filing suits respectively, against 1st Source Information Specialists and, in Missouri's case, one other records broker \u2013 First Data Solutions, Inc.\nSeveral wireless providers, including T-Mobile, Verizon, and Cingular filed earlier lawsuits against records brokers, with Cingular winning an injunction against First Data Solutions and 1st Source Information Specialists. U.S. Senator Charles Schumer (D-New York) introduced legislation in February 2006 aimed at curbing the practice. The Consumer Telephone Records Protection Act of 2006 would create felony criminal penalties for stealing and selling the records of mobile phone, landline, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) subscribers.\n\n\n*** Hewlett Packard ***\nPatricia Dunn, former chairwoman of Hewlett Packard, reported that the HP board hired a private investigation company to delve into who was responsible for leaks within the board. Dunn acknowledged that the company used the practice of pretexting to solicit the telephone records of board members and journalists. Chairman Dunn later apologized for this act and offered to step down from the board if it was desired by board members. Unlike Federal law, California law specifically forbids such pretexting. The four felony charges brought on Dunn were dismissed.\n\n== Preventive measures ==\nTaking some precautions reduces the risk of being a victim of social engineering frauds. The precautions that can be made are as follows:\n\nBe aware of offers that seem  \"Too good to be true\".\nUse multifactor authentication.\nAvoid clicking on attachments from unknown sources.\nNot giving out personal or financial information (such as credit card information, Social Security Numbers, or bank account information) to anyone via email, phone, or text messages.\nUse of spam filter software.\nAvoid befriending people that you do not know in real life.\nTeach kids to contact a trusted adult in case they are being bullied over the internet (cyberbullying) or feel threatened by anything online.\nDon't make instant decisions, but when possible take 5 minutes to evaluate the information presented.\n\nHow do tailgating attacks exploit unattended electronic access control systems?",

      "context": "Social engineering (security)\n\n==Introduction==\nIn the context of information security, social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. A type of confidence trick for the purpose of information gathering, fraud, or system access, it differs from a traditional \"con\" in that it is often one of many steps in a more complex fraud scheme. It has also been defined as \"any act that influences a person to take an action that may or may not be in their best interests.\"An example of social engineering is an attacker calling a help desk, impersonating someone else, and claiming to have forgotten their password. If the help desk worker resets the password, it grants the attacker full access to the account.\n\n== Information security culture ==\nEmployee behaviour can have a big impact on information security in organizations. Cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness towards information security within an organization. \"Exploring the Relationship between Organizational Culture and Information Security Culture\" provides the following definition of information security culture: \"ISC is the totality of patterns of behavior in an organization that contribute to the protection of information of all kinds.\"Andersson and Reimers (2014) found that employees often do not see themselves as part of the organization Information Security \"effort\" and often take actions that ignore organizational information security best interests. Research shows Information security culture needs to be improved continuously. In \"Information Security Culture from Analysis to Change,\" authors commented that \"it's a never ending process, a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance.\" They suggest that to manage information security culture, five steps should be taken: Pre-evaluation, strategic planning, operative planning, implementation, and post-evaluation.\nPre-Evaluation: to identify the awareness of information security within employees and to analyse current security policy.\nStrategic Planning: to come up with a better awareness-program, we need to set clear targets. Clustering people is helpful to achieve it.\nOperative Planning: set a good security culture based on internal communication, management-buy-in, and security awareness and training program.\nImplementation: four stages should be used to implement the information security culture. They are commitment of the management, communication with organizational members, courses for all organizational members, and commitment of the employees.\n\n== Techniques and terms ==\nAll social engineering techniques are based on specific attributes of human decision-making known as cognitive biases. These biases, sometimes called \"bugs in the human hardware,\u201d are exploited in various combinations to create attack techniques, some of which are listed below. The attacks used in social engineering can be used to steal employees' confidential information. The most common type of social engineering happens over the phone. Other examples of social engineering attacks are criminals posing as exterminators, fire marshals and technicians to go unnoticed as they steal company secrets.\nOne example of social engineering is an individual who walks into a building and posts an official-looking announcement to the company bulletin that says the number for the help desk has changed. So, when employees call for help the individual asks them for their passwords and IDs thereby gaining the ability to access the company's private information.\nAnother example of social engineering would be that the hacker contacts the target on a social networking site and starts a conversation with the target. Gradually the hacker gains the trust of the target and then uses that trust to get access to sensitive information like password or bank account details.Social engineering relies heavily on the six principles of influence established by Robert Cialdini. Cialdini's theory of influence is based on six key principles: reciprocity, commitment and consistency, social proof, authority, liking, scarcity.\n\n\n*** Six key principles ***\n\n\n**** Authority ****\nIn social engineering, the attacker may pose as authority to increase the likelihood of adherence from the victim.\n\n\n**** Intimidation ****\n\nAttacker (potentially disguised) informs or implies that there will be negative consequences if certain actions are not performed. Consequences could include subtle intimidation phrases such as \"I'll tell your manager\" to much worse.\n\n\n**** Consensus / Social proof ****\n\nPeople will do things that they see other people are doing. For example, in one experiment, one or more confederates would look up into the sky; bystanders would then look up into the sky to see what they were missing. At one point this experiment was aborted, as so many people were looking up that they stopped traffic. See conformity, and the Asch conformity experiments.\n\n\n**** Scarcity ****\n\nPerceived scarcity will generate demand. The common advertising phrase \"while supplies last\" capitalizes on a sense of scarcity. \n\n\n**** Urgency ****\nLinked to scarcity, attackers use urgency as a time-based psychological principle of social engineering. For example, saying offers are available for a \"limited time only\" encourages sales through a sense of urgency.\n\n\n**** Familiarity / Liking ****\n\nPeople are easily persuaded by other people whom they like. Cialdini cites the marketing of Tupperware in what might now be called viral marketing. People were more likely to buy if they liked the person selling it to them. Some of the many biases favoring more attractive people are discussed. See physical attractiveness stereotype.\n\n\n*** Four social engineering vectors ***\n\n\n**** Vishing ****\nVishing, otherwise known as \"voice phishing\", is the criminal practice of using social engineering over a telephone system to gain access to private personal and financial information from the public for the purpose of financial reward. It is also employed by attackers for reconnaissance purposes to gather more detailed intelligence on a target organization.\n\n\n**** Phishing ****\n\nPhishing is a technique of fraudulently obtaining private information. Typically, the phisher sends an e-mail that appears to come from a legitimate business\u2014a bank, or credit card company\u2014requesting \"verification\" of information and warning of some dire consequence if it is not provided. The e-mail usually contains a link to a fraudulent web page that seems legitimate\u2014with company logos and content\u2014and has a form requesting everything from a home address to an ATM card's PIN or a credit card number. For example, in 2003, there was a phishing scam in which users received emails supposedly from eBay claiming that the user's account was about to be suspended unless a link provided was clicked to update a credit card (information that the genuine eBay already had). By mimicking a legitimate organization's HTML code and logos, it is relatively simple to make a fake Website look authentic. The scam tricked some people into thinking that eBay was requiring them to update their account information by clicking on the link provided. By indiscriminately spamming extremely large groups of people, the \"phisher\" counted on gaining sensitive financial information from the small percentage (yet large number) of recipients who already have eBay accounts and also fall prey to the scam.\n\n\n**** Smishing ****\nThe act of using SMS text messaging to lure victims into a specific course of action, also known as \"smishing\". Like phishing it can be clicking on a malicious link or divulging information. Examples are text messages that claim to be from a common carrier (like FedEx) stating a package is in transit, with a link provided.\n\n\n**** Impersonation ****\nPretending or pretexting to be another person with the goal of gaining access physically to a system or building. Impersonation is used in the \"SIM swap scam\" fraud.\n\n== Other concepts ==\n\n\n*** Pretexting ***\n\nPretexting (adj. pretextual) is the act of creating and using an invented scenario (the pretext) to engage a targeted victim in a manner that increases the chance the victim will divulge information or perform actions that would be unlikely in ordinary circumstances. An elaborate lie, it most often involves some prior research or setup and the use of this information for impersonation (e.g., date of birth, Social Security number, last bill amount) to establish legitimacy in the mind of the target. As a background, pretexting can be interpreted as the first evolution of social engineering, and continued to develop as social engineering incorporated current-day technologies. Current and past examples of pretexting demonstrate this development.\nThis technique can be used to fool a business into disclosing customer information as well as by private investigators to obtain telephone records, utility records, banking records and other information directly from company service representatives. The information can then be used to establish even greater legitimacy under tougher questioning with a manager, e.g., to make account changes, get specific balances, etc.\nPretexting can also be used to impersonate co-workers, police, bank, tax authorities, clergy, insurance investigators\u2014or any other individual who could have perceived authority or right-to-know in the mind of the targeted victim. The pretexter must simply prepare answers to questions that might be asked by the victim. In some cases, all that is needed is a voice that sounds authoritative, an earnest tone, and an ability to think on one's feet to create a pretextual scenario.\n\n\n*** Vishing ***\n\nPhone phishing (or \"vishing\") uses a rogue interactive voice response (IVR) system to recreate a legitimate-sounding copy of a bank or other institution's IVR system. The victim is prompted (typically via a phishing e-mail) to call in to the \"bank\" via a (ideally toll free) number provided in order to \"verify\" information. A typical \"vishing\" system will reject log-ins continually, ensuring the victim enters PINs or passwords multiple times, often disclosing several different passwords. More advanced systems transfer the victim to the attacker/defrauder, who poses as a customer service agent or security expert for further questioning of the victim.\n\n\n*** Spear phishing ***\n\nAlthough similar to \"phishing\", spear phishing is a technique that fraudulently obtains private information by sending highly customized emails to few end users. It is the main difference between phishing attacks because phishing campaigns focus on sending out high volumes of generalized emails with the expectation that only a few people will respond. On the other hand, spear-phishing emails require the attacker to perform additional research on their targets in order to \"trick\" end users into performing requested activities.

When users actually open the emails phishing emails have a relatively modest 5% success rate to have the link or attachment clicked when compared to a spear-phishing attack's 50% success rate.Spear-phishing success is heavily dependent on the amount and quality of OSINT (open-source intelligence) that the attacker can obtain. Social media account activity is one example of a source of OSINT.\n\n\n*** Water holing ***\n\nWater holing is a targeted social engineering strategy that capitalizes on the trust users have in websites they regularly visit. The victim feels safe to do things they would not do in a different situation. A wary person might, for example, purposefully avoid clicking a link in an unsolicited email, but the same person would not hesitate to follow a link on a website they often visit. So, the attacker prepares a trap for the unwary prey at a favored watering hole. This strategy has been successfully used to gain access to some (supposedly) very secure systems.The attacker may set out by identifying a group or individuals to target. The preparation involves gathering information about websites the targets often visit from the secure system. The information gathering confirms that the targets visit the websites and that the system allows such visits. The attacker then tests these websites for vulnerabilities to inject code that may infect a visitor's system with malware. The injected code trap and malware may be tailored to the specific target group and the specific systems they use. In time, one or more members of the target group will get infected and the attacker can gain access to the secure system.\n\n\n*** Baiting ***\nBaiting is like the real-world Trojan horse that uses physical media and relies on the curiosity or greed of the victim. In this attack, attackers leave malware-infected floppy disks, CD-ROMs, or USB flash drives in locations people will find them (bathrooms, elevators, sidewalks, parking lots, etc.), give them legitimate and curiosity-piquing labels, and wait for victims.\nFor example, an attacker may create a disk featuring a corporate logo, available from the target's website, and label it \"Executive Salary Summary Q2 2012\". The attacker then leaves the disk on the floor of an elevator or somewhere in the lobby of the target company. An unknowing employee may find it and insert the disk into a computer to satisfy their curiosity, or a good Samaritan may find it and return it to the company. In any case, just inserting the disk into a computer installs malware, giving attackers access to the victim's PC and, perhaps, the target company's internal computer network.\nUnless computer controls block infections, insertion compromises PCs \"auto-running\" media. Hostile devices can also be used. For instance, a \"lucky winner\" is sent a free digital audio player compromising any computer it is plugged to. A \"road apple\" (the colloquial term for horse manure, suggesting the device's undesirable nature) is any removable media with malicious software left in opportunistic or conspicuous places. It may be a CD, DVD, or USB flash drive, among other media. Curious people take it and plug it into a computer, infecting the host and any attached networks. Again, hackers may give them enticing labels, such as \"Employee Salaries\" or \"Confidential\".One study done in 2016 had researchers drop 297 USB drives around the campus of the University of Illinois. The drives contained files on them that linked to webpages owned by the researchers. The researchers were able to see how many of the drives had files on them opened, but not how many were inserted into a computer without having a file opened. Of the 297 drives that were dropped, 290 (98%) of them were picked up and 135 (45%) of them \"called home\".\n\n\n*** Quid pro quo ***\nQuid pro quo means something for something:\n\nAn attacker calls random numbers at a company, claiming to be calling back from technical support. Eventually this person will hit someone with a legitimate problem, grateful that someone is calling back to help them. The attacker will \"help\" solve the problem and, in the process, have the user type commands that give the attacker access or launch malware.\nIn a 2003 information security survey, 91% of office workers gave researchers what they claimed was their password in answer to a survey question in exchange for a cheap pen. Similar surveys in later years obtained similar results using chocolates and other cheap lures, although they made no attempt to validate the passwords.\n\n\n*** Tailgating ***\n\nAn attacker, seeking entry to a restricted area secured by unattended, electronic access control, e.g. by RFID card, simply walks in behind a person who has legitimate access. Following common courtesy, the legitimate person will usually hold the door open for the attacker or the attackers themselves may ask the employee to hold it open for them. The attacker will often purport to be on a phone call using a mobile to prevent questioning by an employee. The legitimate person may fail to ask for identification for any of several reasons, or may accept an assertion that the attacker has forgotten or lost the appropriate identity token. The attacker may also fake the action of presenting an identity token. \n\n\n*** Other types ***\nCommon confidence tricksters or fraudsters also could be considered \"social engineers\" in the wider sense, in that they deliberately deceive and manipulate people, exploiting human weaknesses to obtain personal benefit. They may, for example, use social engineering techniques as part of an IT fraud.\nAs of the early 2000s, another type of social engineering technique includes spoofing or hacking IDs of people having popular e-mail IDs such as Yahoo!, Gmail, or Hotmail. Additionally, some spoofing attempts included emails from major online service providers, like PayPal. This led to the \"proposed standard\" of Sender Policy Framework RFC 7208 dated April 2014, in combination with DMARC, as means to combat spoofing. Among the many motivations for this deception are:\n\nPhishing credit-card account numbers and their passwords.\nCracking private e-mails and chat histories, and manipulating them by using common editing techniques before using them to extort money and creating distrust among individuals.\nCracking websites of companies or organizations and destroying their reputation.\nComputer virus hoaxes\nConvincing users to run malicious code within the web browser via self-XSS attack to allow access to their web accountAnother type is to read sensitive information of unshielded or unprotected Displays and input devices, called Shoulder surfing.\n\n\n*** Countermeasures ***\nOrganizations reduce their security risks by:\nTraining to Employees: Training employees in security protocols relevant to their position. (e.g., in situations such as tailgating, if a person's identity cannot be verified, then employees must be trained to politely refuse.)\nStandard Framework: Establishing frameworks of trust on an employee/personnel level (i.e., specify and train personnel when/where/why/how sensitive information should be handled)\nScrutinizing Information: Identifying which information is sensitive and evaluating its exposure to social engineering and breakdowns in security systems (building, computer system, etc.)\nSecurity Protocols: Establishing security protocols, policies, and procedures for handling sensitive information.\nEvent Test: Performing unannounced, periodic tests of the security framework.\nInoculation: Preventing social engineering and other fraudulent tricks or traps by instilling a resistance to persuasion attempts through exposure to similar or related attempts.Review: Reviewing the above steps regularly: no solutions to information integrity are perfect.Waste Management: Using a waste management service that has dumpsters with locks on them, with keys to them limited only to the waste management company and the cleaning staff. Locating the dumpster either in view of employees so that trying to access it carries a risk of being seen or caught, or behind a locked gate or fence where the person must trespass before they can attempt to access the dumpster.\n\n== The lifecycle of social engineering ==\nInformation gathering: Information gathering is the first and foremost step of the lifecycle. It requires much patience and keenly watching habits of the victim. This step gathering data about the victim's interests, personal information. It determines the success rate of the overall attack.\nEngaging with victim: After gathering required amount of information, the attacker opens a conversation with the victim smoothly without the victim finding anything inappropriate.\nAttacking: This step generally occurs after a long period of engaging with the target and during this information from the target is retrieved by using social engineering. In phase, the attacker gets the results from the target.\nClosing interaction: This is the last step which includes slowly shutting down the communication by the attacker without arising any suspicion in the victim. In this way, the motive is fulfilled as well as the victim rarely realizes the attack even happened.\n\n== Notable social engineers ==\n\n\n*** Frank Abagnale Jr. ***\nFrank Abagnale Jr. is an American security consultant known for his background as a former con man, check forger, and impostor while he was between the ages of 15 and 21. He became one of the most notorious impostors, claiming to have assumed no fewer than eight identities, including an airline pilot, a physician, a U.S. Bureau of Prisons agent, and a lawyer. Abagnale escaped from police custody twice (once from a taxiing airliner and once from a U.S. federal penitentiary) before turning 22 years old. The popular Steven Spielberg movie Catch Me If You Can is based on his life.\n\n\n*** Kevin Mitnick ***\nKevin Mitnick is an American computer security consultant, author and hacker, best known for his high-profile 1995 arrest and later five-year conviction for various computer and communications-related crimes.\n\n\n*** Susan Headley ***\nSusan Headley was an American hacker active during the late 1970s and early 1980s widely respected for her expertise in social engineering, pretexting, and psychological subversion. She was known for her specialty in breaking into military computer systems, which often involved going to bed with military personnel and going through their clothes for usernames and passwords while they slept. She became heavily involved in phreaking with Kevin Mitnick and Lewis de Payne in Los Angeles, but later framed them for erasing the system files at US Leasing after a falling out, leading to Mitnick's first conviction. She retired to professional poker.\n\n\n*** James Linton ***\nJames Linton is a British hacker and social engineer who in 2017 used OSINT and spear phishing techniques to trick a variety of targets over email including the CEOs of Major Banks, and members of the Trump White House Administration. He then went to work in email security where he socially engineered BEC (Business Email Compromise) threat actors to collect specific threat intelligence.\n\n\n*** Mike Ridpath ***\nMike Ridpath Security consultant, published author, and speaker. Previous member of w00w00. Emphasizes techniques and tactics for social engineering cold calling. Became notable after his talks where he would play recorded calls and explain his thought process on what he was doing to get passwords through the phone and his live demonstrations. As a child Ridpath was connected with Badir Brothers and was widely known within the phreaking and hacking community for his articles with popular underground ezines, such as, Phrack, B4B0 and 9x on modifying Oki 900s, blueboxing, satellite hacking and RCMAC.\n\n\n*** Badir Brothers ***\nBrothers Ramy, Muzher, and Shadde Badir\u2014all of whom were blind from birth\u2014managed to set up an extensive phone and computer fraud scheme in Israel in the 1990s using social engineering, voice impersonation, and Braille-display computers.\n\n\n*** Christopher J. Hadnagy ***\nChristopher J. Hadnagy is an American social engineer and information technology security consultant.  He is best known as an author of 4 books on social engineering and cyber security and founder of Innocent Lives Foundation, an organization that helps tracking and identifying child trafficking using various security techniques such as seeking the assistance of information security specialists, utilizing data from open-source intelligence (OSINT) and collaborating with law enforcement.\n\n== Law ==\nIn common law, pretexting is an invasion of privacy tort of appropriation.\n\n\n*** Pretexting of telephone records ***\nIn December 2006, United States Congress approved a Senate sponsored bill making the pretexting of telephone records a federal felony with fines of up to $250,000 and ten years in prison for individuals (or fines of up to $500,000 for companies). It was signed by President George W. Bush on 12 January 2007.\n\n\n*** Federal legislation ***\nThe 1999 \"GLBA\" is a U.S. Federal law that specifically addresses pretexting of banking records as an illegal act punishable under federal statutes. When a business entity such as a private investigator, SIU insurance investigator, or an adjuster conducts any type of deception, it falls under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). This federal agency has the obligation and authority to ensure that consumers are not subjected to any unfair or deceptive business practices. US Federal Trade Commission Act, Section 5 of the FTCA states, in part:\n\"Whenever the Commission shall have reason to believe that any such person, partnership, or corporation has been or is using any unfair method of competition or unfair or deceptive act or practice in or affecting commerce, and if it shall appear to the Commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public, it shall issue and serve upon such person, partnership, or corporation a complaint stating its charges in that respect.\"\nThe statute states that when someone obtains any personal, non-public information from a financial institution or the consumer, their action is subject to the statute. It relates to the consumer's relationship with the financial institution. For example, a pretexter using false pretenses either to get a consumer's address from the consumer's bank, or to get a consumer to disclose the name of their bank, would be covered. The determining principle is that pretexting only occurs when information is obtained through false pretenses.\nWhile the sale of cell telephone records has gained significant media attention, and telecommunications records are the focus of the two bills currently before the United States Senate, many other types of private records are being bought and sold in the public market. Alongside many advertisements for cell phone records, wireline records and the records associated with calling cards are advertised. As individuals shift to VoIP telephones, it is safe to assume that those records will be offered for sale as well. Currently, it is legal to sell telephone records, but illegal to obtain them.\n\n\n*** 1st Source Information Specialists ***\nU.S. Rep. Fred Upton (R-Kalamazoo, Michigan), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, expressed concern over the easy access to personal mobile phone records on the Internet during a House Energy & Commerce Committee hearing on \"Phone Records For Sale: Why Aren't Phone Records Safe From Pretexting?\" Illinois became the first state to sue an online records broker when Attorney General Lisa Madigan sued 1st Source Information Specialists, Inc. A spokeswoman for Madigan's office said. The Florida-based company operates several Web sites that sell mobile telephone records, according to a copy of the suit. The attorneys general of Florida and Missouri quickly followed Madigan's lead, filing suits respectively, against 1st Source Information Specialists and, in Missouri's case, one other records broker \u2013 First Data Solutions, Inc.\nSeveral wireless providers, including T-Mobile, Verizon, and Cingular filed earlier lawsuits against records brokers, with Cingular winning an injunction against First Data Solutions and 1st Source Information Specialists. U.S. Senator Charles Schumer (D-New York) introduced legislation in February 2006 aimed at curbing the practice. The Consumer Telephone Records Protection Act of 2006 would create felony criminal penalties for stealing and selling the records of mobile phone, landline, and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) subscribers.\n\n\n*** Hewlett Packard ***\nPatricia Dunn, former chairwoman of Hewlett Packard, reported that the HP board hired a private investigation company to delve into who was responsible for leaks within the board. Dunn acknowledged that the company used the practice of pretexting to solicit the telephone records of board members and journalists. Chairman Dunn later apologized for this act and offered to step down from the board if it was desired by board members. Unlike Federal law, California law specifically forbids such pretexting. The four felony charges brought on Dunn were dismissed.\n\n== Preventive measures ==\nTaking some precautions reduces the risk of being a victim of social engineering frauds. The precautions that can be made are as follows:\n\nBe aware of offers that seem  \"Too good to be true\".\nUse multifactor authentication.\nAvoid clicking on attachments from unknown sources.\nNot giving out personal or financial information (such as credit card information, Social Security Numbers, or bank account information) to anyone via email, phone, or text messages.\nUse of spam filter software.\nAvoid befriending people that you do not know in real life.\nTeach kids to contact a trusted adult in case they are being bullied over the internet (cyberbullying) or feel threatened by anything online.\nDon't make instant decisions, but when possible take 5 minutes to evaluate the information presented."

    "instruction": "Tcpcrypt\n\n==Introduction==\nIn computer networking, tcpcrypt is a transport layer communication encryption protocol. Unlike prior protocols like TLS (SSL), tcpcrypt is implemented as a TCP extension. It was designed by a team of six security and networking experts: Andrea Bittau, Mike Hamburg, Mark Handley, David Mazi\u00e8res, Dan Boneh and Quinn Slack. Tcpcrypt has been published as an Internet Draft. Experimental user-space implementations are available for Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and Windows. There is also a Linux kernel implementation.\nThe TCPINC (TCP Increased Security) working group was formed in June 2014 by IETF to work on standardizing security extensions in the TCP protocol. In May 2019 the working group released RFC 8547 and RFC 8548 as an experimental standard for Tcpcrypt.\n\n\n\n== Description ==\nTcpcrypt provides opportunistic encryption \u2014 if either side does not support this extension, then the protocol falls back to regular unencrypted TCP. Tcpcrypt also provides encryption to any application using TCP, even ones that do not know about encryption. This enables incremental and seamless deployment.Unlike TLS, tcpcrypt itself does not do any authentication, but passes a unique \"session ID\" down to the application; the application can then use this token for further authentication. This means that any authentication scheme can be used, including passwords or certificates. It also does a larger part of the public-key connection initiation on the client side, to reduce load on servers and mitigate DoS attacks.\n\n== Performance ==\nTcpcrypt enforces TCP timestamps and adds its own TCP options to each data packet, amounting to 36 bytes per packet compared to plain TCP. With a mean observed packet size for TCP packets of 471 bytes, this can lead to an overhead of 8% of useful bandwidth. This 36 bytes overhead may not be an issue for internet connections faster than 64kbs, but can be an issue for dial up internet users.\nCompared to TLS/SSL, tcpcrypt is designed to have a lower performance impact. In part this is because tcpcrypt does not have built-in authentication, which can be implemented by the application itself. Cryptography primitives are used in such a way to reduce load on the server side, because a single server usually has to provide services for far more clients than reverse.\n\n== Implementations ==\nThe current user space implementations are considered experimental and are reportedly unstable on some systems. It also does not support IPv6 yet, which is currently only supported by the Linux kernel version. It is expected that once tcpcrypt becomes a standard, operating systems will come with tcpcrypt support built-in, making the user space solution unnecessary.\nQ: What is opportunistic encryption in the context of tcpcrypt?",

    "instruction": "2022 Costa Rican ransomware attack\n\n==Introduction==\nBeginning on the night (UTC-6:00) of April 17, 2022, a ransomware attack began against nearly 30 institutions of the government of Costa Rica, including its Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications (MICITT), the National Meteorological Institute, state internet service provider RACSA, the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, CCSS), the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, the Fund for Social Development and Family Allowances, and the Administrative Board of the Municipal Electricity Service of Cartago.The pro-Russian Conti Group claimed the first group of attacks and demanded a US$10 million ransom in exchange for not releasing the information stolen from the Ministry of Finance, which could include sensitive information such as citizens' tax returns and companies operating in Costa Rica.As a consequence, the government had to shut down the computer systems used to declare taxes and for the control and management of imports and exports, causing losses to the productive sector on the order of US$30 million per day. Likewise, the web pages of the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications were removed from the network.\nCosta Rica required technical assistance from the United States, Israel, Spain, and Microsoft, among others, to deal with the cyber attack. The attack consisted of infections of computer systems with ransomware, defacement of web pages, theft of email files and attacks on the Social Security human resources portal, as well as on its official Twitter account.On May 6, 2022, the United States government through the FBI offered a US$10 million reward for information leading to the identification of a person or persons in a leadership position within the Conti Group, and an additional US$5 million for information leading to the capture or conviction, in any country, of individuals who aided or conspired to carry out Conti ransomware attacks.On May 8, 2022, the new president of Costa Rica, Rodrigo Chaves Robles, decreed a state of national emergency due to cyber attacks, considering them an act of terrorism. Days later, at a press conference, he stated that the country was in a state of war and that there was evidence that people inside Costa Rica were helping Conti, calling them \"traitors\" and \"filibusters\".On May 31, 2022, at dawn, the Hive Ransomware Group carried out an attack against the Costa Rican Social Security Fund, forcing the institution to turn off all its critical systems, including the Unique Digital Health File and the Centralized Collection System. The former stores sensitive medical information of patients using Social Security, while the latter is used to collect the population's insurance fees.\n\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n*** Conti Group ***\n\nConti Group is a criminal organization dedicated to carrying out ransomware attacks, stealing files and documents from servers and then demanding a ransom. Its modus operandi is to infect computers with the Conti malware, which operates with up to 32 individual logical threads, making it much faster than most viruses of its kind.The oldest member is known by the aliases Stern or Demon and acts as CEO. Another member known as Mango acts as the general manager and communicates frequently with Stern. Mango told Stern in a message that there were 62 people on the core team. The numbers of people involved fluctuate, reaching up to 100. Due to the constant turnover of members, the group recruits new members through legitimate job recruitment sites and hacker sites.Ordinary programmers earn $1,500 to $2,000 per month, and members who negotiate ransom payments can take a cut of the profits. In April 2021, a member of the Conti Group claimed to have an anonymous journalist take a 5% cut of ransomware payments by pressuring victims to pay.During the Russian invasion of Ukraine of 2022, the Conti Group announced its support for Russia and threatened to implement \"retaliatory measures\" if cyber-attacks were launched against the country. As a result, an anonymous person leaked approximately 60,000 internal chat log messages along with source code and other files used by the group.Opinions expressed in the leaks include support for Vladimir Putin, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and antisemitism (including towards Volodymyr Zelensky). A member known as Patrick repeated several false claims made by Putin about Ukraine. Patrick lives in Australia and may be a Russian citizen. Messages containing homophobia, misogyny and references to child abuse were also found.Conti has been responsible for hundreds of ransomware incidents since 2020. The FBI estimates that, as of January 2022, there were more than 1,000 victims of attacks associated with Conti ransomware with victim payouts exceeding $150 million, making Conti's the most damaging ransomware strain ever documented.Days after the FBI's announcement, Conti announced that they would begin a shutdown process. Some of the Conti members migrated to smaller organizations like Hive, HelloKitty, AvosLocker, BlackCat, and BlackByteo; others founded groups of their own.\n\n\n*** Hive Ransomware Group ***\nHive Ransomware Group is a criminal organization known for attacking public health organizations and institutions, particularly hospitals and clinics. It first appeared in June 2021, and according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), it works as affiliate-based ransomware. It employs a wide variety of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), creating significant challenges for defense and mitigation. Hive uses multiple mechanisms to compromise business networks, including phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain access and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move once on the network.According to a Cisco report, Hive criminals have evidenced low operational security by revealing information about their encryption process and other operational details. The report also indicates that Hive employs any and all means necessary to convince its victims to pay, including offering bribes to victims' negotiators once the ransom payment is made.In August 2021, ZDNet reported that Hive had attacked at least 28 healthcare organizations in the United States, hitting clinics and hospitals across Ohio and West Virginia. Among the victims was the Memorial Healthcare System, which was forced to have its hospitals use paper records, cancel procedures, and refer patients to other non-compromised facilities. The organization ended up paying the ransom to regain access to their systems.In December 2021, Hive revealed that it had attacked 355 companies over six months, the vast majority being in the United States. Of those, at least 104 ended up paying the ransom to get their systems back.In February 2022, four researchers from Kookmin University in South Korea discovered a vulnerability in the Hive ransomware encryption algorithm that allowed them to obtain the master key and recover the hijacked information.The specialized site TechTarget stated that the Hive Ransomware Group communicates in Russian, but that there is no information about the location of its operations.Bleeping Computer LLC reported that some of the Conti hackers migrated to organizations such as Hive; however, the group has denied having any connection with Conti, despite the fact that once the process of closing operations began and its hackers reached that other criminal group, the organization began to employ the tactic of publishing leaked data on the deep web, just as Conti did. AdvIntel expert Yelisey Boguslavskiy identified and confirmed with a high level of certainty that Conti had been working with Hive for more than half a year, since at least November 2021. According to her information, Hive was actively using the initial attack access provided by Conti. Unlike the Conti Group, Hive is not associated with direct support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, even though the ransom payment to Hive is likely to be received by the same people within Conti who claimed the group's collective alignment with the Russian government.Also in May 2022, Hive attacked the Community of Navarra, Spain, forcing a hundred institutions to use pen and paper while systems were recovered. That same month Hive also attacked the Central Bank of Zambia; however, the entity refused to pay the ransom, stating that it had the means to recover its systems, and it entered the extortionists' chat and provided a link to a \"dick pic\" with the message:\n\nSuck this dick and stop blocking banking networks thinking that you will monetize something, learn to monetizeIn July 2022, the FBI infiltrated Hive. Undercover Tampa, Florida Field Office agents acquired full access and acted as a subsidiary in the Hive network undetected for seven months, while gathering evidence and secretly generating decryption keys for victims to recover their data. in January 2023, the United States Department of Justice announced that they had dismantled Hive by seizing the group\u2019s servers, in coordination with Germany and the Netherlands.\n\n== Attacks ==\n\n\n*** Conti Group attack ***\nThe servers of the Ministry of Finance were the first to be compromised during the night of Sunday, April 17. The BetterCyber Twitter account was the first to replicate, the next day, the post on the Conti Group forum that reported the hacking of the government institution, indicating that 1 TeraByte of information had been stolen from the Virtual Tax Administration (ATV) platform, used by the government for citizens and companies to file their tax returns. In turn, the publication indicated that the data would begin to be published on April 23.Before 10 a.m. on April 18, the Ministry of Finance informed through a press release and through its social networks that, \"due to technical problems\", the ATV platform and the Customs Information System (TICA) had been disabled and that the deadline for filing and paying taxes that were due that day would be extended until the next business day after the systems were restored. The institution did not immediately acknowledge being hacked and initially refused to answer questions from the press about the Conti Group claim.The next day, Conti Group posted a new post on their forum announcing that they were asking for US$10 million in ransom for the stolen information. The Ministry of Finance confirmed that the information published so far corresponded to information from the National Customs Service, used for supplies and support.\nIn relation to the communications that have been detected on social networks, and classified as hacking, the Ministry of Finance communicates the following:\nIndeed, since early today we have been facing a situation in some of our servers, which has been attended by our staff and by external experts, who during the last few hours have tried to detect and repair the situations that are occurring.\nThis Ministry has made the decision to allow the investigation teams to carry out an in-depth analysis of the information systems, for which it has made the decision to temporarily suspend some platforms such as ATV and TICA, and services will be restarted once the teams complete their analyses.\nIn the last few hours, the exposure of some of the data belonging to the General Directorate of Customs has been detected, which is carrying out the information investigation processes, as established in the response plan.\n\nThe data identified so far are of a historical nature and are used by the National Customs Service as inputs and support.\nHours after the Treasury statement, the microsite of the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications suffered a defacement with a message reading, \"We greet you from Conti, look for us on your network.\"Jorge Mora Flores, director of Digital Governance of Costa Rica, indicated that as a result of the attack, and because the affected server hosts other pages, the decision was made to turn it off while checks were carried out to determine to what extent security was breached. Subsequently, an update on the Conti Group forum indicated that the attacks against Costa Rican ministries would continue \"until the government pays us\".Hours later, Conti attacked an email server of the National Meteorological Institute, stealing the information contained therein. Conti stated that the scenario that Costa Rica was experiencing was a \"beta version of a global cyber attack on an entire country\". Later, in another update on their forum, they indicated that if the Ministry of Finance did not inform their taxpayers of what was happening, they would carry out additional actions:\n\nIf the minister cannot explain to his taxpayers what is going on, we will: 1) have penetrated his critical infrastructure, gained access to over 800 servers, downloaded over 900 GB of databases and over 100 GB of internal documents, databases in the MSSQL mdf format, there is more than just the email, first name, last name... If the minister considers that this information is not confidential, we will publish it. The leak problem is not the Ministry's main problem, their backups were also encrypted, 70% of their infrastructure will probably not be able to be restored and we have backdoors in a large number of their ministries and private companies. We ask for a significantly small amount of what you will spend in the future. Their export business is already in trouble and they've already lost the $10 million they could have paid us.\nLater that day, the Costa Rican government denied having received a ransom request, despite Conti Group's forum post regarding the US$10 million.\n\nOn April 20, Conti published an additional 5 GB of information stolen from the Ministry of Finance. In the afternoon, the Government called a press conference at the Presidential House where it argued that the situation was under control, and that in addition to the Treasury, MICITT and the IMN, Radiograf\u00eda Costarricense S.A. (RACSA), a state internet service provider, had been attacked through an internal email server breach. In the meantime, the Costa Rican Social Security Fund reported having suffered a cyber attack on its human resources site, which was being combated. Conti Group did not claim responsibility for the attack, since the Fund reported hours later that no sensitive information was stolen from the insured, such as their medical history or contributions to pension or health insurance, and that the databases had been left behind intact.The Minister of the Presidency, Geannina Dinarte Romero, indicated that this was a case of international organized crime and that the Government of Costa Rica would not pay any ransom. She also announced that they were receiving technical assistance from the governments of the United States, Israel and Spain, as well as from Microsoft, which operated the servers of the Ministry of Finance.Early on April 21, Conti Group attacked the servers of the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, as well as the Social Development and Family Allowances Fund. The preliminary report of the government indicated that information such as emails and data on pension payments and social aid from both institutions was stolen. Likewise, the group offered a 35% discount on the amount of the ransom demanded if the Government of Costa Rica made a prompt payment. Before noon, the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications held a press conference where the Government reiterated its position of not paying the ransom demanded by the Conti Group, for which hours later the criminal group announced that it would immediately begin publishing the stolen information, urging Costa Rican cybercriminals to take advantage of it to commit phishing.\n\nPresident Carlos Alvarado Quesada gave his first public statement on the hack that day.\nI reiterate that the Costa Rican State WILL NOT PAY ANYTHING to these cybercriminals. But my opinion is that this attack is not a matter of money, but rather seeks to threaten the stability of the country, in a situation of transition. This they will not do. As we have always done, each person on this earth will do their part to defend Costa Rica.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Government issued a directive addressed to the public sector in order to protect the proper functioning, confidentiality and cybersecurity of public institutions. The document provides that, in the event of any situation that affects the confidentiality, availability and integrity of services available to the public, the continuity of institutional functions, or the identity theft of the institution on social networks\u2014even those that within the institution are considered to be under control\u2014the Computer Security Incident Response Center (CSIRT-CR) must be informed of the event. In addition, agencies are required to back up information regarding the incident for use in investigations. Likewise, institutions must carry out maintenance of their telecommunications infrastructure\u2014whether through public employees or private contractors\u2014including regular updates of institutional systems, changing passwords of all institutional systems and networks, disabling unnecessary services and ports, and monitoring network infrastructure, as well as taking heed of alerts from the CSIRT-CR. The guideline also orders a vulnerability scan to be carried out at least twice a year on the official websites of the government of Costa Rica.On the morning of April 22, the government reported that no new Conti Group attacks against the country had been recorded since the previous day. However, the director of Digital Governance, Jorge Mora, explained that since Monday, when they began to take preventive measures in state institutions, they have detected 35,000 malware communication requests, 9,900 phishing incidents, 60,000 attempts to take remote control of IT systems, and 60,000 attempts to mine cryptocurrencies using the computer infrastructure of the first 100 state institutions intervened.On April 23, the Conti Group attacked the Administrative Board of the Municipal Electrical Service of Cartago, the public company in charge of electricity supply in the province of Cartago. Jorge Mora Flores reported that day that subscriber information could have been compromised; the next day, he reported that the institution's accounting and human resources information was encrypted as part of the attack.On April 25, Conti announced that it would shift its strategy from attacking state institutions to focus on large companies in the private sector; in addition, it would stop announcing its hacks on its deep web page to focus on requesting ransoms for stolen and encrypted information.On April 26, the MICITT reported that the website of the Sede Interuniversitaria de Alajuela, a multi-university campus, was attacked; in addition, there was an attempt to breach the servers of the Rural Development Institute, which was effectively repelled. On April 29, the government reported a hacking attempt to the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Commerce and a day later against the National Liquor Factory and the municipalities of Turrialba and Golfito.On May 2, another hacking attempt was reported at the Ministry of Justice and Peace (MJP), although it was rebuffed. The next day, unsuccessful cyberattacks were reported on the municipalities of Garabito and Alajuelita, as well as on the San Jos\u00e9 Social Protection Board, a national charitable organization that administers the country's national lottery.On May 4, MICITT reported hacking attempts to the National Education Loan Commission and one more to the Cartago University College (CUC), although the latter was not Conti's responsibility.\nNearly two months after the original attack, on June 11, the Ministry of Finance announced that the ATV tax system would be restarted on June 13 so that Costa Ricans could make their payments. On June 24, two other systems disabled by Conti attacks were restored: TICA (Spanish: Tecnolog\u00eda de Informaci\u00f3n para el Control Aduanero, Customs Control Information Technology) and Exonet, a platform used to manage and process tax exemption requests.\n\n\n*** Hive Ransomware Group attack ***\nOn May 31 at two in the morning (UTC-6:00), the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (CCSS) detected anomalous information flows in its systems and began to receive reports from different hospitals of unusual behavior in various computers; it immediately proceeded to turn off all its critical systems, including the Single Digital Health File (Expediente Digital \u00danico en Salud, EDUS) and the Centralized Collection System. Some printers in the institution printed messages with random codes or characters, while others printed default instructions from the Hive Ransomware Group on how to regain access to systems.In a press conference before noon, CCSS officials described the attack as \"exceptionally violent\" and detailed that the first incidents were recorded at the San Vicente de Paul Hospital, in the province of Heredia and then in the Hospital of Liberia, province of Guanacaste; from there, attacks were carried out on the hospitals of the Greater Metropolitan Area. The president of the CCSS, \u00c1lvaro Ramos Chaves, affirmed that databases with sensitive information were not compromised but noted that at least thirty servers (of the more than 1,500 that the institution has) were contaminated with ransomware. He added that they had a plan to restore the systems, but that it would take time because each piece of equipment had to be reviewed to ensure hackers no longer had access.As a consequence, a number of insured persons saw their medical appointments cancelled. The CCSS medical centers had to resort to running on paper, as the digital backup system, the Digital File in a Contingency Environment (Expediente Digital en Ambiente de Contingencia, EDAC), was also taken down as a security measure, a situation that could remain that way for an indefinite period. Medical facilities were left without access to the EDUS, EDAC, and such systems including the hospital occupancy control system (ARCA) and billing. Financial areas of the CCSS were unable to use systems including the Centralized Collection System (SICERE), the Disability Control and Payment Registry (RCPI), and the Integrated Voucher System (SICO). Offices and administrative areas were unable to use computers; teleworkers could only access Office 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams).In total, on the first day of effects from the cyberattack, 4,871 users missed their medical appointments, with another 12,000 missing appointments the next day. The CCSS reported that the laboratory service was the most affected, with only 45 percent operating normally and 48 percent partially affected. A review of 108 health establishments showed that 96% of hospital services operated with a contingency plan, 18% of outpatient consultations were partially affected, 19% of radiology and medical imaging services were partially affected, and 37% of pharmacy services were affected.On June 1, during a press conference at the Presidential Palace, the executive president of the CCSS, \u00c1lvaro Ramos Chaves, announced the opening of an administrative investigation against the agency's Information Technology Department for the hack, to determine if there was negligence. President Chaves Robles noted that fewer than 15 CCSS computers had the microCLAUDIA system donated by Spain installed after the Conti attacks. Ramos Chaves also revealed that the effects of the attack were 27 times greater than what was reported on the first day: more than 800 servers and 9,000 end-user computers were affected, making it impossible to restore all systems within a week as initially planned.On June 2, the Hive Ransomware Group requested $5 million in bitcoin so that the CCSS could get its services back.On June 4, the Superintendency of Pensions (SUPEN) announced the suspension until further notice of the possibility of freely transferring complementary pension funds between the different operators, since this required one of the CCSS systems that was affected by the hack.Given the fall of its systems for reporting payroll and payment of social contributions, the CCSS had to extend until June 10 the deadline for employers to submit the payroll corresponding to the month of May. Likewise, it announced that self-employed and voluntary insured workers would not be able to pay their monthly installments due to the impossibility of making the corresponding invoice. The pension scheme for Disability, Old Age and Death (IVM) had to enable bank accounts and specific email accounts so that people with mortgage loans could pay their monthly payments and report the installments. Likewise, 163 health establishments of the CCSS set up telephone lines for the population to answer questions regarding the continuity of services and the status of their medical appointments.\n\n== Declaration of emergency ==\nOn April 22, the then president-elect of Costa Rica, Rodrigo Chaves Robles, announced his intention to declare a national state of emergency once he assumed power due to the cyberattacks against the country's public sector.On May 3, the Costa Rican Chamber of Industries (CICR), the National Chamber of Freight Carriers (CANATRAC), the Costa Rican Chamber of Foreign Trade (CRECEX), the Chamber of Fiscal and General Deposit Warehouses (CAMALFI), the Costa Rican Chamber of Shippers (NAVE), the Chamber of Exporters of Costa Rica (CADEXCO) and the Association of Customs Agents (AAACR) requested to declare a state of emergency due to the situation of the country's customs as a result of the Conti hack; they warned that within a few days, if the situation did not improve, Costa Rica could face a paralysis of international trade due to the accumulation of cargo containers, since Customs had to carry out procedures on paper, raising the wait to three or even four days to receive approval to move the containers.On May 8, upon assuming power, Chaves Robles signed Executive Decree No. 43542-MP-MICITT, declaring a state of national emergency due to cyberattacks against the public sector in Costa Rica and ordered the Presidency of the Republic to take control of the coordination of the national response, in lieu of the National Emergency Commission, which by law manages situations of declared national emergency.On May 16, President Chaves affirmed that the country was in a state of war due to Conti's hacks and denounced that there were nationals helping the \"terrorist group\" that the previous weekend had threatened to overthrow the newly elected government.\nWe don't know, we don't have information about who is paying us taxes correctly and incorrectly. There is a huge impact on the international trade process since the Customs TICA system is not working. We don't know how the country's budget execution is progressing: Costa Rica doesn't know how much of the budget each person is spending, whether we are going to pay ourselves or not. We are paying salaries almost blindly based on previous payrolls, which represents a huge challenge for the future. What happens if someone surpasses you due to an extraordinary staff and we are repeating the same payroll? There are people who are being paid less by the State than they should be for using old forms. This represents a huge risk because the systems are not flexible to recover excess payments. We have 27 institutions attacked and 9 institutions very affected, including the Ministry of Finance, which is the one that receives the income and makes the expenses of the State. They want to drown us through the financial system of the State's public finances.\nThe next day, dozens of workers from the Ministry of Public Education (MEP) took to the streets to protest the non-payment of their salaries\u2014 payments less than what was due, among other problems related to the impossibility of updating the state payroll due to the hack. The MEP estimated that 16,000 workers were affected, of whom 3,000 did not receive any payments at all. The Ministry of Finance, as a contingency measure, provided a tool that had to be filled out by hand to update employee payments.On May 21, due to new protests, the unions negotiated with the government, which promised to pay the amounts owed and subsequently recover any sums overpaid to the workers. On May 27, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice upheld more than 200 recursos de amparo filed against the state by MEP workers affected in the payment of their salaries and ordered contingency measures to reconcile payments within a month. On May 30, the government announced that the MEP and the Finance Ministry had paid more than 6 billion colones as an extraordinary payroll corresponding to 25,618 movements pending cancellation due to the hack.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question.

      "context": "2022 Costa Rican ransomware attack\n\n==Introduction==\nBeginning on the night (UTC-6:00) of April 17, 2022, a ransomware attack began against nearly 30 institutions of the government of Costa Rica, including its Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications (MICITT), the National Meteorological Institute, state internet service provider RACSA, the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social, CCSS), the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, the Fund for Social Development and Family Allowances, and the Administrative Board of the Municipal Electricity Service of Cartago.The pro-Russian Conti Group claimed the first group of attacks and demanded a US$10 million ransom in exchange for not releasing the information stolen from the Ministry of Finance, which could include sensitive information such as citizens' tax returns and companies operating in Costa Rica.As a consequence, the government had to shut down the computer systems used to declare taxes and for the control and management of imports and exports, causing losses to the productive sector on the order of US$30 million per day. Likewise, the web pages of the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications were removed from the network.\nCosta Rica required technical assistance from the United States, Israel, Spain, and Microsoft, among others, to deal with the cyber attack. The attack consisted of infections of computer systems with ransomware, defacement of web pages, theft of email files and attacks on the Social Security human resources portal, as well as on its official Twitter account.On May 6, 2022, the United States government through the FBI offered a US$10 million reward for information leading to the identification of a person or persons in a leadership position within the Conti Group, and an additional US$5 million for information leading to the capture or conviction, in any country, of individuals who aided or conspired to carry out Conti ransomware attacks.On May 8, 2022, the new president of Costa Rica, Rodrigo Chaves Robles, decreed a state of national emergency due to cyber attacks, considering them an act of terrorism. Days later, at a press conference, he stated that the country was in a state of war and that there was evidence that people inside Costa Rica were helping Conti, calling them \"traitors\" and \"filibusters\".On May 31, 2022, at dawn, the Hive Ransomware Group carried out an attack against the Costa Rican Social Security Fund, forcing the institution to turn off all its critical systems, including the Unique Digital Health File and the Centralized Collection System. The former stores sensitive medical information of patients using Social Security, while the latter is used to collect the population's insurance fees.\n\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n*** Conti Group ***\n\nConti Group is a criminal organization dedicated to carrying out ransomware attacks, stealing files and documents from servers and then demanding a ransom. Its modus operandi is to infect computers with the Conti malware, which operates with up to 32 individual logical threads, making it much faster than most viruses of its kind.The oldest member is known by the aliases Stern or Demon and acts as CEO. Another member known as Mango acts as the general manager and communicates frequently with Stern. Mango told Stern in a message that there were 62 people on the core team. The numbers of people involved fluctuate, reaching up to 100. Due to the constant turnover of members, the group recruits new members through legitimate job recruitment sites and hacker sites.Ordinary programmers earn $1,500 to $2,000 per month, and members who negotiate ransom payments can take a cut of the profits. In April 2021, a member of the Conti Group claimed to have an anonymous journalist take a 5% cut of ransomware payments by pressuring victims to pay.During the Russian invasion of Ukraine of 2022, the Conti Group announced its support for Russia and threatened to implement \"retaliatory measures\" if cyber-attacks were launched against the country. As a result, an anonymous person leaked approximately 60,000 internal chat log messages along with source code and other files used by the group.Opinions expressed in the leaks include support for Vladimir Putin, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and antisemitism (including towards Volodymyr Zelensky). A member known as Patrick repeated several false claims made by Putin about Ukraine. Patrick lives in Australia and may be a Russian citizen. Messages containing homophobia, misogyny and references to child abuse were also found.Conti has been responsible for hundreds of ransomware incidents since 2020. The FBI estimates that, as of January 2022, there were more than 1,000 victims of attacks associated with Conti ransomware with victim payouts exceeding $150 million, making Conti's the most damaging ransomware strain ever documented.Days after the FBI's announcement, Conti announced that they would begin a shutdown process. Some of the Conti members migrated to smaller organizations like Hive, HelloKitty, AvosLocker, BlackCat, and BlackByteo; others founded groups of their own.\n\n\n*** Hive Ransomware Group ***\nHive Ransomware Group is a criminal organization known for attacking public health organizations and institutions, particularly hospitals and clinics. It first appeared in June 2021, and according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), it works as affiliate-based ransomware. It employs a wide variety of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), creating significant challenges for defense and mitigation. Hive uses multiple mechanisms to compromise business networks, including phishing emails with malicious attachments to gain access and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to move once on the network.According to a Cisco report, Hive criminals have evidenced low operational security by revealing information about their encryption process and other operational details. The report also indicates that Hive employs any and all means necessary to convince its victims to pay, including offering bribes to victims' negotiators once the ransom payment is made.In August 2021, ZDNet reported that Hive had attacked at least 28 healthcare organizations in the United States, hitting clinics and hospitals across Ohio and West Virginia.

She also announced that they were receiving technical assistance from the governments of the United States, Israel and Spain, as well as from Microsoft, which operated the servers of the Ministry of Finance.Early on April 21, Conti Group attacked the servers of the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, as well as the Social Development and Family Allowances Fund. The preliminary report of the government indicated that information such as emails and data on pension payments and social aid from both institutions was stolen. Likewise, the group offered a 35% discount on the amount of the ransom demanded if the Government of Costa Rica made a prompt payment. Before noon, the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications held a press conference where the Government reiterated its position of not paying the ransom demanded by the Conti Group, for which hours later the criminal group announced that it would immediately begin publishing the stolen information, urging Costa Rican cybercriminals to take advantage of it to commit phishing.\n\nPresident Carlos Alvarado Quesada gave his first public statement on the hack that day.\nI reiterate that the Costa Rican State WILL NOT PAY ANYTHING to these cybercriminals. But my opinion is that this attack is not a matter of money, but rather seeks to threaten the stability of the country, in a situation of transition. This they will not do. As we have always done, each person on this earth will do their part to defend Costa Rica.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Government issued a directive addressed to the public sector in order to protect the proper functioning, confidentiality and cybersecurity of public institutions. The document provides that, in the event of any situation that affects the confidentiality, availability and integrity of services available to the public, the continuity of institutional functions, or the identity theft of the institution on social networks\u2014even those that within the institution are considered to be under control\u2014the Computer Security Incident Response Center (CSIRT-CR) must be informed of the event. In addition, agencies are required to back up information regarding the incident for use in investigations. Likewise, institutions must carry out maintenance of their telecommunications infrastructure\u2014whether through public employees or private contractors\u2014including regular updates of institutional systems, changing passwords of all institutional systems and networks, disabling unnecessary services and ports, and monitoring network infrastructure, as well as taking heed of alerts from the CSIRT-CR. The guideline also orders a vulnerability scan to be carried out at least twice a year on the official websites of the government of Costa Rica.On the morning of April 22, the government reported that no new Conti Group attacks against the country had been recorded since the previous day. However, the director of Digital Governance, Jorge Mora, explained that since Monday, when they began to take preventive measures in state institutions, they have detected 35,000 malware communication requests, 9,900 phishing incidents, 60,000 attempts to take remote control of IT systems, and 60,000 attempts to mine cryptocurrencies using the computer infrastructure of the first 100 state institutions intervened.On April 23, the Conti Group attacked the Administrative Board of the Municipal Electrical Service of Cartago, the public company in charge of electricity supply in the province of Cartago. Jorge Mora Flores reported that day that subscriber information could have been compromised; the next day, he reported that the institution's accounting and human resources information was encrypted as part of the attack.On April 25, Conti announced that it would shift its strategy from attacking state institutions to focus on large companies in the private sector; in addition, it would stop announcing its hacks on its deep web page to focus on requesting ransoms for stolen and encrypted information.On April 26, the MICITT reported that the website of the Sede Interuniversitaria de Alajuela, a multi-university campus, was attacked; in addition, there was an attempt to breach the servers of the Rural Development Institute, which was effectively repelled. On April 29, the government reported a hacking attempt to the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Commerce and a day later against the National Liquor Factory and the municipalities of Turrialba and Golfito.On May 2, another hacking attempt was reported at the Ministry of Justice and Peace (MJP), although it was rebuffed. The next day, unsuccessful cyberattacks were reported on the municipalities of Garabito and Alajuelita, as well as on the San Jos\u00e9 Social Protection Board, a national charitable organization that administers the country's national lottery.On May 4, MICITT reported hacking attempts to the National Education Loan Commission and one more to the Cartago University College (CUC), although the latter was not Conti's responsibility.\nNearly two months after the original attack, on June 11, the Ministry of Finance announced that the ATV tax system would be restarted on June 13 so that Costa Ricans could make their payments. On June 24, two other systems disabled by Conti attacks were restored: TICA (Spanish: Tecnolog\u00eda de Informaci\u00f3n para el Control Aduanero, Customs Control Information Technology) and Exonet, a platform used to manage and process tax exemption requests.\n\n\n*** Hive Ransomware Group attack ***\nOn May 31 at two in the morning (UTC-6:00), the Costa Rican Social Security Fund (CCSS) detected anomalous information flows in its systems and began to receive reports from different hospitals of unusual behavior in various computers; it immediately proceeded to turn off all its critical systems, including the Single Digital Health File (Expediente Digital \u00danico en Salud, EDUS) and the Centralized Collection System. Some printers in the institution printed messages with random codes or characters, while others printed default instructions from the Hive Ransomware Group on how to regain access to systems.In a press conference before noon, CCSS officials described the attack as \"exceptionally violent\" and detailed that the first incidents were recorded at the San Vicente de Paul Hospital, in the province of Heredia and then in the Hospital of Liberia, province of Guanacaste; from there, attacks were carried out on the hospitals of the Greater Metropolitan Area. The president of the CCSS, \u00c1lvaro Ramos Chaves, affirmed that databases with sensitive information were not compromised but noted that at least thirty servers (of the more than 1,500 that the institution has) were contaminated with ransomware. He added that they had a plan to restore the systems, but that it would take time because each piece of equipment had to be reviewed to ensure hackers no longer had access.As a consequence, a number of insured persons saw their medical appointments cancelled. The CCSS medical centers had to resort to running on paper, as the digital backup system, the Digital File in a Contingency Environment (Expediente Digital en Ambiente de Contingencia, EDAC), was also taken down as a security measure, a situation that could remain that way for an indefinite period. Medical facilities were left without access to the EDUS, EDAC, and such systems including the hospital occupancy control system (ARCA) and billing. Financial areas of the CCSS were unable to use systems including the Centralized Collection System (SICERE), the Disability Control and Payment Registry (RCPI), and the Integrated Voucher System (SICO). Offices and administrative areas were unable to use computers; teleworkers could only access Office 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams).In total, on the first day of effects from the cyberattack, 4,871 users missed their medical appointments, with another 12,000 missing appointments the next day. The CCSS reported that the laboratory service was the most affected, with only 45 percent operating normally and 48 percent partially affected. A review of 108 health establishments showed that 96% of hospital services operated with a contingency plan, 18% of outpatient consultations were partially affected, 19% of radiology and medical imaging services were partially affected, and 37% of pharmacy services were affected.On June 1, during a press conference at the Presidential Palace, the executive president of the CCSS, \u00c1lvaro Ramos Chaves, announced the opening of an administrative investigation against the agency's Information Technology Department for the hack, to determine if there was negligence. President Chaves Robles noted that fewer than 15 CCSS computers had the microCLAUDIA system donated by Spain installed after the Conti attacks. Ramos Chaves also revealed that the effects of the attack were 27 times greater than what was reported on the first day: more than 800 servers and 9,000 end-user computers were affected, making it impossible to restore all systems within a week as initially planned.On June 2, the Hive Ransomware Group requested $5 million in bitcoin so that the CCSS could get its services back.On June 4, the Superintendency of Pensions (SUPEN) announced the suspension until further notice of the possibility of freely transferring complementary pension funds between the different operators, since this required one of the CCSS systems that was affected by the hack.Given the fall of its systems for reporting payroll and payment of social contributions, the CCSS had to extend until June 10 the deadline for employers to submit the payroll corresponding to the month of May. Likewise, it announced that self-employed and voluntary insured workers would not be able to pay their monthly installments due to the impossibility of making the corresponding invoice. The pension scheme for Disability, Old Age and Death (IVM) had to enable bank accounts and specific email accounts so that people with mortgage loans could pay their monthly payments and report the installments. Likewise, 163 health establishments of the CCSS set up telephone lines for the population to answer questions regarding the continuity of services and the status of their medical appointments.\n\n== Declaration of emergency ==\nOn April 22, the then president-elect of Costa Rica, Rodrigo Chaves Robles, announced his intention to declare a national state of emergency once he assumed power due to the cyberattacks against the country's public sector.On May 3, the Costa Rican Chamber of Industries (CICR), the National Chamber of Freight Carriers (CANATRAC), the Costa Rican Chamber of Foreign Trade (CRECEX), the Chamber of Fiscal and General Deposit Warehouses (CAMALFI), the Costa Rican Chamber of Shippers (NAVE), the Chamber of Exporters of Costa Rica (CADEXCO) and the Association of Customs Agents (AAACR) requested to declare a state of emergency due to the situation of the country's customs as a result of the Conti hack; they warned that within a few days, if the situation did not improve, Costa Rica could face a paralysis of international trade due to the accumulation of cargo containers, since Customs had to carry out procedures on paper, raising the wait to three or even four days to receive approval to move the containers.On May 8, upon assuming power, Chaves Robles signed Executive Decree No. 43542-MP-MICITT, declaring a state of national emergency due to cyberattacks against the public sector in Costa Rica and ordered the Presidency of the Republic to take control of the coordination of the national response, in lieu of the National Emergency Commission, which by law manages situations of declared national emergency.On May 16, President Chaves affirmed that the country was in a state of war due to Conti's hacks and denounced that there were nationals helping the \"terrorist group\" that the previous weekend had threatened to overthrow the newly elected government.\nWe don't know, we don't have information about who is paying us taxes correctly and incorrectly. There is a huge impact on the international trade process since the Customs TICA system is not working. We don't know how the country's budget execution is progressing: Costa Rica doesn't know how much of the budget each person is spending, whether we are going to pay ourselves or not. We are paying salaries almost blindly based on previous payrolls, which represents a huge challenge for the future. What happens if someone surpasses you due to an extraordinary staff and we are repeating the same payroll? There are people who are being paid less by the State than they should be for using old forms. This represents a huge risk because the systems are not flexible to recover excess payments. We have 27 institutions attacked and 9 institutions very affected, including the Ministry of Finance, which is the one that receives the income and makes the expenses of the State. They want to drown us through the financial system of the State's public finances.\nThe next day, dozens of workers from the Ministry of Public Education (MEP) took to the streets to protest the non-payment of their salaries\u2014 payments less than what was due, among other problems related to the impossibility of updating the state payroll due to the hack. The MEP estimated that 16,000 workers were affected, of whom 3,000 did not receive any payments at all. The Ministry of Finance, as a contingency measure, provided a tool that had to be filled out by hand to update employee payments.On May 21, due to new protests, the unions negotiated with the government, which promised to pay the amounts owed and subsequently recover any sums overpaid to the workers. On May 27, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice upheld more than 200 recursos de amparo filed against the state by MEP workers affected in the payment of their salaries and ordered contingency measures to reconcile payments within a month. On May 30, the government announced that the MEP and the Finance Ministry had paid more than 6 billion colones as an extraordinary payroll corresponding to 25,618 movements pending cancellation due to the hack."

    "instruction": "Idle scan\n\n==Introduction==\nAn idle scan is a TCP port scan method for determining what services are open on a target computer without leaving traces pointing back at oneself. This is accomplished by using packet spoofing to impersonate another computer (called a \"zombie\") so that the target believes it's being accessed by the zombie. The target will respond in different ways depending on whether the port is open, which can in turn be detected by querying the zombie.\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThis action can be done through common software network utilities such as nmap and hping. The attack involves sending forged packets to a specific machine target in an effort to find distinct characteristics of another zombie machine. The attack is sophisticated because there is no interaction between the attacker computer and the target: the attacker interacts only with the \"zombie\" computer.\nThis exploit functions with two purposes, as a port scanner and a mapper of trusted IP relationships between machines. The target system interacts with the \"zombie\" computer and difference in behavior can be observed using different \"zombies\" with evidence of different privileges granted by the target to different computers.The overall intention behind the idle scan is to \"check the port status while remaining completely invisible to the targeted host.\"\n\n\n*** Origins ***\nDiscovered by Salvatore Sanfilippo (also known by his handle \"Antirez\") in 1998, the idle scan has been used by many black hat \"hackers\" to covertly identify open ports on a target computer in preparation for attacking it. Although it was originally named dumb scan, the term idle scan was coined in 1999, after the publication of a proof of concept 16-bit identification field (IPID) scanner named idlescan, by Filipe Almeida (aka LiquidK). This type of scan can also be referenced as zombie scan; all the nomenclatures are due to the nature of one of the computers involved in the attack.\n\n== TCP/IP basics ==\nThe design and operation of the Internet is based on the Internet Protocol Suite, commonly also called TCP/IP. IP is the primary protocol in the Internet Layer of the Internet Protocol Suite and has the task of delivering datagrams from the source host to the destination host solely based on their addresses. For this purpose, IP defines addressing methods and structures for datagram encapsulation. It is a connectionless protocol and relies on the transmission of packets. Every IP packet from a given source has an ID that uniquely identifies IP datagram.TCP provides reliable, ordered delivery of a stream of bytes from a program on one computer to another program on another computer. TCP is the protocol that major Internet applications rely on, such as the World Wide Web, e-mail, and file transfer. Each of these applications (web server, email server, FTP server) is called a network service. In this system, network services are identified using two components: a host address and a port number.  There are 65536 distinct and usable port numbers per host. Most services use a limited range of numbers by default, and the default port number for a service is almost always used.\nSome port scanners scan only the most common port numbers, or ports most commonly associated with vulnerable services, on a given host. See: List of TCP and UDP port numbers.\nThe result of a scan on a port is usually generalized into one of three categories:\n\nOpen or Accepted: The host sent a reply indicating that a service is listening on the port.\nClosed or Denied or Not Listening: The host sent a reply indicating that connections will be denied to the port.\nFiltered, Dropped or Blocked: There was no reply from the host.Open ports present two vulnerabilities of which administrators must be wary:\n\nSecurity and stability concerns associated with the program responsible for delivering the service - Open ports.\nSecurity and stability concerns associated with the operating system that is running on the host - Open or Closed ports.Filtered ports do not tend to present vulnerabilities. The host in a local network can be protected by a firewall that filters, according with rules that its administrator set up, packets. This is done to deny services to hosts not known and prevent intrusion in the inside network.\nThe IP protocol is network layer transmission protocol.\n\n== Basic mechanics ==\nIdle scans take advantage of predictable Identification field value from IP header: every IP packet from a given source has an ID that uniquely identifies fragments of an original IP datagram; the protocol implementation assigns values to this mandatory field generally by a fixed value (1) increment. Because transmitted packets are numbered in a sequence you can say how many packets are transmitted between two packets that you receive.\nAn attacker would first scan for a host with a sequential and predictable sequence number (IPID). The latest versions of Linux, Solaris, OpenBSD, and Windows Vista are not suitable as zombie, since the IPID has been implemented with patches that randomized the IPID. Computers chosen to be used in this stage are known as \"zombies\".Once a suitable zombie is found the next step would be to try to establish a TCP connection with a given service (port) of the target system, impersonating the zombie. It is done by sending a SYN packet to the target computer, spoofing the IP address from the zombie, i.e. with the source address equal to zombie IP address.\nIf the port of the target computer is open it will accept the connection for the service, responding with a SYN/ACK packet back to the zombie.\nThe zombie computer will then send a RST packet  to the target computer (to reset the connection) because it did not actually send the SYN packet in the first place.\nSince the zombie had to send the RST packet it will increment its IPID. This is how an attacker would find out if the target's port is open. The attacker will send another packet to the zombie. If the IPID is incremented only by a step then the attacker would know that the particular port is closed.\nThe method assumes that zombie has no other interactions: if there is any message sent for other reasons between the first interaction of the attacker with the zombie and the second interaction other than RST message, there will be a false positive.\n\n== Finding a zombie host ==\nThe first step in executing an idle scan is to find an appropriate zombie. It needs to assign IP ID packets incrementally on a global (rather than per-host it communicates with) basis. It should be idle (hence the scan name), as extraneous traffic will bump up its IP ID sequence, confusing the scan logic. The lower the latency between the attacker and the zombie, and between the zombie and the target, the faster the scan will proceed.\nNote that when a port is open, IPIDs increment by 2. Following is the sequence: \n1. Attacker to target -> SYN, target to zombie ->SYN/ACK, Zombie to target -> RST (IPID increment by 1)\n2. Now attacker tries to probe zombie for result. Attacker to Zombie ->SYN/ACK, Zombie to Attacker -> RST (IPID increment by 1)\nSo, in this process IPID increments by 2 finally.\nWhen an idle scan is attempted, tools (for example nmap) tests the proposed zombie and reports any problems with it. If one doesn't work, try another. Enough Internet hosts are vulnerable that zombie candidates aren't hard to find.\nA common approach is to simply execute a ping sweep of some network. Choosing a network near your source address, or near the target, produces better results. You can try an idle scan using each available host from the ping sweep results until you find one that works. As usual, it is best to ask permission before using someone's machines for unexpected purposes such as idle scanning.\nSimple network devices often make great zombies because they are commonly both underused (idle) and built with simple network stacks which are vulnerable to IP ID traffic detection.\nWhile identifying a suitable zombie takes some initial work, you can keep re-using the good ones. Alternatively, there have been some research on utilizing unintended public web services as zombie hosts to perform similar idle scans. Leveraging the way some of these services perform outbound connections upon user submissions can serve as some kind of poor's man idle scanning.\n\n== Using hping ==\nThe hping method for idle scanning provides a lower level example for how idle scanning is performed. In this example the target host (172.16.0.100) will be scanned using an idle host (172.16.0.105). An open and a closed port will be tested to see how each scenario plays out.\nFirst, establish that the idle host is actually idle, send packets using hping2\nand observe the id numbers increase incrementally by one. If the id numbers\nincrease haphazardly, the host is not actually idle or has an OS that has no predictable IP ID.\n\nSend a spoofed SYN packet to the target host on a port you expect to be open. In this case, port 22 (ssh) is being tested.\n\nSince we spoofed the packet, we did not receive a reply and hping reports 100% packet loss. The target host replied directly to the idle host with a syn/ack packet. Now, check the idle host to see if the id number has increased.\n\nNotice that the proxy hosts id increased from id\n\n== Using nmap ==\nThe first thing the user would do is to find a suitable zombie on the LAN:\nPerforming a port scan and OS identification (-O option in nmap) on the zombie candidate network rather than just a ping scan helps in selecting a good zombie. As long as verbose mode (-v) is enabled, OS detection will usually determine the IP ID sequence generation method and print a line such as \u201cIP ID Sequence Generation: Incremental\u201d. If the type is given as Incremental or Broken little-endian incremental, the machine is a good zombie candidate. That is still no guarantee that it will work, as Solaris and some other systems create a new IP ID sequence for each host they communicate with. The host could also be too busy. OS detection and the open port list can also help in identifying systems that are likely to be idle.\nAnother approach to identifying zombie candidates is the run the ipidseq NSE script against a host. This script probes a host to classify its IP ID generation method, then prints the IP ID classification much like the OS detection does. Like most NSE scripts, ipidseq.nse can be run against many hosts in parallel, making it another good choice when scanning entire networks looking for suitable hosts.\nnmap -v -O -sS 192.168.1.0/24\nThis tells nmap to do a ping sweep and show all hosts that are up in the given IP range. Once you have found a zombie, next you would send the spoofed packets:\nnmap -P0 -p <port> -sI <zombie IP> <target IP>\nThe images juxtaposition show both of these stages in a successful scenario.\n\n== Effectiveness ==\nAlthough many Operating Systems are now immune from being used in this attack, Some popular systems are still vulnerable; making the idle scan still very effective. Once a successful scan is completed there is no trace of the attacker's IP address on the target's firewall or Intrusion-detection system log. Another useful possibility is the chance of by-passing a firewall because you are scanning the target from the zombie's computer, which might have extra rights than the attacker's.\nRead the text above and answer this question: How does an idle scan determine if a port is filtered?",

      "context": "Idle scan\n\n==Introduction==\nAn idle scan is a TCP port scan method for determining what services are open on a target computer without leaving traces pointing back at oneself. This is accomplished by using packet spoofing to impersonate another computer (called a \"zombie\") so that the target believes it's being accessed by the zombie. The target will respond in different ways depending on whether the port is open, which can in turn be detected by querying the zombie.\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThis action can be done through common software network utilities such as nmap and hping. The attack involves sending forged packets to a specific machine target in an effort to find distinct characteristics of another zombie machine. The attack is sophisticated because there is no interaction between the attacker computer and the target: the attacker interacts only with the \"zombie\" computer.\nThis exploit functions with two purposes, as a port scanner and a mapper of trusted IP relationships between machines. The target system interacts with the \"zombie\" computer and difference in behavior can be observed using different \"zombies\" with evidence of different privileges granted by the target to different computers.The overall intention behind the idle scan is to \"check the port status while remaining completely invisible to the targeted host.\"\n\n\n*** Origins ***\nDiscovered by Salvatore Sanfilippo (also known by his handle \"Antirez\") in 1998, the idle scan has been used by many black hat \"hackers\" to covertly identify open ports on a target computer in preparation for attacking it. Although it was originally named dumb scan, the term idle scan was coined in 1999, after the publication of a proof of concept 16-bit identification field (IPID) scanner named idlescan, by Filipe Almeida (aka LiquidK). This type of scan can also be referenced as zombie scan; all the nomenclatures are due to the nature of one of the computers involved in the attack.\n\n== TCP/IP basics ==\nThe design and operation of the Internet is based on the Internet Protocol Suite, commonly also called TCP/IP. IP is the primary protocol in the Internet Layer of the Internet Protocol Suite and has the task of delivering datagrams from the source host to the destination host solely based on their addresses. For this purpose, IP defines addressing methods and structures for datagram encapsulation. It is a connectionless protocol and relies on the transmission of packets. Every IP packet from a given source has an ID that uniquely identifies IP datagram.TCP provides reliable, ordered delivery of a stream of bytes from a program on one computer to another program on another computer. TCP is the protocol that major Internet applications rely on, such as the World Wide Web, e-mail, and file transfer. Each of these applications (web server, email server, FTP server) is called a network service. In this system, network services are identified using two components: a host address and a port number.  There are 65536 distinct and usable port numbers per host.

    "instruction": "AOHell\n\n==Introduction==\nAOHell was a Windows application that was used to simplify 'cracking' (computer hacking) using AOL. The program contained a very early use of the term phishing. It was created by a teenager under the pseudonym Da Chronic, whose expressed motivation was anger that child abuse took place on AOL without being curtailed by AOL administrators.\n\n== Features ==\nA fake account generator which would generate a new, fully functional AOL account for the user that lasted for about a month. This generator worked by exploiting the algorithm used by credit card companies known as the Luhn algorithm to dynamically generate apparently legitimate credit card numbers. The account would not be disabled until AOL first billed it (and discovered that the credit card was invalid).  The generator could also generate fake addresses and phone numbers, resembling on their surface legitimate personal information.  One example of a fake account generator was a Macintosh One-click based piece of software called Fake Maker written by a user known as McDawgg within the AOL Macwarez community.  This software ran in parallel with the AOL program to create fake accounts based upon generated legitimate credit card account numbers.  This software ultimately released 3 versions and helped to create thousands of fake accounts before AOL weakened its ability through more expedient account verification.\nPhishing tools. The program included a \"fisher\" tool in 1995 that enabled hackers to steal passwords and credit card information through automated social engineering.  The program would barrage random AOL users with instant messages like:Hi, this is AOL Customer Service.  We're running a security check and need to verify your account.  Please enter your username and password to continue.\nA punter (IM-bomber), which would send malicious Instant Message(s) to another user that would sign them off.\nA mail bomb script which would rapidly send e-mails to a user's inbox until it was full.\nA flooding script that would flood a chat room with ASCII art of an offensive nature, such as the finger or a toilet.\nAn 'artificial intelligence bot', which did not really contain artificial intelligence, but had the ability to automatically respond to a message in a chatroom upon identification of keywords. (For example, a 'profane language' autoresponse was built into the program.)\nAn IM manager, which provided facilities to automatically respond to or block IMs from certain users.\nA Steve Case cloak, which allowed users to pose as AOL founder Steve Case in chat rooms.\n\n== Motives and legacy ==\nThe existence of AOHell and similar software even allowed AOL to develop its own warez community. Lurking in secret chat rooms with names such as 'AirZeraw', mm, cerver, 'wArEzXXX', g00dz, 'punter', 'gif', 'coldice', 'GRiP', and 'trade', AOHell created bots, often referred to as 'servers', which would send out a list of warez (illegally copied software) contained in their mailbox.

      "context": "AOHell\n\n==Introduction==\nAOHell was a Windows application that was used to simplify 'cracking' (computer hacking) using AOL. The program contained a very early use of the term phishing. It was created by a teenager under the pseudonym Da Chronic, whose expressed motivation was anger that child abuse took place on AOL without being curtailed by AOL administrators.\n\n== Features ==\nA fake account generator which would generate a new, fully functional AOL account for the user that lasted for about a month. This generator worked by exploiting the algorithm used by credit card companies known as the Luhn algorithm to dynamically generate apparently legitimate credit card numbers. The account would not be disabled until AOL first billed it (and discovered that the credit card was invalid).  The generator could also generate fake addresses and phone numbers, resembling on their surface legitimate personal information.  One example of a fake account generator was a Macintosh One-click based piece of software called Fake Maker written by a user known as McDawgg within the AOL Macwarez community.  This software ran in parallel with the AOL program to create fake accounts based upon generated legitimate credit card account numbers.  This software ultimately released 3 versions and helped to create thousands of fake accounts before AOL weakened its ability through more expedient account verification.\nPhishing tools. The program included a \"fisher\" tool in 1995 that enabled hackers to steal passwords and credit card information through automated social engineering.  The program would barrage random AOL users with instant messages like:Hi, this is AOL Customer Service.  We're running a security check and need to verify your account.  Please enter your username and password to continue.\nA punter (IM-bomber), which would send malicious Instant Message(s) to another user that would sign them off.\nA mail bomb script which would rapidly send e-mails to a user's inbox until it was full.\nA flooding script that would flood a chat room with ASCII art of an offensive nature, such as the finger or a toilet.\nAn 'artificial intelligence bot', which did not really contain artificial intelligence, but had the ability to automatically respond to a message in a chatroom upon identification of keywords. (For example, a 'profane language' autoresponse was built into the program.)\nAn IM manager, which provided facilities to automatically respond to or block IMs from certain users.\nA Steve Case cloak, which allowed users to pose as AOL founder Steve Case in chat rooms.\n\n== Motives and legacy ==\nThe existence of AOHell and similar software even allowed AOL to develop its own warez community. Lurking in secret chat rooms with names such as 'AirZeraw', mm, cerver, 'wArEzXXX', g00dz, 'punter', 'gif', 'coldice', 'GRiP', and 'trade', AOHell created bots, often referred to as 'servers', which would send out a list of warez (illegally copied software) contained in their mailbox.  Simply messaging the bot with the titles of the desired software packaging would result in those packages being forwarded to one's mailbox.

Hellman's block cipher technique can be applied to a stream cipher by using the same idea of covering the \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n   points space through matrices obtained from multiple variants \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          f\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f_{i}}\n   of the function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n   which is the mapping of internal states to output prefixes. Recall that this tradeoff attack on stream cipher is successful if any of the given \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n   output prefixes is found in any of the matrices covering \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  . This cuts the number of covered points by the matrices from \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n   to \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n        \n          /\n        \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N/D}\n   points.

    "instruction": "Context: Cisco PIX\n\n==Introduction==\nCisco PIX (Private Internet eXchange) was a popular IP firewall and network address translation (NAT) appliance. It was one of the first products in this market segment.\nIn 2005, Cisco introduced the newer Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (Cisco ASA), that inherited many of the PIX features, and in 2008 announced PIX end-of-sale.\nThe PIX technology was sold in a blade, the FireWall Services Module (FWSM), for the Cisco Catalyst 6500 switch series and the 7600 Router series, but has reached end of support status as of September 26, 2007.\n\n\n\n== PIX ==\n\n\n*** History ***\nPIX was originally conceived in early 1994 by John Mayes of Redwood City, California and designed and coded by Brantley Coile of Athens, Georgia. The PIX name is derived from its creators' aim of creating the functional equivalent of an IP PBX to solve the then-emerging registered IP address shortage. At a time when NAT was just being investigated as a viable approach, they wanted to conceal a block or blocks of IP addresses behind a single or multiple registered IP addresses, much as PBXs do for internal phone extensions. When they began, RFC 1597 and RFC 1631 were being discussed, but the now-familiar RFC 1918 had not yet been submitted.\nThe design, and testing were carried out in 1994 by John Mayes, Brantley Coile and Johnson Wu of Network Translation, Inc., with Brantley Coile being the sole software developer. Beta testing of PIX serial number 000000 was completed and first customer acceptance was on December 21, 1994 at KLA Instruments in San Jose, California. The PIX quickly became one of the leading enterprise firewall products and was awarded the Data Communications Magazine \"Hot Product of the Year\" award in January 1995.Shortly before Cisco acquired Network Translation in November 1995, Mayes and Coile hired two longtime associates, Richard (Chip) Howes and Pete Tenereillo, and shortly after acquisition 2 more longtime associates, Jim Jordan and Tom Bohannon. Together they continued development on Finesse OS and the original version of the Cisco PIX Firewall, now known as the PIX \"Classic\". During this time, the PIX shared most of its code with another Cisco product, the LocalDirector.\nOn January 28, 2008, Cisco announced the end-of-sale and end-of-life dates for all Cisco PIX Security Appliances, software, accessories, and licenses. The last day for purchasing Cisco PIX Security Appliance platforms and bundles was July 28, 2008. The last day to purchase accessories and licenses was January 27, 2009. Cisco ended support for Cisco PIX Security Appliance customers on July 29, 2013.In May 2005, Cisco introduced the ASA which combines functionality from the PIX, VPN 3000 series and IPS product lines. The ASA series of devices run PIX code 7.0 and later. Through PIX OS release 7.x the PIX and the ASA use the same software images. Beginning with PIX OS version 8.x, the operating system code diverges, with the ASA using a Linux kernel and PIX continuing to use the traditional Finesse/PIX OS combination.\n\n\n*** Software ***\nThe PIX runs a custom-written proprietary operating system originally called Finese (Fast Internet Service Executive), but as of 2014 the software is known simply as PIX OS. Though classified as a network-layer firewall with stateful inspection, technically the PIX would more precisely be called a Layer 4, or Transport Layer Firewall, as its access is not restricted to Network Layer routing, but socket-based connections (a port and an IP Address: port communications occur at Layer 4). By default it allows internal connections out (outbound traffic), and only allows inbound traffic that is a response to a valid request or is allowed by an Access Control List (ACL) or by a conduit. Administrators can configure the PIX to perform many functions including network address translation (NAT) and port address translation (PAT), as well as serving as a virtual private network (VPN) endpoint appliance.\nThe PIX became the first commercially available firewall product to introduce protocol specific filtering with the introduction of the \"fixup\" command. The PIX \"fixup\" capability allows the firewall to apply additional security policies to connections identified as using specific protocols. Protocols for which specific fixup behaviors were developed include DNS and SMTP. The DNS fixup originally implemented a very simple but effective security policy; it allowed just one DNS response from a DNS server on the Internet (known as outside interface) for each DNS request from a client on the protected (known as inside) interface. \"Inspect\" has superseded \"fixup\" in later versions of PIX OS.\nThe Cisco PIX was also one of the first commercially available security appliances to incorporate IPSec VPN gateway functionality.\nAdministrators can manage the PIX via a command line interface (CLI) or via a graphical user interface (GUI). They can access the CLI from the serial console, telnet and SSH. GUI administration originated with version 4.1, and it has been through several incarnations:\nPIX Firewall Manager (PFM) for PIX OS versions 4.x and 5.x, which runs locally on a Windows NT client\nPIX Device Manager (PDM) for PIX OS version 6.x, which runs over https and requires Java\nAdaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) for PIX OS version 7 and greater, which can run locally on a client or in reduced-functionality mode over HTTPS.Because Cisco acquired the PIX from Network Translation, the CLI originally did not align with the Cisco IOS syntax. Starting with version 7.0, the configuration became much more IOS-like.\n\n\n*** Hardware ***\n\nThe original NTI PIX and the PIX Classic had cases that were sourced from OEM provider Appro. All flash cards and the early encryption acceleration cards, the PIX-PL and PIX-PL2, were sourced from Productivity Enhancement Products (PEP). Later models had cases from Cisco OEM manufacturers.\nThe PIX was constructed using Intel-based/Intel-compatible motherboards; the PIX 501 used an Am5x86 processor, and all other standalone models used Intel 80486 through Pentium III processors.\nThe PIX boots off a proprietary ISA flash memory daughtercard in the case of the NTI PIX, PIX Classic, 10000, 510, 520, and 535, and it boots off integrated flash memory in the case of the PIX 501, 506/506e, 515/515e, 525, and WS-SVC-FWM-1-K9. The latter is the part code for the PIX technology implemented in the Fire Wall Services Module, for the Catalyst 6500 and the 7600 Router.\n\n== Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) ==\nThe Adaptive Security Appliance is a network firewall made by Cisco. It was introduced in 2005 to replace the Cisco PIX line. Along with stateful firewall functionality another focus of the ASA is Virtual Private Network (VPN) functionality. It also features Intrusion Prevention and Voice over IP. The ASA 5500 series was followed up by the 5500-X series. The 5500-X series focuses more on virtualization than it does on hardware acceleration security modules.\n\n\n*** History ***\nIn 2005 Cisco released the 5510, 5520, and 5540 models.\n\n\n*** Software ***\nThe ASA continues using the PIX codebase but, when the ASA OS software transitioned from major version 7.X to 8.X, it moved from the Finesse/Pix OS operating system platform to the Linux operating system platform. It also integrates features of the Cisco IPS 4200 Intrusion prevention system, and the Cisco VPN 3000 Concentrator.\n\n\n*** Hardware ***\nThe ASA continues the PIX lineage of Intel 80x86 hardware.\n\n== Security vulnerabilities ==\nThe Cisco PIX VPN product was hacked by the NSA-tied group Equation Group somewhere before 2016. Equation Group developed a tool code-named BENIGNCERTAIN that reveals the pre-shared password(s) to the attacker (CVE-2016-6415). Equation Group was later hacked by another group called The Shadow Brokers, which published their exploit publicly, among others. According to Ars Technica, the NSA likely used this vulnerability to wiretap VPN-connections for more than a decade, citing the Snowden leaks.The Cisco ASA-brand was also hacked by Equation Group. The vulnerability requires that both SSH and SNMP are accessible to the attacker. The codename given to this exploit by NSA was EXTRABACON. The bug and exploit (CVE-2016-6366) was also leaked by The ShadowBrokers, in the same batch of exploits and backdoors. According to Ars Technica, the exploit can easily be made to work against more modern versions of Cisco ASA than what the leaked exploit can handle.On the 29th of January 2018 a security problem at the Cisco ASA-brand was disclosed by Cedric Halbronn from the NCC Group. A use after free-bug in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN functionality of the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code. The bug is listed as CVE-2018-0101.\nAnswer this question: When did Cisco announce the end-of-sale and end-of-life dates for all Cisco PIX Security Appliances?",

The last day for purchasing Cisco PIX Security Appliance platforms and bundles was July 28, 2008. The last day to purchase accessories and licenses was January 27, 2009. Cisco ended support for Cisco PIX Security Appliance customers on July 29, 2013.In May 2005, Cisco introduced the ASA which combines functionality from the PIX, VPN 3000 series and IPS product lines. The ASA series of devices run PIX code 7.0 and later. Through PIX OS release 7.x the PIX and the ASA use the same software images. Beginning with PIX OS version 8.x, the operating system code diverges, with the ASA using a Linux kernel and PIX continuing to use the traditional Finesse/PIX OS combination.\n\n\n*** Software ***\nThe PIX runs a custom-written proprietary operating system originally called Finese (Fast Internet Service Executive), but as of 2014 the software is known simply as PIX OS. Though classified as a network-layer firewall with stateful inspection, technically the PIX would more precisely be called a Layer 4, or Transport Layer Firewall, as its access is not restricted to Network Layer routing, but socket-based connections (a port and an IP Address: port communications occur at Layer 4). By default it allows internal connections out (outbound traffic), and only allows inbound traffic that is a response to a valid request or is allowed by an Access Control List (ACL) or by a conduit. Administrators can configure the PIX to perform many functions including network address translation (NAT) and port address translation (PAT), as well as serving as a virtual private network (VPN) endpoint appliance.\nThe PIX became the first commercially available firewall product to introduce protocol specific filtering with the introduction of the \"fixup\" command. The PIX \"fixup\" capability allows the firewall to apply additional security policies to connections identified as using specific protocols. Protocols for which specific fixup behaviors were developed include DNS and SMTP. The DNS fixup originally implemented a very simple but effective security policy; it allowed just one DNS response from a DNS server on the Internet (known as outside interface) for each DNS request from a client on the protected (known as inside) interface. \"Inspect\" has superseded \"fixup\" in later versions of PIX OS.\nThe Cisco PIX was also one of the first commercially available security appliances to incorporate IPSec VPN gateway functionality.\nAdministrators can manage the PIX via a command line interface (CLI) or via a graphical user interface (GUI). They can access the CLI from the serial console, telnet and SSH. GUI administration originated with version 4.1, and it has been through several incarnations:\nPIX Firewall Manager (PFM) for PIX OS versions 4.x and 5.x, which runs locally on a Windows NT client\nPIX Device Manager (PDM) for PIX OS version 6.x, which runs over https and requires Java\nAdaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) for PIX OS version 7 and greater, which can run locally on a client or in reduced-functionality mode over HTTPS.Because Cisco acquired the PIX from Network Translation, the CLI originally did not align with the Cisco IOS syntax. Starting with version 7.0, the configuration became much more IOS-like.\n\n\n*** Hardware ***\n\nThe original NTI PIX and the PIX Classic had cases that were sourced from OEM provider Appro. All flash cards and the early encryption acceleration cards, the PIX-PL and PIX-PL2, were sourced from Productivity Enhancement Products (PEP). Later models had cases from Cisco OEM manufacturers.\nThe PIX was constructed using Intel-based/Intel-compatible motherboards; the PIX 501 used an Am5x86 processor, and all other standalone models used Intel 80486 through Pentium III processors.\nThe PIX boots off a proprietary ISA flash memory daughtercard in the case of the NTI PIX, PIX Classic, 10000, 510, 520, and 535, and it boots off integrated flash memory in the case of the PIX 501, 506/506e, 515/515e, 525, and WS-SVC-FWM-1-K9. The latter is the part code for the PIX technology implemented in the Fire Wall Services Module, for the Catalyst 6500 and the 7600 Router.\n\n== Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) ==\nThe Adaptive Security Appliance is a network firewall made by Cisco. It was introduced in 2005 to replace the Cisco PIX line. Along with stateful firewall functionality another focus of the ASA is Virtual Private Network (VPN) functionality. It also features Intrusion Prevention and Voice over IP. The ASA 5500 series was followed up by the 5500-X series. The 5500-X series focuses more on virtualization than it does on hardware acceleration security modules.\n\n\n*** History ***\nIn 2005 Cisco released the 5510, 5520, and 5540 models.\n\n\n*** Software ***\nThe ASA continues using the PIX codebase but, when the ASA OS software transitioned from major version 7.X to 8.X, it moved from the Finesse/Pix OS operating system platform to the Linux operating system platform. It also integrates features of the Cisco IPS 4200 Intrusion prevention system, and the Cisco VPN 3000 Concentrator.\n\n\n*** Hardware ***\nThe ASA continues the PIX lineage of Intel 80x86 hardware.\n\n== Security vulnerabilities ==\nThe Cisco PIX VPN product was hacked by the NSA-tied group Equation Group somewhere before 2016. Equation Group developed a tool code-named BENIGNCERTAIN that reveals the pre-shared password(s) to the attacker (CVE-2016-6415). Equation Group was later hacked by another group called The Shadow Brokers, which published their exploit publicly, among others. According to Ars Technica, the NSA likely used this vulnerability to wiretap VPN-connections for more than a decade, citing the Snowden leaks.The Cisco ASA-brand was also hacked by Equation Group. The vulnerability requires that both SSH and SNMP are accessible to the attacker. The codename given to this exploit by NSA was EXTRABACON. The bug and exploit (CVE-2016-6366) was also leaked by The ShadowBrokers, in the same batch of exploits and backdoors. According to Ars Technica, the exploit can easily be made to work against more modern versions of Cisco ASA than what the leaked exploit can handle.On the 29th of January 2018 a security problem at the Cisco ASA-brand was disclosed by Cedric Halbronn from the NCC Group. A use after free-bug in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN functionality of the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code. The bug is listed as CVE-2018-0101."

    "instruction": "Information technology audit\n\n==Introduction==\nAn information technology audit, or information systems audit, is an examination of the management controls within an Information technology (IT) infrastructure and business applications. The evaluation of evidence obtained determines if the information systems are safeguarding assets, maintaining data integrity, and operating effectively to achieve the organization's goals or objectives. These reviews may be performed in conjunction with a financial statement audit, internal audit, or other form of attestation engagement.\nIT audits are also known as automated data processing audits (ADP audits) and computer audits.\nThey were formerly called electronic data processing audits (EDP audits).\n\n\n\n== Purpose ==\nAn IT audit is different from a financial statement audit.  While a financial audit's purpose is to evaluate whether the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, an entity's financial position, results\nof operations, and cash flows in conformity to standard accounting practices, the purposes of an IT audit is to evaluate the system's internal control design and effectiveness.  This includes, but is not limited to, efficiency and security protocols, development processes, and IT governance or oversight.\nInstalling controls are necessary but not sufficient to provide adequate security. People responsible for security must consider if the controls are installed as intended, if they are effective, or if any breach in security has occurred and if so, what actions can be done to prevent future breaches. These inquiries must be answered by independent and unbiased observers. These observers are performing the task of information systems auditing. In an Information Systems (IS) environment, an audit is an examination of information systems, their inputs, outputs, and processing.\nAs technology continues to advance and become more prevalent in our lives and in businesses, along comes an increase of IT threats and disruptions. These impact every industry and come in different forms such as data breaches, external threats, and operational issues. These risks and need for high levels of assurance increase the need for IT audits to check businesses IT system performances and to lower the probability and impact of technology threats and disruptions.The primary functions of an IT audit are to evaluate the systems that are in place to guard an organization's information. Specifically, information technology audits are used to evaluate the organization's ability to protect its information assets and to properly dispense information to authorized parties. The IT audit aims to evaluate the following:\nWill the organization's computer systems be available for the business at all times when required? (known as availability)\nWill the information in the systems be disclosed only to authorized users? (known as security and confidentiality)\nWill the information provided by the system always be accurate, reliable, and timely? (measures the integrity)\nIn this way, the audit hopes to assess the risk to the company's valuable asset (its information) and establish methods of minimizing those risks.\nMore specifically, organizations should look into three major requirements: confidentiality, integrity, and availability to label their needs for security and trust in their IT systems.\n\nConfidentiality: The purpose is to keep private information restricted from unauthorized users.\nIntegrity: The purpose is to guarantee that information be changed in an authorized manner\nAvailability: The purpose is to ensure that only authorized users have access to specific informationThese three requirements should be emphasized in every industry and every organization with an IT environment but each requirements and controls to support them will vary.\n\n== Types of IT audits ==\nVarious authorities have created differing taxonomies to distinguish the various types of IT audits.  Goodman & Lawless state that there are three specific systematic approaches to carry out an IT audit:\nTechnological innovation process audit.  This audit constructs a risk profile for existing and new projects.  The audit will assess the length and depth of the company's experience in its chosen technologies, as well as its presence in relevant markets, the organization of each project, and the structure of the portion of the industry that deals with this project or product, organization and industry structure.\nInnovative comparison audit.  This audit is an analysis of the innovative abilities of the company being audited, in comparison to its competitors.  This requires examination of company's research and development facilities, as well as its track record in actually producing new products.\nTechnological position audit: This audit reviews the technologies that the business currently has and that it needs to add.  Technologies are characterized as being either \"base\", \"key\", \"pacing\" or \"emerging\".Others describe the spectrum of IT audits with five categories of audits:\n\nSystems and Applications: An audit to verify that systems and applications are appropriate, are efficient, and are adequately controlled to ensure valid, reliable, timely, and secure input, processing, and output at all levels of a system's activity. System and process assurance audits form a subtype, focussing on business process-centric business IT systems. Such audits have the objective to assist financial auditors.Information Processing Facilities: An audit to verify that the processing facility is controlled to ensure timely, accurate, and efficient processing of applications under normal and potentially disruptive conditions.\nSystems Development: An audit to verify that the systems under development meet the objectives of the organization, and to ensure that the systems are developed in accordance with generally accepted standards for systems development.\nManagement of IT and Enterprise Architecture: An audit to verify that IT management has developed an organizational structure and procedures to ensure a controlled and efficient environment for information processing.\nClient/Server, Telecommunications, Intranets, and Extranets: An audit to verify that telecommunications controls are in place on the client (computer receiving services), server, and on the network connecting the clients and servers.And some lump all IT audits as being one of only two type: \"general control review\" audits or \"application control review\" audits.\nA number of IT audit professionals from the Information Assurance realm consider there to be three fundamental types of controls regardless of the type of audit to be performed, especially in the IT realm.  Many frameworks and standards try to break controls into different disciplines or arenas, terming them \u201cSecurity Controls\u201c,  \u201dAccess Controls\u201c, \u201cIA Controls\u201d in an effort to define the types of controls involved.  At a more fundamental level, these controls can be shown to consist of three types of fundamental controls:  Protective/Preventative Controls, Detective Controls and Reactive/Corrective Controls.\nIn an IS, there are two types of auditors and audits: internal and external. IS auditing is usually a part of accounting internal auditing, and is frequently performed by corporate internal auditors. An external auditor reviews the findings of the internal audit as well as the inputs, processing and outputs of information systems. The external audit of information systems is  primarily conducted by certified Information System auditors, such as CISA, certified by ISACA, Information System Audit and Control Association , USA, Information System Auditor (ISA) certified by ICAI (Institute of Chartered Accountants of India), and other certified by reputed organization for IS audit.     Delete -->   (frequently a part of the overall external auditing performed by a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) firm.\n)\nIS auditing considers all the potential hazards and controls in information systems. It focuses on issues like operations, data, integrity, software applications, security, privacy, budgets and expenditures, cost control, and productivity. Guidelines are available to assist auditors in their jobs, such as those from Information Systems Audit and Control Association.\n\n== History of IT auditing ==\n\nThe concept of IT auditing was formed in the mid-1960s.  Since that time, IT auditing has gone through numerous changes, largely due to advances in technology and the incorporation of technology into business.\nCurrently, there are many IT-dependent companies that rely on information technology in order to operate their business e.g. Telecommunication or Banking company. For the other types of business, IT plays the big part of company including the applying of workflow instead of using the paper request form, using the application control instead of manual control which is more reliable or implementing the ERP application to facilitate the organization by using only 1 application. According to these, the importance of IT Audit is constantly increased. One of the most important roles of the IT audit is to audit over the critical system in order to support the financial audit or to support the specific regulations announced e.g. SOX.\n\n== Principles of an IT audit ==\nThe following principles of an audit should find a reflection:\nTimeliness:  Only when the processes and programming is continuously inspected in regard to their potential susceptibility to faults and weaknesses, but as well with regard to the continuation of the analysis of the found strengths, or by comparative functional analysis with similar applications an updated frame can be continued.\nSource openness:  It requires an explicit reference in the audit of encrypted programs, how the handling of open source has to be understood. E.g. programs, offering an open source application, but not considering the IM server as open source, have to be regarded as critical. An auditor should take an own position to the paradigm of the need of the open source nature within cryptologic applications.\nElaborateness:  Audit processes should be oriented to certain minimum standard. The recent audit processes of encrypting software often vary greatly in quality, in the scope and effectiveness and also experience in the media reception often differing perceptions. Because of the need of special knowledge on the one hand and to be able to read programming code and then on the other hand to also have knowledge of encryption procedures, many users even trust the shortest statements of formal confirmation. Individual commitment as an auditor, e.g. for quality, scale and effectiveness, is thus to be assessed reflexively for yourself and to be documented within the audit.\nThe financial context:  Further transparency is needed to clarify whether the software has been developed commercially and whether the audit was funded commercially (paid Audit). It makes a difference whether it is a private hobby / community project or whether a commercial company is behind it.\nScientific referencing of learning perspectives:  Each audit should describe the findings in detail within the context and also highlight progress and development needs constructively. An auditor is not the parent of the program, but at least he or she is in a role of a mentor, if the auditor is regarded as part of a PDCA learning circle (PDCA\n\n== Emerging issues ==\nThere are also new audits being imposed by various standard boards which are required to be performed, depending upon the audited organization, which will affect IT and ensure that IT departments are performing certain functions and controls appropriately to be considered compliant. Examples of such audits are SSAE 16, ISAE 3402, and ISO27001:2013.\n\n\n*** Web presence audits ***\nThe extension of the corporate IT presence beyond the corporate firewall (e.g. the adoption of social media by the enterprise along with the proliferation of cloud-based tools like social media management systems) has elevated the importance of incorporating web presence audits into the IT/IS audit. The purposes of these audits include ensuring the company is taking the necessary steps to:\n\nrein in use of unauthorized tools (e.g. \"shadow IT\")\nminimize damage to reputation\nmaintain regulatory compliance\nprevent information leakage\nmitigate third-party risk\nminimize governance riskThe use of departmental or user developed tools has been a controversial topic in the past.  However, with the widespread availability of data analytics tools, dashboards, and statistical packages users no longer need to stand in line waiting for IT resources to fulfill seemingly endless requests for reports. The task of IT is to work with business groups to make authorized access and reporting as straightforward as possible.  To use a simple example, users should not have to do their own data matching so that pure relational tables are linked in a meaningful way.  IT needs to make non-normalized, data warehouse type files available to users so that their analysis work is simplified.  For example, some organizations will refresh a warehouse periodically and create easy to use \"flat' tables which can be easily uploaded by a package such as Tableau and used to create dashboards.\n\n\n*** Enterprise communications audits ***\nThe rise of VOIP networks and issues like BYOD and the increasing capabilities of modern enterprise telephony systems causes increased risk of critical telephony infrastructure being misconfigured, leaving the enterprise open to the possibility of communications fraud or reduced system stability. Banks, financial institutions, and contact centers typically set up policies to be enforced across their communications systems. The task of auditing that the communications systems are in compliance with the policy falls on specialized telecom auditors. These audits ensure that the company's communication systems:\n\nadhere to stated policy\nfollow policies designed to minimize the risk of hacking or phreaking\nmaintain regulatory compliance\nprevent or minimize toll fraud\nmitigate third-party risk\nminimize governance riskEnterprise communications audits are also called voice audits, but the term is increasingly deprecated as communications infrastructure increasingly becomes data-oriented and data-dependent. The term \"telephony audit\" is also deprecated because modern communications infrastructure, especially when dealing with customers, is omni-channel, where interaction takes place across multiple channels, not just over the telephone.\nOne of the key issues that plagues enterprise communication audits is the lack of industry-defined or government-approved standards.

AI in IT audits raises many ethical issues.\nThe use of Artificial Intelligence causes unintended biases in results An issue that AI faces in completing IT audits for corporations is that unintended biases can occur as the AI filters through data. AI does not have a human element or the ability to understand different situations in which certain data is expected or not expected. AI only understands the data in which it has seen before and therefore is unable to evolve given each unique situation. This causes unintended biases and therefore unintended consequences if the AI systems are given too much trust and not carefully monitored by the human eye. As a result ethical, legal and economic issues arise.\nTechnology replacing the role of humans Big 4 firms have invested significant amounts of money in emerging technologies in the IT audit space.

Thus auditors with extensive tech backgrounds and degrees in technology are highly coveted by firms utilizing AI to perform audits.\n\n== Effect of IT Audit on Companies and Financial Audits ==\nGlobalization in combination with the growth in information technology systems has caused companies to shift to an increasingly digitized working environment. Advantages provided by these systems include a reduction in working time, the ability to test large amounts of data, reduce audit risk, and provide more flexible and complete analytical information. With an increase in time, auditors are able to implement additional audit tests, leading to a great improvement in the audit process overall. The use of computer-assisted audit techniques (CAATs) have allowed companies to examine larger samples of data and more thorough reviews of all transactions, allowing the auditor to test and better understand any issues within the data.The use of IT systems in audits has transformed the way auditors accomplish important audit functions such as the management of databases, risk assurance and controls, and even governance and compliance. In addition, IT audit systems improve the operational efficiency and aid in decision making that would otherwise be left to hand-held calculations. IT systems help to eliminate the human error in audits and while it does not fully solve the issue, IT systems have proven to be helpful in audits done by the Big 4 and small firms alike. These systems have greatly reduced the margin of error on audits and provide a better insight into the data being analyzed.\nAs a result of the increased use of IT systems in audits, authoritative bodies such as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the Information Systems Audit Control Association (ISACA) have established guidance on how to properly use IT systems to perform audits. Auditors must now adhere to the established guidelines when utilizing IT systems in audits.\n\n== Benefits of Utilizing IT systems on Financial Audits ==\nThe use of IT systems and AI techniques on financial audits is starting to show huge benefits for leading accounting firms. In a study done by one of the Big 4 accounting firms, it is expected that the use of IT Systems and AI techniques will generate an increase of $6.6 trillion dollars in revenue as a result of the increase in productivity. As a result, leading auditing firms are making enormous investments with the goal of increasing productivity and therefore revenue through the development or outsourcing of IT systems and AI techniques to assist in financial audits.\nPwC, one of the biggest auditing firms in the world, has narrowed down three different types of IT systems and AI techniques that firms can develop and implement to achieve increased revenue and productivity. The first system is by created in a way that technology systems that play a supplemental role in the human auditors decision-making. This allows the human auditor to retain autonomy over decisions and use the technology to support and enhance their ability to perform accurate work, ultimately saving the firm in productivity costs. Next, PwC states that systems with problem solving abilities are imperative to producing the most accurate results. PwC recognizes the increased margin for error due to unintended biases, and thus the need for creating systems that are able to adapt to different scenarios. This type of system requires decision making to be shared between the human auditor and the IT system to produce the maximum output by allowing the system to take over the computing work that could not be one by a human auditor alone. Finally, PwC recognizes that there are scenarios where technology needs to have the autonomy of decision making and act independently. This allows human auditors to focus on more important tasks while the technology takes care of time consuming tasks that do not require human time.The utilization of IT systems and AI techniques on financial audits extend past the goal of reaching maximized productivity and increased revenue. Firms who utilize these systems to assist in the completion of audits are able to identify pieces of data that may constitute fraud with higher efficiency and accuracy. For example, systems such as drones have been approved by all four of the big 4  to assist in obtaining more accurate inventory calculations, meanwhile voice and facial recognition is adding firms in fraud cases.\nQ: What are the benefits of utilizing IT systems on financial audits?",

      "context": "Information technology audit\n\n==Introduction==\nAn information technology audit, or information systems audit, is an examination of the management controls within an Information technology (IT) infrastructure and business applications. The evaluation of evidence obtained determines if the information systems are safeguarding assets, maintaining data integrity, and operating effectively to achieve the organization's goals or objectives. These reviews may be performed in conjunction with a financial statement audit, internal audit, or other form of attestation engagement.\nIT audits are also known as automated data processing audits (ADP audits) and computer audits.\nThey were formerly called electronic data processing audits (EDP audits).\n\n\n\n== Purpose ==\nAn IT audit is different from a financial statement audit.  While a financial audit's purpose is to evaluate whether the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, an entity's financial position, results\nof operations, and cash flows in conformity to standard accounting practices, the purposes of an IT audit is to evaluate the system's internal control design and effectiveness.  This includes, but is not limited to, efficiency and security protocols, development processes, and IT governance or oversight.\nInstalling controls are necessary but not sufficient to provide adequate security. People responsible for security must consider if the controls are installed as intended, if they are effective, or if any breach in security has occurred and if so, what actions can be done to prevent future breaches. These inquiries must be answered by independent and unbiased observers. These observers are performing the task of information systems auditing. In an Information Systems (IS) environment, an audit is an examination of information systems, their inputs, outputs, and processing.\nAs technology continues to advance and become more prevalent in our lives and in businesses, along comes an increase of IT threats and disruptions. These impact every industry and come in different forms such as data breaches, external threats, and operational issues. These risks and need for high levels of assurance increase the need for IT audits to check businesses IT system performances and to lower the probability and impact of technology threats and disruptions.The primary functions of an IT audit are to evaluate the systems that are in place to guard an organization's information. Specifically, information technology audits are used to evaluate the organization's ability to protect its information assets and to properly dispense information to authorized parties. The IT audit aims to evaluate the following:\nWill the organization's computer systems be available for the business at all times when required? (known as availability)\nWill the information in the systems be disclosed only to authorized users? (known as security and confidentiality)\nWill the information provided by the system always be accurate, reliable, and timely? (measures the integrity)\nIn this way, the audit hopes to assess the risk to the company's valuable asset (its information) and establish methods of minimizing those risks.\nMore specifically, organizations should look into three major requirements: confidentiality, integrity, and availability to label their needs for security and trust in their IT systems.\n\nConfidentiality: The purpose is to keep private information restricted from unauthorized users.\nIntegrity: The purpose is to guarantee that information be changed in an authorized manner\nAvailability: The purpose is to ensure that only authorized users have access to specific informationThese three requirements should be emphasized in every industry and every organization with an IT environment but each requirements and controls to support them will vary.\n\n== Types of IT audits ==\nVarious authorities have created differing taxonomies to distinguish the various types of IT audits.  Goodman & Lawless state that there are three specific systematic approaches to carry out an IT audit:\nTechnological innovation process audit.  This audit constructs a risk profile for existing and new projects.  The audit will assess the length and depth of the company's experience in its chosen technologies, as well as its presence in relevant markets, the organization of each project, and the structure of the portion of the industry that deals with this project or product, organization and industry structure.\nInnovative comparison audit.  This audit is an analysis of the innovative abilities of the company being audited, in comparison to its competitors.  This requires examination of company's research and development facilities, as well as its track record in actually producing new products.\nTechnological position audit: This audit reviews the technologies that the business currently has and that it needs to add.  Technologies are characterized as being either \"base\", \"key\", \"pacing\" or \"emerging\".Others describe the spectrum of IT audits with five categories of audits:\n\nSystems and Applications: An audit to verify that systems and applications are appropriate, are efficient, and are adequately controlled to ensure valid, reliable, timely, and secure input, processing, and output at all levels of a system's activity. System and process assurance audits form a subtype, focussing on business process-centric business IT systems. Such audits have the objective to assist financial auditors.Information Processing Facilities: An audit to verify that the processing facility is controlled to ensure timely, accurate, and efficient processing of applications under normal and potentially disruptive conditions.\nSystems Development: An audit to verify that the systems under development meet the objectives of the organization, and to ensure that the systems are developed in accordance with generally accepted standards for systems development.\nManagement of IT and Enterprise Architecture: An audit to verify that IT management has developed an organizational structure and procedures to ensure a controlled and efficient environment for information processing.\nClient/Server, Telecommunications, Intranets, and Extranets: An audit to verify that telecommunications controls are in place on the client (computer receiving services), server, and on the network connecting the clients and servers.And some lump all IT audits as being one of only two type: \"general control review\" audits or \"application control review\" audits.\nA number of IT audit professionals from the Information Assurance realm consider there to be three fundamental types of controls regardless of the type of audit to be performed, especially in the IT realm.  Many frameworks and standards try to break controls into different disciplines or arenas, terming them \u201cSecurity Controls\u201c,  \u201dAccess Controls\u201c, \u201cIA Controls\u201d in an effort to define the types of controls involved.  At a more fundamental level, these controls can be shown to consist of three types of fundamental controls:  Protective/Preventative Controls, Detective Controls and Reactive/Corrective Controls.\nIn an IS, there are two types of auditors and audits: internal and external. IS auditing is usually a part of accounting internal auditing, and is frequently performed by corporate internal auditors. An external auditor reviews the findings of the internal audit as well as the inputs, processing and outputs of information systems. The external audit of information systems is  primarily conducted by certified Information System auditors, such as CISA, certified by ISACA, Information System Audit and Control Association , USA, Information System Auditor (ISA) certified by ICAI (Institute of Chartered Accountants of India), and other certified by reputed organization for IS audit.     Delete -->   (frequently a part of the overall external auditing performed by a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) firm.\n)\nIS auditing considers all the potential hazards and controls in information systems. It focuses on issues like operations, data, integrity, software applications, security, privacy, budgets and expenditures, cost control, and productivity. Guidelines are available to assist auditors in their jobs, such as those from Information Systems Audit and Control Association.\n\n== History of IT auditing ==\n\nThe concept of IT auditing was formed in the mid-1960s.  Since that time, IT auditing has gone through numerous changes, largely due to advances in technology and the incorporation of technology into business.\nCurrently, there are many IT-dependent companies that rely on information technology in order to operate their business e.g. Telecommunication or Banking company. For the other types of business, IT plays the big part of company including the applying of workflow instead of using the paper request form, using the application control instead of manual control which is more reliable or implementing the ERP application to facilitate the organization by using only 1 application. According to these, the importance of IT Audit is constantly increased. One of the most important roles of the IT audit is to audit over the critical system in order to support the financial audit or to support the specific regulations announced e.g. SOX.\n\n== Principles of an IT audit ==\nThe following principles of an audit should find a reflection:\nTimeliness:  Only when the processes and programming is continuously inspected in regard to their potential susceptibility to faults and weaknesses, but as well with regard to the continuation of the analysis of the found strengths, or by comparative functional analysis with similar applications an updated frame can be continued.\nSource openness:  It requires an explicit reference in the audit of encrypted programs, how the handling of open source has to be understood. E.g. programs, offering an open source application, but not considering the IM server as open source, have to be regarded as critical. An auditor should take an own position to the paradigm of the need of the open source nature within cryptologic applications.\nElaborateness:  Audit processes should be oriented to certain minimum standard. The recent audit processes of encrypting software often vary greatly in quality, in the scope and effectiveness and also experience in the media reception often differing perceptions. Because of the need of special knowledge on the one hand and to be able to read programming code and then on the other hand to also have knowledge of encryption procedures, many users even trust the shortest statements of formal confirmation. Individual commitment as an auditor, e.g. for quality, scale and effectiveness, is thus to be assessed reflexively for yourself and to be documented within the audit.\nThe financial context:  Further transparency is needed to clarify whether the software has been developed commercially and whether the audit was funded commercially (paid Audit). It makes a difference whether it is a private hobby / community project or whether a commercial company is behind it.\nScientific referencing of learning perspectives:  Each audit should describe the findings in detail within the context and also highlight progress and development needs constructively. An auditor is not the parent of the program, but at least he or she is in a role of a mentor, if the auditor is regarded as part of a PDCA learning circle (PDCA\n\n== Emerging issues ==\nThere are also new audits being imposed by various standard boards which are required to be performed, depending upon the audited organization, which will affect IT and ensure that IT departments are performing certain functions and controls appropriately to be considered compliant. Examples of such audits are SSAE 16, ISAE 3402, and ISO27001:2013.\n\n\n*** Web presence audits ***\nThe extension of the corporate IT presence beyond the corporate firewall (e.g. the adoption of social media by the enterprise along with the proliferation of cloud-based tools like social media management systems) has elevated the importance of incorporating web presence audits into the IT/IS audit. The purposes of these audits include ensuring the company is taking the necessary steps to:\n\nrein in use of unauthorized tools (e.g. \"shadow IT\")\nminimize damage to reputation\nmaintain regulatory compliance\nprevent information leakage\nmitigate third-party risk\nminimize governance riskThe use of departmental or user developed tools has been a controversial topic in the past.  However, with the widespread availability of data analytics tools, dashboards, and statistical packages users no longer need to stand in line waiting for IT resources to fulfill seemingly endless requests for reports. The task of IT is to work with business groups to make authorized access and reporting as straightforward as possible.  To use a simple example, users should not have to do their own data matching so that pure relational tables are linked in a meaningful way.  IT needs to make non-normalized, data warehouse type files available to users so that their analysis work is simplified.  For example, some organizations will refresh a warehouse periodically and create easy to use \"flat' tables which can be easily uploaded by a package such as Tableau and used to create dashboards.\n\n\n*** Enterprise communications audits ***\nThe rise of VOIP networks and issues like BYOD and the increasing capabilities of modern enterprise telephony systems causes increased risk of critical telephony infrastructure being misconfigured, leaving the enterprise open to the possibility of communications fraud or reduced system stability. Banks, financial institutions, and contact centers typically set up policies to be enforced across their communications systems. The task of auditing that the communications systems are in compliance with the policy falls on specialized telecom auditors. These audits ensure that the company's communication systems:\n\nadhere to stated policy\nfollow policies designed to minimize the risk of hacking or phreaking\nmaintain regulatory compliance\nprevent or minimize toll fraud\nmitigate third-party risk\nminimize governance riskEnterprise communications audits are also called voice audits, but the term is increasingly deprecated as communications infrastructure increasingly becomes data-oriented and data-dependent. The term \"telephony audit\" is also deprecated because modern communications infrastructure, especially when dealing with customers, is omni-channel, where interaction takes place across multiple channels, not just over the telephone.\nOne of the key issues that plagues enterprise communication audits is the lack of industry-defined or government-approved standards. IT audits are built on the basis of adherence to standards and policies published by organizations such as NIST and PCI, but the absence of such standards for enterprise communications audits means that these audits have to be based an organization's internal standards and policies, rather than industry standards. As a result, enterprise communications audits are still manually done, with random sampling checks. Policy Audit Automation tools for enterprise communications have only recently become available.\n\n\n*** Ethical Dilemmas in IT Audits ***\nThe Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in IT audits is growing rapidly, with 30% of all corporate audits to be conducted using AI by 2025 as reported by the World Economic forum from 2015.

    "instruction": "Pre-shared key\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, a pre-shared key (PSK) is a shared secret which was previously shared between the two parties using some secure channel before it needs to be used.\n\n== Key ==\nTo build a key from shared secret, the key derivation function is typically used. Such systems almost always use symmetric key cryptographic algorithms. The term PSK is used in Wi-Fi encryption such as Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), where the method is called WPA-PSK or WPA2-PSK, and also in the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), where it is known as EAP-PSK. In all these cases, both the wireless access points (AP) and all clients share the same key.The characteristics of this secret or key are determined by the system which uses it; some system designs require that such keys be in a particular format. It can be a password, a passphrase, or a hexadecimal string. The secret is used by all systems involved in the cryptographic processes used to secure the traffic between the systems.  \nCrypto systems rely on one or more keys for confidentiality.  One particular attack is always possible against keys, the brute force key space search attack.

Such systems almost always use symmetric key cryptographic algorithms.

    "instruction": "Information security audit\n\n==Introduction==\nAn information security audit is an audit of the level of information security in an organization. It is an independent review and examination of system records, activities, and related documents. These audits are intended to improve the level of information security, avoid improper information security designs, and optimize the efficiency of the security safeguards and security processes. Within the broad scope of auditing information security there are multiple types of audits, multiple objectives for different audits, etc. Most commonly the controls being audited can be categorized as technical, physical and administrative. Auditing information security covers topics from auditing the physical security of data centers to auditing the logical security of databases, and highlights key components to look for and different methods for auditing these areas.\nWhen centered on the Information technology (IT) aspects of information security, it can be seen as a part of an information technology audit. It is often then referred to as an information technology security audit or a computer security audit. However, information security encompasses much more than IT.\n\n\n\n== The audit process ==\n\n\n*** Step 1: Preliminary audit assessment ***\nThe auditor is responsible for assessing the current technological maturity level of a company during the first stage of the audit. This stage is used to assess the current status of the company and helps identify the required time, cost and scope of an audit. First, you need to identify the minimum security requirements:\nSecurity policy and standards\nOrganizational and Personal security\nCommunication, Operation and Asset management\nPhysical and environmental security\nAccess control and Compliance\nIT systems development and maintenance\nIT security incident management\nDisaster recovery and business continuity management\nRisk management\n\n\n*** Step 2: Planning & preparation ***\nThe auditor should plan a company's audit based on the information found in the previous step. Planning an audit helps the auditor obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence for each company's specific circumstances. It helps predict audit costs at a reasonable level, assign the proper manpower and time line and avoid misunderstandings with clients.An auditor should be adequately educated about the company and its critical business activities before conducting a data center review. The objective of the data center is to align data center activities with the goals of the business while maintaining the security and integrity of critical information and processes. To adequately determine whether the client's goal is being achieved, the auditor should perform the following before conducting the review:\n\nMeet with IT management to determine possible areas of concern\nReview the current IT organization chart\nReview job descriptions of data center employees\nResearch all operating systems, software applications, and data center equipment operating within the data center\nReview the company's IT policies and procedures\nEvaluate the company's IT budget and systems planning documentation\nReview the data center's disaster recovery plan\n\n\n*** Step 3: Establishing audit objectives ***\nIn the next step, the auditor outlines the objectives of the audit after that conducting a review of a corporate data center takes place. Auditors consider multiple factors that relate to data center procedures and activities that potentially identify audit risks in the operating environment and assess the controls in place that mitigate those risks. After thorough testing and analysis, the auditor is able to adequately determine if the data center maintains proper controls and is operating efficiently and effectively.\nFollowing is a list of objectives the auditor should review:\n\nPersonnel procedures and responsibilities, including systems and cross-functional training\nChange management processes are in place and followed by IT and management personnel\nAppropriate backup procedures are in place to minimize downtime and prevent the loss of important data\nThe data center has adequate physical security controls to prevent unauthorized access to the data center\nAdequate environmental controls are in place to ensure equipment is protected from fire and flooding\n\n\n*** Step 4: Performing the review ***\nThe next step is collecting evidence to satisfy data center audit objectives. This involves traveling to the data center location and observing processes and within the data center. The following review procedures should be conducted to satisfy the pre-determined audit objectives:\n\nData centre personnel \u2013 All data center personnel should be authorized to access the data center (key cards, login ID's, secure passwords, etc.). Datacenter employees are adequately educated about data center equipment and properly perform their jobs. Vendor service personnel are supervised when doing work on data center equipment. The auditor should observe and interview data center employees to satisfy their objectives.\nEquipment \u2013 The auditor should verify that all data center equipment is working properly and effectively. Equipment utilization reports, equipment inspection for damage and functionality, system downtime records and equipment performance measurements all help the auditor determine the state of data center equipment. Additionally, the auditor should interview employees to determine if preventative maintenance policies are in place and performed.\nPolicies and Procedures \u2013 All data center policies and procedures should be documented and located at the data center. Important documented procedures include data center personnel job responsibilities, back up policies, security policies, employee termination policies, system operating procedures and an overview of operating systems.\nPhysical security / environmental controls \u2013 The auditor should assess the security of the client's data center. Physical security includes bodyguards, locked cages, man traps, single entrances, bolted-down equipment, and computer monitoring systems. Additionally, environmental controls should be in place to ensure the security of data center equipment. These include Air conditioning units, raised floors, humidifiers and an uninterruptible power supply.\nBackup procedures \u2013 The auditor should verify that the client has backup procedures in place in the case of system failure. Clients may maintain a backup data center at a separate location that allows them to instantaneously continue operations in the instance of system failure\n\n\n*** Step 5: Preparing the Audit Report ***\nAfter the audit examination is completed, the audit findings and suggestions for corrective actions can be communicated to responsible stakeholders in a formal meeting. This ensures better understanding and support of the audit recommendations. It also gives the audited organization an opportunity to express its views on the issues raised.\nWriting a report after such a meeting and describing where agreements have been reached on all audit issues can greatly enhance audit effectiveness. Exit conferences also help finalize recommendations that are practical and feasible.\n\n\n*** Step 6: Issuing the review report ***\nThe data center review report should summarize the auditor's findings and be similar in format to a standard review report. The review report should be dated as of the completion of the auditor's inquiry and procedures. It should state what the review entailed and explain that a review provides only \"limited assurance\" to third parties.\nTypically, a data center review report consolidates the entirety of the audit. It also offers recommendations surrounding proper implementation of physical safeguards and advises the client on appropriate roles and responsibilities of its personnel. Its contents may include:\nThe auditors\u2019 procedures and findings\nThe auditors\u2019 recommendations\nObjective, scope, and methodologies\nOverview/conclusionsThe report may optionally include rankings of the security vulnerabilities identified throughout the performance of the audit and the urgency of the tasks necessary to address them. Rankings like \u201chigh\u201d, \u201clow\u201d, and \u201cmedium\u201d can be used to describe the imperativeness of the tasks.\n\n== Who performs audits ==\nGenerally, computer security audits are performed by:\n\nFederal or State Regulators\nInformation security audits would primarily be prepared by the partners of these regulators.\nExamples include: Certified accountants, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), etc.\nCorporate Internal Auditors If the information security audit is an internal audit, it may be performed by internal auditors employed by the organization.\nExamples include: Certificated accountants, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Certified Internet Audit Professional (CIAP)\nExternal Auditors\nTypically, third-party experts employed by an independent organization and specializing in the field of data security are hired when state or federal auditors are not accessible.\nConsultants\nOutsourcing the technology auditing where the organization lacks the specialized skill set.\n\n== Jobs and certifications in information security ==\n\n\n*** Information Security Officer (ISO) ***\nInformation Security Officer (ISO) is a relatively new position, which has emerged in organizations to deal in the aftermath of chaotic growth in information technology and network communication. The role of the ISO has been very nebulous since the problem that they were created to address was not defined clearly. The role of an ISO has become one of following the dynamics of the security environment and keeping the risk posture balanced for the organization.\n\n\n*** Certifications ***\nInformation systems audits combine the efforts and skill sets from the accounting and technology fields. Professionals from both fields rely on one another to ensure the security of the information and data.With this collaboration, the security of the information system has proven to increase over time. In relation to the information systems audit, the role of the auditor is to examine the company\u2019s controls of the security program. Furthermore, the auditor discloses the operating effectiveness of these controls in an audit report. The Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), an Information Technology professional organization, promotes gaining expertise through various certifications. The benefits of these certifications are applicable to external and internal personnel of the system. Examples of certifications that are relevant to information security audits include:\n\nCertified Information Systems Manager (CISM)\nCertified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC)\nCertified in the Governance of Enterprise IT (CGEIT)\nCertified Information System Auditor (CISA)\nCSX (Cybersecurity Nexus Fundamentals)\nCSXP (Cybersecurity Nexus Practitioner)\n\n== The audited systems ==\n\n\n*** Network vulnerabilities ***\nInterception: Data that is being transmitted over the network is vulnerable to being intercepted by an unintended third party who could put the data to harmful use.\nAvailability: Networks have become wide-spanning, crossing hundreds or thousands of miles which many rely on to access company information, and lost connectivity could cause business interruption.\nAccess/entry point: Networks are vulnerable to unwanted access. A weak point in the network can make that information available to intruders. It can also provide an entry point for viruses and Trojan horses.\n\n\n*** Controls ***\nInterception controls: Interception can be partially deterred by physical access controls at data centers and offices, including where communication links terminate and where the network wiring and distributions are located.  Encryption also helps to secure wireless networks.\nAvailability controls: The best control for this is to have excellent network architecture and monitoring. The network should have redundant paths between every resource and an access point and automatic routing to switch the traffic to the available path without loss of data or time.\nAccess/entry point controls: Most network controls are put at the point where the network connects with an external network. These controls limit the traffic that passes through the network. These can include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software.The auditor should ask certain questions to better understand the network and its vulnerabilities. The auditor should first assess the extent of the network is and how it is structured. A network diagram can assist the auditor in this process. The next question an auditor should ask is what critical information this network must protect. Things such as enterprise systems, mail servers, web servers, and host applications accessed by customers are typically areas of focus. It is also important to know who has access and to what parts. Do customers and vendors have access to systems on the network? Can employees access information from home? Lastly, the auditor should assess how the network is connected to external networks and how it is protected. Most networks are at least connected to the internet, which could be a point of vulnerability. These are critical questions in protecting networks.\n\n\n*** Segregation of duties ***\nWhen you have a function that deals with money either incoming or outgoing it is very important to make sure that duties are segregated to minimize and hopefully prevent fraud. One of the key ways to ensure proper segregation of duties (SoD) from a systems perspective is to review individuals\u2019 access authorizations. Certain systems such as SAP claim to come with the capability to perform SoD tests, but the functionality provided is elementary, requiring very time-consuming queries to be built and is limited to the transaction level only with little or no use of the object or field values assigned to the user through the transaction, which often produces misleading results. For complex systems such as SAP, it is often preferred to use tools developed specifically to assess and analyze SoD conflicts and other types of system activity. For other systems or for multiple system formats you should monitor which users may have superuser access to the system giving them unlimited access to all aspects of the system. Also, developing a matrix for all functions highlighting the points where proper segregation of duties has been breached will help identify potential material weaknesses by cross-checking each employee's available accesses. This is as important if not more so in the development function as it is in production. Ensuring that people who develop the programs are not the ones who are authorized to pull it into production is key to preventing unauthorized programs into the production environment where they can be used to perpetrate fraud.\n\n== Types of audits ==\n\n\n*** Encryption and IT audit ***\nIn assessing the need for a client to implement encryption policies for their organization, the Auditor should conduct an analysis of the client's risk and data value. Companies with multiple external users, e-commerce applications, and sensitive customer/employee information should maintain rigid encryption policies aimed at encrypting the correct data at the appropriate stage in the data collection process.Auditors should continually evaluate their client's encryption policies and procedures. Companies that are heavily reliant on e-commerce systems and wireless networks are extremely vulnerable to theft and loss of critical information in transmission. Policies and procedures should be documented and carried out to ensure that all transmitted data is protected.\nThe auditor should verify that management has controls in place over the data encryption management process. Access to keys should require dual control, keys should be composed of two separate components and should be maintained on a computer that is not accessible to programmers or outside users. Furthermore, management should attest that encryption policies ensure data protection at the desired level and verify that the cost of encrypting the data does not exceed the value of the information itself. All data that is required to be maintained for an extensive amount of time should be encrypted and transported to a remote location. Procedures should be in place to guarantee that all encrypted sensitive information arrives at its location and is stored properly. Finally, the auditor should attain verification from management that the encryption system is strong, not attackable, and compliant with all local and international laws and regulations.\n\n\n*** Logical security audit ***\nJust as it sounds, a logical security audit follows a format in an organized procedure. The first step in an audit of any system is to seek to understand its components and its structure. When auditing logical security the auditor should investigate what security controls are in place, and how they work. In particular, the following areas are key points in auditing logical security:\n\nPasswords: Every company should have written policies regarding passwords, and employees' use of them. Passwords should not be shared and employees should have mandatory scheduled changes. Employees should have user rights that are in line with their job functions. They should also be aware of proper log on/ log off procedures. Also helpful are security tokens, small devices that authorized users of computer programs or networks carry to assist in identity confirmation. They can also store cryptographic keys and biometric data. The most popular type of security token (RSA's SecurID) displays a number that changes every minute. Users are authenticated by entering a personal identification number and the number on the token.\nTermination Procedures: Proper termination procedures so that, old employees can no longer access the network. This can be done by changing passwords and codes. Also, all id cards and badges that are in circulation should be documented and accounted for.\nSpecial User Accounts: Special User Accounts and other privileged accounts should be monitored and have proper controls in place.\nRemote Access: Remote access is often a point where intruders can enter a system. The logical security tools used for remote access should be very strict. Remote access should be logged.\n\n\n*** Specific tools used in network security ***\nNetwork security is achieved by various tools including firewalls and proxy servers, encryption, logical security and access controls, anti-virus software, and auditing systems such as log management.\nFirewalls are a very basic part of network security. They are often placed between the private local network and the internet. Firewalls provide a flow-through for traffic in which it can be authenticated, monitored, logged, and reported. Some different types of firewalls include network layer firewalls, screened subnet firewalls, packet filter firewalls, dynamic packet filtering firewalls, hybrid firewalls, transparent firewalls, and application-level firewalls.\nThe process of encryption involves converting plain text into a series of unreadable characters known as the ciphertext. If the encrypted text is stolen or attained while in transit, the content is unreadable to the viewer. This guarantees secure transmission and is extremely useful to companies sending/receiving critical information. Once encrypted information arrives at its intended recipient, the decryption process is deployed to restore the ciphertext back to plaintext.\nProxy servers hide the true address of the client workstation and can also act as a firewall. Proxy server firewalls have special software to enforce authentication. Proxy server firewalls act as a middle man for user requests.\nAntivirus software programs such as McAfee and Symantec software locate and dispose of malicious content. These virus protection programs run live updates to ensure they have the latest information about known computer viruses.\nLogical security includes software safeguards for an organization's systems, including user ID and password access, authentication, access rights and authority levels. These measures are to ensure that only authorized users are able to perform actions or access information in a network or a workstation.\n\n\n*** Behavioral audit ***\nVulnerabilities in an organization's  IT systems are often not attributed to technical weaknesses, but rather related to individual behavior of employees within the organization. A simple example of this is users leaving their computers unlocked or being vulnerable to phishing attacks. As a result, a thorough InfoSec audit will frequently include a penetration test in which auditors attempt to gain access to as much of the system as possible, from both the perspective of a typical employee as well as an outsider. A behavioral audit ensures preventative measures are in place such as a phishing webinar, where employees are made aware of what phishing is and how to detect it.\nSystem and process assurance audits combine elements from IT infrastructure and application/information security audits and use diverse controls in categories such as Completeness, Accuracy, Validity (V) and Restricted access (CAVR).\n\n== Auditing application security ==\n\n\n*** Application security ***\nApplication Security centers on three main functions:\n\nProgramming\nProcessing\nAccessWhen it comes to programming it is important to ensure proper physical and password protection exists around servers and mainframes for the development and update of key systems. Having physical access security at one's data center or office such as electronic badges and badge readers, security guards, choke points, and security cameras is vitally important to ensuring the security of applications and data. Then one needs to have security around changes to the system. Those usually have to do with proper security access to make the changes and having proper authorization procedures in place for pulling programming changes from development through test and finally into production.\nWith processing, it is important that procedures and monitoring of a few different aspects such as the input of falsified or erroneous data, incomplete processing, duplicate transactions and untimely processing are in place. Making sure that input is randomly reviewed or that all processing has proper approval is a way to ensure this. It is important to be able to identify incomplete processing and ensure that proper procedures are in place for either completing it or deleting it from the system if it was in error. There should also be procedures to identify and correct duplicate entries. Finally, when it comes to processing that is not being done on a timely basis one should back-track the associated data to see where the delay is coming from and identify whether or not this delay creates any control concerns.\nFinally, access, it is important to realize that maintaining network security against unauthorized access is one of the major focuses for companies as threats can come from a few sources. First, one have internal unauthorized access.  It is very important to have system access passwords that must be changed regularly and that there is a way to track access and changes so one is able to identify who made what changes. All activity should be logged. The second arena to be concerned with is remote access, people accessing one's system from the outside through the internet. Setting up firewalls and password protection to on-line data changes are key to protecting against unauthorized remote access. One way to identify weaknesses in access controls is to bring in a hacker to try and crack one's system by either gaining entry to the building and using an internal terminal or hacking in from the outside through remote access.\n\n== Summary ==\nAn information security audit can be defined by examining the different aspects of information security. External and internal professionals within an institution  have the responsibility of maintaining and inspecting the adequacy and effectiveness of information security. As in any institution, there are various controls to be implemented and maintained. To secure the information, an institution is expected to apply security measures to circumvent outside intervention. By and large, the two concepts of application security and segregation of duties are both in many ways connected and they both have the same goal, to protect the integrity of the companies\u2019 data and to prevent fraud. For application security, it has to do with preventing unauthorized access to hardware and software through having proper security measures both physical and electronic in place. With segregation of duties, it is primarily a physical review of individuals\u2019 access to the systems and processing and ensuring that there are no overlaps that could lead to fraud. The type of audit the individual performs determines the specific procedures and tests to be executed throughout the audit process.\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGallegos, Frederick; Senft, Sandra; Manson, Daniel P.; Gonzales, Carol (2004).

Rankings like \u201chigh\u201d, \u201clow\u201d, and \u201cmedium\u201d can be used to describe the imperativeness of the tasks.\n\n== Who performs audits ==\nGenerally, computer security audits are performed by:\n\nFederal or State Regulators\nInformation security audits would primarily be prepared by the partners of these regulators.\nExamples include: Certified accountants, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), etc.\nCorporate Internal Auditors If the information security audit is an internal audit, it may be performed by internal auditors employed by the organization.\nExamples include: Certificated accountants, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Certified Internet Audit Professional (CIAP)\nExternal Auditors\nTypically, third-party experts employed by an independent organization and specializing in the field of data security are hired when state or federal auditors are not accessible.\nConsultants\nOutsourcing the technology auditing where the organization lacks the specialized skill set.\n\n== Jobs and certifications in information security ==\n\n\n*** Information Security Officer (ISO) ***\nInformation Security Officer (ISO) is a relatively new position, which has emerged in organizations to deal in the aftermath of chaotic growth in information technology and network communication. The role of the ISO has been very nebulous since the problem that they were created to address was not defined clearly. The role of an ISO has become one of following the dynamics of the security environment and keeping the risk posture balanced for the organization.\n\n\n*** Certifications ***\nInformation systems audits combine the efforts and skill sets from the accounting and technology fields. Professionals from both fields rely on one another to ensure the security of the information and data.With this collaboration, the security of the information system has proven to increase over time. In relation to the information systems audit, the role of the auditor is to examine the company\u2019s controls of the security program. Furthermore, the auditor discloses the operating effectiveness of these controls in an audit report. The Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), an Information Technology professional organization, promotes gaining expertise through various certifications. The benefits of these certifications are applicable to external and internal personnel of the system. Examples of certifications that are relevant to information security audits include:\n\nCertified Information Systems Manager (CISM)\nCertified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC)\nCertified in the Governance of Enterprise IT (CGEIT)\nCertified Information System Auditor (CISA)\nCSX (Cybersecurity Nexus Fundamentals)\nCSXP (Cybersecurity Nexus Practitioner)\n\n== The audited systems ==\n\n\n*** Network vulnerabilities ***\nInterception: Data that is being transmitted over the network is vulnerable to being intercepted by an unintended third party who could put the data to harmful use.\nAvailability: Networks have become wide-spanning, crossing hundreds or thousands of miles which many rely on to access company information, and lost connectivity could cause business interruption.\nAccess/entry point: Networks are vulnerable to unwanted access. A weak point in the network can make that information available to intruders. It can also provide an entry point for viruses and Trojan horses.\n\n\n*** Controls ***\nInterception controls: Interception can be partially deterred by physical access controls at data centers and offices, including where communication links terminate and where the network wiring and distributions are located.  Encryption also helps to secure wireless networks.\nAvailability controls: The best control for this is to have excellent network architecture and monitoring. The network should have redundant paths between every resource and an access point and automatic routing to switch the traffic to the available path without loss of data or time.\nAccess/entry point controls: Most network controls are put at the point where the network connects with an external network. These controls limit the traffic that passes through the network. These can include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software.The auditor should ask certain questions to better understand the network and its vulnerabilities. The auditor should first assess the extent of the network is and how it is structured. A network diagram can assist the auditor in this process. The next question an auditor should ask is what critical information this network must protect. Things such as enterprise systems, mail servers, web servers, and host applications accessed by customers are typically areas of focus. It is also important to know who has access and to what parts. Do customers and vendors have access to systems on the network? Can employees access information from home? Lastly, the auditor should assess how the network is connected to external networks and how it is protected. Most networks are at least connected to the internet, which could be a point of vulnerability. These are critical questions in protecting networks.\n\n\n*** Segregation of duties ***\nWhen you have a function that deals with money either incoming or outgoing it is very important to make sure that duties are segregated to minimize and hopefully prevent fraud. One of the key ways to ensure proper segregation of duties (SoD) from a systems perspective is to review individuals\u2019 access authorizations. Certain systems such as SAP claim to come with the capability to perform SoD tests, but the functionality provided is elementary, requiring very time-consuming queries to be built and is limited to the transaction level only with little or no use of the object or field values assigned to the user through the transaction, which often produces misleading results. For complex systems such as SAP, it is often preferred to use tools developed specifically to assess and analyze SoD conflicts and other types of system activity. For other systems or for multiple system formats you should monitor which users may have superuser access to the system giving them unlimited access to all aspects of the system. Also, developing a matrix for all functions highlighting the points where proper segregation of duties has been breached will help identify potential material weaknesses by cross-checking each employee's available accesses. This is as important if not more so in the development function as it is in production. Ensuring that people who develop the programs are not the ones who are authorized to pull it into production is key to preventing unauthorized programs into the production environment where they can be used to perpetrate fraud.\n\n== Types of audits ==\n\n\n*** Encryption and IT audit ***\nIn assessing the need for a client to implement encryption policies for their organization, the Auditor should conduct an analysis of the client's risk and data value. Companies with multiple external users, e-commerce applications, and sensitive customer/employee information should maintain rigid encryption policies aimed at encrypting the correct data at the appropriate stage in the data collection process.Auditors should continually evaluate their client's encryption policies and procedures. Companies that are heavily reliant on e-commerce systems and wireless networks are extremely vulnerable to theft and loss of critical information in transmission. Policies and procedures should be documented and carried out to ensure that all transmitted data is protected.\nThe auditor should verify that management has controls in place over the data encryption management process. Access to keys should require dual control, keys should be composed of two separate components and should be maintained on a computer that is not accessible to programmers or outside users. Furthermore, management should attest that encryption policies ensure data protection at the desired level and verify that the cost of encrypting the data does not exceed the value of the information itself. All data that is required to be maintained for an extensive amount of time should be encrypted and transported to a remote location. Procedures should be in place to guarantee that all encrypted sensitive information arrives at its location and is stored properly. Finally, the auditor should attain verification from management that the encryption system is strong, not attackable, and compliant with all local and international laws and regulations.\n\n\n*** Logical security audit ***\nJust as it sounds, a logical security audit follows a format in an organized procedure. The first step in an audit of any system is to seek to understand its components and its structure. When auditing logical security the auditor should investigate what security controls are in place, and how they work. In particular, the following areas are key points in auditing logical security:\n\nPasswords: Every company should have written policies regarding passwords, and employees' use of them. Passwords should not be shared and employees should have mandatory scheduled changes. Employees should have user rights that are in line with their job functions. They should also be aware of proper log on/ log off procedures. Also helpful are security tokens, small devices that authorized users of computer programs or networks carry to assist in identity confirmation. They can also store cryptographic keys and biometric data. The most popular type of security token (RSA's SecurID) displays a number that changes every minute. Users are authenticated by entering a personal identification number and the number on the token.\nTermination Procedures: Proper termination procedures so that, old employees can no longer access the network. This can be done by changing passwords and codes. Also, all id cards and badges that are in circulation should be documented and accounted for.\nSpecial User Accounts: Special User Accounts and other privileged accounts should be monitored and have proper controls in place.\nRemote Access: Remote access is often a point where intruders can enter a system. The logical security tools used for remote access should be very strict. Remote access should be logged.\n\n\n*** Specific tools used in network security ***\nNetwork security is achieved by various tools including firewalls and proxy servers, encryption, logical security and access controls, anti-virus software, and auditing systems such as log management.\nFirewalls are a very basic part of network security. They are often placed between the private local network and the internet. Firewalls provide a flow-through for traffic in which it can be authenticated, monitored, logged, and reported. Some different types of firewalls include network layer firewalls, screened subnet firewalls, packet filter firewalls, dynamic packet filtering firewalls, hybrid firewalls, transparent firewalls, and application-level firewalls.\nThe process of encryption involves converting plain text into a series of unreadable characters known as the ciphertext. If the encrypted text is stolen or attained while in transit, the content is unreadable to the viewer. This guarantees secure transmission and is extremely useful to companies sending/receiving critical information. Once encrypted information arrives at its intended recipient, the decryption process is deployed to restore the ciphertext back to plaintext.\nProxy servers hide the true address of the client workstation and can also act as a firewall. Proxy server firewalls have special software to enforce authentication. Proxy server firewalls act as a middle man for user requests.\nAntivirus software programs such as McAfee and Symantec software locate and dispose of malicious content. These virus protection programs run live updates to ensure they have the latest information about known computer viruses.\nLogical security includes software safeguards for an organization's systems, including user ID and password access, authentication, access rights and authority levels. These measures are to ensure that only authorized users are able to perform actions or access information in a network or a workstation.\n\n\n*** Behavioral audit ***\nVulnerabilities in an organization's  IT systems are often not attributed to technical weaknesses, but rather related to individual behavior of employees within the organization. A simple example of this is users leaving their computers unlocked or being vulnerable to phishing attacks. As a result, a thorough InfoSec audit will frequently include a penetration test in which auditors attempt to gain access to as much of the system as possible, from both the perspective of a typical employee as well as an outsider. A behavioral audit ensures preventative measures are in place such as a phishing webinar, where employees are made aware of what phishing is and how to detect it.\nSystem and process assurance audits combine elements from IT infrastructure and application/information security audits and use diverse controls in categories such as Completeness, Accuracy, Validity (V) and Restricted access (CAVR).\n\n== Auditing application security ==\n\n\n*** Application security ***\nApplication Security centers on three main functions:\n\nProgramming\nProcessing\nAccessWhen it comes to programming it is important to ensure proper physical and password protection exists around servers and mainframes for the development and update of key systems. Having physical access security at one's data center or office such as electronic badges and badge readers, security guards, choke points, and security cameras is vitally important to ensuring the security of applications and data. Then one needs to have security around changes to the system. Those usually have to do with proper security access to make the changes and having proper authorization procedures in place for pulling programming changes from development through test and finally into production.\nWith processing, it is important that procedures and monitoring of a few different aspects such as the input of falsified or erroneous data, incomplete processing, duplicate transactions and untimely processing are in place. Making sure that input is randomly reviewed or that all processing has proper approval is a way to ensure this. It is important to be able to identify incomplete processing and ensure that proper procedures are in place for either completing it or deleting it from the system if it was in error. There should also be procedures to identify and correct duplicate entries. Finally, when it comes to processing that is not being done on a timely basis one should back-track the associated data to see where the delay is coming from and identify whether or not this delay creates any control concerns.\nFinally, access, it is important to realize that maintaining network security against unauthorized access is one of the major focuses for companies as threats can come from a few sources. First, one have internal unauthorized access.  It is very important to have system access passwords that must be changed regularly and that there is a way to track access and changes so one is able to identify who made what changes. All activity should be logged. The second arena to be concerned with is remote access, people accessing one's system from the outside through the internet. Setting up firewalls and password protection to on-line data changes are key to protecting against unauthorized remote access. One way to identify weaknesses in access controls is to bring in a hacker to try and crack one's system by either gaining entry to the building and using an internal terminal or hacking in from the outside through remote access.\n\n== Summary ==\nAn information security audit can be defined by examining the different aspects of information security. External and internal professionals within an institution  have the responsibility of maintaining and inspecting the adequacy and effectiveness of information security. As in any institution, there are various controls to be implemented and maintained. To secure the information, an institution is expected to apply security measures to circumvent outside intervention. By and large, the two concepts of application security and segregation of duties are both in many ways connected and they both have the same goal, to protect the integrity of the companies\u2019 data and to prevent fraud. For application security, it has to do with preventing unauthorized access to hardware and software through having proper security measures both physical and electronic in place. With segregation of duties, it is primarily a physical review of individuals\u2019 access to the systems and processing and ensuring that there are no overlaps that could lead to fraud. The type of audit the individual performs determines the specific procedures and tests to be executed throughout the audit process.\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGallegos, Frederick; Senft, Sandra; Manson, Daniel P.; Gonzales, Carol (2004).

    "instruction": "SHA-1\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a hash function which takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value known as a message digest \u2013 typically rendered as 40 hexadecimal digits. It was designed by the United States National Security Agency, and is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard. The algorithm has been cryptographically broken but is still widely used.\nSince 2005, SHA-1 has not been considered secure against well-funded opponents; as of 2010 many organizations have recommended its replacement. NIST formally deprecated use of SHA-1 in 2011 and disallowed its use for digital signatures in 2013, and declared that it should be phased out by 2030. As of 2020, chosen-prefix attacks against SHA-1 are practical. As such, it is recommended to remove SHA-1 from products as soon as possible and instead use SHA-2 or SHA-3. Replacing SHA-1 is urgent where it is used for digital signatures.\nAll major web browser vendors ceased acceptance of SHA-1 SSL certificates in 2017. In February 2017, CWI Amsterdam and Google announced they had performed a collision attack against SHA-1, publishing two dissimilar PDF files which produced the same SHA-1 hash. However, SHA-1 is still secure for HMAC.Microsoft has discontinued SHA-1 code signing support for Windows Update on August 7, 2020.\n\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nSHA-1 produces a message digest based on principles similar to those used by Ronald L. Rivest of MIT in the design of the MD2, MD4 and MD5 message digest algorithms, but generates a larger hash value (160 bits vs. 128 bits).\nSHA-1 was developed as part of the U.S. Government's Capstone project. The original specification of the algorithm was published in 1993 under the title Secure Hash Standard, FIPS PUB 180, by U.S. government standards agency NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). This version is now often named SHA-0. It was withdrawn by the NSA shortly after publication and was superseded by the revised version, published in 1995 in FIPS PUB 180-1 and commonly designated SHA-1. SHA-1 differs from SHA-0 only by a single bitwise rotation in the message schedule of its compression function. According to the NSA, this was done to correct a flaw in the original algorithm which reduced its cryptographic security, but they did not provide any further explanation. Publicly available techniques did indeed demonstrate a compromise of SHA-0, in 2004, before SHA-1 in 2017 (see \u00a7Attacks).\n\n== Applications ==\n\n\n*** Cryptography ***\n\nSHA-1 forms part of several widely used security applications and protocols, including TLS and SSL, PGP, SSH, S/MIME, and IPsec. Those applications can also use MD5; both MD5 and SHA-1 are descended from MD4.\nSHA-1 and SHA-2 are the hash algorithms required by law for use in certain U.S. government applications, including use within other cryptographic algorithms and protocols, for the protection of sensitive unclassified information. FIPS PUB 180-1 also encouraged adoption and use of SHA-1 by private and commercial organizations. SHA-1 is being retired from most government uses; the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology said, \"Federal agencies should stop using SHA-1 for...applications that require collision resistance as soon as practical, and must use the SHA-2 family of hash functions for these applications after 2010\" (emphasis in original), though that was later relaxed to allow SHA-1 to be used for verifying old digital signatures and time stamps.A prime motivation for the publication of the Secure Hash Algorithm was the Digital Signature Standard, in which it is incorporated.\nThe SHA hash functions have been used for the basis of the SHACAL block ciphers.\n\n\n*** Data integrity ***\nRevision control systems such as Git, Mercurial, and Monotone use SHA-1, not for security, but to identify revisions and to ensure that the data has not changed due to accidental corruption. Linus Torvalds said about Git:\n\nIf you have disk corruption, if you have DRAM corruption, if you have any kind of problems at all, Git will notice them. It's not a question of if, it's a guarantee. You can have people who try to be malicious. They won't succeed. [...] Nobody has been able to break SHA-1, but the point is the SHA-1, as far as Git is concerned, isn't even a security feature. It's purely a consistency check. The security parts are elsewhere, so a lot of people assume that since Git uses SHA-1 and SHA-1 is used for cryptographically secure stuff, they think that, Okay, it's a huge security feature. It has nothing at all to do with security, it's just the best hash you can get. ...\nI guarantee you, if you put your data in Git, you can trust the fact that five years later, after it was converted from your hard disk to DVD to whatever new technology and you copied it along, five years later you can verify that the data you get back out is the exact same data you put in. [...]\nOne of the reasons I care is for the kernel, we had a break in on one of the BitKeeper sites where people tried to corrupt the kernel source code repositories.However Git does not require the second preimage resistance of SHA-1 as a security feature, since it will always prefer to keep the earliest version of an object in case of collision, preventing an attacker from surreptitiously overwriting files.\n\n== Cryptanalysis and validation ==\nFor a hash function for which L is the number of bits in the message digest, finding a message that corresponds to a given message digest can always be done using a brute force search in approximately 2L evaluations. This is called a preimage attack and may or may not be practical depending on L and the particular computing environment. However, a collision, consisting of finding two different messages that produce the same message digest, requires on average only about 1.2 \u00d7 2L/2 evaluations using a birthday attack. Thus the strength of a hash function is usually compared to a symmetric cipher of half the message digest length. SHA-1, which has a 160-bit message digest, was originally thought to have 80-bit strength.\nSome of the applications that use cryptographic hashes, like password storage, are only minimally affected by a collision attack. Constructing a password that works for a given account requires a preimage attack, as well as access to the hash of the original password, which may or may not be trivial. Reversing password encryption (e.g. to obtain a password to try against a user's account elsewhere) is not made possible by the attacks. (However, even a secure password hash can't prevent brute-force attacks on weak passwords.)\nIn the case of document signing, an attacker could not simply fake a signature from an existing document: The attacker would have to produce a pair of documents, one innocuous and one damaging, and get the private key holder to sign the innocuous document. There are practical circumstances in which this is possible; until the end of 2008, it was possible to create forged SSL certificates using an MD5 collision.Due to the block and iterative structure of the algorithms and the absence of additional final steps, all SHA functions (except SHA-3) are vulnerable to length-extension and partial-message collision attacks. These attacks allow an attacker to forge a message signed only by a keyed hash \u2013 SHA(message || key) or SHA(key || message) \u2013 by extending the message and recalculating the hash without knowing the key. A simple improvement to prevent these attacks is to hash twice: SHAd(message)\n\n== Examples and pseudocode ==\n\n\n*** Example hashes ***\nThese are examples of SHA-1 message digests in hexadecimal and in Base64 binary to ASCII text encoding.\n\nSHA1(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\")\nOutputted hexadecimal: 2fd4e1c67a2d28fced849ee1bb76e7391b93eb12\nOutputted Base64 binary to ASCII text encoding: L9ThxnotKPzthJ7hu3bnORuT6xI\n\n== Comparison of SHA functions ==\nIn the table below, internal state means the \"internal hash sum\" after each compression of a data block.\n\n== Implementations ==\nBelow is a list of cryptography libraries that support SHA-1:\n\nBotan\nBouncy Castle\ncryptlib\nCrypto++\nLibgcrypt\nMbed TLS\nNettle\nLibreSSL\nOpenSSL\nGnuTLS\nHardware acceleration is provided by the following processor extensions:\n\nIntel SHA extensions: Available on some Intel and AMD x86 processors.\nVIA PadLock\nIBM z/Architecture:  Available since 2003 as part of the Message-Security-Assist Extension\n\nQ: What applications use SHA-1 for cryptographic purposes?",

SHA-1 is being retired from most government uses; the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology said, \"Federal agencies should stop using SHA-1 for...applications that require collision resistance as soon as practical, and must use the SHA-2 family of hash functions for these applications after 2010\" (emphasis in original), though that was later relaxed to allow SHA-1 to be used for verifying old digital signatures and time stamps.A prime motivation for the publication of the Secure Hash Algorithm was the Digital Signature Standard, in which it is incorporated.\nThe SHA hash functions have been used for the basis of the SHACAL block ciphers.\n\n\n*** Data integrity ***\nRevision control systems such as Git, Mercurial, and Monotone use SHA-1, not for security, but to identify revisions and to ensure that the data has not changed due to accidental corruption. Linus Torvalds said about Git:\n\nIf you have disk corruption, if you have DRAM corruption, if you have any kind of problems at all, Git will notice them. It's not a question of if, it's a guarantee. You can have people who try to be malicious. They won't succeed. [...] Nobody has been able to break SHA-1, but the point is the SHA-1, as far as Git is concerned, isn't even a security feature. It's purely a consistency check. The security parts are elsewhere, so a lot of people assume that since Git uses SHA-1 and SHA-1 is used for cryptographically secure stuff, they think that, Okay, it's a huge security feature. It has nothing at all to do with security, it's just the best hash you can get. ...\nI guarantee you, if you put your data in Git, you can trust the fact that five years later, after it was converted from your hard disk to DVD to whatever new technology and you copied it along, five years later you can verify that the data you get back out is the exact same data you put in. [...]\nOne of the reasons I care is for the kernel, we had a break in on one of the BitKeeper sites where people tried to corrupt the kernel source code repositories.However Git does not require the second preimage resistance of SHA-1 as a security feature, since it will always prefer to keep the earliest version of an object in case of collision, preventing an attacker from surreptitiously overwriting files.\n\n== Cryptanalysis and validation ==\nFor a hash function for which L is the number of bits in the message digest, finding a message that corresponds to a given message digest can always be done using a brute force search in approximately 2L evaluations. This is called a preimage attack and may or may not be practical depending on L and the particular computing environment. However, a collision, consisting of finding two different messages that produce the same message digest, requires on average only about 1.2 \u00d7 2L/2 evaluations using a birthday attack. Thus the strength of a hash function is usually compared to a symmetric cipher of half the message digest length. SHA-1, which has a 160-bit message digest, was originally thought to have 80-bit strength.\nSome of the applications that use cryptographic hashes, like password storage, are only minimally affected by a collision attack. Constructing a password that works for a given account requires a preimage attack, as well as access to the hash of the original password, which may or may not be trivial. Reversing password encryption (e.g. to obtain a password to try against a user's account elsewhere) is not made possible by the attacks. (However, even a secure password hash can't prevent brute-force attacks on weak passwords.)\nIn the case of document signing, an attacker could not simply fake a signature from an existing document: The attacker would have to produce a pair of documents, one innocuous and one damaging, and get the private key holder to sign the innocuous document. There are practical circumstances in which this is possible; until the end of 2008, it was possible to create forged SSL certificates using an MD5 collision.Due to the block and iterative structure of the algorithms and the absence of additional final steps, all SHA functions (except SHA-3) are vulnerable to length-extension and partial-message collision attacks. These attacks allow an attacker to forge a message signed only by a keyed hash \u2013 SHA(message || key) or SHA(key || message) \u2013 by extending the message and recalculating the hash without knowing the key. A simple improvement to prevent these attacks is to hash twice: SHAd(message)\n\n== Examples and pseudocode ==\n\n\n*** Example hashes ***\nThese are examples of SHA-1 message digests in hexadecimal and in Base64 binary to ASCII text encoding.\n\nSHA1(\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\")\nOutputted hexadecimal: 2fd4e1c67a2d28fced849ee1bb76e7391b93eb12\nOutputted Base64 binary to ASCII text encoding: L9ThxnotKPzthJ7hu3bnORuT6xI\n\n== Comparison of SHA functions ==\nIn the table below, internal state means the \"internal hash sum\" after each compression of a data block.\n\n== Implementations ==\nBelow is a list of cryptography libraries that support SHA-1:\n\nBotan\nBouncy Castle\ncryptlib\nCrypto++\nLibgcrypt\nMbed TLS\nNettle\nLibreSSL\nOpenSSL\nGnuTLS\nHardware acceleration is provided by the following processor extensions:\n\nIntel SHA extensions: Available on some Intel and AMD x86 processors.\nVIA PadLock\nIBM z/Architecture:  Available since 2003 as part of the Message-Security-Assist Extension"

In September 2021, Apple released new versions of its operating systems for multiple device families containing a fix for the vulnerability.\n\n\n\n== Exploit ==\nThe exploit was discovered by Citizen Lab, who reported that the vulnerability has been used to target political dissidents and human rights activists. FORCEDENTRY appears to be the same as the attack previously detected and named \"Megalodon\" by Amnesty International.The exploit uses PDF files disguised as GIF files to inject JBIG2-encoded data to provoke an integer overflow in Apple's CoreGraphics system, circumventing Apple's \"BlastDoor\" sandbox for message content. BlastDoor was introduced as part of iOS 14 to defend against KISMET, another zero-click exploit. The FORCEDENTRY exploit has been given the CVE identifier CVE-2021-30860.

It's not as fast as Javascript, but it's fundamentally computationally equivalent.\nThe bootstrapping operations for the sandbox escape exploit are written to run on this logic circuit and the whole thing runs in this weird, emulated environment created out of a single decompression pass through a JBIG2 stream.

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nWireless identity theft\n\n==Introduction==\nWireless identity theft, also known as contactless identity theft or RFID identity theft, is  a form of identity theft described as \"the act of compromising an individual\u2019s personal identifying information using wireless (radio frequency) mechanics.\" Numerous articles have been written about wireless identity theft and broadcast television has produced several investigations of this phenomenon. According to Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, wireless identity theft is a serious issue as the contactless (wireless) card design is inherently flawed, increasing the vulnerability to attacks.\n\n\n\n== Overview ==\nWireless identity theft is a relatively new technique for gathering individuals' personal information from RF-enabled cards carried on a person in their access control, credit, debit, or government issued identification cards. Each of these cards carry a radio frequency identification chip which responds to certain radio frequencies. When these \"tags\" come into contact with radio waves, they respond with a slightly altered signal. The response can contain encoded personally identifying information, including the card holder's name, address, Social Security Number, phone number, and pertinent account or employee information.Upon capturing (or \u2018harvesting\u2019) this data, one is then able to program other cards to respond in an identical fashion (\u2018cloning\u2019). Many websites are dedicated to teaching people how to do this, as well as supplying the necessary equipment and software.The financial industrial complex is migrating from the use of magnetic stripes on debit and credit cards which technically require a swipe through a magnetic card swipe reader.  The number of transactions per minute can be increased, and more transactions can be processed in a shorter time, therefore making for arguably shorter lines at the cashier.\n\n== Controversies ==\nAcademic researchers and \u2018White-Hat\u2019 hackers have analysed and documented the covert theft of RFID credit card information and been met with both denials and criticisms from RFID card-issuing agencies. Nevertheless, after public disclosure of information that could be stolen by low-cost jerry-rigged detectors which were used to scan cards in mailing envelopes (and in other studies also even via drive-by data attacks), the design of security features on various cards was upgraded to remove card owners\u2019 names and other data.  Additionally, a number of completely unencrypted card designs were converted to encrypted data systems.\n\n\n*** RSA report ***\nThe issues raised in a 2006 report were of importance due to the tens of millions of cards that have already been issued. Credit and debit card data could be stolen via special low cost radio scanners without the cards being physically touched or removed from their owner's pocket, purse or carry bag. Among the findings of the 2006 research study \"Vulnerabilities in First-Generation RFID-Enabled Credit Cards\", and in reports by other white-hat hackers:\n\nsome scanned credit cards revealed their owners\u2019 names, card numbers and expiration dates;\nthat the short maximum scanning distance of the cards and tags (normally measured in inches or centimetres) could be extended to several feet via technological modifications;\nthat even without range-extension technologies, Black Hatters walking through crowded venues or delivering fliers could easily capture card data from other individuals and from mail envelopes;\nthat security experts who reviewed the study findings were startled by the breaches of privacy of the study (conducted in 2006);\nthat other e-systems, such as Exxon Mobil\u2019s Speedpass keychain payment device, used weak encryption methods which could be compromised by a half-hour or so of computing time;\nthat some cards\u2019 scanned stolen data quickly yielded actual credit card numbers and didn't use data tokens;\nthat data illicitly obtained from some cards was successfully used to trick a regular commercial card-reader (used by the study group) into accepting purchase transactions from an online store that didn't require the entry of the cards\u2019 validation codes;\nthat while higher level security systems have been and continue to be developed, and are available for RFID credit cards, it is only the actual banks which decide how much security they want to deploy for their cardholders;\nthat every one of the 20 cards tested in the study was defeated by at least one of the attacks the researchers deployed;\nanother related security threat concerned a different product: new government issued ePassports (passports that now incorporate RFID tags similar to credit and debit cards). The RFID tags in ePassports are also subject to data theft and cloning attacks. The United States government has been issuing ePassports since 2006.In a related issue, privacy groups and individuals have also raised \"Big Brother\" concerns, where there is a threat to individuals from their aggregated information and even tracking of their movements by either card issuing agencies, other third party entities, and even by governments. Industry observers have stated that \u2018...RFID certainly has the potential to be the most invasive consumer technology ever.\u2019Credit card issuing agencies have issued denial statements regarding wireless identity theft or fraud and provided marketing information that either directly criticized or implied that:\n\nbeyond the card data itself, other data protection and anti-fraud measures in their payment systems are in place to protect consumers;\nthe academic study conducted in 2006 used a sample of only 20 RFID cards, and was not accurately representative of the general RFID marketplace which generally used higher security than the tested cards;\nunencrypted plain text information on the cards was \"...basically useless\" (by itself), since financial transactions they were tied to used verifications systems with powerful encryption technologies;\neven if consumers were victims of RFID credit card fraud or identity theft, they would not be financially liable for such credit card fraud (a marketing strategy that ignores the other serious consequences to card holders after they've been associated with fraudulent transactions or have their identity stolen);After the release of the study results, all of the credit card companies contacted during the New York Times' investigative report said that they were removing card holder names from the data being transmitted with their new second generation RFID cards.\n\n\n*** Compromised U.S. identification documents ***\nCertain official identification documents issued by the U.S. government, U.S. Passports, Passport Cards, and also enhanced driver's licenses issued by States of New York and Washington, contain RFID chips for the purpose of assisting those policing the U.S. border. Various security issues have been identified with their use, including the ability of black hats to harvest their identifier numbers at a distance and apply them to blank counterfeit documents and cards, thus assuming those people's identifiers.Various issues and potential issues with their use have been identified, including privacy concerns. Although the RFID identifier number associated with each document is not supposed to include personal identification information, \"...numbers evolve over time, and uses evolve over time, and eventually these things can reveal more information than we initially expect\" stated Tadayoshi Kohno, an assistant professor of computer science, at University of Washington who participated in a study of such government issued documents.\n\nWhat is the potential privacy threat posed by RFID-enabled credit cards, even if higher level security systems are developed and available?",

Among the findings of the 2006 research study \"Vulnerabilities in First-Generation RFID-Enabled Credit Cards\", and in reports by other white-hat hackers:\n\nsome scanned credit cards revealed their owners\u2019 names, card numbers and expiration dates;\nthat the short maximum scanning distance of the cards and tags (normally measured in inches or centimetres) could be extended to several feet via technological modifications;\nthat even without range-extension technologies, Black Hatters walking through crowded venues or delivering fliers could easily capture card data from other individuals and from mail envelopes;\nthat security experts who reviewed the study findings were startled by the breaches of privacy of the study (conducted in 2006);\nthat other e-systems, such as Exxon Mobil\u2019s Speedpass keychain payment device, used weak encryption methods which could be compromised by a half-hour or so of computing time;\nthat some cards\u2019 scanned stolen data quickly yielded actual credit card numbers and didn't use data tokens;\nthat data illicitly obtained from some cards was successfully used to trick a regular commercial card-reader (used by the study group) into accepting purchase transactions from an online store that didn't require the entry of the cards\u2019 validation codes;\nthat while higher level security systems have been and continue to be developed, and are available for RFID credit cards, it is only the actual banks which decide how much security they want to deploy for their cardholders;\nthat every one of the 20 cards tested in the study was defeated by at least one of the attacks the researchers deployed;\nanother related security threat concerned a different product: new government issued ePassports (passports that now incorporate RFID tags similar to credit and debit cards). The RFID tags in ePassports are also subject to data theft and cloning attacks. The United States government has been issuing ePassports since 2006.In a related issue, privacy groups and individuals have also raised \"Big Brother\" concerns, where there is a threat to individuals from their aggregated information and even tracking of their movements by either card issuing agencies, other third party entities, and even by governments. Industry observers have stated that \u2018...RFID certainly has the potential to be the most invasive consumer technology ever.\u2019Credit card issuing agencies have issued denial statements regarding wireless identity theft or fraud and provided marketing information that either directly criticized or implied that:\n\nbeyond the card data itself, other data protection and anti-fraud measures in their payment systems are in place to protect consumers;\nthe academic study conducted in 2006 used a sample of only 20 RFID cards, and was not accurately representative of the general RFID marketplace which generally used higher security than the tested cards;\nunencrypted plain text information on the cards was \"...basically useless\" (by itself), since financial transactions they were tied to used verifications systems with powerful encryption technologies;\neven if consumers were victims of RFID credit card fraud or identity theft, they would not be financially liable for such credit card fraud (a marketing strategy that ignores the other serious consequences to card holders after they've been associated with fraudulent transactions or have their identity stolen);After the release of the study results, all of the credit card companies contacted during the New York Times' investigative report said that they were removing card holder names from the data being transmitted with their new second generation RFID cards.\n\n\n*** Compromised U.S. identification documents ***\nCertain official identification documents issued by the U.S. government, U.S. Passports, Passport Cards, and also enhanced driver's licenses issued by States of New York and Washington, contain RFID chips for the purpose of assisting those policing the U.S. border. Various security issues have been identified with their use, including the ability of black hats to harvest their identifier numbers at a distance and apply them to blank counterfeit documents and cards, thus assuming those people's identifiers.Various issues and potential issues with their use have been identified, including privacy concerns. Although the RFID identifier number associated with each document is not supposed to include personal identification information, \"...numbers evolve over time, and uses evolve over time, and eventually these things can reveal more information than we initially expect\" stated Tadayoshi Kohno, an assistant professor of computer science, at University of Washington who participated in a study of such government issued documents."

    "instruction": "Block cipher\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, a block cipher is a deterministic algorithm operating on fixed-length groups of bits, called blocks. Block ciphers are specified elementary components in the design of many cryptographic protocols and are widely used to encrypt large amounts of data, including in data exchange protocols. A block cipher uses blocks as an unvarying transformation.\nEven a secure block cipher is suitable for the encryption of only a single block of data at a time, using a fixed key. A multitude of modes of operation has been designed to allow their repeated use in a secure way to achieve the security goals of confidentiality and authenticity. However, block ciphers may also feature as building blocks in other cryptographic protocols, such as universal hash functions and pseudorandom number generators.\n\n== Definition ==\nA block cipher consists of two paired algorithms, one for encryption, E, and the other for decryption, D. Both algorithms accept two inputs: an input block of size n bits and a key of size k bits; and both yield an n-bit output block. The decryption algorithm D is defined to be the inverse function of encryption, i.e., D\n\n== Design ==\n\n\n*** Iterated block ciphers ***\nMost block cipher algorithms are classified as iterated block ciphers which means that they transform fixed-size blocks of plaintext into identically sized blocks of ciphertext, via the repeated application of an invertible transformation known as the round function, with each iteration referred to as a round.Usually, the round function R takes different round keys Ki as a second input, which is derived from the original key:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          M\n          \n            i\n\n== Modes of operation ==\n\nA block cipher by itself allows encryption only of a single data block of the cipher's block length. For a variable-length message, the data must first be partitioned into separate cipher blocks. In the simplest case, known as electronic codebook (ECB) mode, a message is first split into separate blocks of the cipher's block size (possibly extending the last block with padding bits), and then each block is encrypted and decrypted independently. However, such a naive method is generally insecure because equal plaintext blocks will always generate equal ciphertext blocks (for the same key), so patterns in the plaintext message become evident in the ciphertext output.To overcome this limitation, several so-called block cipher modes of operation have been designed and specified in national recommendations such as NIST 800-38A and BSI TR-02102 and international standards such as ISO/IEC 10116. The general concept is to use randomization of the plaintext data based on an additional input value, frequently called an initialization vector, to create what is termed probabilistic encryption. In the popular cipher block chaining (CBC) mode, for encryption to be secure the initialization vector passed along with the plaintext message must be a random or pseudo-random value, which is added in an exclusive-or manner to the first plaintext block before it is encrypted. The resultant ciphertext block is then used as the new initialization vector for the next plaintext block. In the cipher feedback (CFB) mode, which emulates a self-synchronizing stream cipher, the initialization vector is first encrypted and then added to the plaintext block. The output feedback (OFB) mode repeatedly encrypts the initialization vector to create a key stream for the emulation of a synchronous stream cipher. The newer counter (CTR) mode similarly creates a key stream, but has the advantage of only needing unique and not (pseudo-)random values as initialization vectors; the needed randomness is derived internally by using the initialization vector as a block counter and encrypting this counter for each block.From a security-theoretic point of view, modes of operation must provide what is known as semantic security. Informally, it means that given some ciphertext under an unknown key one cannot practically derive any information from the ciphertext (other than the length of the message) over what one would have known without seeing the ciphertext. It has been shown that all of the modes discussed above, with the exception of the ECB mode, provide this property under so-called chosen plaintext attacks.\n\n== Padding ==\n\nSome modes such as the CBC mode only operate on complete plaintext blocks. Simply extending the last block of a message with zero bits is insufficient since it does not allow a receiver to easily distinguish messages that differ only in the number of padding bits. More importantly, such a simple solution gives rise to very efficient padding oracle attacks. A suitable padding scheme is therefore needed to extend the last plaintext block to the cipher's block size. While many popular schemes described in standards and in the literature have been shown to be vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, a solution that adds a one-bit and then extends the last block with zero-bits, standardized as \"padding method 2\" in ISO/IEC 9797-1, has been proven secure against these attacks.\n\n== Cryptanalysis ==\n\n\n*** Brute-force attacks ***\n This property results in the cipher's security degrading quadratically, and needs to be taken into account when selecting a block size. There is a trade-off though as large block sizes can result in the algorithm becoming inefficient to operate. Earlier block ciphers such as the DES have typically selected a 64-bit block size, while newer designs such as the AES support block sizes of 128 bits or more, with some ciphers supporting a range of different block sizes.\n\n\n*** Differential cryptanalysis ***\n\n\n*** Linear cryptanalysis ***\n\nA linear cryptanalysis is a form of cryptanalysis based on finding affine approximations to the action of a cipher. Linear cryptanalysis is one of the two most widely used attacks on block ciphers; the other being differential cryptanalysis.The discovery is attributed to Mitsuru Matsui, who first applied the technique to the FEAL cipher (Matsui and Yamagishi, 1992).\n\n\n*** Integral cryptanalysis ***\n\nIntegral cryptanalysis is a cryptanalytic attack that is particularly applicable to block ciphers based on substitution\u2013permutation networks. Unlike differential cryptanalysis, which uses pairs of chosen plaintexts with a fixed XOR difference, integral cryptanalysis uses sets or even multisets of chosen plaintexts of which part is held constant and another part varies through all possibilities. For example, an attack might use 256 chosen plaintexts that have all but 8 of their bits the same, but all differ in those 8 bits. Such a set necessarily has an XOR sum of 0, and the XOR sums of the corresponding sets of ciphertexts provide information about the cipher's operation. This contrast between the differences between pairs of texts and the sums of larger sets of texts inspired the name \"integral cryptanalysis\", borrowing the terminology of calculus.\n\n\n*** Other techniques ***\n\nIn addition to linear and differential cryptanalysis, there is a growing catalog of attacks: truncated differential cryptanalysis, partial differential cryptanalysis, integral cryptanalysis, which encompasses square and integral attacks, slide attacks, boomerang attacks, the XSL attack, impossible differential cryptanalysis, and algebraic attacks. For a new block cipher design to have any credibility, it must demonstrate evidence of security against known attacks.\n\n== Provable security ==\nWhen a block cipher is used in a given mode of operation, the resulting algorithm should ideally be about as secure as the block cipher itself. ECB (discussed above) emphatically lacks this property: regardless of how secure the underlying block cipher is, ECB mode can easily be attacked. On the other hand, CBC mode can be proven to be secure under the assumption that the underlying block cipher is likewise secure. Note, however, that making statements like this requires formal mathematical definitions for what it means for an encryption algorithm or a block cipher to \"be secure\". This section describes two common notions for what properties a block cipher should have. Each corresponds to a mathematical model that can be used to prove properties of higher-level algorithms, such as CBC.\nThis general approach to cryptography \u2013 proving higher-level algorithms (such as CBC) are secure under explicitly stated assumptions regarding their components (such as a block cipher) \u2013 is known as provable security.\n\n\n*** Standard model ***\n\nInformally, a block cipher is secure in the standard model if an attacker cannot tell the difference between the block cipher (equipped with a random key) and a random permutation.\nTo be a bit more precise, let E be an n-bit block cipher. We imagine the following game:\n\nThe person running the game flips a coin.\nIf the coin lands on heads, he chooses a random key K and defines the function f\n\n== Practical evaluation ==\nBlock ciphers may be evaluated according to multiple criteria in practice. Common factors include:\nKey parameters, such as its key size and block size, both of which provide an upper bound on the security of the cipher.\nThe estimated security level, which is based on the confidence gained in the block cipher design after it has largely withstood major efforts in cryptanalysis over time, the design's mathematical soundness, and the existence of practical or certificational attacks.\nThe cipher's complexity and its suitability for implementation in hardware or software. Hardware implementations may measure the complexity in terms of gate count or energy consumption, which are important parameters for resource-constrained devices.\nThe cipher's performance in terms of processing throughput on various platforms, including its memory requirements.\nThe cost of the cipher refers to licensing requirements that may apply due to intellectual property rights.\nThe flexibility of the cipher includes its ability to support multiple key sizes and block lengths.\n\n== Notable block ciphers ==\n\n\n*** Lucifer / DES ***\n\nLucifer is generally considered to be the first civilian block cipher, developed at IBM in the 1970s based on work done by Horst Feistel. A revised version of the algorithm was adopted as a U.S. government Federal Information Processing Standard: FIPS PUB 46 Data Encryption Standard (DES). It was chosen by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards (NBS) after a public invitation for submissions and some internal changes by NBS (and, potentially, the NSA). DES was publicly released in 1976 and has been widely used.DES was designed to, among other things, resist a certain cryptanalytic attack known to the NSA and rediscovered by IBM, though unknown publicly until rediscovered again and published by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir in the late 1980s. The technique is called differential cryptanalysis and remains one of the few general attacks against block ciphers; linear cryptanalysis is another but may have been unknown even to the NSA, prior to its publication by Mitsuru Matsui. DES prompted a large amount of other work and publications in cryptography and cryptanalysis in the open community and it inspired many new cipher designs.DES has a block size of 64 bits and a key size of 56 bits. 64-bit blocks became common in block cipher designs after DES. Key length depended on several factors, including government regulation. Many observers in the 1970s commented that the 56-bit key length used for DES was too short. As time went on, its inadequacy became apparent, especially after a special-purpose machine designed to break DES was demonstrated in 1998 by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. An extension to DES, Triple DES, triple-encrypts each block with either two independent keys (112-bit key and 80-bit security) or three independent keys (168-bit key and 112-bit security). It was widely adopted as a replacement. As of 2011, the three-key version is still considered secure, though the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards no longer permit the use of the two-key version in new applications, due to its 80-bit security level.\n\n\n*** IDEA ***\nThe International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) is a block cipher designed by James Massey of ETH Zurich and Xuejia Lai; it was first described in 1991, as an intended replacement for DES.\nIDEA operates on 64-bit blocks using a 128-bit key and consists of a series of eight identical transformations (a round) and an output transformation (the half-round). The processes for encryption and decryption are similar. IDEA derives much of its security by interleaving operations from different groups \u2013 modular addition and multiplication, and bitwise exclusive or (XOR) \u2013 which are algebraically \"incompatible\" in some sense.\nThe designers analysed IDEA to measure its strength against differential cryptanalysis and concluded that it is immune under certain assumptions. No successful linear or algebraic weaknesses have been reported. As of 2012, the best attack which applies to all keys can break a full 8.5-round IDEA using a narrow-bicliques attack about four times faster than brute force.\n\n\n*** RC5 ***\n\nRC5 is a block cipher designed by Ronald Rivest in 1994 which, unlike many other ciphers, has a variable block size (32, 64, or 128 bits), key size (0 to 2040 bits), and a number of rounds (0 to 255). The original suggested choice of parameters was a block size of 64 bits, a 128-bit key, and 12 rounds.\nA key feature of RC5 is the use of data-dependent rotations; one of the goals of RC5 was to prompt the study and evaluation of such operations as a cryptographic primitive. RC5 also consists of a number of modular additions and XORs. The general structure of the algorithm is a Feistel-like a network. The encryption and decryption routines can be specified in a few lines of code. The key schedule, however, is more complex, expanding the key using an essentially one-way function with the binary expansions of both e and the golden ratio as sources of \"nothing up my sleeve numbers\". The tantalizing simplicity of the algorithm together with the novelty of the data-dependent rotations has made RC5 an attractive object of study for cryptanalysts.\n12-round RC5 (with 64-bit blocks) is susceptible to a differential attack using 244 chosen plaintexts. 18\u201320 rounds are suggested as sufficient protection.\n\n\n*** Rijndael / AES ***\n\nThe Rijndael cipher developed by Belgian cryptographers, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen was one of the competing designs to replace DES. It won the 5-year public competition to become the AES, (Advanced Encryption Standard).\nAdopted by NIST in 2001, AES has a fixed block size of 128 bits and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits, whereas Rijndael can be specified with block and key sizes in any multiple of 32 bits, with a minimum of 128 bits. The block size has a maximum of 256 bits, but the key size has no theoretical maximum. AES operates on a 4\u00d74 column-major order matrix of bytes, termed the state (versions of Rijndael with a larger block size have additional columns in the state).\n\n\n*** Blowfish ***\n\nBlowfish is a block cipher, designed in 1993 by Bruce Schneier and included in a large number of cipher suites and encryption products. Blowfish has a 64-bit block size and a variable key length from 1 bit up to 448 bits. It is a 16-round Feistel cipher and uses large key-dependent S-boxes. Notable features of the design include the key-dependent S-boxes and a highly complex key schedule.\nIt was designed as a general-purpose algorithm, intended as an alternative to the aging DES and free of the problems and constraints associated with other algorithms. At the time Blowfish was released, many other designs were proprietary, encumbered by patents, or were commercial/government secrets. Schneier has stated that \"Blowfish is unpatented, and will remain so in all countries. The algorithm is hereby placed in the public domain, and can be freely used by anyone.\" The same applies to Twofish, a successor algorithm from Schneier.\n\n== Generalizations ==\n\n\n*** Tweakable block ciphers ***\nM. Liskov, R. Rivest, and D. Wagner have described a generalized version of block ciphers called \"tweakable\" block ciphers. A tweakable block cipher accepts a second input called the tweak along with its usual plaintext or ciphertext input. The tweak, along with the key, selects the permutation computed by the cipher. If changing tweaks is sufficiently lightweight (compared with a usually fairly expensive key setup operation), then some interesting new operation modes become possible. The disk encryption theory article describes some of these modes.\n\n\n*** Format-preserving encryption ***\n\nBlock ciphers traditionally work over a binary alphabet. That is, both the input and the output are binary strings, consisting of n zeroes and ones. In some situations, however, one may wish to have a block cipher that works over some other alphabet; for example, encrypting 16-digit credit card numbers in such a way that the ciphertext is also a 16-digit number might facilitate adding an encryption layer to legacy software. This is an example of format-preserving encryption. More generally, format-preserving encryption requires a keyed permutation on some finite language. This makes format-preserving encryption schemes a natural generalization of (tweakable) block ciphers. In contrast, traditional encryption schemes, such as CBC, are not permutations because the same plaintext can encrypt multiple different ciphertexts, even when using a fixed key.\n\n== Relation to other cryptographic primitives ==\nBlock ciphers can be used to build other cryptographic primitives, such as those below. For these other primitives to be cryptographically secure, care has to be taken to build them the right way.\n\nStream ciphers can be built using block ciphers. OFB mode and CTR mode are block modes that turn a block cipher into a stream cipher.\nCryptographic hash functions can be built using block ciphers. See the one-way compression function for descriptions of several such methods. The methods resemble the block cipher modes of operation usually used for encryption.\nCryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs) can be built using block ciphers.\nSecure pseudorandom permutations of arbitrarily sized finite sets can be constructed with block ciphers; see Format-Preserving Encryption.\nA publicly known unpredictable permutation combined with key whitening is enough to construct a block cipher -- such as the single-key Even-Mansour cipher, perhaps the simplest possible provably secure block cipher.\nMessage authentication codes (MACs) are often built from block ciphers. CBC-MAC, OMAC, and PMAC are such MACs.\nAuthenticated encryption is also built from block ciphers. It means to both encrypt and MAC at the same time. That is to both provide confidentiality and authentication. CCM, EAX, GCM, and OCB are such authenticated encryption modes.Just as block ciphers can be used to build hash functions, like SHA-1 and SHA-2 are based on block ciphers which are also used independently as SHACAL, hash functions can be used to build block ciphers. Examples of such block ciphers are BEAR and LION.\nRead the text above and answer this question: What is differential cryptanalysis and how does it apply to block ciphers?",

Block ciphers are specified elementary components in the design of many cryptographic protocols and are widely used to encrypt large amounts of data, including in data exchange protocols. A block cipher uses blocks as an unvarying transformation.\nEven a secure block cipher is suitable for the encryption of only a single block of data at a time, using a fixed key. A multitude of modes of operation has been designed to allow their repeated use in a secure way to achieve the security goals of confidentiality and authenticity. However, block ciphers may also feature as building blocks in other cryptographic protocols, such as universal hash functions and pseudorandom number generators.\n\n== Definition ==\nA block cipher consists of two paired algorithms, one for encryption, E, and the other for decryption, D. Both algorithms accept two inputs: an input block of size n bits and a key of size k bits; and both yield an n-bit output block. The decryption algorithm D is defined to be the inverse function of encryption, i.e., D\n\n== Design ==\n\n\n*** Iterated block ciphers ***\nMost block cipher algorithms are classified as iterated block ciphers which means that they transform fixed-size blocks of plaintext into identically sized blocks of ciphertext, via the repeated application of an invertible transformation known as the round function, with each iteration referred to as a round.Usually, the round function R takes different round keys Ki as a second input, which is derived from the original key:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          M\n          \n            i\n\n== Modes of operation ==\n\nA block cipher by itself allows encryption only of a single data block of the cipher's block length. For a variable-length message, the data must first be partitioned into separate cipher blocks. In the simplest case, known as electronic codebook (ECB) mode, a message is first split into separate blocks of the cipher's block size (possibly extending the last block with padding bits), and then each block is encrypted and decrypted independently. However, such a naive method is generally insecure because equal plaintext blocks will always generate equal ciphertext blocks (for the same key), so patterns in the plaintext message become evident in the ciphertext output.To overcome this limitation, several so-called block cipher modes of operation have been designed and specified in national recommendations such as NIST 800-38A and BSI TR-02102 and international standards such as ISO/IEC 10116. The general concept is to use randomization of the plaintext data based on an additional input value, frequently called an initialization vector, to create what is termed probabilistic encryption. In the popular cipher block chaining (CBC) mode, for encryption to be secure the initialization vector passed along with the plaintext message must be a random or pseudo-random value, which is added in an exclusive-or manner to the first plaintext block before it is encrypted. The resultant ciphertext block is then used as the new initialization vector for the next plaintext block. In the cipher feedback (CFB) mode, which emulates a self-synchronizing stream cipher, the initialization vector is first encrypted and then added to the plaintext block. The output feedback (OFB) mode repeatedly encrypts the initialization vector to create a key stream for the emulation of a synchronous stream cipher. The newer counter (CTR) mode similarly creates a key stream, but has the advantage of only needing unique and not (pseudo-)random values as initialization vectors; the needed randomness is derived internally by using the initialization vector as a block counter and encrypting this counter for each block.From a security-theoretic point of view, modes of operation must provide what is known as semantic security. Informally, it means that given some ciphertext under an unknown key one cannot practically derive any information from the ciphertext (other than the length of the message) over what one would have known without seeing the ciphertext. It has been shown that all of the modes discussed above, with the exception of the ECB mode, provide this property under so-called chosen plaintext attacks.\n\n== Padding ==\n\nSome modes such as the CBC mode only operate on complete plaintext blocks. Simply extending the last block of a message with zero bits is insufficient since it does not allow a receiver to easily distinguish messages that differ only in the number of padding bits. More importantly, such a simple solution gives rise to very efficient padding oracle attacks. A suitable padding scheme is therefore needed to extend the last plaintext block to the cipher's block size. While many popular schemes described in standards and in the literature have been shown to be vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, a solution that adds a one-bit and then extends the last block with zero-bits, standardized as \"padding method 2\" in ISO/IEC 9797-1, has been proven secure against these attacks.\n\n== Cryptanalysis ==\n\n\n*** Brute-force attacks ***\n This property results in the cipher's security degrading quadratically, and needs to be taken into account when selecting a block size. There is a trade-off though as large block sizes can result in the algorithm becoming inefficient to operate. Earlier block ciphers such as the DES have typically selected a 64-bit block size, while newer designs such as the AES support block sizes of 128 bits or more, with some ciphers supporting a range of different block sizes.\n\n\n*** Differential cryptanalysis ***\n\n\n*** Linear cryptanalysis ***\n\nA linear cryptanalysis is a form of cryptanalysis based on finding affine approximations to the action of a cipher. Linear cryptanalysis is one of the two most widely used attacks on block ciphers; the other being differential cryptanalysis.The discovery is attributed to Mitsuru Matsui, who first applied the technique to the FEAL cipher (Matsui and Yamagishi, 1992).\n\n\n*** Integral cryptanalysis ***\n\nIntegral cryptanalysis is a cryptanalytic attack that is particularly applicable to block ciphers based on substitution\u2013permutation networks. Unlike differential cryptanalysis, which uses pairs of chosen plaintexts with a fixed XOR difference, integral cryptanalysis uses sets or even multisets of chosen plaintexts of which part is held constant and another part varies through all possibilities. For example, an attack might use 256 chosen plaintexts that have all but 8 of their bits the same, but all differ in those 8 bits. Such a set necessarily has an XOR sum of 0, and the XOR sums of the corresponding sets of ciphertexts provide information about the cipher's operation. This contrast between the differences between pairs of texts and the sums of larger sets of texts inspired the name \"integral cryptanalysis\", borrowing the terminology of calculus.\n\n\n*** Other techniques ***\n\nIn addition to linear and differential cryptanalysis, there is a growing catalog of attacks: truncated differential cryptanalysis, partial differential cryptanalysis, integral cryptanalysis, which encompasses square and integral attacks, slide attacks, boomerang attacks, the XSL attack, impossible differential cryptanalysis, and algebraic attacks.

    "instruction": "LulzSec\n\n==Introduction==\nLulzSec (a contraction for Lulz Security) was a black hat computer hacking group that claimed responsibility for several high profile attacks, including the compromise of user accounts from PlayStation Network in 2011. The group also claimed responsibility for taking the CIA website offline. Some security professionals have commented that LulzSec has drawn attention to insecure systems and the dangers of password reuse. It has gained attention due to its high profile targets and the sarcastic messages it has posted in the aftermath of its attacks. One of the founders of LulzSec was computer security specialist Hector Monsegur, who used the online moniker Sabu. He later helped law enforcement track down other members of the organization as part of a plea deal. At least four associates of LulzSec were arrested in March 2012 as part of this investigation. Prior, British authorities had announced the arrests of two teenagers they alleged were LulzSec members, going by the pseudonyms T-flow and Topiary.\nAt just after midnight (BST, UT+01) on 26 June 2011, LulzSec released a \"50 days of lulz\" statement, which they claimed to be their final release, confirming that LulzSec consisted of six members, and that their website was to be shut down. The sudden disbandment of the group was unexpected. Their final release included accounts and passwords from many different sources. Despite claims of retirement, the group committed another hack against newspapers owned by News Corporation on 18 July, defacing them with false reports regarding the death of Rupert Murdoch. The group had also helped launch Operation AntiSec, a joint effort involving LulzSec, Anonymous, and other hackers.\n\n== Background and history ==\nA federal indictment against members contends that, prior to forming the hacking collective known as LulzSec, the six members were all part of another collective called Internet Feds, a group in rivalry with Anonymous. Under this name, the group attacked websites belonging to Fine Gael, HBGary, and Fox Broadcasting Company. This includes the alleged incident in which e-mail messages were stolen from HBGary accounts. In May 2011, following the publicity surrounding the HBGary hacks, six members of Internet Feds founded the group LulzSec.The group's first recorded attack was against Fox.com's website, though they still may have been using the name Internet Feds at the time. It claimed responsibility for leaking information, including passwords, altering several employees' LinkedIn profiles, and leaking a database of X Factor contestants containing contact information of 73,000 contestants. They claimed to do so because the rapper Common had been referred to as \"vile\" on air.LulzSec drew its name from the neologism \"lulz\", (from lol), \"laughing out loud\", which represents laughter, and \"Sec\", short for \"Security\". The Wall Street Journal characterized its attacks as closer to Internet pranks than serious cyber-warfare, while the group itself claimed to possess the capability of stronger attacks. It gained attention in part due to its brazen claims of responsibility and lighthearted taunting of corporations that were hacked. It frequently referred to Internet memes when defacing websites. The group emerged in May 2011, and successfully attacked websites of several major corporations. It specialized in finding websites with poor security, stealing and posting information from them online. It used well-known straightforward methods, such as SQL injection, to attack its target websites. Several media sources have described their tactics as grey hat hacking. Members of the group may have been involved in a previous attack against the security firm HBGary.The group used the motto \"Laughing at your security since 2011!\" and its website, created in June 2011, played the theme from The Love Boat. It announced its exploits via Twitter and its own website, often accompanied with lighthearted ASCII art drawings of boats. Its website also included a bitcoin donation link to help fund its activities. Ian Paul of PC World wrote that, \"As its name suggests, LulzSec claims to be interested in mocking and embarrassing companies by exposing security flaws rather than stealing data for criminal purposes.\" The group was also critical of white hat hackers, claiming that many of them have been corrupted by their employers.Some in the security community contended that the group raised awareness of the widespread lack of effective security against hackers. They were credited with inspiring LulzRaft, a group implicated in several high-profile website hacks in Canada.In June 2011 the group took suggestions for sites to hit with denial-of-service attacks. The group redirected telephone numbers to different customer support lines, including the line for World of Warcraft, magnets.com, and the FBI Detroit office. The group claimed this sent five to 20 calls per second to these sources, overwhelming their support officers. On 24 June 2011, The Guardian released leaked logs of one of the group's IRC chats, revealing that the core group was a small group of hackers with a leader Sabu who exercised large control over the group's activities. It also revealed that the group had connections with Anonymous, though was not formally affiliated with it. Some LulzSec members had once been prominent Anonymous members, including member Topiary.At just after midnight (UTC) on 26 June 2011, LulzSec released a \"50 days of lulz\" statement, which they claimed to be their final release, confirming that LulzSec consisted of six members, and that their website was to be taken down. The group claimed that they had planned to be active for only fifty days from the beginning.  \"We're not quitting because we're afraid of law enforcement. The press are getting bored of us, and we're getting bored of us,\" a group member said in an interview to the Associated Press. Members of the group were reported to have joined with Anonymous members to continue the AntiSec operation. However, despite claiming to retire, the group remained in communication as it attacked the websites of British newspapers The Times and The Sun on 18 July, leaving a false story on the death of owner Rupert Murdoch.\n\n== Former members and associates ==\nLulzSec consisted of seven core members. The online handles of these seven were established through various attempts by other hacking groups to release personal information of group members on the internet, leaked IRC logs published by The Guardian, and through confirmation from the group itself.\nSabu \u2013 One of the group's founders, who seemed to act as a kind of leader for the group, Sabu would often decide what targets to attack next and who could participate in these attacks. He may have been part of the Anonymous group that hacked HBGary. Various attempts to release his real identity have claimed that he is an information technology consultant with the strongest hacking skills of the group and knowledge of the Python programming language. It was thought that Sabu was involved in the media outrage cast of 2010 using the skype \"anonymous.sabu\" Sabu was arrested in June 2011 and identified as a 29-year-old unemployed man from New York\u2019s Lower East Side. On 15 August, he pleaded guilty to several hacking charges and agreed to cooperate with the FBI. Over the following seven months he successfully unmasked the other members of the group. Sabu was identified by Backtrace Security as Hector Montsegur on 11 March 2011 in a PDF publication named \"Namshub.\"\nTopiary \u2013 Topiary was also a suspected former member of the Anonymous, where he used to perform media relations, including hacking the website of the Westboro Baptist Church during a live interview. Topiary ran the LulzSec Twitter account on a daily basis; following the announcement of LulzSec's dissolution, he deleted all the posts on his Twitter page, except for one, which stated: \"You cannot arrest an idea\". Police arrested a man from Shetland, United Kingdom suspected of being Topiary on 27 July 2011. The man was later identified as Jake Davis and was charged with five counts, including unauthorized access of a computer and conspiracy. He was indicted on conspiracy charges on 6 March 2012.\nKayla/KMS \u2013 Ryan Ackroyd of London, and another unidentified individual known as \"lol\" or \"Shock.ofgod\" in LulzSec chat logs. Kayla owned a botnet used by the group in their distributed denial-of-service attacks. The botnet is reported to have consisted of about 800,000 infected computer servers. Kayla was involved in several high-profile attacks under the group \"gn0sis\". Kayla also may have participated in the Anonymous operation against HBGary. Kayla reportedly wiretapped 2 CIA agents in an anonymous operation. Kayla was also involved in the 2010 media outrage under the Skype handle \"Pastorhoudaille\". Kayla is suspected of having been something of a deputy to Sabu and to have found the vulnerabilities that allowed LulzSec access to the United States Senate systems. One of the men behind the handle Kayla was identified as Ryan Ackroyd of London, arrested, and indicted on conspiracy charges on 6 March 2012.\nTflow \u2013 (Real name: Mustafa Al-Bassam) The fourth founding member of the group identified in chat logs, attempts to identify him have labelled him a PHP coder, web developer, and performer of scams on PayPal. The group placed him in charge of maintenance and security of the group's website lulzsecurity.com. London Metropolitan Police announced the arrest of a 16-year-old hacker going by the handle Tflow on 19 July 2011.\nAvunit \u2013 He is one of the core seven members of the group, but not a founding member. He left the group after their self-labelled \"Fuck the FBI Friday\".  He was also affiliated with Anonymous AnonOps HQ. Avunit is the only one of the core seven members that has not been identified.\nPwnsauce \u2013 Pwnsauce joined the group around the same time as Avunit and became one of its core members. He was identified as Darren Martyn of Ireland and was indicted on conspiracy charges on 6 March 2012. The Irish national worked as a local chapter leader for the Open Web Application Security Project, resigning one week before his arrest.\nPalladium \u2013 Identified as Donncha O'Cearbhaill of Ireland, he was indicted on conspiracy on 6 March 2012.\nAnarchaos \u2013 Identified as Jeremy Hammond of Chicago, he was arrested on access device fraud and hacking charges.  He was also charged with a hacking attack on the U.S. security company Stratfor in December 2011.  He is said to be a member of Anonymous.\nRyan Cleary, who sometimes used the handle ViraL. Cleary faced a sentence of 32 months in relation to attacks against the US Air Force and others.\n\n== Ideology ==\n\nLulzSec did not appear to hack for financial profit, claiming their main motivation was to have fun by causing mayhem. They did things \"for the lulz\" and focused on the possible comedic and entertainment value of attacking targets. The group occasionally claimed a political message. When they hacked PBS, they stated they did so in retaliation for what they perceived as unfair treatment of WikiLeaks in a Frontline documentary entitled WikiSecrets. A page they inserted on the PBS website included the title \"FREE BRADLEY MANNING. FUCK FRONTLINE!\" The 20 June announcement of \"Operation Anti-Security\" contained justification for attacks on government targets, citing supposed government efforts to \"dominate and control our Internet ocean\" and accusing them of corruption and breaching privacy. The news media most often described them as grey hat hackers.Karim Hijazi, CEO of security company Unveillance, accused the group of blackmailing him by offering not to attack his company or its affiliates in exchange for money. LulzSec responded by claiming that Hijazi offered to pay them to attack his business opponents and that they never intended to take any money from him. LulzSec has denied responsibility for misuse of any of the data they breached and released. Instead, they placed the blame on users who reused passwords on multiple websites and on companies with inadequate security in place.In June 2011, the group released a manifesto outlining why they performed hacks and website takedowns, reiterating that \"we do things just because we find it entertaining\" and that watching the results can be \"priceless\". They also claimed to be drawing attention to computer security flaws and holes. They contended that many other hackers exploit and steal user information without releasing the names publicly or telling people they may possibly have been hacked. LulzSec said that by releasing lists of hacked usernames or informing the public of vulnerable websites, it gave users the opportunity to change names and passwords elsewhere that might otherwise have been exploited, and businesses would be alarmed and would upgrade their security.The group's later attacks have had a more political tone. They claimed to want to expose the \"racist and corrupt nature\" of the military and law enforcement. They have also expressed opposition to the War on Drugs. Lulzsec's Operation Anti-Security was characterized as a protest against government censorship and monitoring of the internet. In a question and answer session with BBC Newsnight, LulzSec member Whirlpool (AKA: Topiary) said, \"Politically motivated ethical hacking is more fulfilling\". He claimed the loosening of copyright laws and the rollback of what he sees as corrupt racial profiling practices as some of the group's goals.\n\n== Initial targets ==\nThe group's first attacks came in May 2011. Their first recorded target was Fox.com, which they retaliated against after they called Common, a rapper and entertainer, \"vile\" on the Fox News Channel. They leaked several passwords, LinkedIn profiles, and the names of 73,000 X Factor contestants. Soon after on 15 May, they released the transaction logs of 3,100 Automated Teller Machines in the United Kingdom. In May 2011, members of Lulz Security gained international attention for hacking the American Public Broadcasting System (PBS) website. They stole user data and posted a fake story on the site which claimed that Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls were still alive and living in New Zealand. In the aftermath of the attack, CNN referred to the responsible group as the \"Lulz Boat\".Lulz Security claimed that some of its hacks, including its attack on PBS, were motivated by a desire to defend WikiLeaks and Chelsea Manning. A Fox News report on the group quoted one commentator, Brandon Pike, who claimed that Lulz Security was affiliated with the hacktivist group Anonymous. Lulz Security claimed that Pike had actually hired it to hack PBS. Pike denied the accusation and claimed it was leveled against him because he said Lulz Security was a splinter of Anonymous.In June 2011, members of the group claimed responsibility for an attack against Sony Pictures that took data that included \"names, passwords, e-mail addresses, home addresses and dates of birth for thousands of people.\" The group claimed that it used a SQL injection attack, and was motivated by Sony's legal action against George Hotz for jailbreaking the PlayStation 3.  The group claimed it would launch an attack that would be the \"beginning of the end\" for Sony. Some of the compromised user information was subsequently used in scams. The group claimed to have compromised over 1,000,000 accounts, though Sony claimed the real number was around 37,500.\n\n== Corporate attacks ==\nLulz Security attempted to hack into Nintendo, but both the group and Nintendo itself report that no particularly valuable information was found by the hackers. LulzSec claimed that it did not mean to harm Nintendo, declaring: \"We're not targeting Nintendo. We like the N64 too much \u2014 we sincerely hope Nintendo plugs the gap.\"On 11 June, reports emerged that LulzSec hacked into and stole user information from the pornography website www.pron.com. They obtained and published around 26,000 e-mail addresses and passwords. Among the information stolen were records of two users who subscribed using email addresses associated with the Malaysian government, three users who subscribed using United States military email addresses and 55 users who LulzSec claimed were administrators of other adult-oriented websites. Following the breach, Facebook locked the accounts of all users who had used the published e-mail addresses, and also blocked new Facebook accounts opened using the leaked e-mail addresses, fearing that users of the site would get hacked after LulzSec encouraged people to try and see if these people used identical user name and password combinations on Facebook as well.LulzSec hacked into the Bethesda Game Studios network and posted information taken from the network onto the Internet, though they refrained from publishing 200,000 compromised accounts. LulzSec posted to Twitter regarding the attack, \"Bethesda, we broke into your site over two months ago. We've had all of your Brink users for weeks, Please fix your junk, thanks!\"On 14 June 2011, LulzSec took down four websites by request of fans as part of their \"Titanic Take-down Tuesday\". These websites were Minecraft, League of Legends, The Escapist, and IT security company FinFisher. They also attacked the login servers of the massively multiplayer online game EVE Online, which also disabled the game's front-facing website, and the League of Legends login servers. Most of the takedowns were performed with distributed denial-of-service attacks. On 15 June, LulzSec took down the main server of S2 Games' Heroes of Newerth as another phone request. They claimed, \"Heroes of Newerth master login server is down. They need some treatment. Also, DotA is better.\"On 16 June, LulzSec posted a random assortment of 62,000 emails and passwords to MediaFire. LulzSec stated they released this in return for supporters flooding the 4chan /b/ board. The group did not say what websites the combinations were for and encouraged followers to plug them into various sites until they gained access to an account. Some reported gaining access to Facebook accounts and changing images to sexual content and others to using the Amazon.com accounts of others to purchase several books. Writerspace.com, a literary website, later admitted that the addresses and passwords came from users of their site.\n\n== Government-focused activities ==\nLulzSec claimed to have hacked local InfraGard chapter sites, a non-profit organization affiliated with the FBI. The group leaked some of InfraGard member e-mails and a database of local users. The group defaced the website posting the following message, \"LET IT FLOW YOU STUPID FBI BATTLESHIPS\", accompanied with a video. LulzSec posted:\n\nIt has come to our unfortunate attention that NATO and our good friend Barrack Osama-Llama 24th-century Obama [sic] have recently upped the stakes with regard to hacking. They now treat hacking as an act of war. So, we just hacked an FBI affiliated website (Infragard, specifically the Atlanta chapter) and leaked its user base. We also took complete control over the site and defaced it[.]\nOn 9 June, LulzSec sent an email to the administrators of the British National Health Service, informing them of a security vulnerability discovered in NHS systems. LulzSec stated that they did not intend to exploit this vulnerability, saying in the email that \"We mean you no harm and only want to help you fix your tech issues.\"On 13 June, LulzSec released the e-mails and passwords of a number of users of senate.gov, the website of the United States Senate. The information released also included the root directory of parts of the website. LulzSec stated, \"This is a small, just-for-kicks release of some internal data from senate.gov \u2013 is this an act of war, gentlemen? Problem?\" referencing a recent statement by the Pentagon that some cyberattacks could be considered an act of war. No highly sensitive information appears in the release.On 15 June, LulzSec launched an attack on CIA.gov, the public website of the United States Central Intelligence Agency, taking the website offline with a distributed denial-of-service attack. The website was down from 5:48 pm to 8:00 pm eastern time.On 2 December, an offshoot of LulzSec calling itself LulzSec Portugal, attacked several sites related to the government of Portugal. The websites for the Bank of Portugal, the Assembly of the Republic, and the Ministry of Economy, Innovation and Development all became unavailable for a few hours.\n\n== Operation Anti-Security ==\n\nOn 20 June, the group announced it had teamed up with Anonymous for \"Operation Anti-Security\". They encouraged supporters to steal and publish classified government information from any source while leaving the term \"AntiSec\" as evidence of their intrusion. Also listed as potential targets were major banks. USA Today characterized the operation as an open declaration of cyberwarfare against big government and corporations. Their first target of the operation was the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), a national law enforcement agency of the United Kingdom. LulzSec claimed to have taken the website offline at about 11 am EST on 20 June 2011, though it only remained down for a few minutes. While the attack appeared to be a DDoS attack, LulzSec tweeted that actual hacking was taking place \"behind the scenes\". At about 6:10 pm EST on 20 June, SOCA's website went down yet again. SOCA's website was back online sometime between 20 and 21 June. The website of the local district government of Jianhua District in Qiqihar, China, was also knocked offline. Early in the morning on 22 June, it was revealed that LulzSec's \"Brazilian unit\" had taken down two Brazilian government websites, brasil.gov.br and presidencia.gov.br. They also brought down the website of Brazilian energy company Petrobras.On 20 June, two members on the \"Lulz Boat\" reportedly leaked logs that LulzSec was going to leak on 21 June. They also claimed that the two had leaked information that aided authorities in locating and arresting Ryan Cleary, a man loosely affiliated with the group. LulzSec posted various personal information about the two on Pastebin including IP addresses and physical addresses. Both had been involved with cyber-crimes in the past, and one had been involved with hacking the game Deus Ex.After LulzSec encouragement, some began tagging public locations with physical graffiti reading \"Antisec\" as part of the operation. Numerous beachfronts in Mission Beach, San Diego were vandalized with the phrase. Some local news organizations mistook the graffiti in Mission Beach as signs of the Antisec Movement. Many commenters on the local news websites corrected this.On 23 June, LulzSec released a number of documents pertaining to the Arizona Department of Public Safety, which they titled \"chinga la migra\", which roughly translates to \"fuck the border patrol\". The leaked items included email addresses and passwords, as well as hundreds of documents marked \"sensitive\" or \"for official use only\". LulzSec claimed that this was in protest of the law passed in Arizona requiring some aliens to carry registration documents at all times. Arizona officials have confirmed the intrusion. Arizona police have complained that the release of officer identities and the method used to combat gangs could endanger the lives of police officers.On 24 June 2011, LulzSecBrazil published what they claimed were access codes and passwords that they used to access the Petrobras website and employee profile data they had taken using the information. Petrobras denied that any data had been stolen, and LulzSecBrazil removed the information from their Twitter feed a few hours later. The group also released personal information regarding President of Brazil Dilma Rousseff and Mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo Gilberto Kassab.On 25 June 2011, LulzSec released what they described as their last data dump. The release contained an enormous amount of information from various sources. The files contained a half gigabyte of internal information from telecommunication company AT&T, including information relating to its release of 4G LTE and details pertaining to over 90,000 personal phones used by IBM. The IP addresses of several large corporations including Sony, Viacom, and Disney, EMI, and NBC Universal were included. It also contained over 750,000 username and password combinations from several websites, including 200,000 email addresses, usernames, and encrypted passwords from hackforums.net; 12,000 names, usernames, and passwords of the NATO online bookshop; half a million usernames and encrypted passwords of players of the online game Battlefield Heroes; 50,000 usernames, email addresses, and encrypted passwords of various video game forum users; and 29 users of Priority Investigations, an Irish private investigation company. Also included were an internal manual for AOL engineering staff and a screencapture of a vandalized page from navy.mil, the website of the United States Navy. Members of the group continued the operation with members of Anonymous after disbanding.Despite claiming to have retired, on 18 July LulzSec hacked into the website of British newspaper The Sun. The group redirected the newspaper's website to an also-hacked redesign website of another newspaper The Times, altering the site to resemble The Sun and posting a fake story claiming that Rupert Murdoch had died after ingesting a fatal dose of palladium. They objected to the involvement of News Corporation, the Murdoch-owned company that publishes The Sun and The Times, in a large phone hacking scandal. The hacked website also contained a webcomic depicting LulzSec deciding on and carrying out the attack. The group later redirected The Sun website to their Twitter feed. News International released a statement regarding the attacks before having the page the statement appeared on also redirected to the LulzSec Twitter page and eventually taken offline. The group also released the names and phone numbers of a reporter for The Sun and two others associated with the newspaper and encouraged their supporters to call them. In recent times NovaCygni of AntiSec has openly touted that the news channel Russian Television (RT) has openly stated support for the Anonymous movement and that at least one reporter for them is an active member of Anonymous. They further included an old email address and password of former News International executive Rebekah Brooks. News Corporation took the websites offline as a precaution later in the day.\n\n== Denied attacks ==\nThe media reported a number of attacks, originally attributed to LulzSec, that the group later denied involvement in. On 21 June, someone claiming to be from the group posted on Pastebin that they had stolen the entire database of the United Kingdom Census 2011. LulzSec responded by saying that they had obtained no such data and that whoever posted the notice was not from the group. British officials said they were investigating the incident, but have found no evidence that any databases had been compromised or any information taken. The British government, upon concluding their investigation, called the claims that any information on the census was taken a hoax.In June 2011, assets belonging to newspaper publisher News International were attacked, apparently in retaliation for reporting by The Sun of the arrest of Ryan Cleary, an associate of the group. The newspaper's website and a computer used in the publishing process of The Times were attacked. However, LulzSec denied any involvement, stating \"we didn't attack The Sun or The Times in any way with any kind of DDoS attack\". Members of AntiSec based in Essex England claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\n== Hacker actions against LulzSec ==\nA number of different hackers have targeted LulzSec and its members in response to their activities. On 23 June 2011, Fox News reported that rival hacker group TeaMp0isoN were responsible for outing web designer Sven Slootweg, who they said used the online nickname Joepie91, and that they have intentions to do the same with every member. A Pastebin post in June 2011 from hacker KillerCube identified LulzSec leader Sabu as Hector Xavier Monsegur, an identification later shown to be accurate.A group calling themselves Team Web Ninjas appeared in June 2011 saying they were angry over the LulzSec release of the e-mail addresses and passwords of thousands of normal Internet users. They attempted to publicly identify the online and real world identities of LulzSec leadership and claimed to do so on behalf of the group's victims. The group claimed to have identified and given to law enforcement the names of a number of the group's members, including someone they claimed to be a United States Marine.The Jester, a hacker who generally went by the leetspeak handle th3j35t3r, vowed to find and expose members of LulzSec. Claiming to perform hacks out of a sense of American patriotism, he attempted to obtain and publish the real world personally identifiable information of key members, whom he described as \"childish\". On 24 June 2011, he claimed to have revealed the identity of LulzSec leader Sabu as an information technology consultant possibly from New York City. On 24 June 2011, a hacker allegedly going by the name Oneiroi briefly took down the LulzSec website in what he labelled \"Operation Supernova\". The Twitter page for the group also briefly became unavailable.On 24 June 2011, The Guardian published leaked logs from one of the group's IRC channels. The logs were originally assumed to have been leaked by a disillusioned former member of the group who went by the nickname m_nerva, yet fellow hacker Michael Major, known by his handle 'hann', later claimed responsibility. After confirming that the leaked logs were indeed theirs, and that the logs revealed personal information on two members who had recently left the group due to the implications of attacking the FBI website, LulzSec went on to threaten m_nerva on their Twitter feed. LulzSec claimed the logs were not from one of their core chatting channels, but rather a secondary channel used to screen potential backups and gather research.A short time before LulzSec claimed to be disbanding, a group calling itself the A-Team posted what they claimed was a full list of LulzSec members online along with numerous chat logs of the group communicating with each other. A rival hacker going by the name of TriCk also claimed to be working to reveal the group's identities and claimed that efforts on the part of rival hackers had pushed the group to disband for fear of being caught.\n\n== Law enforcement response ==\n\nOn 21 June 2011, the London Metropolitan Police announced that they had arrested a 19-year-old man from Wickford, Essex, named by LulzSec and locally as Ryan Cleary, as part of an operation carried out in cooperation with the FBI. The suspect was arrested on charges of computer misuse and fraud, and later charged with five counts of computer hacking under the Criminal Law Act and the Computer Misuse Act. News reports described him as an alleged member of LulzSec. LulzSec denied the man arrested was a member. A member of LulzSec claimed that the suspect was not part of the group, but did host one of its IRC channels on his server. British police confirmed that he was being questioned regarding alleged involvement in LulzSec attacks against the Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA) and other targets. They also questioned him regarding an attack on the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry in November 2010. On 25 June 2011 the court released Cleary under the bail conditions that he not leave his house without his mother and not use any device connected to the internet. He was diagnosed the previous week with Asperger syndrome.\nIn June 2012 Cleary, together with another suspected LulzSec member, 19-year-old Jake Davis, pleaded guilty conspiring to attack government, law enforcement and media websites in 2011.At around the same time as Cleary's arrest, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents raided the Reston, Virginia facility of Swiss web hosting service DigitalOne. The raid took several legitimate websites offline for hours as the agency looked for information on an undisclosed target. Media reports speculated the raid may have been related to the LulzSec investigation.A few days before LulzSec disbanded, the FBI executed a search warrant on an Iowa home rented by Laurelai Bailey. Authorities interviewed her for five hours and confiscated her hard drives, camera, and other electronic equipment, but no charges were filed. Bailey denied being a member of the group, but admitted chatting with members of LulzSec online and later leaking those chats. The FBI was interested in having her infiltrate the group, but Bailey claimed the members hated her and would never let her in. The questioning by the FBI led a local technical support company to fire Laurelai, claiming she embarrassed the company.On 27 June 2011, the FBI executed another search warrant in Hamilton, Ohio. The local media connected the raid to the LulzSec investigation; however, the warrant was sealed, the name of the target was not revealed, and the FBI office in Cincinnati refused to comment on any possible connection between the group and the raid. No one was charged with a crime after the FBI served the warrant. Some reports suggested the house may have belonged to former LulzSec member m_nerva, whom was originally suspected of leaking a number of the group's logs to the press, and information leading to the warrant supplied by Ryan Cleary.On 19 July 2011, the London Metropolitan Police announced the arrest of LulzSec member Tflow. A 16-year-old male was arrested in South London on charges of violating the Computer Misuse Act, as part of an operation involving the arrest of several other hackers affiliated with Anonymous in the United States and United Kingdom. LulzSec once again denied that any of their membership had been arrested, stating \"there are seven of us, and we're all still here.\"On the same day the FBI arrested 21-year-old Lance Moore in Las Cruces, New Mexico, accusing him of stealing thousands of documents and applications from AT&T that LulzSec published as part of their so called \"final release\".The Police Central E-Crime Unit arrested an 18-year-old man from Shetland on 27 July 2011 suspected of being LulzSec member Topiary. They also searched the house of a 17-year-old from Lincolnshire possibly connected to the investigation, interviewing him. Scotland Yard later identified the man arrested as Yell, Shetland resident Jake Davis. He was charged with unauthorized access of a computer under the Computer Misuse Act 1990, encouraging or assisting criminal activity under the Serious Crime Act 2007, conspiracy to launch a denial-of-service attack against the Serious Organised Crime Unit contrary to the Criminal Law Act 1977, and criminal conspiracy also under the Criminal Law Act 1977. Police confiscated a Dell laptop and a 100-gigabyte hard drive that ran 16 different virtual machines. Details relating to an attack on Sony and hundreds of thousands of email addresses and passwords were found on the computer. A London court released Davis on bail under the conditions that he live under curfew with his parents and have no access to the internet. His lawyer Gideon Cammerman stated that, while his client did help publicize LulzSec and Anonymous attacks, he lacked the technical skills to have been anything but a sympathizer.In early September 2011, Scotland Yard made two further arrests relating to LulzSec. Police arrested a 24-year-old male in Mexborough, South Yorkshire and a 20-year-old male in Warminster, Wiltshire. The two were accused of conspiring to commit offenses under the Computer Misuse Act of 1990; police said that the arrests related to investigations into LulzSec member Kayla.On 22 September 2011, the FBI arrested Cody Kretsinger, a 23-year-old from Phoenix, Arizona who was indicted on charges of conspiracy and the unauthorized impairment of a protected computer. He is suspected of using the name \"recursion\" and assisting LulzSec in their early hack against Sony Pictures Entertainment, though he allegedly erased the hard drives he used to carry out the attack. Kretsinger was released on his own recognizance under the conditions that he not access the internet except while at work and that he not travel to any states other than Arizona, California, or Illinois. The case against him was filed in Los Angeles, where Sony Pictures is located. Kretsinger pleaded guilty on 5 April 2012 to one count of conspiracy and one count of unauthorized impairment of a protected computer. On 19 April 2013, Kretsinger was sentenced for the \"unauthorized impairment of protected computers\" to one year in federal prison, one year of home detention following the completion of his prison sentence, a fine of $605,663 in restitution to Sony Pictures and 1000 hours of community service.On 8 August 2013, Raynaldo Rivera, age 21, known by the online moniker \"neuron\", of Chandler, Arizona, was sentenced to one year and one day in federal prison by United States District Judge John A. Kronstadt. In addition to the prison sentence, Judge Kronstadt ordered Rivera to serve 13 months of home detention, to perform 1,000 hours of community service and to pay $605,663 in restitution to Sony Pictures.On 6 March 2012, two men from Great Britain, one from the United States, and two from Ireland were charged in connection to their alleged involvement with LulzSec. The FBI revealed that supposed LulzSec leader Hector Xavier Monsegur, who went by the username Sabu, had been aiding law enforcement since pleading guilty to twelve counts, including conspiracy and computer hacking, on 15 August 2011 as part of a plea deal. In exchange for his cooperation, federal prosecutors agreed not to prosecute Monsegur for his computer hacking, and also not to prosecute him for two attempts to sell marijuana, possession of an illegal handgun, purchasing stolen property, charging $15,000 to his former employer's credit card in a case of identity theft, and directing people to buy prescription drugs from illegal sources. He still faces a misdemeanor charge of impersonating a federal agent. Five suspects were charged with conspiracy: Jake Davis, accused of being the hacker \"Topiary\" (who had been previously arrested); Ryan Ackroyd of London, accused of being \"Kayla\"; Darren Martyn of Ireland, accused of being \"pwnsauce\"; Donncha O\u2019Cearrbhail of Ireland, accused of being \"palladium\"; and Jeremy Hammond of Chicago, accused of being \"Anarchaos\". While not a member of LulzSec, authorities suspect Hammond of being a member of Anonymous and charged him with access device fraud and hacking in relation to his supposed involvement in the December 2011 attack on intelligence company Stratfor as part of Operation AntiSec.On 8 April 2013, Jake 'Topiary' Davis and three other LulzSec members pleaded guilty to charges of computer hacking at Southwark Crown Court in London.On 24 April 2013, Australian Federal Police arrested 24-year-old Matthew Flannery of Point Clare, who boasted on Facebook \"I\u2019m the leader of LulzSec\". Flannery, who went by the username Aush0k, was arrested for the alleged hacking of the Narrabri Shire Council website on which homepage sexually explicit text and an image were left. On 27 August 2014, Flannery entered guilty pleas to five charges of making unauthorised modification of data to cause impairment, and dishonestly obtaining the Commonwealth Bank details of a woman. Flannery, who said the reference to LulzSec was a joke, lost his job of computer technician in a security company. On 16 October 2014, he was sentenced to 15 months of house arrest which continues until mid-April 2016, alongside a 12 months good behaviour bond.\nQ: What was the impact of LulzSec's \"50 days of lulz\" statement on the group's activities?",

However, the group continued to commit hacks even after this announcement, including an attack against newspapers owned by News Corporation on 18 July.",
      "context": "LulzSec\n\n==Introduction==\nLulzSec (a contraction for Lulz Security) was a black hat computer hacking group that claimed responsibility for several high profile attacks, including the compromise of user accounts from PlayStation Network in 2011. The group also claimed responsibility for taking the CIA website offline. Some security professionals have commented that LulzSec has drawn attention to insecure systems and the dangers of password reuse. It has gained attention due to its high profile targets and the sarcastic messages it has posted in the aftermath of its attacks. One of the founders of LulzSec was computer security specialist Hector Monsegur, who used the online moniker Sabu. He later helped law enforcement track down other members of the organization as part of a plea deal. At least four associates of LulzSec were arrested in March 2012 as part of this investigation. Prior, British authorities had announced the arrests of two teenagers they alleged were LulzSec members, going by the pseudonyms T-flow and Topiary.\nAt just after midnight (BST, UT+01) on 26 June 2011, LulzSec released a \"50 days of lulz\" statement, which they claimed to be their final release, confirming that LulzSec consisted of six members, and that their website was to be shut down. The sudden disbandment of the group was unexpected. Their final release included accounts and passwords from many different sources. Despite claims of retirement, the group committed another hack against newspapers owned by News Corporation on 18 July, defacing them with false reports regarding the death of Rupert Murdoch. The group had also helped launch Operation AntiSec, a joint effort involving LulzSec, Anonymous, and other hackers.\n\n== Background and history ==\nA federal indictment against members contends that, prior to forming the hacking collective known as LulzSec, the six members were all part of another collective called Internet Feds, a group in rivalry with Anonymous. Under this name, the group attacked websites belonging to Fine Gael, HBGary, and Fox Broadcasting Company. This includes the alleged incident in which e-mail messages were stolen from HBGary accounts. In May 2011, following the publicity surrounding the HBGary hacks, six members of Internet Feds founded the group LulzSec.The group's first recorded attack was against Fox.com's website, though they still may have been using the name Internet Feds at the time. It claimed responsibility for leaking information, including passwords, altering several employees' LinkedIn profiles, and leaking a database of X Factor contestants containing contact information of 73,000 contestants. They claimed to do so because the rapper Common had been referred to as \"vile\" on air.LulzSec drew its name from the neologism \"lulz\", (from lol), \"laughing out loud\", which represents laughter, and \"Sec\", short for \"Security\". The Wall Street Journal characterized its attacks as closer to Internet pranks than serious cyber-warfare, while the group itself claimed to possess the capability of stronger attacks. It gained attention in part due to its brazen claims of responsibility and lighthearted taunting of corporations that were hacked. It frequently referred to Internet memes when defacing websites. The group emerged in May 2011, and successfully attacked websites of several major corporations. It specialized in finding websites with poor security, stealing and posting information from them online. It used well-known straightforward methods, such as SQL injection, to attack its target websites. Several media sources have described their tactics as grey hat hacking. Members of the group may have been involved in a previous attack against the security firm HBGary.The group used the motto \"Laughing at your security since 2011!\" and its website, created in June 2011, played the theme from The Love Boat. It announced its exploits via Twitter and its own website, often accompanied with lighthearted ASCII art drawings of boats. Its website also included a bitcoin donation link to help fund its activities. Ian Paul of PC World wrote that, \"As its name suggests, LulzSec claims to be interested in mocking and embarrassing companies by exposing security flaws rather than stealing data for criminal purposes.\" The group was also critical of white hat hackers, claiming that many of them have been corrupted by their employers.Some in the security community contended that the group raised awareness of the widespread lack of effective security against hackers. They were credited with inspiring LulzRaft, a group implicated in several high-profile website hacks in Canada.In June 2011 the group took suggestions for sites to hit with denial-of-service attacks. The group redirected telephone numbers to different customer support lines, including the line for World of Warcraft, magnets.com, and the FBI Detroit office. The group claimed this sent five to 20 calls per second to these sources, overwhelming their support officers. On 24 June 2011, The Guardian released leaked logs of one of the group's IRC chats, revealing that the core group was a small group of hackers with a leader Sabu who exercised large control over the group's activities. It also revealed that the group had connections with Anonymous, though was not formally affiliated with it. Some LulzSec members had once been prominent Anonymous members, including member Topiary.At just after midnight (UTC) on 26 June 2011, LulzSec released a \"50 days of lulz\" statement, which they claimed to be their final release, confirming that LulzSec consisted of six members, and that their website was to be taken down. The group claimed that they had planned to be active for only fifty days from the beginning.  \"We're not quitting because we're afraid of law enforcement. The press are getting bored of us, and we're getting bored of us,\" a group member said in an interview to the Associated Press. Members of the group were reported to have joined with Anonymous members to continue the AntiSec operation. However, despite claiming to retire, the group remained in communication as it attacked the websites of British newspapers The Times and The Sun on 18 July, leaving a false story on the death of owner Rupert Murdoch.\n\n== Former members and associates ==\nLulzSec consisted of seven core members. The online handles of these seven were established through various attempts by other hacking groups to release personal information of group members on the internet, leaked IRC logs published by The Guardian, and through confirmation from the group itself.\nSabu \u2013 One of the group's founders, who seemed to act as a kind of leader for the group, Sabu would often decide what targets to attack next and who could participate in these attacks. He may have been part of the Anonymous group that hacked HBGary. Various attempts to release his real identity have claimed that he is an information technology consultant with the strongest hacking skills of the group and knowledge of the Python programming language. It was thought that Sabu was involved in the media outrage cast of 2010 using the skype \"anonymous.sabu\" Sabu was arrested in June 2011 and identified as a 29-year-old unemployed man from New York\u2019s Lower East Side. On 15 August, he pleaded guilty to several hacking charges and agreed to cooperate with the FBI. Over the following seven months he successfully unmasked the other members of the group. Sabu was identified by Backtrace Security as Hector Montsegur on 11 March 2011 in a PDF publication named \"Namshub.\"\nTopiary \u2013 Topiary was also a suspected former member of the Anonymous, where he used to perform media relations, including hacking the website of the Westboro Baptist Church during a live interview. Topiary ran the LulzSec Twitter account on a daily basis; following the announcement of LulzSec's dissolution, he deleted all the posts on his Twitter page, except for one, which stated: \"You cannot arrest an idea\". Police arrested a man from Shetland, United Kingdom suspected of being Topiary on 27 July 2011. The man was later identified as Jake Davis and was charged with five counts, including unauthorized access of a computer and conspiracy. He was indicted on conspiracy charges on 6 March 2012.\nKayla/KMS \u2013 Ryan Ackroyd of London, and another unidentified individual known as \"lol\" or \"Shock.ofgod\" in LulzSec chat logs. Kayla owned a botnet used by the group in their distributed denial-of-service attacks. The botnet is reported to have consisted of about 800,000 infected computer servers. Kayla was involved in several high-profile attacks under the group \"gn0sis\". Kayla also may have participated in the Anonymous operation against HBGary. Kayla reportedly wiretapped 2 CIA agents in an anonymous operation. Kayla was also involved in the 2010 media outrage under the Skype handle \"Pastorhoudaille\". Kayla is suspected of having been something of a deputy to Sabu and to have found the vulnerabilities that allowed LulzSec access to the United States Senate systems. One of the men behind the handle Kayla was identified as Ryan Ackroyd of London, arrested, and indicted on conspiracy charges on 6 March 2012.\nTflow \u2013 (Real name: Mustafa Al-Bassam) The fourth founding member of the group identified in chat logs, attempts to identify him have labelled him a PHP coder, web developer, and performer of scams on PayPal. The group placed him in charge of maintenance and security of the group's website lulzsecurity.com. London Metropolitan Police announced the arrest of a 16-year-old hacker going by the handle Tflow on 19 July 2011.\nAvunit \u2013 He is one of the core seven members of the group, but not a founding member. He left the group after their self-labelled \"Fuck the FBI Friday\".  He was also affiliated with Anonymous AnonOps HQ. Avunit is the only one of the core seven members that has not been identified.\nPwnsauce \u2013 Pwnsauce joined the group around the same time as Avunit and became one of its core members. He was identified as Darren Martyn of Ireland and was indicted on conspiracy charges on 6 March 2012. The Irish national worked as a local chapter leader for the Open Web Application Security Project, resigning one week before his arrest.\nPalladium \u2013 Identified as Donncha O'Cearbhaill of Ireland, he was indicted on conspiracy on 6 March 2012.\nAnarchaos \u2013 Identified as Jeremy Hammond of Chicago, he was arrested on access device fraud and hacking charges.  He was also charged with a hacking attack on the U.S. security company Stratfor in December 2011.  He is said to be a member of Anonymous.\nRyan Cleary, who sometimes used the handle ViraL. Cleary faced a sentence of 32 months in relation to attacks against the US Air Force and others.\n\n== Ideology ==\n\nLulzSec did not appear to hack for financial profit, claiming their main motivation was to have fun by causing mayhem. They did things \"for the lulz\" and focused on the possible comedic and entertainment value of attacking targets. The group occasionally claimed a political message. When they hacked PBS, they stated they did so in retaliation for what they perceived as unfair treatment of WikiLeaks in a Frontline documentary entitled WikiSecrets. A page they inserted on the PBS website included the title \"FREE BRADLEY MANNING. FUCK FRONTLINE!\" The 20 June announcement of \"Operation Anti-Security\" contained justification for attacks on government targets, citing supposed government efforts to \"dominate and control our Internet ocean\" and accusing them of corruption and breaching privacy. The news media most often described them as grey hat hackers.Karim Hijazi, CEO of security company Unveillance, accused the group of blackmailing him by offering not to attack his company or its affiliates in exchange for money. LulzSec responded by claiming that Hijazi offered to pay them to attack his business opponents and that they never intended to take any money from him. LulzSec has denied responsibility for misuse of any of the data they breached and released. Instead, they placed the blame on users who reused passwords on multiple websites and on companies with inadequate security in place.In June 2011, the group released a manifesto outlining why they performed hacks and website takedowns, reiterating that \"we do things just because we find it entertaining\" and that watching the results can be \"priceless\". They also claimed to be drawing attention to computer security flaws and holes. They contended that many other hackers exploit and steal user information without releasing the names publicly or telling people they may possibly have been hacked. LulzSec said that by releasing lists of hacked usernames or informing the public of vulnerable websites, it gave users the opportunity to change names and passwords elsewhere that might otherwise have been exploited, and businesses would be alarmed and would upgrade their security.The group's later attacks have had a more political tone. They claimed to want to expose the \"racist and corrupt nature\" of the military and law enforcement. They have also expressed opposition to the War on Drugs. Lulzsec's Operation Anti-Security was characterized as a protest against government censorship and monitoring of the internet. In a question and answer session with BBC Newsnight, LulzSec member Whirlpool (AKA: Topiary) said, \"Politically motivated ethical hacking is more fulfilling\". He claimed the loosening of copyright laws and the rollback of what he sees as corrupt racial profiling practices as some of the group's goals.\n\n== Initial targets ==\nThe group's first attacks came in May 2011. Their first recorded target was Fox.com, which they retaliated against after they called Common, a rapper and entertainer, \"vile\" on the Fox News Channel. They leaked several passwords, LinkedIn profiles, and the names of 73,000 X Factor contestants. Soon after on 15 May, they released the transaction logs of 3,100 Automated Teller Machines in the United Kingdom. In May 2011, members of Lulz Security gained international attention for hacking the American Public Broadcasting System (PBS) website. They stole user data and posted a fake story on the site which claimed that Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls were still alive and living in New Zealand. In the aftermath of the attack, CNN referred to the responsible group as the \"Lulz Boat\".Lulz Security claimed that some of its hacks, including its attack on PBS, were motivated by a desire to defend WikiLeaks and Chelsea Manning. A Fox News report on the group quoted one commentator, Brandon Pike, who claimed that Lulz Security was affiliated with the hacktivist group Anonymous. Lulz Security claimed that Pike had actually hired it to hack PBS. Pike denied the accusation and claimed it was leveled against him because he said Lulz Security was a splinter of Anonymous.In June 2011, members of the group claimed responsibility for an attack against Sony Pictures that took data that included \"names, passwords, e-mail addresses, home addresses and dates of birth for thousands of people.\" The group claimed that it used a SQL injection attack, and was motivated by Sony's legal action against George Hotz for jailbreaking the PlayStation 3.  The group claimed it would launch an attack that would be the \"beginning of the end\" for Sony. Some of the compromised user information was subsequently used in scams. The group claimed to have compromised over 1,000,000 accounts, though Sony claimed the real number was around 37,500.\n\n== Corporate attacks ==\nLulz Security attempted to hack into Nintendo, but both the group and Nintendo itself report that no particularly valuable information was found by the hackers. LulzSec claimed that it did not mean to harm Nintendo, declaring: \"We're not targeting Nintendo. We like the N64 too much \u2014 we sincerely hope Nintendo plugs the gap.\"On 11 June, reports emerged that LulzSec hacked into and stole user information from the pornography website www.pron.com. They obtained and published around 26,000 e-mail addresses and passwords. Among the information stolen were records of two users who subscribed using email addresses associated with the Malaysian government, three users who subscribed using United States military email addresses and 55 users who LulzSec claimed were administrators of other adult-oriented websites. Following the breach, Facebook locked the accounts of all users who had used the published e-mail addresses, and also blocked new Facebook accounts opened using the leaked e-mail addresses, fearing that users of the site would get hacked after LulzSec encouraged people to try and see if these people used identical user name and password combinations on Facebook as well.LulzSec hacked into the Bethesda Game Studios network and posted information taken from the network onto the Internet, though they refrained from publishing 200,000 compromised accounts. LulzSec posted to Twitter regarding the attack, \"Bethesda, we broke into your site over two months ago. We've had all of your Brink users for weeks, Please fix your junk, thanks!\"On 14 June 2011, LulzSec took down four websites by request of fans as part of their \"Titanic Take-down Tuesday\". These websites were Minecraft, League of Legends, The Escapist, and IT security company FinFisher. They also attacked the login servers of the massively multiplayer online game EVE Online, which also disabled the game's front-facing website, and the League of Legends login servers. Most of the takedowns were performed with distributed denial-of-service attacks. On 15 June, LulzSec took down the main server of S2 Games' Heroes of Newerth as another phone request. They claimed, \"Heroes of Newerth master login server is down. They need some treatment. Also, DotA is better.\"On 16 June, LulzSec posted a random assortment of 62,000 emails and passwords to MediaFire. LulzSec stated they released this in return for supporters flooding the 4chan /b/ board. The group did not say what websites the combinations were for and encouraged followers to plug them into various sites until they gained access to an account. Some reported gaining access to Facebook accounts and changing images to sexual content and others to using the Amazon.com accounts of others to purchase several books. Writerspace.com, a literary website, later admitted that the addresses and passwords came from users of their site.\n\n== Government-focused activities ==\nLulzSec claimed to have hacked local InfraGard chapter sites, a non-profit organization affiliated with the FBI. The group leaked some of InfraGard member e-mails and a database of local users. The group defaced the website posting the following message, \"LET IT FLOW YOU STUPID FBI BATTLESHIPS\", accompanied with a video. LulzSec posted:\n\nIt has come to our unfortunate attention that NATO and our good friend Barrack Osama-Llama 24th-century Obama [sic] have recently upped the stakes with regard to hacking. They now treat hacking as an act of war. So, we just hacked an FBI affiliated website (Infragard, specifically the Atlanta chapter) and leaked its user base. We also took complete control over the site and defaced it[.]\nOn 9 June, LulzSec sent an email to the administrators of the British National Health Service, informing them of a security vulnerability discovered in NHS systems. LulzSec stated that they did not intend to exploit this vulnerability, saying in the email that \"We mean you no harm and only want to help you fix your tech issues.\"On 13 June, LulzSec released the e-mails and passwords of a number of users of senate.gov, the website of the United States Senate. The information released also included the root directory of parts of the website. LulzSec stated, \"This is a small, just-for-kicks release of some internal data from senate.gov \u2013 is this an act of war, gentlemen? Problem?\" referencing a recent statement by the Pentagon that some cyberattacks could be considered an act of war. No highly sensitive information appears in the release.On 15 June, LulzSec launched an attack on CIA.gov, the public website of the United States Central Intelligence Agency, taking the website offline with a distributed denial-of-service attack. The website was down from 5:48 pm to 8:00 pm eastern time.On 2 December, an offshoot of LulzSec calling itself LulzSec Portugal, attacked several sites related to the government of Portugal. The websites for the Bank of Portugal, the Assembly of the Republic, and the Ministry of Economy, Innovation and Development all became unavailable for a few hours.\n\n== Operation Anti-Security ==\n\nOn 20 June, the group announced it had teamed up with Anonymous for \"Operation Anti-Security\". They encouraged supporters to steal and publish classified government information from any source while leaving the term \"AntiSec\" as evidence of their intrusion. Also listed as potential targets were major banks. USA Today characterized the operation as an open declaration of cyberwarfare against big government and corporations. Their first target of the operation was the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), a national law enforcement agency of the United Kingdom. LulzSec claimed to have taken the website offline at about 11 am EST on 20 June 2011, though it only remained down for a few minutes. While the attack appeared to be a DDoS attack, LulzSec tweeted that actual hacking was taking place \"behind the scenes\". At about 6:10 pm EST on 20 June, SOCA's website went down yet again. SOCA's website was back online sometime between 20 and 21 June. The website of the local district government of Jianhua District in Qiqihar, China, was also knocked offline. Early in the morning on 22 June, it was revealed that LulzSec's \"Brazilian unit\" had taken down two Brazilian government websites, brasil.gov.br and presidencia.gov.br. They also brought down the website of Brazilian energy company Petrobras.On 20 June, two members on the \"Lulz Boat\" reportedly leaked logs that LulzSec was going to leak on 21 June. They also claimed that the two had leaked information that aided authorities in locating and arresting Ryan Cleary, a man loosely affiliated with the group. LulzSec posted various personal information about the two on Pastebin including IP addresses and physical addresses. Both had been involved with cyber-crimes in the past, and one had been involved with hacking the game Deus Ex.After LulzSec encouragement, some began tagging public locations with physical graffiti reading \"Antisec\" as part of the operation. Numerous beachfronts in Mission Beach, San Diego were vandalized with the phrase. Some local news organizations mistook the graffiti in Mission Beach as signs of the Antisec Movement. Many commenters on the local news websites corrected this.On 23 June, LulzSec released a number of documents pertaining to the Arizona Department of Public Safety, which they titled \"chinga la migra\", which roughly translates to \"fuck the border patrol\". The leaked items included email addresses and passwords, as well as hundreds of documents marked \"sensitive\" or \"for official use only\". LulzSec claimed that this was in protest of the law passed in Arizona requiring some aliens to carry registration documents at all times. Arizona officials have confirmed the intrusion. Arizona police have complained that the release of officer identities and the method used to combat gangs could endanger the lives of police officers.On 24 June 2011, LulzSecBrazil published what they claimed were access codes and passwords that they used to access the Petrobras website and employee profile data they had taken using the information. Petrobras denied that any data had been stolen, and LulzSecBrazil removed the information from their Twitter feed a few hours later. The group also released personal information regarding President of Brazil Dilma Rousseff and Mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo Gilberto Kassab.On 25 June 2011, LulzSec released what they described as their last data dump. The release contained an enormous amount of information from various sources. The files contained a half gigabyte of internal information from telecommunication company AT&T, including information relating to its release of 4G LTE and details pertaining to over 90,000 personal phones used by IBM. The IP addresses of several large corporations including Sony, Viacom, and Disney, EMI, and NBC Universal were included. It also contained over 750,000 username and password combinations from several websites, including 200,000 email addresses, usernames, and encrypted passwords from hackforums.net; 12,000 names, usernames, and passwords of the NATO online bookshop; half a million usernames and encrypted passwords of players of the online game Battlefield Heroes; 50,000 usernames, email addresses, and encrypted passwords of various video game forum users; and 29 users of Priority Investigations, an Irish private investigation company. Also included were an internal manual for AOL engineering staff and a screencapture of a vandalized page from navy.mil, the website of the United States Navy. Members of the group continued the operation with members of Anonymous after disbanding.Despite claiming to have retired, on 18 July LulzSec hacked into the website of British newspaper The Sun. The group redirected the newspaper's website to an also-hacked redesign website of another newspaper The Times, altering the site to resemble The Sun and posting a fake story claiming that Rupert Murdoch had died after ingesting a fatal dose of palladium. They objected to the involvement of News Corporation, the Murdoch-owned company that publishes The Sun and The Times, in a large phone hacking scandal. The hacked website also contained a webcomic depicting LulzSec deciding on and carrying out the attack. The group later redirected The Sun website to their Twitter feed. News International released a statement regarding the attacks before having the page the statement appeared on also redirected to the LulzSec Twitter page and eventually taken offline. The group also released the names and phone numbers of a reporter for The Sun and two others associated with the newspaper and encouraged their supporters to call them. In recent times NovaCygni of AntiSec has openly touted that the news channel Russian Television (RT) has openly stated support for the Anonymous movement and that at least one reporter for them is an active member of Anonymous. They further included an old email address and password of former News International executive Rebekah Brooks. News Corporation took the websites offline as a precaution later in the day.\n\n== Denied attacks ==\nThe media reported a number of attacks, originally attributed to LulzSec, that the group later denied involvement in. On 21 June, someone claiming to be from the group posted on Pastebin that they had stolen the entire database of the United Kingdom Census 2011. LulzSec responded by saying that they had obtained no such data and that whoever posted the notice was not from the group. British officials said they were investigating the incident, but have found no evidence that any databases had been compromised or any information taken. The British government, upon concluding their investigation, called the claims that any information on the census was taken a hoax.In June 2011, assets belonging to newspaper publisher News International were attacked, apparently in retaliation for reporting by The Sun of the arrest of Ryan Cleary, an associate of the group. The newspaper's website and a computer used in the publishing process of The Times were attacked. However, LulzSec denied any involvement, stating \"we didn't attack The Sun or The Times in any way with any kind of DDoS attack\". Members of AntiSec based in Essex England claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\n== Hacker actions against LulzSec ==\nA number of different hackers have targeted LulzSec and its members in response to their activities. On 23 June 2011, Fox News reported that rival hacker group TeaMp0isoN were responsible for outing web designer Sven Slootweg, who they said used the online nickname Joepie91, and that they have intentions to do the same with every member. A Pastebin post in June 2011 from hacker KillerCube identified LulzSec leader Sabu as Hector Xavier Monsegur, an identification later shown to be accurate.A group calling themselves Team Web Ninjas appeared in June 2011 saying they were angry over the LulzSec release of the e-mail addresses and passwords of thousands of normal Internet users. They attempted to publicly identify the online and real world identities of LulzSec leadership and claimed to do so on behalf of the group's victims. The group claimed to have identified and given to law enforcement the names of a number of the group's members, including someone they claimed to be a United States Marine.The Jester, a hacker who generally went by the leetspeak handle th3j35t3r, vowed to find and expose members of LulzSec. Claiming to perform hacks out of a sense of American patriotism, he attempted to obtain and publish the real world personally identifiable information of key members, whom he described as \"childish\". On 24 June 2011, he claimed to have revealed the identity of LulzSec leader Sabu as an information technology consultant possibly from New York City. On 24 June 2011, a hacker allegedly going by the name Oneiroi briefly took down the LulzSec website in what he labelled \"Operation Supernova\". The Twitter page for the group also briefly became unavailable.On 24 June 2011, The Guardian published leaked logs from one of the group's IRC channels. The logs were originally assumed to have been leaked by a disillusioned former member of the group who went by the nickname m_nerva, yet fellow hacker Michael Major, known by his handle 'hann', later claimed responsibility. After confirming that the leaked logs were indeed theirs, and that the logs revealed personal information on two members who had recently left the group due to the implications of attacking the FBI website, LulzSec went on to threaten m_nerva on their Twitter feed. LulzSec claimed the logs were not from one of their core chatting channels, but rather a secondary channel used to screen potential backups and gather research.A short time before LulzSec claimed to be disbanding, a group calling itself the A-Team posted what they claimed was a full list of LulzSec members online along with numerous chat logs of the group communicating with each other. A rival hacker going by the name of TriCk also claimed to be working to reveal the group's identities and claimed that efforts on the part of rival hackers had pushed the group to disband for fear of being caught.\n\n== Law enforcement response ==\n\nOn 21 June 2011, the London Metropolitan Police announced that they had arrested a 19-year-old man from Wickford, Essex, named by LulzSec and locally as Ryan Cleary, as part of an operation carried out in cooperation with the FBI. The suspect was arrested on charges of computer misuse and fraud, and later charged with five counts of computer hacking under the Criminal Law Act and the Computer Misuse Act. News reports described him as an alleged member of LulzSec. LulzSec denied the man arrested was a member. A member of LulzSec claimed that the suspect was not part of the group, but did host one of its IRC channels on his server. British police confirmed that he was being questioned regarding alleged involvement in LulzSec attacks against the Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA) and other targets. They also questioned him regarding an attack on the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry in November 2010. On 25 June 2011 the court released Cleary under the bail conditions that he not leave his house without his mother and not use any device connected to the internet. He was diagnosed the previous week with Asperger syndrome.\nIn June 2012 Cleary, together with another suspected LulzSec member, 19-year-old Jake Davis, pleaded guilty conspiring to attack government, law enforcement and media websites in 2011.At around the same time as Cleary's arrest, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents raided the Reston, Virginia facility of Swiss web hosting service DigitalOne. The raid took several legitimate websites offline for hours as the agency looked for information on an undisclosed target. Media reports speculated the raid may have been related to the LulzSec investigation.A few days before LulzSec disbanded, the FBI executed a search warrant on an Iowa home rented by Laurelai Bailey. Authorities interviewed her for five hours and confiscated her hard drives, camera, and other electronic equipment, but no charges were filed. Bailey denied being a member of the group, but admitted chatting with members of LulzSec online and later leaking those chats. The FBI was interested in having her infiltrate the group, but Bailey claimed the members hated her and would never let her in. The questioning by the FBI led a local technical support company to fire Laurelai, claiming she embarrassed the company.On 27 June 2011, the FBI executed another search warrant in Hamilton, Ohio. The local media connected the raid to the LulzSec investigation; however, the warrant was sealed, the name of the target was not revealed, and the FBI office in Cincinnati refused to comment on any possible connection between the group and the raid. No one was charged with a crime after the FBI served the warrant. Some reports suggested the house may have belonged to former LulzSec member m_nerva, whom was originally suspected of leaking a number of the group's logs to the press, and information leading to the warrant supplied by Ryan Cleary.On 19 July 2011, the London Metropolitan Police announced the arrest of LulzSec member Tflow. A 16-year-old male was arrested in South London on charges of violating the Computer Misuse Act, as part of an operation involving the arrest of several other hackers affiliated with Anonymous in the United States and United Kingdom. LulzSec once again denied that any of their membership had been arrested, stating \"there are seven of us, and we're all still here.\"On the same day the FBI arrested 21-year-old Lance Moore in Las Cruces, New Mexico, accusing him of stealing thousands of documents and applications from AT&T that LulzSec published as part of their so called \"final release\".The Police Central E-Crime Unit arrested an 18-year-old man from Shetland on 27 July 2011 suspected of being LulzSec member Topiary. They also searched the house of a 17-year-old from Lincolnshire possibly connected to the investigation, interviewing him. Scotland Yard later identified the man arrested as Yell, Shetland resident Jake Davis. He was charged with unauthorized access of a computer under the Computer Misuse Act 1990, encouraging or assisting criminal activity under the Serious Crime Act 2007, conspiracy to launch a denial-of-service attack against the Serious Organised Crime Unit contrary to the Criminal Law Act 1977, and criminal conspiracy also under the Criminal Law Act 1977. Police confiscated a Dell laptop and a 100-gigabyte hard drive that ran 16 different virtual machines. Details relating to an attack on Sony and hundreds of thousands of email addresses and passwords were found on the computer. A London court released Davis on bail under the conditions that he live under curfew with his parents and have no access to the internet. His lawyer Gideon Cammerman stated that, while his client did help publicize LulzSec and Anonymous attacks, he lacked the technical skills to have been anything but a sympathizer.In early September 2011, Scotland Yard made two further arrests relating to LulzSec. Police arrested a 24-year-old male in Mexborough, South Yorkshire and a 20-year-old male in Warminster, Wiltshire. The two were accused of conspiring to commit offenses under the Computer Misuse Act of 1990; police said that the arrests related to investigations into LulzSec member Kayla.On 22 September 2011, the FBI arrested Cody Kretsinger, a 23-year-old from Phoenix, Arizona who was indicted on charges of conspiracy and the unauthorized impairment of a protected computer. He is suspected of using the name \"recursion\" and assisting LulzSec in their early hack against Sony Pictures Entertainment, though he allegedly erased the hard drives he used to carry out the attack. Kretsinger was released on his own recognizance under the conditions that he not access the internet except while at work and that he not travel to any states other than Arizona, California, or Illinois. The case against him was filed in Los Angeles, where Sony Pictures is located. Kretsinger pleaded guilty on 5 April 2012 to one count of conspiracy and one count of unauthorized impairment of a protected computer. On 19 April 2013, Kretsinger was sentenced for the \"unauthorized impairment of protected computers\" to one year in federal prison, one year of home detention following the completion of his prison sentence, a fine of $605,663 in restitution to Sony Pictures and 1000 hours of community service.On 8 August 2013, Raynaldo Rivera, age 21, known by the online moniker \"neuron\", of Chandler, Arizona, was sentenced to one year and one day in federal prison by United States District Judge John A. Kronstadt. In addition to the prison sentence, Judge Kronstadt ordered Rivera to serve 13 months of home detention, to perform 1,000 hours of community service and to pay $605,663 in restitution to Sony Pictures.On 6 March 2012, two men from Great Britain, one from the United States, and two from Ireland were charged in connection to their alleged involvement with LulzSec. The FBI revealed that supposed LulzSec leader Hector Xavier Monsegur, who went by the username Sabu, had been aiding law enforcement since pleading guilty to twelve counts, including conspiracy and computer hacking, on 15 August 2011 as part of a plea deal. In exchange for his cooperation, federal prosecutors agreed not to prosecute Monsegur for his computer hacking, and also not to prosecute him for two attempts to sell marijuana, possession of an illegal handgun, purchasing stolen property, charging $15,000 to his former employer's credit card in a case of identity theft, and directing people to buy prescription drugs from illegal sources. He still faces a misdemeanor charge of impersonating a federal agent. Five suspects were charged with conspiracy: Jake Davis, accused of being the hacker \"Topiary\" (who had been previously arrested); Ryan Ackroyd of London, accused of being \"Kayla\"; Darren Martyn of Ireland, accused of being \"pwnsauce\"; Donncha O\u2019Cearrbhail of Ireland, accused of being \"palladium\"; and Jeremy Hammond of Chicago, accused of being \"Anarchaos\". While not a member of LulzSec, authorities suspect Hammond of being a member of Anonymous and charged him with access device fraud and hacking in relation to his supposed involvement in the December 2011 attack on intelligence company Stratfor as part of Operation AntiSec.On 8 April 2013, Jake 'Topiary' Davis and three other LulzSec members pleaded guilty to charges of computer hacking at Southwark Crown Court in London.On 24 April 2013, Australian Federal Police arrested 24-year-old Matthew Flannery of Point Clare, who boasted on Facebook \"I\u2019m the leader of LulzSec\". Flannery, who went by the username Aush0k, was arrested for the alleged hacking of the Narrabri Shire Council website on which homepage sexually explicit text and an image were left. On 27 August 2014, Flannery entered guilty pleas to five charges of making unauthorised modification of data to cause impairment, and dishonestly obtaining the Commonwealth Bank details of a woman. Flannery, who said the reference to LulzSec was a joke, lost his job of computer technician in a security company. On 16 October 2014, he was sentenced to 15 months of house arrest which continues until mid-April 2016, alongside a 12 months good behaviour bond."

    "instruction": "Communications & Information Services Corps\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Communications and Information Services Corps (CIS) (Irish: An C\u00f3r Seirbh\u00eds\u00ed Cumars\u00e1ide agus Eolais) \u2013 formerly the Army Corps of Signals \u2013 is one of the combat support corps of the Irish Defence Forces, the military of Ireland. It is responsible for the installation, maintenance and operation of communications and information systems for the command, control and administration of the Defence Forces, and the facilitation of accurate, real-time sharing of intelligence between the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps branches at home and overseas.The CIS Corps is headquartered at McKee Barracks, Dublin, and comes under the command of an officer of Colonel rank, known as the Director of CIS Corps.\n\n\n\n== Mission ==\n\nFormerly the Army Corps of Signals, the Communications and Information Services Corps is responsible for the development and operation of Information Technology and Telecommunications systems in support of Defence Forces tasks. It is also responsible for coordinating all communications \u2013 radio and line \u2013 and information systems, communications research and updating of communications in line with modern developments and operational requirements. The CIS Corps is tasked with utilising networking and information technologies in order to dramatically increase Defence Force operational effectiveness through the provision of timely and accurate information to the appropriate commander, along with the real time efficient sharing of information and intelligence with the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps, as well as with multinational partners involved in international peacekeeping and other actors as required.This role includes the development and maintenance of a secure nationwide Defence Forces Telecommunications Network (DFTN), which can support both protected voice and data services, and the provision and maintenance of encrypted military communications equipment for use by Defence Forces personnel at home and abroad. CIS Corps units are dispersed throughout the DF giving Communications and IT support to each of the Army Brigades; Naval Service, Air Corps, Defence Forces Training Centre (DFTC) and Defence Forces Headquarters (DFHQ). The CIS Corps have Base Workshops where detailed maintenance, research and development is conducted.The CIS Corps collar flash features the angel Gabriel, the messenger of God, behind a signal shield and the caption \"C\u00f3r Comhartha\u00edochta\". This is the Irish translation for 'Signals Corps', while the translation for Communications and Information Services Corps is \"An C\u00f3r Seirbh\u00eds\u00ed Cumars\u00e1ide agus Eolais\".\n\n== Signals intelligence & cyber ==\nThe Communications and Information Services (CIS) Corps works with the Defence Forces intelligence branch, the Directorate of Military Intelligence (J2), with regard to signals intelligence (SIGINT), and houses a dedicated SIGINT element within the Corps. The DF CIS Corps has the ability to intercept and monitor communications, remotely collect data, and process it. Under Irish legislation, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 and Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 provides the Defence Forces with the legal authority to conduct domestic intelligence operations involving espionage, electronic communications and stored electronic information in order to safeguard and maintain the security of the state.The CIS Corps along with the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, the national police force, provide a significant domestic support role to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in countering cyber-attacks, protecting critical national infrastructure and securing government communications. CIS is responsible for cyber security within the Defence Forces, and maintains a capability in that area for the purpose of protecting its own networks and users domestic and foreign. In 2016 the establishment of the Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT) in DFHQ CIS Company was revealed.In July 2015, leaked email correspondence from Hacking Team \u2013 a private Italian spying and eavesdropping software company \u2013 reportedly showed members of the Irish CIS Corps in discussions with the company to purchase intrusion and surveillance \"solutions\" for the lawful interception of online communications, such as monitoring incoming and outgoing emails, browsing activity, Skype calls, remotely switching on webcams and microphones and remotely taking control of devices. A Defence Forces spokesperson said that for operational security reasons, it could not comment on specific elements of the activities of the CIS Corps, but confirmed that no goods or services were purchased from the company in question.The CIS Corps deployed 'ethical hackers' to fight back against the Health Service Executive ransomware attack in mid-2021, and sent CIS personnel to hospitals and HSE offices in order to decrypt devices affected by the cyberattack onsite.

      "context": "Communications & Information Services Corps\n\n==Introduction==\nThe Communications and Information Services Corps (CIS) (Irish: An C\u00f3r Seirbh\u00eds\u00ed Cumars\u00e1ide agus Eolais) \u2013 formerly the Army Corps of Signals \u2013 is one of the combat support corps of the Irish Defence Forces, the military of Ireland. It is responsible for the installation, maintenance and operation of communications and information systems for the command, control and administration of the Defence Forces, and the facilitation of accurate, real-time sharing of intelligence between the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps branches at home and overseas.The CIS Corps is headquartered at McKee Barracks, Dublin, and comes under the command of an officer of Colonel rank, known as the Director of CIS Corps.\n\n\n\n== Mission ==\n\nFormerly the Army Corps of Signals, the Communications and Information Services Corps is responsible for the development and operation of Information Technology and Telecommunications systems in support of Defence Forces tasks. It is also responsible for coordinating all communications \u2013 radio and line \u2013 and information systems, communications research and updating of communications in line with modern developments and operational requirements. The CIS Corps is tasked with utilising networking and information technologies in order to dramatically increase Defence Force operational effectiveness through the provision of timely and accurate information to the appropriate commander, along with the real time efficient sharing of information and intelligence with the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps, as well as with multinational partners involved in international peacekeeping and other actors as required.This role includes the development and maintenance of a secure nationwide Defence Forces Telecommunications Network (DFTN), which can support both protected voice and data services, and the provision and maintenance of encrypted military communications equipment for use by Defence Forces personnel at home and abroad. CIS Corps units are dispersed throughout the DF giving Communications and IT support to each of the Army Brigades; Naval Service, Air Corps, Defence Forces Training Centre (DFTC) and Defence Forces Headquarters (DFHQ). The CIS Corps have Base Workshops where detailed maintenance, research and development is conducted.The CIS Corps collar flash features the angel Gabriel, the messenger of God, behind a signal shield and the caption \"C\u00f3r Comhartha\u00edochta\". This is the Irish translation for 'Signals Corps', while the translation for Communications and Information Services Corps is \"An C\u00f3r Seirbh\u00eds\u00ed Cumars\u00e1ide agus Eolais\".\n\n== Signals intelligence & cyber ==\nThe Communications and Information Services (CIS) Corps works with the Defence Forces intelligence branch, the Directorate of Military Intelligence (J2), with regard to signals intelligence (SIGINT), and houses a dedicated SIGINT element within the Corps. The DF CIS Corps has the ability to intercept and monitor communications, remotely collect data, and process it. Under Irish legislation, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 and Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 provides the Defence Forces with the legal authority to conduct domestic intelligence operations involving espionage, electronic communications and stored electronic information in order to safeguard and maintain the security of the state.The CIS Corps along with the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, the national police force, provide a significant domestic support role to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in countering cyber-attacks, protecting critical national infrastructure and securing government communications. CIS is responsible for cyber security within the Defence Forces, and maintains a capability in that area for the purpose of protecting its own networks and users domestic and foreign. In 2016 the establishment of the Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT) in DFHQ CIS Company was revealed.In July 2015, leaked email correspondence from Hacking Team \u2013 a private Italian spying and eavesdropping software company \u2013 reportedly showed members of the Irish CIS Corps in discussions with the company to purchase intrusion and surveillance \"solutions\" for the lawful interception of online communications, such as monitoring incoming and outgoing emails, browsing activity, Skype calls, remotely switching on webcams and microphones and remotely taking control of devices. A Defence Forces spokesperson said that for operational security reasons, it could not comment on specific elements of the activities of the CIS Corps, but confirmed that no goods or services were purchased from the company in question.The CIS Corps deployed 'ethical hackers' to fight back against the Health Service Executive ransomware attack in mid-2021, and sent CIS personnel to hospitals and HSE offices in order to decrypt devices affected by the cyberattack onsite. Reservists were particularly useful to this effort due to their cybersecurity skills and experience gleaned from the private sector.\n\n== CIS School ==\n\nSoldiers join the Communications and Information Services Corps in one of the following apprenticeship trades;\n\nCommunication Operative\nElectronic Engineering Technician\nSoftware Engineering Technician\nInformation Technology Support Technician\nCommunications & Information Services Technician\nRegimental Signaller\nRadio Instructor\nTelephone Maintenance Technician\nData Communications Technician\nMicrowave Systems Technician\nNetwork AdministratorAll personnel do their basic military training.\nThe CIS School runs a large number of CIS related courses, including a degree programme in Military Communications for CIS technicians in association with the Institute of Technology, Carlow.There are 3 sections to the CIS School, providing training in the areas of operational procedures, technical proficiency and simulation.\nProcedural and Operations Section (Proc/Ops);\n\nCommunications Operative Course\nDetachment Commanders Course\nAerial Riggers Course\nRegimental Signals Course\nCIS Standard NCO Course\nCIS Young Officers CourseTechnical Section;\n\nCIS Trainee Technician Scheme (TTS)\nTechnical Training Advancement Courses\nStrategic Applications TrainingSimulation Section;\n\nDigital Indoor Range Theatres (DIRT)\nCommand and Staff TrainerThe DIRT range is a digital indoor shooting range in which trainees can be assessed on their marksmanship skills for the various small arms weapons used by the DF.

    "instruction": "Signcryption\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, signcryption is a public-key primitive that simultaneously performs the functions of both digital signature and encryption.\nEncryption and digital signature are two fundamental cryptographic tools that can guarantee the confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation. Until 1997, they were viewed as important but distinct building blocks of various cryptographic systems. In public key schemes, a traditional method is to digitally sign a message then followed by an encryption (signature-then-encryption) that can have two problems: Low efficiency and high cost of such summation, and the case that any arbitrary scheme cannot guarantee security. Signcryption is a relatively new cryptographic technique that is supposed to perform the functions of digital signature and encryption in a single logical step and can effectively decrease the computational costs and communication overheads in comparison with the traditional signature-then-encryption schemes.\nSigncryption provides the properties of both digital signatures and encryption schemes in a way that is more efficient than signing and encrypting separately. This means that at least some aspect of its efficiency (for example the computation time) is better than any hybrid of digital signature and encryption schemes, under a particular model of security. Note that sometimes  hybrid encryption can be employed instead of simple encryption, and a single session-key reused for several encryptions to achieve better overall efficiency across many signature-encryptions than a signcryption scheme but the session-key reuse causes the system to lose security under even the relatively weak CPA model. This is the reason why a random session key is used for each message in a hybrid encryption scheme but for a given level of security (i.e., a given model, say CPA), a signcryption scheme should be more efficient than any simple signature-hybrid encryption combination.\n\n== Scheme ==\nA signcryption scheme typically consists of three algorithms: Key Generation (Gen), Signcryption (SC), and Unsigncryption (USC). Gen generates a pair of keys for any user, SC is generally a probabilistic algorithm, and USC is most likely deterministic. Any signcryption scheme should have the following properties:\nCorrectness: Any signcryption scheme should be verifiably correct.\nEfficiency: The computational costs and communication overheads of a signcryption scheme should be smaller than those of the best known signature-then-encryption schemes with the same provided functionalities.\nSecurity: A signcryption scheme should simultaneously fulfill the security attributes of an encryption scheme and those of a digital signature. Such additional properties mainly include: Confidentiality, Unforgeability, Integrity, and Non-repudiation. Some signcryption schemes provide further attributes such as Public verifiability and Forward secrecy of message confidentiality while the others do not provide them. Such properties are the attributes that are required in many applications while the others may not require them. Hereunder, the above-mentioned attributes are briefly described.Confidentiality: It should be computationally infeasible for an adaptive attacker to gain any partial information on the contents of a signcrypted text, without knowledge of the sender's or designated recipient's private key.\nUnforgeability: It should be computationally infeasible for an adaptive attacker to masquerade as an honest sender in creating an authentic signcrypted text that can be accepted by the unsigncryption algorithm.\nNon-repudiation: The recipient should have the ability to prove to a third party (e.g. a judge) that the sender has sent the signcrypted text. This ensures that the sender cannot deny his previously signcrypted texts.\nIntegrity: The recipient should be able to verify that the received message is the original one that was sent by the sender.\nPublic verifiability: Any third party without any need for the private key of sender or recipient can verify that the signcrypted text is the valid signcryption of its corresponding message.\nForward secrecy of message confidentiality: If the long-term private key of the sender is compromised, no one should be able to extract the plaintext of previously signcrypted texts. In a regular signcryption scheme, when the long-term private key is compromised, all the previously issued signatures will not be trustworthy any more. Since the threat of key exposure is becoming more acute as the cryptographic computations are performed more frequently on poorly protected devices such as mobile phones, forward secrecy seems an essential attribute in such systems.\n\n== Applications ==\nSigncryption is seen to have several applications including the following:\n\nSecure and authentic email.\nE-commerce and M-commerce applications that often require confidentiality, authenticity, and perhaps non-repudiation.\n\nQ: How does signcryption impact the trust and transparency of communication in applications where third-party verification is necessary?",

It is also known as cascade encryption, cascade ciphering, multiple encryption, and superencipherment. Superencryption refers to the outer-level encryption of a multiple encryption.\nSome cryptographers, like Matthew Green of Johns Hopkins University, say multiple encryption addresses a problem that mostly doesn't exist: Modern ciphers rarely get broken... You\u2019re far more likely to get hit by malware or an implementation bug than you are to suffer a catastrophic attack on AES. .... and in that quote lies the reason for multiple encryption, namely poor implementation.

Since those ciphertexts are the plaintexts used by the second cipher, the second cipher may be rendered vulnerable to attacks based on known plaintext properties (see references below).\nThis is the case when the first layer is a program P that always adds the same string S of characters at the beginning (or end) of all ciphertexts (commonly known as a magic number). When found in a file, the string S allows an operating system to know that the program P has to be launched in order to decrypt the file. This string should be removed before adding a second layer.\nTo prevent this kind of attack, one can use the method provided by Bruce Schneier:\nGenerate a random pad R of the same size as the plaintext.\nEncrypt R using the first cipher and key.\nXOR the plaintext with the pad, then encrypt the result using the second cipher and a different (!) key.\nConcatenate both ciphertexts in order to build the final ciphertext.A cryptanalyst must break both ciphers to get any information.

    "instruction": "Context: Temporal Key Integrity Protocol\n\n==Introduction==\nTemporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP ) is a security protocol used in the IEEE 802.11 wireless networking standard. TKIP was designed by the IEEE 802.11i task group and the Wi-Fi Alliance as an interim solution to replace WEP without requiring the replacement of legacy hardware. This was necessary because the breaking of WEP had left Wi-Fi networks without viable link-layer security, and a solution was required for already deployed hardware. However, TKIP itself is no longer considered secure, and was deprecated in the 2012 revision of the 802.11 standard.\n\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn October 31, 2002, the Wi-Fi Alliance endorsed TKIP under the name Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA).  The IEEE endorsed the final version of TKIP, along with more robust solutions such as 802.1X and the AES based CCMP, when they published IEEE 802.11i-2004 on 23 July 2004.  The Wi-Fi Alliance soon afterwards adopted the full specification under the marketing name WPA2.TKIP was resolved to be deprecated by the IEEE in January 2009.\n\n== Technical details ==\nTKIP and the related WPA standard implement three new security features to address security problems encountered in WEP protected networks. First, TKIP implements a key mixing function that combines the secret root key with the initialization vector before passing it to the  RC4 cipher initialization. WEP, in comparison, merely concatenated the initialization vector to the root key, and passed this value to the RC4 routine. This permitted the vast majority of the RC4 based WEP related key attacks. Second, WPA implements a sequence counter to protect against replay attacks. Packets received out of order will be rejected by the access point. Finally, TKIP implements a 64-bit Message Integrity Check (MIC) and re-initializes the sequence number each time when a new key (Temporal Key) is used.To be able to run on legacy WEP hardware with minor upgrades, TKIP uses RC4 as its cipher. TKIP also provides a rekeying mechanism. TKIP ensures that every data packet is sent with a unique encryption key(Interim Key/Temporal Key + Packet Sequence Counter).Key mixing increases the complexity of decoding the keys by giving an attacker substantially less data that has been encrypted using any one key. WPA2 also implements a new message integrity code, MIC. The message integrity check prevents forged packets from being accepted. Under WEP it was possible to alter a packet whose content was known even if it had not been decrypted.\n\n== Security ==\nTKIP uses the same underlying mechanism as WEP, and consequently is vulnerable to a number of similar attacks. The message integrity check, per-packet key hashing, broadcast key rotation, and a sequence counter discourage many attacks. The key mixing function also eliminates the WEP key recovery attacks.\nNotwithstanding these changes, the weakness of some of these additions have allowed for new, although narrower, attacks.\n\n\n*** Packet spoofing and decryption ***\nTKIP is vulnerable to a MIC key recovery attack that, if successfully executed, permits an attacker to transmit and decrypt arbitrary packets on the network being attacked. The current publicly available TKIP-specific attacks do not reveal the Pairwise Master Key or the Pairwise Temporal Keys. On November 8, 2008, Martin Beck and Erik Tews released a paper detailing how to recover the MIC key and transmit a few packets. This attack was improved by Mathy Vanhoef and Frank Piessens in 2013, where they increase the amount of packets an attacker can transmit, and show how an attacker can also decrypt arbitrary packets.The basis of the attack is an extension of the WEP chop-chop attack. Because WEP uses a cryptographically insecure checksum mechanism (CRC32), an attacker can guess individual bytes of a packet, and the wireless access point will confirm or deny whether or not the guess is correct. If the guess is correct, the attacker will be able to detect the guess is correct and continue to guess other bytes of the packet. However, unlike the chop-chop attack against a WEP network, the attacker must wait for at least 60 seconds after an incorrect guess (a successful circumvention of the CRC32 mechanism) before continuing the attack. This is because although TKIP continues to use the CRC32 checksum mechanism, it implements an additional MIC code named Michael. If two incorrect Michael MIC codes are received within 60 seconds, the access point will implement countermeasures, meaning it will rekey the TKIP session key, thus changing future keystreams. Accordingly, attacks on TKIP will wait an appropriate amount of time to avoid these countermeasures. Because ARP packets are easily identified by their size, and the vast majority of the contents of this packet would be known to an attacker, the number of bytes an attacker must guess using the above method is rather small (approximately 14 bytes). Beck and Tews estimate recovery of 12 bytes is possible in about 12 minutes on a typical network, which would allow an attacker to transmit 3\u20137 packets of at most 28 bytes. Vanhoef and Piessens improved this technique by relying on fragmentation, allowing an attacker to transmit arbitrary many packets, each at most 112 bytes in size. The Vanhoef\u2013Piessens attacks also can be used to decrypt arbitrary packets of the attack's choice.\nAn attacker already has access to the entire ciphertext packet. Upon retrieving the entire plaintext of the same packet, the attacker has access to the keystream of the packet, as well as the MIC code of the session. Using this information the attacker can construct a new packet and transmit it on the network. To circumvent the WPA implemented replay protection, the attacks use QoS channels to transmit these newly constructed packets. An attacker able to transmit these packets may be able to implement any number of attacks, including ARP poisoning attacks, denial of service, and other similar attacks, with no need of being associated with the network.\n\n\n*** Royal Holloway attack ***\nA group of security researchers at the Information Security Group at Royal Holloway, University of London reported a theoretical attack on TKIP which exploits the underlying RC4 encryption mechanism. TKIP uses a similar key structure to WEP with the low 16-bit value of a sequence counter (used to prevent replay attacks) being expanded into the 24-bit \"IV\", and this sequence counter always increments on every new packet. An attacker can use this key structure to improve existing attacks on RC4. In particular, if the same data is encrypted multiple times, an attacker can learn this information from only 224 connections. While they claim that this attack is on the verge of practicality, only simulations were performed, and the attack has not been demonstrated in practice.\n\n\n*** NOMORE attack ***\nIn 2015, security researchers from KU Leuven presented new attacks against RC4 in both TLS and WPA-TKIP. Dubbed the Numerous Occurrence MOnitoring & Recovery Exploit (NOMORE) attack, it is the first attack of its kind that was demonstrated in practice. The attack against WPA-TKIP can be completed within an hour, and allows an attacker to decrypt and inject arbitrary packets.\n\n== Legacy ==\nZDNet reported on June 18, 2010, that WEP & TKIP would soon be disallowed on Wi-Fi devices by the Wi-Fi alliance.\nHowever, a survey in 2013 showed that it was still in widespread use.\n\nQuestion: What security feature in TKIP discourages packet spoofing and decryption attacks?\n\nAnswer:",

Finally, TKIP implements a 64-bit Message Integrity Check (MIC) and re-initializes the sequence number each time when a new key (Temporal Key) is used.To be able to run on legacy WEP hardware with minor upgrades, TKIP uses RC4 as its cipher. TKIP also provides a rekeying mechanism. TKIP ensures that every data packet is sent with a unique encryption key(Interim Key/Temporal Key + Packet Sequence Counter).Key mixing increases the complexity of decoding the keys by giving an attacker substantially less data that has been encrypted using any one key. WPA2 also implements a new message integrity code, MIC. The message integrity check prevents forged packets from being accepted. Under WEP it was possible to alter a packet whose content was known even if it had not been decrypted.\n\n== Security ==\nTKIP uses the same underlying mechanism as WEP, and consequently is vulnerable to a number of similar attacks. The message integrity check, per-packet key hashing, broadcast key rotation, and a sequence counter discourage many attacks. The key mixing function also eliminates the WEP key recovery attacks.\nNotwithstanding these changes, the weakness of some of these additions have allowed for new, although narrower, attacks.\n\n\n*** Packet spoofing and decryption ***\nTKIP is vulnerable to a MIC key recovery attack that, if successfully executed, permits an attacker to transmit and decrypt arbitrary packets on the network being attacked. The current publicly available TKIP-specific attacks do not reveal the Pairwise Master Key or the Pairwise Temporal Keys. On November 8, 2008, Martin Beck and Erik Tews released a paper detailing how to recover the MIC key and transmit a few packets. This attack was improved by Mathy Vanhoef and Frank Piessens in 2013, where they increase the amount of packets an attacker can transmit, and show how an attacker can also decrypt arbitrary packets.The basis of the attack is an extension of the WEP chop-chop attack. Because WEP uses a cryptographically insecure checksum mechanism (CRC32), an attacker can guess individual bytes of a packet, and the wireless access point will confirm or deny whether or not the guess is correct. If the guess is correct, the attacker will be able to detect the guess is correct and continue to guess other bytes of the packet. However, unlike the chop-chop attack against a WEP network, the attacker must wait for at least 60 seconds after an incorrect guess (a successful circumvention of the CRC32 mechanism) before continuing the attack. This is because although TKIP continues to use the CRC32 checksum mechanism, it implements an additional MIC code named Michael. If two incorrect Michael MIC codes are received within 60 seconds, the access point will implement countermeasures, meaning it will rekey the TKIP session key, thus changing future keystreams. Accordingly, attacks on TKIP will wait an appropriate amount of time to avoid these countermeasures. Because ARP packets are easily identified by their size, and the vast majority of the contents of this packet would be known to an attacker, the number of bytes an attacker must guess using the above method is rather small (approximately 14 bytes). Beck and Tews estimate recovery of 12 bytes is possible in about 12 minutes on a typical network, which would allow an attacker to transmit 3\u20137 packets of at most 28 bytes. Vanhoef and Piessens improved this technique by relying on fragmentation, allowing an attacker to transmit arbitrary many packets, each at most 112 bytes in size. The Vanhoef\u2013Piessens attacks also can be used to decrypt arbitrary packets of the attack's choice.\nAn attacker already has access to the entire ciphertext packet. Upon retrieving the entire plaintext of the same packet, the attacker has access to the keystream of the packet, as well as the MIC code of the session. Using this information the attacker can construct a new packet and transmit it on the network. To circumvent the WPA implemented replay protection, the attacks use QoS channels to transmit these newly constructed packets. An attacker able to transmit these packets may be able to implement any number of attacks, including ARP poisoning attacks, denial of service, and other similar attacks, with no need of being associated with the network.\n\n\n*** Royal Holloway attack ***\nA group of security researchers at the Information Security Group at Royal Holloway, University of London reported a theoretical attack on TKIP which exploits the underlying RC4 encryption mechanism. TKIP uses a similar key structure to WEP with the low 16-bit value of a sequence counter (used to prevent replay attacks) being expanded into the 24-bit \"IV\", and this sequence counter always increments on every new packet. An attacker can use this key structure to improve existing attacks on RC4. In particular, if the same data is encrypted multiple times, an attacker can learn this information from only 224 connections. While they claim that this attack is on the verge of practicality, only simulations were performed, and the attack has not been demonstrated in practice.\n\n\n*** NOMORE attack ***\nIn 2015, security researchers from KU Leuven presented new attacks against RC4 in both TLS and WPA-TKIP. Dubbed the Numerous Occurrence MOnitoring & Recovery Exploit (NOMORE) attack, it is the first attack of its kind that was demonstrated in practice. The attack against WPA-TKIP can be completed within an hour, and allows an attacker to decrypt and inject arbitrary packets.\n\n== Legacy ==\nZDNet reported on June 18, 2010, that WEP & TKIP would soon be disallowed on Wi-Fi devices by the Wi-Fi alliance.\nHowever, a survey in 2013 showed that it was still in widespread use."

    "instruction": "Context: Pretty Good Privacy\n\n==Introduction==\nPretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. PGP is used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications. Phil Zimmermann developed PGP in 1991.PGP and similar software follow the OpenPGP, an open standard of PGP encryption software, standard (RFC 4880) for encrypting and decrypting data. Modern versions of PGP are interoperable with GnuPG and other OpenPGP-compliant systems.\n\n== Design ==\n\nPGP encryption uses a serial combination of hashing, data compression, symmetric-key cryptography, and finally public-key cryptography; each step uses one of several supported algorithms. Each public key is bound to a username or an e-mail address. The first version of this system was generally known as a web of trust to contrast with the X.509 system, which uses a hierarchical approach based on certificate authority and which was added to PGP implementations later. Current versions of PGP encryption include options through an automated key management server.\n\n\n*** PGP fingerprint ***\nA public key fingerprint is a shorter version of a public key. From a fingerprint, someone can validate the correct corresponding public key. A fingerprint like C3A6 5E46 7B54 77DF 3C4C 9790 4D22 B3CA 5B32 FF66 can be printed on a business card.\n\n\n*** Compatibility ***\nAs PGP evolves, versions that support newer features and algorithms can create encrypted messages that older PGP systems cannot decrypt, even with a valid private key. Therefore, it is essential that partners in PGP communication understand each other's capabilities or at least agree on PGP settings.\n\n\n*** Confidentiality ***\nPGP can be used to send messages confidentially. For this, PGP uses a hybrid cryptosystem by combining symmetric-key encryption and public-key encryption. The message is encrypted using a symmetric encryption algorithm, which requires a symmetric key generated by the sender. The symmetric key is used only once and is also called a session key. The message and its session key are sent to the receiver. The session key must be sent to the receiver so they know how to decrypt the message, but to protect it during transmission it is encrypted with the receiver's public key. Only the private key belonging to the receiver can decrypt the session key, and use it to symmetrically decrypt the message.\n\n\n*** Digital signatures ***\nPGP supports message authentication and integrity checking. The latter is used to detect whether a message has been altered since it was completed (the message integrity property) and the former, to determine whether it was actually sent by the person or entity claimed to be the sender (a digital signature). Because the content is encrypted, any changes in the message will fail the decryption with the appropriate key. The sender uses PGP to create a digital signature for the message with either the RSA or DSA algorithms. To do so, PGP computes a hash (also called a message digest) from the plaintext and then creates the digital signature from that hash using the sender's private key.\n\n\n*** Web of trust ***\n\nBoth when encrypting messages and when verifying signatures, it is critical that the public key used to send messages to someone or some entity actually does 'belong' to the intended recipient. Simply downloading a public key from somewhere is not a reliable assurance of that association; deliberate (or accidental) impersonation is possible. From its first version, PGP has always included provisions for distributing user's public keys in an 'identity certification', which is also constructed cryptographically so that any tampering (or accidental garble) is readily detectable. However, merely making a certificate that is impossible to modify without being detected is insufficient; this can prevent corruption only after the certificate has been created, not before. Users must also ensure by some means that the public key in a certificate actually does belong to the person or entity claiming it. A given public key (or more specifically, information binding a user name to a key) may be digitally signed by a third-party user to attest to the association between someone (actually a user name) and the key. There are several levels of confidence that can be included in such signatures. Although many programs read and write this information, few (if any) include this level of certification when calculating whether to trust a key.\nThe web of trust protocol was first described by Phil Zimmermann in 1992, in the manual for PGP version 2.0:\n\nAs time goes on, you will accumulate keys from other people that you may want to designate as trusted introducers.  Everyone else will each choose their own trusted introducers.  And everyone will gradually accumulate and distribute with their key a collection of certifying signatures from other people, with the expectation that anyone receiving it will trust at least one or two of the signatures.  This will cause the emergence of a decentralized fault-tolerant web of confidence for all public keys.\nThe web of trust mechanism has advantages over a centrally managed public key infrastructure scheme such as that used by S/MIME but has not been universally used. Users have to be willing to accept certificates and check their validity manually or have to simply accept them. No satisfactory solution has been found for the underlying problem.\n\n\n*** Certificates ***\n\nIn the (more recent) OpenPGP specification, trust signatures can be used to support creation of certificate authorities. A trust signature indicates both that the key belongs to its claimed owner and that the owner of the key is trustworthy to sign other keys at one level below their own. A level 0 signature is comparable to a web of trust signature since only the validity of the key is certified. A level 1 signature is similar to the trust one has in a certificate authority because a key signed to level 1 is able to issue an unlimited number of level 0 signatures. A level 2 signature is highly analogous to the trust assumption users must rely on whenever they use the default certificate authority list (like those included in web browsers); it allows the owner of the key to make other keys certificate authorities.\nPGP versions have always included a way to cancel ('revoke') public key certificates. A lost or compromised private key will require this if communication security is to be retained by that user. This is, more or less, equivalent to the certificate revocation lists of centralised PKI schemes. Recent PGP versions have also supported certificate expiration dates.\nThe problem of correctly identifying a public key as belonging to a particular user is not unique to PGP. All public key/private key cryptosystems have the same problem, even if in slightly different guises, and no fully satisfactory solution is known. PGP's original scheme at least leaves the decision as to whether or not to use its endorsement/vetting system to the user, while most other PKI schemes do not, requiring instead that every certificate attested to by a central certificate authority be accepted as correct.\n\n\n*** Security quality ***\nTo the best of publicly available information, there is no known method which will allow a person or group to break PGP encryption by cryptographic, or computational means. Indeed, in 1995, cryptographer Bruce Schneier characterized an early version as being \"the closest you're likely to get to military-grade encryption.\" Early versions of PGP have been found to have theoretical vulnerabilities and so current versions are recommended. In addition to protecting data in transit over a network, PGP encryption can also be used to protect data in long-term data storage such as disk files.  These long-term storage options are also known as data at rest, i.e. data stored, not in transit.\nThe cryptographic security of PGP encryption depends on the assumption that the algorithms used are unbreakable by direct cryptanalysis with current equipment and techniques.\nIn the original version, the RSA algorithm was used to encrypt session keys. RSA's security depends upon the one-way function nature of mathematical integer factoring. Similarly, the symmetric key algorithm used in PGP version 2 was IDEA, which might at some point in the future be found to have previously undetected cryptanalytic flaws. Specific instances of current PGP or IDEA insecurities (if they exist) are not publicly known. As current versions of PGP have added additional encryption algorithms, their cryptographic vulnerability varies with the algorithm used. However, none of the algorithms in current use are publicly known to have cryptanalytic weaknesses.\nNew versions of PGP are released periodically and vulnerabilities fixed by developers as they come to light. Any agency wanting to read PGP messages would probably use easier means than standard cryptanalysis, e.g. rubber-hose cryptanalysis or black-bag cryptanalysis (e.g. installing some form of trojan horse or keystroke logging software/hardware on the target computer to capture encrypted keyrings and their passwords). The FBI has already used this attack against PGP in its investigations. However, any such vulnerabilities apply not just to PGP but to any conventional encryption software.\nIn 2003, an incident involving seized Psion PDAs belonging to members of the Red Brigade indicated that neither the Italian police nor the FBI were able to decrypt PGP-encrypted files stored on them.A second incident in December 2006, (see In re Boucher), involving US customs agents who seized a laptop PC that allegedly contained child pornography, indicates that US government agencies find it \"nearly impossible\" to access PGP-encrypted files. Additionally, a magistrate judge ruling on the case in November 2007 has stated that forcing the suspect to reveal his PGP passphrase would violate his Fifth Amendment rights i.e. a suspect's constitutional right not to incriminate himself. The Fifth Amendment issue was opened again as the government appealed the case, after which a federal district judge ordered the defendant to provide the key.Evidence suggests that as of 2007, British police investigators are unable to break PGP, so instead have resorted to using RIPA legislation to demand the passwords/keys. In November 2009 a British citizen was convicted under RIPA legislation and jailed for nine months for refusing to provide police investigators with encryption keys to PGP-encrypted files.PGP as a cryptosystem has been criticized for complexity of the standard, implementation and very low usability of the user interface including by recognized figures in cryptography research. It uses an ineffective serialization format for storage of both keys and encrypted data, which resulted in signature-spamming attacks on public keys of prominent developers of GNU Privacy Guard. Backwards compatibility of the OpenPGP standard results in usage of relatively weak default choices of cryptographic primitives (CAST5 cipher, CFB mode, S2K password hashing). The standard has been also criticized for leaking metadata, usage of long-term keys and lack of forward secrecy. Popular end-user implementations have suffered from various signature-striping, cipher downgrade and metadata leakage vulnerabilities which have been attributed to the complexity of the standard.\n\n== PGP Corporation encryption applications ==\nThis section describes commercial programs available from PGP Corporation.  For information on other programs compatible with the OpenPGP specification, see External links below.While originally used primarily for encrypting the contents of e-mail messages and attachments from a desktop client, PGP products have been diversified since 2002 into a set of encryption applications that can be managed by an optional central policy server.  PGP encryption applications include e-mails and attachments, digital signatures, full disk encryption, file and folder security, protection for IM sessions, batch file transfer encryption, and protection for files and folders stored on network servers and, more recently, encrypted or signed HTTP request/responses by means of a client-side (Enigform) and a server-side (mod openpgp) module. There is also a WordPress plugin available, called wp-enigform-authentication, that takes advantage of the session management features of Enigform with mod_openpgp.\nThe PGP Desktop 9.x family includes PGP Desktop Email, PGP Whole Disk Encryption, and PGP NetShare. Additionally, a number of Desktop bundles are also available. Depending on the application, the products feature desktop e-mail, digital signatures, IM security, whole disk encryption, file, and folder security, encrypted self-extracting archives, and secure shredding of deleted files. Capabilities are licensed in different ways depending on the features required.\nThe PGP Universal Server 2.x management console handles centralized deployment, security policy, policy enforcement, key management, and reporting.  It is used for automated e-mail encryption in the gateway and manages PGP Desktop 9.x clients. In addition to its local keyserver, PGP Universal Server works with the PGP public keyserver\u2014called the PGP Global Directory\u2014to find recipient keys. It has the capability of delivering e-mail securely when no recipient key is found via a secure HTTPS browser session.\nWith PGP Desktop 9.x managed by PGP Universal Server 2.x, first released in 2005, all PGP encryption applications are based on a new proxy-based architecture. These newer versions of PGP software eliminate the use of e-mail plug-ins and insulate the user from changes to other desktop applications. All desktop and server operations are now based on security policies and operate in an automated fashion. The PGP Universal server automates the creation, management, and expiration of keys, sharing these keys among all PGP encryption applications.\nThe Symantec PGP platform has now undergone a rename.  PGP Desktop is now known as Symantec Encryption Desktop (SED), and the PGP Universal Server is now known as Symantec Encryption Management Server (SEMS). The current shipping versions are Symantec Encryption Desktop 10.3.0 (Windows and macOS platforms) and Symantec Encryption Server 3.3.2.\nAlso available are PGP Command-Line, which enables command line-based encryption and signing of information for storage, transfer, and backup, as well as the PGP Support Package for BlackBerry which enables RIM BlackBerry devices to enjoy sender-to-recipient messaging encryption.\nNew versions of PGP applications use both OpenPGP and the S/MIME, allowing communications with any user of a NIST specified standard.\n\n== OpenPGP ==\nWithin PGP Inc., there was still concern surrounding patent issues. RSADSI was challenging the continuation of the Viacrypt RSA license to the newly merged firm. The company adopted an informal internal standard that they called \"Unencumbered PGP\" which would \"use no algorithm with licensing difficulties\".  Because of PGP encryption's importance worldwide, many wanted to write their own software that would interoperate with PGP 5. Zimmermann became convinced that an open standard for PGP encryption was critical for them and for the cryptographic community as a whole. In July 1997, PGP Inc. proposed to the IETF that there be a standard called OpenPGP. They gave the IETF permission to use the name OpenPGP to describe this new standard as well as any program that supported the standard. The IETF accepted the proposal and started the OpenPGP Working Group.\nOpenPGP is on the Internet Standards Track and is under active development. Many e-mail clients provide OpenPGP-compliant email security as described in RFC 3156. The current specification is RFC 4880 (November 2007), the successor to RFC 2440. RFC 4880 specifies a suite of required algorithms consisting of ElGamal encryption, DSA, Triple DES and SHA-1. In addition to these algorithms, the standard recommends RSA as described in PKCS #1 v1.5 for encryption and signing, as well as AES-128, CAST-128 and IDEA. Beyond these, many other algorithms are supported. The standard was extended to support Camellia cipher by RFC 5581 in 2009, and signing and key exchange based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) (i.e. ECDSA and ECDH) by RFC 6637 in 2012.  Support for ECC encryption was added by the proposed RFC 4880bis in 2014.\nThe Free Software Foundation has developed its own OpenPGP-compliant software suite called GNU Privacy Guard, freely available together with all source code under the GNU General Public License and is maintained separately from several graphical user interfaces that interact with the GnuPG library for encryption, decryption, and signing functions (see KGPG, Seahorse, MacGPG). Several other vendors have also developed OpenPGP-compliant software.\nThe development of an open source OpenPGP-compliant library, OpenPGP.js, written in JavaScript and supported by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union, has allowed web-based applications to use PGP encryption in the web browser.\n\nPGP\nRFC 1991 PGP Message Exchange Formats (obsolete)\nOpenPGP\nRFC 2440 OpenPGP Message Format (obsolete)\nRFC 4880 OpenPGP Message Format\nRFC 5581 The Camellia Cipher in OpenPGP\nRFC 6637 Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) in OpenPGP\ndraft-ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh OpenPGP Message Format\nPGP/MIME\nRFC 2015 MIME Security with Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)\nRFC 3156 MIME Security with OpenPGPOpenPGP's encryption can ensure the secure delivery of files and messages, as well as provide verification of who created or sent the message using a process called digital signing. The open source office suite LibreOffice implemented document signing with OpenPGP as of version 5.4.0 on Linux. Using OpenPGP for communication requires participation by both the sender and recipient. OpenPGP can also be used to secure sensitive files when they are stored in vulnerable places like mobile devices or in the cloud.\n\n== Limitations ==\nWith the advancement of cryptography, parts of PGP have been criticized for being dated:\n\nThe long length of PGP public keys\nDifficulty for the users to comprehend and poor usability\nLack of ubiquity\nLack of forward secrecyIn October 2017, the ROCA vulnerability was announced, which affects RSA keys generated by buggy Infineon firmware used on Yubikey 4 tokens, often used with PGP.

Everyone else will each choose their own trusted introducers.  And everyone will gradually accumulate and distribute with their key a collection of certifying signatures from other people, with the expectation that anyone receiving it will trust at least one or two of the signatures.  This will cause the emergence of a decentralized fault-tolerant web of confidence for all public keys.\nThe web of trust mechanism has advantages over a centrally managed public key infrastructure scheme such as that used by S/MIME but has not been universally used. Users have to be willing to accept certificates and check their validity manually or have to simply accept them. No satisfactory solution has been found for the underlying problem.\n\n\n*** Certificates ***\n\nIn the (more recent) OpenPGP specification, trust signatures can be used to support creation of certificate authorities. A trust signature indicates both that the key belongs to its claimed owner and that the owner of the key is trustworthy to sign other keys at one level below their own. A level 0 signature is comparable to a web of trust signature since only the validity of the key is certified. A level 1 signature is similar to the trust one has in a certificate authority because a key signed to level 1 is able to issue an unlimited number of level 0 signatures. A level 2 signature is highly analogous to the trust assumption users must rely on whenever they use the default certificate authority list (like those included in web browsers); it allows the owner of the key to make other keys certificate authorities.\nPGP versions have always included a way to cancel ('revoke') public key certificates. A lost or compromised private key will require this if communication security is to be retained by that user. This is, more or less, equivalent to the certificate revocation lists of centralised PKI schemes. Recent PGP versions have also supported certificate expiration dates.\nThe problem of correctly identifying a public key as belonging to a particular user is not unique to PGP. All public key/private key cryptosystems have the same problem, even if in slightly different guises, and no fully satisfactory solution is known. PGP's original scheme at least leaves the decision as to whether or not to use its endorsement/vetting system to the user, while most other PKI schemes do not, requiring instead that every certificate attested to by a central certificate authority be accepted as correct.\n\n\n*** Security quality ***\nTo the best of publicly available information, there is no known method which will allow a person or group to break PGP encryption by cryptographic, or computational means. Indeed, in 1995, cryptographer Bruce Schneier characterized an early version as being \"the closest you're likely to get to military-grade encryption.\" Early versions of PGP have been found to have theoretical vulnerabilities and so current versions are recommended. In addition to protecting data in transit over a network, PGP encryption can also be used to protect data in long-term data storage such as disk files.  These long-term storage options are also known as data at rest, i.e. data stored, not in transit.\nThe cryptographic security of PGP encryption depends on the assumption that the algorithms used are unbreakable by direct cryptanalysis with current equipment and techniques.\nIn the original version, the RSA algorithm was used to encrypt session keys. RSA's security depends upon the one-way function nature of mathematical integer factoring. Similarly, the symmetric key algorithm used in PGP version 2 was IDEA, which might at some point in the future be found to have previously undetected cryptanalytic flaws. Specific instances of current PGP or IDEA insecurities (if they exist) are not publicly known. As current versions of PGP have added additional encryption algorithms, their cryptographic vulnerability varies with the algorithm used. However, none of the algorithms in current use are publicly known to have cryptanalytic weaknesses.\nNew versions of PGP are released periodically and vulnerabilities fixed by developers as they come to light. Any agency wanting to read PGP messages would probably use easier means than standard cryptanalysis, e.g. rubber-hose cryptanalysis or black-bag cryptanalysis (e.g. installing some form of trojan horse or keystroke logging software/hardware on the target computer to capture encrypted keyrings and their passwords). The FBI has already used this attack against PGP in its investigations. However, any such vulnerabilities apply not just to PGP but to any conventional encryption software.\nIn 2003, an incident involving seized Psion PDAs belonging to members of the Red Brigade indicated that neither the Italian police nor the FBI were able to decrypt PGP-encrypted files stored on them.A second incident in December 2006, (see In re Boucher), involving US customs agents who seized a laptop PC that allegedly contained child pornography, indicates that US government agencies find it \"nearly impossible\" to access PGP-encrypted files. Additionally, a magistrate judge ruling on the case in November 2007 has stated that forcing the suspect to reveal his PGP passphrase would violate his Fifth Amendment rights i.e. a suspect's constitutional right not to incriminate himself. The Fifth Amendment issue was opened again as the government appealed the case, after which a federal district judge ordered the defendant to provide the key.Evidence suggests that as of 2007, British police investigators are unable to break PGP, so instead have resorted to using RIPA legislation to demand the passwords/keys. In November 2009 a British citizen was convicted under RIPA legislation and jailed for nine months for refusing to provide police investigators with encryption keys to PGP-encrypted files.PGP as a cryptosystem has been criticized for complexity of the standard, implementation and very low usability of the user interface including by recognized figures in cryptography research. It uses an ineffective serialization format for storage of both keys and encrypted data, which resulted in signature-spamming attacks on public keys of prominent developers of GNU Privacy Guard. Backwards compatibility of the OpenPGP standard results in usage of relatively weak default choices of cryptographic primitives (CAST5 cipher, CFB mode, S2K password hashing). The standard has been also criticized for leaking metadata, usage of long-term keys and lack of forward secrecy. Popular end-user implementations have suffered from various signature-striping, cipher downgrade and metadata leakage vulnerabilities which have been attributed to the complexity of the standard.\n\n== PGP Corporation encryption applications ==\nThis section describes commercial programs available from PGP Corporation.  For information on other programs compatible with the OpenPGP specification, see External links below.While originally used primarily for encrypting the contents of e-mail messages and attachments from a desktop client, PGP products have been diversified since 2002 into a set of encryption applications that can be managed by an optional central policy server.  PGP encryption applications include e-mails and attachments, digital signatures, full disk encryption, file and folder security, protection for IM sessions, batch file transfer encryption, and protection for files and folders stored on network servers and, more recently, encrypted or signed HTTP request/responses by means of a client-side (Enigform) and a server-side (mod openpgp) module. There is also a WordPress plugin available, called wp-enigform-authentication, that takes advantage of the session management features of Enigform with mod_openpgp.\nThe PGP Desktop 9.x family includes PGP Desktop Email, PGP Whole Disk Encryption, and PGP NetShare. Additionally, a number of Desktop bundles are also available. Depending on the application, the products feature desktop e-mail, digital signatures, IM security, whole disk encryption, file, and folder security, encrypted self-extracting archives, and secure shredding of deleted files. Capabilities are licensed in different ways depending on the features required.\nThe PGP Universal Server 2.x management console handles centralized deployment, security policy, policy enforcement, key management, and reporting.  It is used for automated e-mail encryption in the gateway and manages PGP Desktop 9.x clients. In addition to its local keyserver, PGP Universal Server works with the PGP public keyserver\u2014called the PGP Global Directory\u2014to find recipient keys. It has the capability of delivering e-mail securely when no recipient key is found via a secure HTTPS browser session.\nWith PGP Desktop 9.x managed by PGP Universal Server 2.x, first released in 2005, all PGP encryption applications are based on a new proxy-based architecture. These newer versions of PGP software eliminate the use of e-mail plug-ins and insulate the user from changes to other desktop applications. All desktop and server operations are now based on security policies and operate in an automated fashion. The PGP Universal server automates the creation, management, and expiration of keys, sharing these keys among all PGP encryption applications.\nThe Symantec PGP platform has now undergone a rename.  PGP Desktop is now known as Symantec Encryption Desktop (SED), and the PGP Universal Server is now known as Symantec Encryption Management Server (SEMS). The current shipping versions are Symantec Encryption Desktop 10.3.0 (Windows and macOS platforms) and Symantec Encryption Server 3.3.2.\nAlso available are PGP Command-Line, which enables command line-based encryption and signing of information for storage, transfer, and backup, as well as the PGP Support Package for BlackBerry which enables RIM BlackBerry devices to enjoy sender-to-recipient messaging encryption.\nNew versions of PGP applications use both OpenPGP and the S/MIME, allowing communications with any user of a NIST specified standard.\n\n== OpenPGP ==\nWithin PGP Inc., there was still concern surrounding patent issues. RSADSI was challenging the continuation of the Viacrypt RSA license to the newly merged firm. The company adopted an informal internal standard that they called \"Unencumbered PGP\" which would \"use no algorithm with licensing difficulties\".  Because of PGP encryption's importance worldwide, many wanted to write their own software that would interoperate with PGP 5. Zimmermann became convinced that an open standard for PGP encryption was critical for them and for the cryptographic community as a whole. In July 1997, PGP Inc. proposed to the IETF that there be a standard called OpenPGP. They gave the IETF permission to use the name OpenPGP to describe this new standard as well as any program that supported the standard. The IETF accepted the proposal and started the OpenPGP Working Group.\nOpenPGP is on the Internet Standards Track and is under active development. Many e-mail clients provide OpenPGP-compliant email security as described in RFC 3156. The current specification is RFC 4880 (November 2007), the successor to RFC 2440. RFC 4880 specifies a suite of required algorithms consisting of ElGamal encryption, DSA, Triple DES and SHA-1. In addition to these algorithms, the standard recommends RSA as described in PKCS #1 v1.5 for encryption and signing, as well as AES-128, CAST-128 and IDEA. Beyond these, many other algorithms are supported. The standard was extended to support Camellia cipher by RFC 5581 in 2009, and signing and key exchange based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) (i.e. ECDSA and ECDH) by RFC 6637 in 2012.  Support for ECC encryption was added by the proposed RFC 4880bis in 2014.\nThe Free Software Foundation has developed its own OpenPGP-compliant software suite called GNU Privacy Guard, freely available together with all source code under the GNU General Public License and is maintained separately from several graphical user interfaces that interact with the GnuPG library for encryption, decryption, and signing functions (see KGPG, Seahorse, MacGPG). Several other vendors have also developed OpenPGP-compliant software.\nThe development of an open source OpenPGP-compliant library, OpenPGP.js, written in JavaScript and supported by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European Union, has allowed web-based applications to use PGP encryption in the web browser.\n\nPGP\nRFC 1991 PGP Message Exchange Formats (obsolete)\nOpenPGP\nRFC 2440 OpenPGP Message Format (obsolete)\nRFC 4880 OpenPGP Message Format\nRFC 5581 The Camellia Cipher in OpenPGP\nRFC 6637 Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) in OpenPGP\ndraft-ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh OpenPGP Message Format\nPGP/MIME\nRFC 2015 MIME Security with Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)\nRFC 3156 MIME Security with OpenPGPOpenPGP's encryption can ensure the secure delivery of files and messages, as well as provide verification of who created or sent the message using a process called digital signing. The open source office suite LibreOffice implemented document signing with OpenPGP as of version 5.4.0 on Linux. Using OpenPGP for communication requires participation by both the sender and recipient. OpenPGP can also be used to secure sensitive files when they are stored in vulnerable places like mobile devices or in the cloud.\n\n== Limitations ==\nWith the advancement of cryptography, parts of PGP have been criticized for being dated:\n\nThe long length of PGP public keys\nDifficulty for the users to comprehend and poor usability\nLack of ubiquity\nLack of forward secrecyIn October 2017, the ROCA vulnerability was announced, which affects RSA keys generated by buggy Infineon firmware used on Yubikey 4 tokens, often used with PGP. Many published PGP keys were found to be susceptible. Yubico offers free replacement of affected tokens."

    "instruction": "Banburismus\n\n==Introduction==\nBanburismus was a cryptanalytic process developed by Alan Turing at Bletchley Park in Britain during the Second World War. It was used by Bletchley Park's Hut 8 to help break German Kriegsmarine (naval) messages enciphered on Enigma machines. The process used sequential conditional probability to infer information about the likely settings of the Enigma machine. It gave rise to Turing's invention of the ban as a measure of the weight of evidence in favour of a hypothesis. This concept was later applied in Turingery and all the other methods used for breaking the Lorenz cipher.\n\n== Overview ==\nThe aim of Banburismus was to reduce the time required of the electromechanical Bombe machines by identifying the most likely right-hand and middle wheels of the Enigma. Hut 8 performed the procedure continuously for two years, stopping only in 1943 when sufficient bombe time became readily available. Banburismus was a development of the \"clock method\" invented by the Polish cryptanalyst Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki.Hugh Alexander was regarded as the best of the Banburists. He and I. J. Good considered the process more an intellectual game than a job. It was \"not easy enough to be trivial, but not difficult enough to cause a nervous breakdown\".\n\n== Principles ==\nBanburismus utilised a weakness in the indicator procedure (the encrypted message settings) of Kriegsmarine Enigma traffic. Unlike the German Army and Airforce Enigma procedures, the Kriegsmarine used a Grundstellung provided by key lists, and so it was the same for all messages on a particular day (or pair of days). This meant that the three-letter indicators were all enciphered with the same rotor settings so that they were all in depth with each other. Normally, the indicators for two messages were never the same, but it could happen that, part-way through a message, the rotor positions became the same as the starting position of the rotors for another message, the parts of the two messages that overlapped in this way were in depth.\n\n \nThe principle behind Banburismus is relatively simple (and seems to be rather similar to the Index of Coincidence). If two sentences in English or German are written down one above the other, and a count is made of how often a letter in one message is the same as the corresponding letter in the other message; there will be more matches than would occur if the sentences were random strings of letters. For a random sequence, the repeat rate for single letters is expected to be 1 in 26 (around 3.8%), and for the German Navy messages it was shown to be 1 in 17 (5.9%). If the two messages were in depth, then the matches occur just as they did in the plaintexts. However, if the messages were not in depth, then the two ciphertexts will compare as if they were random, giving a repeat rate of about 1 in 26. This allows an attacker to take two messages whose indicators differ only in the third character, and slide them against each other looking for the giveaway repeat pattern that shows where they align in depth.\nThe comparison of two messages to look for repeats was made easier by punching the messages onto thin cards about 250 millimetres (9.8 in) high by several metres (yards) wide, depending on the length of message. A hole at the top of a column on the card represented an 'A' at that position, a hole at the bottom represented a 'Z'. The two message-cards were laid on top of each other on a light-box and where the light shone through, there was a repeat. This made it much simpler to detect and count the repeats. The cards were printed in Banbury in Oxfordshire. They became known as 'banburies' at Bletchley Park, and hence the procedure using them: Banburismus.The application of the scritchmus procedure (see below) gives a clue as to the possible right-hand rotor.\n\n\n*** Example ***\nMessage with indicator \"VFG\": XCYBGDSLVWBDJLKWIPEHVYGQZWDTHRQXIKEESQSSPZXARIXEABQIRUCKHGWUEBPF\nMessage with indicator \"VFX\":\nYNSCFCCPVIPEMSGIZWFLHESCIYSPVRXMCFQAXVXDVUQILBJUABNLKMKDJMENUNQ\nHut 8 would punch these onto banburies and count the repeats for all valid offsets \u221225 letters to +25 letters. There are two promising positions:\n\nXCYBGDSLVWBDJLKWIPEHVYGQZWDTHRQXIKEESQSSPZXARIXEABQIRUCKHGWUEBPF\n        YNSCFCCPVIPEMSGIZWFLHESCIYSPVRXMCFQAXVXDVUQILBJUABNLKMKDJMENUNQ\n                      - --  -   -          -  -   --\n\nThis offset of eight letters shows nine repeats, including two bigrams, in an overlap of 56 letters (16%).\nThe other promising position looks like this:\n\nXCYBGDSLVWBDJLKWIPEHVYGQZWDTHRQXIKEESQSSPZXARIXEABQIRUCKHGWUEBPF\n       YNSCFCCPVIPEMSGIZWFLHESCIYSPVRXMCFQAXVXDVUQILBJUABNLKMKDJMENUNQ\n                ---\n\nThis offset of seven shows just a single trigram in an overlap of 57 letters.\nTuring's method of accumulating a score of a number of decibans allows the calculation of which of these situations is most likely to represent messages in depth. As might be expected, the former is the winner with odds of 5:1 on, the latter is only 2:1 on.Turing calculated the scores for the number of single repeats in overlaps of so many letters, and the number of bigrams and trigrams. Tetragrams often represented German words in the plaintext and their scores were calculated according to the type of message (from traffic analysis), and even their position within the message. These were tabulated and the relevant values summed by Banburists in assessing pairs of messages to see which were likely to be in depth.\nBletchley Park used the convention that the indicator plaintext of \"VFX\", being eight characters ahead of \"VFG\", or (in terms of just the third, differing, letter) that \"X\n\n== Middle wheel ==\nOnce the end wheel is identified, these same principles can be extended to handle the middle rotor, though with the added complexity that the search is for overlaps in message-pairs sharing just the first indicator letter, and that the overlaps could therefore occur at up to 650 characters apart.The workload of doing this is beyond manual labour, so BP punched the messages onto 80-column cards and used Hollerith machines to scan for tetragram repeats or better. That told them which banburies to set up on the light boxes (and with what overlap) to evaluate the whole repeat pattern.\nArmed with a set of probable mid-wheel overlaps, Hut 8 could compose letter-chains for the middle wheel much in the same way as was illustrated above for the end wheel. That in turn (after Scritchmus) would give at least a partial middle wheel alphabet, and hopefully at least some of the possible choices of rotor for the middle wheel could be eliminated from turnover knowledge (as was done in identifying the end wheel).\nTaken together, the probable right hand and middle wheels would give a set of bombe runs for the day, that would be significantly reduced from the 336 possible.\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAlexander, C.

They became known as 'banburies' at Bletchley Park, and hence the procedure using them: Banburismus.The application of the scritchmus procedure (see below) gives a clue as to the possible right-hand rotor.\n\n\n*** Example ***\nMessage with indicator \"VFG\": XCYBGDSLVWBDJLKWIPEHVYGQZWDTHRQXIKEESQSSPZXARIXEABQIRUCKHGWUEBPF\nMessage with indicator \"VFX\":\nYNSCFCCPVIPEMSGIZWFLHESCIYSPVRXMCFQAXVXDVUQILBJUABNLKMKDJMENUNQ\nHut 8 would punch these onto banburies and count the repeats for all valid offsets \u221225 letters to +25 letters. There are two promising positions:\n\nXCYBGDSLVWBDJLKWIPEHVYGQZWDTHRQXIKEESQSSPZXARIXEABQIRUCKHGWUEBPF\n        YNSCFCCPVIPEMSGIZWFLHESCIYSPVRXMCFQAXVXDVUQILBJUABNLKMKDJMENUNQ\n                      - --  -   -          -  -   --\n\nThis offset of eight letters shows nine repeats, including two bigrams, in an overlap of 56 letters (16%).\nThe other promising position looks like this:\n\nXCYBGDSLVWBDJLKWIPEHVYGQZWDTHRQXIKEESQSSPZXARIXEABQIRUCKHGWUEBPF\n       YNSCFCCPVIPEMSGIZWFLHESCIYSPVRXMCFQAXVXDVUQILBJUABNLKMKDJMENUNQ\n                ---\n\nThis offset of seven shows just a single trigram in an overlap of 57 letters.\nTuring's method of accumulating a score of a number of decibans allows the calculation of which of these situations is most likely to represent messages in depth. As might be expected, the former is the winner with odds of 5:1 on, the latter is only 2:1 on.Turing calculated the scores for the number of single repeats in overlaps of so many letters, and the number of bigrams and trigrams. Tetragrams often represented German words in the plaintext and their scores were calculated according to the type of message (from traffic analysis), and even their position within the message. These were tabulated and the relevant values summed by Banburists in assessing pairs of messages to see which were likely to be in depth.\nBletchley Park used the convention that the indicator plaintext of \"VFX\", being eight characters ahead of \"VFG\", or (in terms of just the third, differing, letter) that \"X\n\n== Middle wheel ==\nOnce the end wheel is identified, these same principles can be extended to handle the middle rotor, though with the added complexity that the search is for overlaps in message-pairs sharing just the first indicator letter, and that the overlaps could therefore occur at up to 650 characters apart.The workload of doing this is beyond manual labour, so BP punched the messages onto 80-column cards and used Hollerith machines to scan for tetragram repeats or better. That told them which banburies to set up on the light boxes (and with what overlap) to evaluate the whole repeat pattern.\nArmed with a set of probable mid-wheel overlaps, Hut 8 could compose letter-chains for the middle wheel much in the same way as was illustrated above for the end wheel. That in turn (after Scritchmus) would give at least a partial middle wheel alphabet, and hopefully at least some of the possible choices of rotor for the middle wheel could be eliminated from turnover knowledge (as was done in identifying the end wheel).\nTaken together, the probable right hand and middle wheels would give a set of bombe runs for the day, that would be significantly reduced from the 336 possible.\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAlexander, C.

Already scanned files can be identified by their known (e.g., VT default) SHA256 hash without uploading complete files. The SHA256 query URL has the form https://www.virustotal.com/latest-scan/SHA256. File uploads are normally limited to 128 MB. In 2017 VirusTotal discontinued support of the Windows Uploader.\n\n\n*** Uploader for Mac OS X and Linux ***\nSame as the Windows app you upload the file (via the app's UI or context menu) then you will be given back a result. The Mac OS X app can be downloaded from their website. However, you need to compile and build the app for Linux using the same core (provided in their repository) used in the Mac OS X application. Already scanned files can be identified by their known (e.g., VT default) SHA256 hash without uploading complete files.\n\n\n*** VirusTotal for Browsers ***\nThere are several browser extensions available, such as VT4Browsers for Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome and vtExplorer for Internet Explorer. They allow the user to download files directly with VirusTotal's web application prior to storing them in the computer, as well as scanning URLs.\n\n\n*** VirusTotal for Mobile ***\nThe service also offers an Android App that employs the public API to search any installed application for VirusTotal's previously scanned ones and show its status. Any application not previously scanned can be submitted, but an API key must be provided and other restrictions to public API usage may apply (see #Public API).\n\n\n*** Public API ***\nVirusTotal provides as a free service a public API that allows for automation of some of its online features such as \"upload and scan files, submit and scan URLs, access finished scan reports and make automatic comments on URLs and samples\". Some restrictions apply for requests made through the public API, such as requiring an individual API key freely obtained by online signing up, low priority scan queue, limited number of requests per time frame, etc.\n\n\n*** Antivirus products ***\nAntivirus engines used for detection for uploading files.\n\n\n*** Website/domain scanning engines and datasets ***\nAntivirus scanning engines used for URL scanning.\n\n\n*** File characterization tools & datasets ***\nUtilities used to provide additional info on uploaded files.\n\n== Privacy ==\nFiles uploaded to VirusTotal may be shared freely with anti-malware companies and will also be retained in a store. The VirusTotal About Page states under VirusTotal and confidentiality:\nFiles and URLs sent to VirusTotal will be shared with antivirus vendors and security companies so as to help them in improving their services and products. We do this because we believe it will eventually lead to a safer Internet and better end-user protection.\nBy default any file/URL submitted to VirusTotal which is detected by at least one scanner is freely sent to all those scanners that do not detect the resource. Additionally, all files and URLs enter a private store that may be accessed by premium (mainly security/antimalware companies/organizations) VirusTotal users so as to improve their security products and services."

    "instruction": "Context: Forward secrecy\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, forward secrecy (FS), also known as perfect forward secrecy (PFS), is a feature of specific key-agreement protocols that gives assurances that session keys will not be compromised even if long-term secrets used in the session key exchange are compromised. For HTTPS, the long-term secret is typically the private key of the server. Forward secrecy protects past sessions against future compromises of keys or passwords. By generating a unique session key for every session a user initiates, the compromise of a single session key will not affect any data other than that exchanged in the specific session protected by that particular key. This by itself is not sufficient for forward secrecy which additionally requires that a long-term secret compromise does not affect the security of past session keys.\nForward secrecy protects data on the transport layer of a network that uses common transport layer security protocols, including OpenSSL, when its long-term secret keys are compromised, as with the Heartbleed security bug. If forward secrecy is used, encrypted communications and sessions recorded in the past cannot be retrieved and decrypted should long-term secret keys or passwords be compromised in the future, even if the adversary actively interfered, for example via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.\nThe value of forward secrecy is that it protects past communication. This reduces the motivation for attackers to compromise keys. For instance, if an attacker learns a long-term key, but the compromise is detected and the long-term key is revoked and updated, relatively little information is leaked in a forward secure system.\nThe value of forward secrecy depends on the assumed capabilities of an adversary. Forward secrecy has value if an adversary is assumed to be able to obtain secret keys from a device (read access) but is either detected or unable to modify the way session keys are generated in the device (full compromise).  In some cases an adversary who can read long-term keys from a device may also be able to modify the functioning of the session key generator, as in the backdoored Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator. If an adversary can make the random number generator predictable, then past traffic will be protected but all future traffic will be compromised.\nThe value of forward secrecy is limited not only by the assumption that an adversary will attack a server by only stealing keys and not modifying the random number generator used by the server but it is also limited by the assumption that the adversary will only passively collect traffic on the communications link and not be active using a man-in-the-middle attack.  Forward secrecy typically uses an ephemeral Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange to prevent reading past traffic.  The ephemeral Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange is often signed by the server using a static signing key.  If an adversary can steal (or obtain through a court order) this static (long term) signing key, the adversary can masquerade as the server to the client and as the client to the server and implement a classic man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n== Definition ==\nAn encryption system has the property of forward secrecy if plain-text (decrypted) inspection of the data exchange that occurs during key agreement phase of session initiation does not reveal the key that was used to encrypt the remainder of the session.\n\n== Example ==\nThe following is a hypothetical example of a simple instant messaging protocol that employs forward secrecy:\n\nAlice and Bob each generate a pair of long-term, asymmetric public and private keys, then verify public-key fingerprints in person or over an already-authenticated channel. Verification establishes with confidence that the claimed owner of a public key is the actual owner.\nAlice and Bob use a key exchange algorithm such as Diffie\u2013Hellman, to securely agree on an ephemeral session key. They use the keys from step 1 only to authenticate one another during this process.\nAlice sends Bob a message, encrypting it with a symmetric cipher using the session key negotiated in step 2.\nBob decrypts Alice's message using the key negotiated in step 2.\nThe process repeats for each new message sent, starting from step 2 (and switching Alice and Bob's roles as sender/receiver as appropriate). Step 1 is never repeated.Forward secrecy (achieved by generating new session keys for each message) ensures that past communications cannot be decrypted if one of the keys generated in an iteration of step 2 is compromised, since such a key is only used to encrypt a single message. Forward secrecy also ensures that past communications cannot be decrypted if the long-term private keys from step 1 are compromised. However, masquerading as Alice or Bob would be possible going forward if this occurred, possibly compromising all future messages.\n\n== Attacks ==\nForward secrecy is designed to prevent the compromise of a long-term secret key from affecting the confidentiality of past conversations. However, forward secrecy cannot defend against a successful cryptanalysis of the underlying ciphers being used, since a cryptanalysis consists of finding a way to decrypt an encrypted message without the key, and forward secrecy only protects keys, not the ciphers themselves. A patient attacker can capture a conversation whose confidentiality is protected through the use of public-key cryptography and wait until the underlying cipher is broken (e.g. large quantum computers could be created which allow the discrete logarithm problem to be computed quickly). This would allow the recovery of old plaintexts even in a system employing forward secrecy.\nNon-interactive forward-secure key exchange protocols face additional threats that are not relevant to interactive protocols. In a message suppression attack, an attacker in control of the network may itself store messages while preventing them from reaching the intended recipient; as the messages are never received, the corresponding private keys may not be destroyed or punctured, so a compromise of the private key can lead to successful decryption. Proactively retiring private keys on a schedule mitigates, but does not eliminate, this attack. In a malicious key exhaustion attack, the attacker sends many messages to the recipient and exhausts the private key material, forcing a protocol to choose between failing closed (and enabling denial of service attacks) or failing open (and giving up some amount of forward secrecy).\n\n== Non-interactive forward secrecy ==\nMost key exchange protocols are interactive, requiring bidirectional communication between the parties. A protocol that permits the sender to transmit data without first needing to receive any replies from the recipient may be called non-interactive, or asynchronous, or zero round trip (0-RTT).Interactivity is onerous for some applications\u2014for example, in a secure messaging system, it may be desirable to have a store-and-forward implementation, rather than requiring sender and recipient to be online at the same time; loosening the bidirectionality requirement can also improve performance even where it is not a strict requirement, for example at connection establishment or resumption. These use cases have stimulated interest in non-interactive key exchange, and, as forward security is a desirable property in a key exchange protocol, in non-interactive forward secrecy. This combination has been identified as desirable since at least 1996. However, combining forward secrecy and non-interactivity has proven challenging; it had been suspected that forward secrecy with protection against replay attacks was impossible non-interactively, but it has been shown to be possible to achieve all three desiderata.Broadly, two approaches to non-interactive forward secrecy have been explored, pre-computed keys and puncturable encryption.With pre-computed keys, many key pairs are created and the public keys shared, with the private keys destroyed after a message has been received using the corresponding public key. This approach has been deployed as part of the Signal protocol.In puncturable encryption, the recipient modifies their private key after receiving a message in such a way that the new private key cannot read the message but the public key is unchanged. Ross J. Anderson informally described a puncturable encryption scheme for forward secure key exchange in 1997, and Green & Miers (2015) formally described such a system, building on the related scheme of Canetti, Halevi & Katz (2003), which modifies the private key according to a schedule so that messages sent in previous periods cannot be read with the private key from a later period. Green & Miers (2015) make use of hierarchical identity-based encryption and attribute-based encryption, while G\u00fcnther et al. (2017) use a different construction that can be based on any hierarchical identity-based scheme. Dallmeier et al. (2020) experimentally found that modifying QUIC to use a 0-RTT forward secure and replay-resistant key exchange implemented with puncturable encryption incurred significantly increased resource usage, but not so much as to make practical use infeasible.\n\n== Weak perfect forward secrecy ==\nWeak perfect forward secrecy (Wpfs) is the weaker property whereby when agents' long-term keys are compromised, the secrecy of previously established session-keys is guaranteed, but only for sessions in which the adversary did not actively interfere. This new notion, and the distinction between this and forward secrecy was introduced by Hugo Krawczyk in 2005.\nThis weaker definition implicitly requires that full (perfect) forward secrecy maintains the secrecy of previously established session keys even in sessions where the adversary did actively interfere, or attempted to act as a man in the middle.\n\n== Protocols ==\nForward secrecy is present in several major protocol implementations, such as SSH and as an optional feature in IPsec (RFC 2412). Off-the-Record Messaging, a cryptography protocol and library for many instant messaging clients, as well as OMEMO which provides additional features such as multi-user functionality in such clients, both provide forward secrecy as well as deniable encryption.\nIn Transport Layer Security (TLS), cipher suites based on Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange (DHE-RSA, DHE-DSA) and elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange (ECDHE-RSA, ECDHE-ECDSA) are available. In theory, TLS can choose appropriate ciphers since SSLv3, but in everyday practice many implementations have refused to offer forward secrecy or only provide it with very low encryption grade. TLS 1.3 leaves ephemeral Diffie\u2013Hellman (finite field and elliptic curve variants) as the only remaining key exchange mechanism, in order to ensure forward secrecy.OpenSSL supports forward secrecy using elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman since version 1.0, with a computational overhead of approximately 15% for the initial handshake.The Signal Protocol uses the Double Ratchet Algorithm to provide forward secrecy.On the other hand, among popular protocols currently in use, WPA does not support forward secrecy.\n\n== Use ==\nForward secrecy is seen as an important security feature by several large Internet information providers.  Since late 2011, Google provided forward secrecy with TLS by default to users of its Gmail service, Google Docs service, and encrypted search services. Since November 2013, Twitter provided forward secrecy with TLS to its users. Wikis hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation have all provided forward secrecy to users since July 2014 and are requiring the use of forward secrecy since August 2018.\nFacebook reported as part of an investigation into email encryption that, as of May 2014, 74% of hosts that support STARTTLS also provide forward secrecy. TLS 1.3, published in August 2018, dropped support for ciphers without forward secrecy. As of February 2019, 96.6% of web servers surveyed support some form of forward secrecy, and 52.1% will use forward secrecy with most browsers.At WWDC 2016, Apple announced that all iOS apps would need to use App Transport Security (ATS), a feature which enforces the use of HTTPS transmission. Specifically, ATS requires the use of an encryption cipher that provides forward secrecy. ATS became mandatory for apps on January 1, 2017.The Signal messaging application employs forward secrecy in its protocol, notably differentiating it from messaging protocols based on PGP.\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAnderson, Ross (2002). \"Two Remarks on Public Key Cryptology\" (PDF).\nCanetti, Ran; Halevi, Shai; Katz, Jonathan (2003). \"A Forward-Secure Public-Key Encryption Scheme\".

In puncturable encryption, the recipient modifies their private key after receiving a message in such a way that the new private key cannot read the message but the public key is unchanged.",
      "context": "Forward secrecy\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, forward secrecy (FS), also known as perfect forward secrecy (PFS), is a feature of specific key-agreement protocols that gives assurances that session keys will not be compromised even if long-term secrets used in the session key exchange are compromised. For HTTPS, the long-term secret is typically the private key of the server. Forward secrecy protects past sessions against future compromises of keys or passwords. By generating a unique session key for every session a user initiates, the compromise of a single session key will not affect any data other than that exchanged in the specific session protected by that particular key. This by itself is not sufficient for forward secrecy which additionally requires that a long-term secret compromise does not affect the security of past session keys.\nForward secrecy protects data on the transport layer of a network that uses common transport layer security protocols, including OpenSSL, when its long-term secret keys are compromised, as with the Heartbleed security bug. If forward secrecy is used, encrypted communications and sessions recorded in the past cannot be retrieved and decrypted should long-term secret keys or passwords be compromised in the future, even if the adversary actively interfered, for example via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.\nThe value of forward secrecy is that it protects past communication. This reduces the motivation for attackers to compromise keys. For instance, if an attacker learns a long-term key, but the compromise is detected and the long-term key is revoked and updated, relatively little information is leaked in a forward secure system.\nThe value of forward secrecy depends on the assumed capabilities of an adversary. Forward secrecy has value if an adversary is assumed to be able to obtain secret keys from a device (read access) but is either detected or unable to modify the way session keys are generated in the device (full compromise).  In some cases an adversary who can read long-term keys from a device may also be able to modify the functioning of the session key generator, as in the backdoored Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator. If an adversary can make the random number generator predictable, then past traffic will be protected but all future traffic will be compromised.\nThe value of forward secrecy is limited not only by the assumption that an adversary will attack a server by only stealing keys and not modifying the random number generator used by the server but it is also limited by the assumption that the adversary will only passively collect traffic on the communications link and not be active using a man-in-the-middle attack.  Forward secrecy typically uses an ephemeral Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange to prevent reading past traffic.  The ephemeral Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange is often signed by the server using a static signing key.  If an adversary can steal (or obtain through a court order) this static (long term) signing key, the adversary can masquerade as the server to the client and as the client to the server and implement a classic man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n== Definition ==\nAn encryption system has the property of forward secrecy if plain-text (decrypted) inspection of the data exchange that occurs during key agreement phase of session initiation does not reveal the key that was used to encrypt the remainder of the session.\n\n== Example ==\nThe following is a hypothetical example of a simple instant messaging protocol that employs forward secrecy:\n\nAlice and Bob each generate a pair of long-term, asymmetric public and private keys, then verify public-key fingerprints in person or over an already-authenticated channel. Verification establishes with confidence that the claimed owner of a public key is the actual owner.\nAlice and Bob use a key exchange algorithm such as Diffie\u2013Hellman, to securely agree on an ephemeral session key. They use the keys from step 1 only to authenticate one another during this process.\nAlice sends Bob a message, encrypting it with a symmetric cipher using the session key negotiated in step 2.\nBob decrypts Alice's message using the key negotiated in step 2.\nThe process repeats for each new message sent, starting from step 2 (and switching Alice and Bob's roles as sender/receiver as appropriate). Step 1 is never repeated.Forward secrecy (achieved by generating new session keys for each message) ensures that past communications cannot be decrypted if one of the keys generated in an iteration of step 2 is compromised, since such a key is only used to encrypt a single message. Forward secrecy also ensures that past communications cannot be decrypted if the long-term private keys from step 1 are compromised. However, masquerading as Alice or Bob would be possible going forward if this occurred, possibly compromising all future messages.\n\n== Attacks ==\nForward secrecy is designed to prevent the compromise of a long-term secret key from affecting the confidentiality of past conversations. However, forward secrecy cannot defend against a successful cryptanalysis of the underlying ciphers being used, since a cryptanalysis consists of finding a way to decrypt an encrypted message without the key, and forward secrecy only protects keys, not the ciphers themselves. A patient attacker can capture a conversation whose confidentiality is protected through the use of public-key cryptography and wait until the underlying cipher is broken (e.g. large quantum computers could be created which allow the discrete logarithm problem to be computed quickly). This would allow the recovery of old plaintexts even in a system employing forward secrecy.\nNon-interactive forward-secure key exchange protocols face additional threats that are not relevant to interactive protocols. In a message suppression attack, an attacker in control of the network may itself store messages while preventing them from reaching the intended recipient; as the messages are never received, the corresponding private keys may not be destroyed or punctured, so a compromise of the private key can lead to successful decryption. Proactively retiring private keys on a schedule mitigates, but does not eliminate, this attack. In a malicious key exhaustion attack, the attacker sends many messages to the recipient and exhausts the private key material, forcing a protocol to choose between failing closed (and enabling denial of service attacks) or failing open (and giving up some amount of forward secrecy).\n\n== Non-interactive forward secrecy ==\nMost key exchange protocols are interactive, requiring bidirectional communication between the parties. A protocol that permits the sender to transmit data without first needing to receive any replies from the recipient may be called non-interactive, or asynchronous, or zero round trip (0-RTT).Interactivity is onerous for some applications\u2014for example, in a secure messaging system, it may be desirable to have a store-and-forward implementation, rather than requiring sender and recipient to be online at the same time; loosening the bidirectionality requirement can also improve performance even where it is not a strict requirement, for example at connection establishment or resumption. These use cases have stimulated interest in non-interactive key exchange, and, as forward security is a desirable property in a key exchange protocol, in non-interactive forward secrecy. This combination has been identified as desirable since at least 1996. However, combining forward secrecy and non-interactivity has proven challenging; it had been suspected that forward secrecy with protection against replay attacks was impossible non-interactively, but it has been shown to be possible to achieve all three desiderata.Broadly, two approaches to non-interactive forward secrecy have been explored, pre-computed keys and puncturable encryption.With pre-computed keys, many key pairs are created and the public keys shared, with the private keys destroyed after a message has been received using the corresponding public key. This approach has been deployed as part of the Signal protocol.In puncturable encryption, the recipient modifies their private key after receiving a message in such a way that the new private key cannot read the message but the public key is unchanged. Ross J. Anderson informally described a puncturable encryption scheme for forward secure key exchange in 1997, and Green & Miers (2015) formally described such a system, building on the related scheme of Canetti, Halevi & Katz (2003), which modifies the private key according to a schedule so that messages sent in previous periods cannot be read with the private key from a later period. Green & Miers (2015) make use of hierarchical identity-based encryption and attribute-based encryption, while G\u00fcnther et al. (2017) use a different construction that can be based on any hierarchical identity-based scheme. Dallmeier et al. (2020) experimentally found that modifying QUIC to use a 0-RTT forward secure and replay-resistant key exchange implemented with puncturable encryption incurred significantly increased resource usage, but not so much as to make practical use infeasible.\n\n== Weak perfect forward secrecy ==\nWeak perfect forward secrecy (Wpfs) is the weaker property whereby when agents' long-term keys are compromised, the secrecy of previously established session-keys is guaranteed, but only for sessions in which the adversary did not actively interfere. This new notion, and the distinction between this and forward secrecy was introduced by Hugo Krawczyk in 2005.\nThis weaker definition implicitly requires that full (perfect) forward secrecy maintains the secrecy of previously established session keys even in sessions where the adversary did actively interfere, or attempted to act as a man in the middle.\n\n== Protocols ==\nForward secrecy is present in several major protocol implementations, such as SSH and as an optional feature in IPsec (RFC 2412).

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nURL redirection\n\n==Introduction==\nURL redirection, also called URL forwarding, is a World Wide Web technique for making a web page available under more than one URL address. When a web browser attempts to open a URL that has been redirected, a page with a different URL is opened. Similarly, domain redirection or domain forwarding is when all pages in a URL domain are redirected to a different domain, as when wikipedia.com and wikipedia.net are automatically redirected to wikipedia.org.\nURL redirection is done for various reasons:\n\nfor URL shortening;\nto prevent broken links when web pages are moved;\nto allow multiple domain names belonging to the same owner to refer to a single web site;\nto guide navigation into and out of a website;\nfor privacy protection; and\nfor hostile purposes such as phishing attacks or malware distribution.\n\n\n\n== Purposes ==\nThere are several reasons to use URL redirection:\n\n\n*** Forcing HTTPS ***\nA website may potentially be accessible over both a secure HTTPS URI scheme and plain HTTP (an insecure URI beginning with \"http://\").\nIf a user types in a URI or clicks on a link that refers to the insecure variant, the browser will automatically redirect to the secure version in case the website is contained in the HSTS preload list shipped with the application or if the user had already visited the origin in the past.\nOtherwise the website will be contacted over HTTP. A website operator may decide to serve such requests by redirecting the browser to the HTTPS variant instead and hopefully also priming HSTS for future accesses.\n\n\n*** Similar domain names ***\nA user might mistype a URL. Organizations often register these \"misspelled\" domains and redirect them to the \"correct\" location. This technique is often used to \"reserve\" other top-level domains (TLD) with the same name, or make it easier for a \".edu\" or \".net\" site to accommodate users who type \".com\".\n\n\n*** Moving pages to a new domain ***\nWeb pages may be redirected to a new domain for three reasons:\n\na site might desire, or need, to change its domain name;\nan author might move their individual pages to a new domain;\ntwo web sites might merge.With URL redirects, incoming links to an outdated URL can be sent to the correct location. These links might be from other sites that have not realized that there is a change or from bookmarks/favorites that users have saved in their browsers. The same applies to search engines. They often have the older/outdated domain names and links in their database and will send search users to these old URLs. By using a \"moved permanently\" redirect to the new URL, visitors will still end up at the correct page. Also, in the next search engine pass, the search engine should detect and use the newer URL.\n\n\n*** Logging outgoing links ***\nThe access logs of most web servers keep detailed information about where visitors came from and how they browsed the hosted site.  They do not, however, log which links visitors left by.  This is because the visitor's browser has no need to communicate with the original server when the visitor clicks on an outgoing link. This information can be captured in several ways.  One way involves URL redirection.  Instead of sending the visitor straight to the other site, links on the site can direct to a URL on the original website's domain that automatically redirects to the real target. This technique bears the downside of the delay caused by the additional request to the original website's server. As this added request will leave a trace in the server log, revealing exactly which link was followed, it can also be a privacy issue. The same technique is also used by some corporate websites to implement a statement that the subsequent content is at another site, and therefore not necessarily affiliated with the corporation. In such scenarios, displaying the warning causes an additional delay.\n\n\n*** Short aliases for long URLs ***\n\nWeb applications often include lengthy descriptive attributes in their URLs which represent data hierarchies, command structures, transaction paths and session information. This practice results in a URL that is aesthetically unpleasant and difficult to remember, and which may not fit within the size limitations of microblogging sites. URL shortening services provide a solution to this problem by redirecting a user to a longer URL from a shorter one.\n\n\n*** Meaningful, persistent aliases for long or changing URLs ***\n\nSometimes the URL of a page changes even though the content stays the same. Therefore, URL redirection can help users who have bookmarks. This is routinely done on Wikipedia whenever a page is renamed.\n\n\n*** Post/Redirect/Get ***\n\nPost/Redirect/Get (PRG) is a web development design pattern that prevents some duplicate form submissions if the user clicks the refresh button after submitting the form, creating a more intuitive interface for user agents (users).\n\n\n*** Device targeting and geotargeting ***\nRedirects can be effectively used for targeting purposes like geotargeting. Device targeting has become increasingly important with the rise of mobile clients. There are two approaches to serve mobile users: Make the website responsive or redirect to a mobile website version. If a mobile website version is offered, users with mobile clients will be automatically forwarded to the corresponding mobile content. For device targeting, client-side redirects or non-cacheable server-side redirects are used. Geotargeting is the approach to offer localized content and automatically forward the user to a localized version of the requested URL. This is helpful for websites that target audience in more than one location and/or language. Usually server-side redirects are used for Geotargeting but client-side redirects might be an option as well, depending on requirements.\n\n\n*** Manipulating search engines ***\nRedirects have been used to manipulate search engines with unethical intentions, e.g., URL hijacking. The goal of misleading redirects is to drive search traffic to landing pages, which do not have enough ranking power on their own or which are only remotely or not at all related to the search target. The approach requires a rank for a range of search terms with a number of URLs that would utilize sneaky redirects to forward the searcher to the target page. This method had a revival with the uprise of mobile devices and device targeting. URL hijacking is an off-domain redirect technique that exploited the nature of the search engine's handling for temporary redirects. If a temporary redirect is encountered, search engines have to decide whether they assign the ranking value to the URL that initializes the redirect or to the redirect target URL. The URL that initiates the redirect may be kept to show up in search results, as the redirect indicates a temporary nature. Under certain circumstances it was possible to exploit this behavior by applying temporary redirects to well-ranking URLs, leading to a replacement of the original URL in search results by the URL that initialized the redirect, therefore \"stealing\" the ranking. This method was usually combined with sneaky redirects to re-target the user stream from the search results to a target page. Search engines have developed efficient technologies to detect these kinds of manipulative approaches. Major search engines usually apply harsh ranking penalties on sites that get caught applying techniques like these.\n\n\n*** Manipulating visitors ***\nURL redirection is sometimes used as a part of phishing attacks that confuse visitors about which web site they are visiting. Because modern browsers always show the real URL in the address bar, the threat is lessened. However, redirects can also take you to sites that will otherwise attempt to attack in other ways. For example, a redirect might take a user to a site that would attempt to trick them into downloading antivirus software and installing a Trojan of some sort instead.\n\n\n*** Removing referrer information ***\nWhen a link is clicked, the browser sends along in the HTTP request a field called referer which indicates the source of the link. This field is populated with the URL of the current web page, and will end up in the logs of the server serving the external link. Since sensitive pages may have sensitive URLs (for example, https://company.com/plans-for-the-next-release-of-our-product), it is not desirable for the referrer URL to leave the organization. A redirection page that performs referrer hiding could be embedded in all external URLs, transforming for example https://externalsite.com/page into https://redirect.company.com/https://externalsite.com/page. This technique also eliminates other potentially sensitive information from the referrer URL, such as the session ID, and can reduce the chance of phishing by indicating to the end user that they passed a clear gateway to another site.\n\n== Implementation ==\nSeveral different kinds of response to the browser will result in a redirection.  These vary in whether they affect HTTP headers or HTML content.  The techniques used typically depend on the role of the person implementing it and their access to different parts of the system.  For example, a web author with no control over the headers might use a Refresh meta tag whereas a web server administrator redirecting all pages on a site is more likely to use server configuration.\n\n\n*** Manual redirect ***\nThe simplest technique is to ask the visitor to follow a link to the new page, usually using an HTML anchor like:\n\nThis method is often used as a fall-back \u2014 if the browser does not support the automatic redirect, the visitor can still reach the target document by following the link.\n\n\n*** HTTP status codes 3xx ***\nIn the HTTP protocol used by the World Wide Web, a redirect is a response with a status code beginning with 3 that causes a browser to display a different page. If a client encounters a redirect, it needs to make a number of decisions how to handle the redirect. Different status codes are used by clients to understand the purpose of the redirect, how to handle caching and which request method to use for the subsequent request.\nHTTP/1.1 defines several status codes for redirection (RFC 7231):\n\n300 multiple choices (e.g. offer different languages)\n301 moved permanently (redirects permanently from one URL to another passing link equity to the redirected page)\n302 found (originally \"temporary redirect\" in HTTP/1.0 and popularly used for CGI scripts; superseded by 303 and 307 in HTTP/1.1 but preserved for backward compatibility)\n303 see other (forces a GET request to the new URL even if original request was POST)\n305 use proxy (indicates that the client's requested resource is only available through a proxy)\n307 temporary redirect (provides a new URL for the browser to resubmit a GET or POST request)\n308 permanent redirect (provides a new URL for the browser to resubmit a GET or POST request)Status codes 304 not modified and 305 use proxy are not redirects.\n\nAll of these status codes require the URL of the redirect target to be given in the Location: header of the HTTP response. The 300 multiple choices will usually list all choices in the body of the message and show the default choice in the Location: header.\n\n\n**** Example HTTP response for a 301 redirect ****\nA HTTP response with the 301 \"moved permanently\" redirect looks like this:\n\n\n**** Using server-side scripting for redirection ****\nWeb authors producing HTML content can't usually create redirects using HTTP headers as these are generated automatically by the web server program when serving an HTML file.  The same is usually true even for programmers writing CGI scripts, though some servers allow scripts to add custom headers (e.g. by enabling \"non-parsed-headers\").  Many web servers will generate a 3xx status code if a script outputs a \"Location:\" header line.  For example, in PHP, one can use the \"header\" function:\n\nMore headers may be required to prevent caching. The programmer must ensure that the headers are output before the body.  This may not fit easily with the natural flow of control through the code.  To help with this, some frameworks for server-side content generation can buffer the body data.  In the ASP scripting language, this can also be accomplished using response.buffer\n\n== Services ==\nThere exist services that can perform URL redirection on demand, with no need for technical work or access to the web server your site is hosted on.\n\n\n*** URL redirection services ***\nA redirect service is an information management system, which provides an internet link that redirects users to the desired content. The typical benefit to the user is the use of a memorable domain name, and a reduction in the length of the URL or web address. A redirecting link can also be used as a permanent address for content that frequently changes hosts, similarly to the Domain Name System. Hyperlinks involving URL redirection services are frequently used in spam messages directed at blogs and wikis.  Thus, one way to reduce spam is to reject all edits and comments containing hyperlinks to known URL redirection services; however, this will also remove legitimate edits and comments and may not be an effective method to reduce spam.\nRecently, URL redirection services have taken to using AJAX as an efficient, user friendly method for creating shortened URLs. A major drawback of some URL redirection services is the use of delay pages, or frame based advertising, to generate revenue.\n\n\n**** History ****\nThe first redirect services took advantage of top-level domains (TLD) such as \".to\" (Tonga), \".at\" (Austria) and \".is\" (Iceland). Their goal was to make memorable URLs. The first mainstream redirect service was V3.com that boasted 4 million users at its peak in 2000.  V3.com success was attributed to having a wide variety of short memorable domains including \"r.im\", \"go.to\", \"i.am\", \"come.to\" and \"start.at\".  V3.com was acquired by FortuneCity.com, a large free web hosting company, in early 1999. As the sales price of top level domains started falling from $50.00 per year to less than $10.00, use of redirection services declined. With the launch of TinyURL in 2002 a new kind of redirecting service was born, namely URL shortening. Their goal was to make long URLs short, to be able to post them on internet forums. Since 2006, with the 140 character limit on the extremely popular Twitter service, these short URL services have been heavily used.\n\n\n*** Referrer masking ***\nRedirection services can hide the referrer by placing an intermediate page between the page the link is on and its destination. Although these are conceptually similar to other URL redirection services, they serve a different purpose, and they rarely attempt to shorten or obfuscate the destination URL (as their only intended side-effect is to hide referrer information and provide a clear gateway between other websites.) This type of redirection is often used to prevent potentially-malicious links from gaining information using the referrer, for example a session ID in the query string. Many large community websites use link redirection on external links to lessen the chance of an exploit that could be used to steal account information, as well as make it clear when a user is leaving a service, to lessen the chance of effective phishing  .\nHere is a simplistic example of such a service, written in PHP.\n\nThe above example does not check who called it (e.g. by referrer, although that could be spoofed).  Also, it does not check the URL provided.  This means that a malicious person could link to the redirection page using a URL parameter of his/her own selection, from any page, which uses the web server's resources.\n\n== Security issues ==\nURL redirection can be abused by attackers for phishing attacks, such as open redirect and covert redirect. \"An open redirect is an application that takes a parameter and redirects a user to the parameter value without any validation.\" \"Covert redirect is an application that takes a parameter and redirects a user to the parameter value WITHOUT SUFFICIENT validation.\" It was disclosed in May 2014 by a mathematical doctoral student Wang Jing from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using URL redirection for short aliases of long URLs?",

For example, a web author with no control over the headers might use a Refresh meta tag whereas a web server administrator redirecting all pages on a site is more likely to use server configuration.\n\n\n*** Manual redirect ***\nThe simplest technique is to ask the visitor to follow a link to the new page, usually using an HTML anchor like:\n\nThis method is often used as a fall-back \u2014 if the browser does not support the automatic redirect, the visitor can still reach the target document by following the link.\n\n\n*** HTTP status codes 3xx ***\nIn the HTTP protocol used by the World Wide Web, a redirect is a response with a status code beginning with 3 that causes a browser to display a different page. If a client encounters a redirect, it needs to make a number of decisions how to handle the redirect. Different status codes are used by clients to understand the purpose of the redirect, how to handle caching and which request method to use for the subsequent request.\nHTTP/1.1 defines several status codes for redirection (RFC 7231):\n\n300 multiple choices (e.g. offer different languages)\n301 moved permanently (redirects permanently from one URL to another passing link equity to the redirected page)\n302 found (originally \"temporary redirect\" in HTTP/1.0 and popularly used for CGI scripts; superseded by 303 and 307 in HTTP/1.1 but preserved for backward compatibility)\n303 see other (forces a GET request to the new URL even if original request was POST)\n305 use proxy (indicates that the client's requested resource is only available through a proxy)\n307 temporary redirect (provides a new URL for the browser to resubmit a GET or POST request)\n308 permanent redirect (provides a new URL for the browser to resubmit a GET or POST request)Status codes 304 not modified and 305 use proxy are not redirects.\n\nAll of these status codes require the URL of the redirect target to be given in the Location: header of the HTTP response. The 300 multiple choices will usually list all choices in the body of the message and show the default choice in the Location: header.\n\n\n**** Example HTTP response for a 301 redirect ****\nA HTTP response with the 301 \"moved permanently\" redirect looks like this:\n\n\n**** Using server-side scripting for redirection ****\nWeb authors producing HTML content can't usually create redirects using HTTP headers as these are generated automatically by the web server program when serving an HTML file.  The same is usually true even for programmers writing CGI scripts, though some servers allow scripts to add custom headers (e.g. by enabling \"non-parsed-headers\").  Many web servers will generate a 3xx status code if a script outputs a \"Location:\" header line.  For example, in PHP, one can use the \"header\" function:\n\nMore headers may be required to prevent caching. The programmer must ensure that the headers are output before the body.  This may not fit easily with the natural flow of control through the code.  To help with this, some frameworks for server-side content generation can buffer the body data.  In the ASP scripting language, this can also be accomplished using response.buffer\n\n== Services ==\nThere exist services that can perform URL redirection on demand, with no need for technical work or access to the web server your site is hosted on.\n\n\n*** URL redirection services ***\nA redirect service is an information management system, which provides an internet link that redirects users to the desired content. The typical benefit to the user is the use of a memorable domain name, and a reduction in the length of the URL or web address. A redirecting link can also be used as a permanent address for content that frequently changes hosts, similarly to the Domain Name System. Hyperlinks involving URL redirection services are frequently used in spam messages directed at blogs and wikis.  Thus, one way to reduce spam is to reject all edits and comments containing hyperlinks to known URL redirection services; however, this will also remove legitimate edits and comments and may not be an effective method to reduce spam.\nRecently, URL redirection services have taken to using AJAX as an efficient, user friendly method for creating shortened URLs. A major drawback of some URL redirection services is the use of delay pages, or frame based advertising, to generate revenue.\n\n\n**** History ****\nThe first redirect services took advantage of top-level domains (TLD) such as \".to\" (Tonga), \".at\" (Austria) and \".is\" (Iceland). Their goal was to make memorable URLs. The first mainstream redirect service was V3.com that boasted 4 million users at its peak in 2000.  V3.com success was attributed to having a wide variety of short memorable domains including \"r.im\", \"go.to\", \"i.am\", \"come.to\" and \"start.at\".  V3.com was acquired by FortuneCity.com, a large free web hosting company, in early 1999. As the sales price of top level domains started falling from $50.00 per year to less than $10.00, use of redirection services declined. With the launch of TinyURL in 2002 a new kind of redirecting service was born, namely URL shortening. Their goal was to make long URLs short, to be able to post them on internet forums. Since 2006, with the 140 character limit on the extremely popular Twitter service, these short URL services have been heavily used.\n\n\n*** Referrer masking ***\nRedirection services can hide the referrer by placing an intermediate page between the page the link is on and its destination. Although these are conceptually similar to other URL redirection services, they serve a different purpose, and they rarely attempt to shorten or obfuscate the destination URL (as their only intended side-effect is to hide referrer information and provide a clear gateway between other websites.) This type of redirection is often used to prevent potentially-malicious links from gaining information using the referrer, for example a session ID in the query string. Many large community websites use link redirection on external links to lessen the chance of an exploit that could be used to steal account information, as well as make it clear when a user is leaving a service, to lessen the chance of effective phishing  .\nHere is a simplistic example of such a service, written in PHP.\n\nThe above example does not check who called it (e.g. by referrer, although that could be spoofed).  Also, it does not check the URL provided.  This means that a malicious person could link to the redirection page using a URL parameter of his/her own selection, from any page, which uses the web server's resources.\n\n== Security issues ==\nURL redirection can be abused by attackers for phishing attacks, such as open redirect and covert redirect. \"An open redirect is an application that takes a parameter and redirects a user to the parameter value without any validation.\" \"Covert redirect is an application that takes a parameter and redirects a user to the parameter value WITHOUT SUFFICIENT validation.\" It was disclosed in May 2014 by a mathematical doctoral student Wang Jing from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore."

    "instruction": "Speck (cipher)\n\n==Introduction==\nSpeck is a family of lightweight block ciphers publicly released by the National Security Agency (NSA) in June 2013. Speck has been optimized for performance in software implementations, while its sister algorithm, Simon, has been optimized for hardware implementations. Speck is an add\u2013rotate\u2013xor (ARX) cipher.\nThe NSA began working on the Simon and Speck ciphers in 2011. The agency anticipated some agencies in the US federal government would need a cipher that would operate well on a diverse collection of Internet of Things devices while maintaining an acceptable level of security.\n\n== Cipher description ==\nSpeck supports a variety of block and key sizes.  A block is always two words, but the words may be 16, 24, 32, 48 or 64 bits in size.  The corresponding key is 2, 3 or 4 words.  The round function consists of two rotations, adding the right word to the left word, xoring the key into the left word, then xoring the left word into the right word.  The number of rounds depends on the parameters selected, as follows:\nThe key schedule uses the same round function as the main block cipher.\n\n== Reference code ==\nThe following is the designers' reference implementation, written in C, of the Speck variant with a 128-bit block size and key, where key\n\n== Performance ==\nAccording to ECRYPT's stream cipher benchmarks (eBASC), Speck is one of the fastest ciphers available, both for long as well as short messages. Some median performances for long messages (128-bit, 128-block size version) are: 1.99 cycles per byte (cpb) on an AMD Ryzen 7 1700; 1.27 cpb on an Intel Core i5-6600; 15.96 cpb on a Broadcom BCM2836 Cortex A7. For example, on the ARMv7 platform, Speck is about 3 times faster than AES.When implemented on 8-bit AVR microcontroller, Speck encryption with 64-bit blocks and 128-bit key consumes 192 bytes of flash memory, temporary variables consume 112 bytes of RAM, and takes 164 cycles to encrypt each byte in the block.Salsa20 is a stream cipher with comparable performance, but it is difficult to use stream ciphers securely in some applications where block ciphers like Speck work well. This led Google to add an implementation of Speck in Linux kernel version 4.17, planning to offer it as an option for disk encryption on low-end Android devices that would otherwise be unencrypted due to slow AES performance on processors that lack AES instructions. Speck was later dropped from the Linux kernel due to backlash and concerns, and Google switched to the Adiantum algorithm instead.\n\n== Security ==\n\n\n*** Cryptanalysis ***\nThe designers claim that Speck, though a \"lightweight\" cipher, is designed to have the full security possible for each block and key size, against standard chosen-plaintext (CPA) and chosen-ciphertext (CCA) attacks.  Resistance against related-key attacks was also stated as a goal, though a less crucial one as attacks in that model are not relevant for typical use cases.:\u200a2\u200a  No effort was made to resist attacks in the known-key distinguishing attack model, nor did the designers evaluate Speck for use as a hash function.:\u200a8\u200aAs of 2018, no successful attack on full-round Speck of any variant is known.  Due to interest in Simon and Speck, about 70 cryptanalysis papers have been published on them.:\u200a10\u200a  As is typical for iterated ciphers, reduced-round variants have been successfully attacked.  The best published attacks on Speck in the standard attack model (CPA/CCA with unknown key) are differential cryptanalysis attacks; these make it through about 70\u201375% of the rounds of most variants, though these best attacks are only marginally faster than brute-force.:\u200a12\u200a  The design team states that while designing Speck, they found differential attacks to be the limiting attacks, i.e. the type of attack that makes it through the most rounds; they then set the number of rounds to leave a security margin similar to AES-128's at approximately 30%.:\u200a12\u201313\u200a\nSpeck has been criticized for having too small a security margin, i.e. too few rounds between the best attacks and the full cipher, in comparison to more conservative ciphers such as ChaCha20.\nCiphers with small security margins are more likely to be broken by future advances in cryptanalysis.  Speck's design team counters that there is a real-world cost to unnecessarily large security margins, especially on lightweight devices, that cryptanalysis during the design phase allowed the number of rounds to be set appropriately, and that they targeted AES's security margin.:\u200a17\u200aSpeck includes a round counter in the key schedule.  The designers state this was included to block slide and rotational cryptanalysis attacks.:\u200a16\u200a  Still, rotational-XOR cryptanalysis has been used to find distinguishers against reduced-round versions of Speck. Though the authors don't describe standard key-recovery attacks based on their distinguishers, their best distinguishers on Speck32 and Speck48 in the known-key distinguishing attack model for certain weak key classes make it through slightly more rounds than the best differential distinguishers.  One of the authors has said that his research was resource-constrained and that rotational-XOR distinguishers on more rounds are probably possible. However, this type of cryptanalysis assumes the related-key or even the known-key attack models, which are not a concern in typical cryptographic protocols and solutions.:\u200a8\u200a  The designers also state that Speck was not designed to resist known-key distinguishing attacks (which do not directly compromise the confidentiality of ciphers).:\u200a8\u200aThe designers state that NSA cryptanalysis found the algorithms to have no weaknesses, and security commensurate with their key lengths.:\u200a2\u200a  The design team says that their cryptanalysis included linear and differential cryptanalysis using standard techniques such as Matsui's algorithm and SAT/SMT solvers, though a full list of techniques used is not given.:\u200a10\u200a  Speck's designers have been criticized for not providing more details on NSA cryptanalysis of the ciphers.The NSA has approved Simon128/256 and Speck128/256 for use in U.S. National Security Systems, though AES-256 is still recommended for non-constrained applications.\n\n\n*** Side-channel attacks ***\nBeing an ARX cipher, Speck does not use S-boxes or other lookup tables; it is therefore naturally immune to cache-timing attacks.:\u200a12\u200a This contrasts with ciphers that use lookup tables such as AES, which have been shown to be vulnerable to such attacks.  However, like most block ciphers (including AES) Speck is vulnerable to power analysis attacks unless hardware countermeasures are taken.:\u200a12\u200a\n\n\n*** Block and key sizes ***\nAlthough the Speck family of ciphers includes variants with the same block and key sizes as AES (Speck128/128, Speck128/192, and Speck128/256), it also includes variants with block size as low as 32 bits and key size as low as 64 bits.  These small block and key sizes are insecure for general use, as they can allow birthday attacks and brute-force attacks, regardless of the formal security of the cipher.  The designers state that these block and key sizes were included for highly resource-constrained devices where nothing better is possible, or where only very small amounts of data are ever encrypted, e.g. in RFID protocols.:\u200a2\u20133\u200a  Only the variant with a 128-bit block size and 256-bit key size is approved for use in U.S. National Security Systems.\n\n== Standardization efforts and controversies ==\nInitial attempts to standardise Simon and Speck failed to meet International Organization for Standardization super-majority required by the process and the ciphers were not adopted. Expert delegates to the ISO from several countries including Germany, Japan and Israel opposed the efforts by the NSA to standardise the Simon and Speck ciphers, citing concerns that the NSA is pushing for their standardisation with knowledge of exploitable weaknesses in the ciphers. The position was based on partial evidence of weaknesses in the ciphers, lack of clear need for standardisation of the new ciphers, and the NSA's previous involvement in the creation and promotion of the backdoored Dual_EC_DRBG cryptographic algorithm.In response to concerns, the NSA stated that more than 70 security analysis papers from some of the world's leading cryptographers support NSA's conclusion that the algorithms are secure and NSA affirmed that it is not aware of any cryptanalytic techniques that would allow them or anyone else to exploit Simon or SpeckAfter initial attempts to standardise the ciphers failed, the ISO standardised Simon and Speck in other working groups. As of October 2018, the Simon and Speck ciphers have been standardized by ISO as a part of the RFID air interface standard, International Standard ISO/29167-21 (for Simon) and International Standard ISO/29167-22 (for Speck), making them available for use by commercial entities.On August 7, 2018, Speck was removed from the Linux kernel 4.20 release completely.\nRead the text above and answer this question: What are the supported block and key sizes for Speck, and how do they affect the round function?",

    "instruction": "Emotet\n\n==Introduction==\nEmotet is  a malware strain and a cybercrime operation believed to be based in Ukraine. The malware, also known as Heodo, was first detected in 2014 and deemed one of the most prevalent threats of the decade. In 2021, the servers used for Emotet were disrupted through global police action in Germany and Ukraine and brought under the control of law enforcement.First versions of the Emotet malware functioned as a banking trojan aimed at stealing banking credentials from infected hosts. Throughout 2016 and 2017, Emotet operators, sometimes known as Mealybug, updated the trojan and reconfigured it to work primarily as a \"loader,\" a type of malware that gains access to a system, and then allows its operators to download additional payloads. Second-stage payloads can be any type of executable code, from Emotet's own modules to malware developed by other cybercrime gangs.\nInitial infection of target systems often proceeds through a macro virus in an email attachment. The infected email is a legitimate-appearing reply to an earlier message that was sent by the victim.It has been widely documented that the Emotet authors have used the malware to create a botnet of infected computers to which they sell access in an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) model, referred in the cybersecurity community as MaaS (Malware-as-a-Service), Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS), or Crimeware. Emotet is known for renting access to infected computers to ransomware operations, such as the Ryuk gang.As of September 2019, the Emotet operation ran on top of three separate botnets called Epoch 1, Epoch 2, and Epoch 3.In July 2020, Emotet campaigns were detected globally, infecting its victims with TrickBot and Qbot, which are used to steal banking credentials and spread inside networks. Some of the malspam campaigns contained malicious documents with names such as \"form.doc\" or \"invoice.doc\". According to security researchers, the malicious document launches a PowerShell script to pull the Emotet payload from malicious websites and infected machines. In November 2020, Emotet used parked domains to distribute payloads.

      "answer": "When Emotet was first detected in 2014, it functioned as a banking trojan aimed at stealing banking credentials from infected hosts.",
      "context": "Emotet\n\n==Introduction==\nEmotet is  a malware strain and a cybercrime operation believed to be based in Ukraine. The malware, also known as Heodo, was first detected in 2014 and deemed one of the most prevalent threats of the decade. In 2021, the servers used for Emotet were disrupted through global police action in Germany and Ukraine and brought under the control of law enforcement.First versions of the Emotet malware functioned as a banking trojan aimed at stealing banking credentials from infected hosts. Throughout 2016 and 2017, Emotet operators, sometimes known as Mealybug, updated the trojan and reconfigured it to work primarily as a \"loader,\" a type of malware that gains access to a system, and then allows its operators to download additional payloads. Second-stage payloads can be any type of executable code, from Emotet's own modules to malware developed by other cybercrime gangs.\nInitial infection of target systems often proceeds through a macro virus in an email attachment. The infected email is a legitimate-appearing reply to an earlier message that was sent by the victim.It has been widely documented that the Emotet authors have used the malware to create a botnet of infected computers to which they sell access in an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) model, referred in the cybersecurity community as MaaS (Malware-as-a-Service), Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS), or Crimeware. Emotet is known for renting access to infected computers to ransomware operations, such as the Ryuk gang.As of September 2019, the Emotet operation ran on top of three separate botnets called Epoch 1, Epoch 2, and Epoch 3.In July 2020, Emotet campaigns were detected globally, infecting its victims with TrickBot and Qbot, which are used to steal banking credentials and spread inside networks. Some of the malspam campaigns contained malicious documents with names such as \"form.doc\" or \"invoice.doc\". According to security researchers, the malicious document launches a PowerShell script to pull the Emotet payload from malicious websites and infected machines. In November 2020, Emotet used parked domains to distribute payloads. In January 2021, international action coordinated by Europol and Eurojust allowed investigators to take control of and disrupt the Emotet infrastructure. The reported action was accompanied with arrests made in Ukraine.On 14 November 2021, new Emotet samples emerged that were very similar to the previous bot code, but with a different encryption scheme that used elliptic curve cryptography for command and control communications.

In the most common form of a null cipher, the plaintext is included within the ciphertext and one needs to discard certain characters in order to decrypt the message (such as first letter, last letter, third letter of every second word, etc.) Most characters in such a cryptogram are nulls, only some are significant, and some others can be used as pointers to the significant ones.Here is an example null cipher message, sent by a German during World War I:\nPRESIDENT'S EMBARGO RULING SHOULD HAVE IMMEDIATE NOTICE.

For example, Cardinal Richelieu is said to have used a grille to write secret messages, after which the blank spaces were filled out with extraneous matter to create the impression of a continuous text.\n\n== Dot concealment cipher ==\nA dot or pinprick concealment cipher is a common classical encryption method in which dot or pinprick is placed above or below certain letters in a piece of writing. An early reference to this was when Aeneas Tacticus wrote about it in his book On the Defense of Fortifications.

Acrostics in poems and other written works that are not referenced to are a type of Null cipher.\nThis method is often used to secretly insult a famous or important individual. For example, Rolfe Humphries received a lifelong ban from contributing to Poetry Magazine after he wrote and tried to publish \"a poem containing a concealed scurrilous phrase aimed at a well-known person\", namely Nicholas Murray Butler.\n\n== Definition of a null ==\nPut simply, a null cipher is any cipher which involves a number of nulls, or decoy letters. As well as the methods shown above, a null cipher could be plaintext words with nulls placed in designated areas or even a plaintext message broken up in different positions with a null at the end of each word.

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nSpoofed URL\n\n==Introduction==\nA spoofed URL describes one website that poses as another website. It often applies a mechanism that exploits bugs in web browser technology, allowing a malicious computer attack. Such attacks are most effective against computers that lack recent security patches. Others are designed for the purpose of a parody.\nDuring such an attack, a computer user innocently visits a website and sees a familiar URL in the address bar such as http://www.wikipedia.org but is, in reality, sending information to an entirely different location that would typically be monitored by an information thief. When sensitive information is requested by a fraudulent website, it is called phishing.\nThe user is typically enticed to the false website from an email or a hyperlink from another website.\nIn another variation, a website may look like the original, but is in fact a parody of it. These are mostly harmless, and are more noticeably different from the original, as they usually do not exploit bugs in web browser technology.\nRedirects can also take place in a hosts file, redirecting from legitimate site(s) to another IP, that of the spoofed URL.\nWebsite spoofing \u2013 Using a fake website that looks legitimate or resembles a well-known website, hackers cheat users into entering their credentials or using the spoofed website, causing data theft.\n\n\n\n== Cyber security ==\nSpoofing is the act of deception or hoaxing. URLs are the address of a resource (as a document or website) on the Internet that consists of a communications protocol followed by the name or address of a computer on the network and that often includes additional locating information (as directory and file names). Simply, a spoofed URL is a web address that illuminates an immense amount of deception through its ability to appear as an original site, despite it not being one. In order to prevent falling victim to the prevalent scams stemmed from the spoofed URLs, major software companies have come forward and advised techniques to detect and prevent spoofed URLs.\n\n== Detection ==\nIn order to prevent criminals from accessing personal information, such as credit card information, bank account/routing numbers, and one\u2019s telephone number, home address, etc. it is important to learn and understand how these spoof URLs can be detected. It is very important to first verify the name of the site on a digital certification through the use of SSL/TLS. Always try to identify the actual URL for the web page you are on. Make sure you are able to see the full URL for any hyperlink, so that you can examine the address. Some characters that are commonly found in spoofed URLs are: %00, %01, @. Sometimes the URLs can differ by a single letter or number. In addition, set your Internet security level to high to ensure that your computer is protected from possible attacks from spoofed sites. In general, only input personal information on a Website if the name has been verified on the digital certificate. Also, if you have any concern about the confidentiality of a website leave the page immediately.\n\n== Prevention ==\nSpoofed URLs, a universal defining identity for phishing scams, pose a serious threat to end-users and commercial institutions. Email continues to be the favorite vehicle to perpetrate such scams mainly due to its widespread use combined with the ability to easily spoof them. Several approaches, both generic and specialized, have been proposed to address this problem. However, phishing techniques, growing in ingenuity as well as sophistication, render these solutions weak. In order to prevent users from future victimization stemmed from a spoofed URL, Internet vigilantes have published numerous tips to help users identify a spoof. The most common are: using authentication based on key exchange between the machines on your network, using an access control list to deny private IP addresses on your downstream interface, implementing filters of both inbound and outbound traffic, configuring routers and switches if they support such configuration, to reject packets originating from outside the local network that claim to originate from within, and enable encryption sessions in the router so that trusted hosts that are outside your network can securely communicate with your local hosts. Ultimately, protection comes from the individual user. Keeping up with new spoofing techniques or scams will readily allow one to identify a scam and most importantly keep information secure and personal.\n\n\n*** Susceptible targets ***\nPayPal, an e-commerce business allows money transactions to be made through the Internet and is a common target for spoofed URLs. This forgery of a legitimate PayPal website allows hackers to gain personal and financial information and thus, steal money through fraud. Along with spoof or fake emails that appear with generic greetings, misspellings, and a false sense of urgency, spoofed URLs are an easy way for hackers to violate one\u2019s PayPal privacy. For example, www.paypalsecure.com, includes the name, but is a spoofed URL designed to deceive. Remember to always log into PayPal through a new window browser and never log in through email. In the case that you do receive a suspected spoofed URL, forward the entire email to spoof@PayPal.com to help prevent the URL from tricking other PayPal users.\n\n== Common crimes ==\nA major crime associated with spoofed URLs is identity theft. The thief will create a website very similar in appearance to that of a popular site, then when a user accesses the spoofed URL, they can inadvertently give the thief their credit card and personal details. Their spoofed URLs might use \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d prices to lure more and more looking for a good deal. Crimes like these happen quite often, and most frequently during the festive holidays and other heavy online shopping periods of the year.Another crime associated with spoofed URLs is setting up a fake anti-malware software. An example of this would be Ransomware, fake anti-malware software that locks up important files for the computer to run, and forces the user to pay a ransom to get the files back. If the user refuses to pay after a certain period of time, the Ransomware will delete the files from the computer, essentially making the computer unusable. Ads for these programs usually appear on popular websites, such as dating sites or social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. They can also come in the form of attachments to emails.\nPhishing scams are also another major way that users can get tricked into scams (see below).\n\n== Phishing ==\nPhishing is a scam by which an e-mail user is duped into revealing personal or confidential information which the scammer can use illicitly. Phishing is the action of fraudsters sending an email to an individual, hoping to seek private information used for identity theft, by falsely asserting to be a reputable legal business. Phishing is performed through emails containing a spoofed URL, which links them to a website. Since it usually appears in the form on an email, it is crucial to not rely just on the address in the \u201cfrom\u201d field in order to prevent phishing. Computer users should also look out for spelling mistakes within the website's URLs, as this is another common sign to look out for in a phishing email. The website whose URLs are in the e-mails requests individuals to enter personal information so businesses can update it in their system. This information often includes passwords, credit card numbers, social security, and bank account numbers. In turn, the email recipients are giving these fake businesses their information the real businesses already have.\n\nHow do spoofed URLs exploit bugs in web browser technology to carry out cyber attacks?",

    "instruction": "Crypto-shredding\n\n==Introduction==\nCrypto-shredding is the practice of 'deleting' data by deliberately deleting or overwriting the encryption keys. \nThis requires that the data have been encrypted. Data may be considered to exist in three states: data at rest, data in transit and data in use. General data security principles, such as in the CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, require that all three states must be adequately protected.\nDeleting data at rest on storage media such as backup tapes, data stored in the cloud, computers, phones, or multi-function printers can present challenges when confidentiality of information is of concern. When encryption is in place, data disposal is more secure.\n\n\n\n== Motivations for use ==\nThere are various reasons for using crypto-shredding, including when the data is contained in defective or out-of date systems, there is no further use for the data, the circumstances are such that there are no [longer] legal rights to use or retain the data, and other similar motivations. Legal obligations may also come from regulations such as the right to be forgotten, the General Data Protection Regulation, and others. Data security is largely influenced by confidentiality and privacy concerns.\n\n== Use ==\nIn some cases all data storage is encrypted, such as encrypting entire harddisks, computer files, or databases. Alternatively only specific data may be encrypted, such as passport numbers, social security numbers, bank account numbers, person names, or record in a databases. Additionally, data in one system may be encrypted with separate keys when that same data is contained in multiple systems.\nWhen specific pieces of data are encrypted (possibly with different keys) it allows for more specific data shredding. There is no need to have access to the data (like an encrypted backup tape), only the encryption keys need to be shredded.\n\n\n*** Example ***\niOS devices and Macintosh computers with an Apple T2 or Apple silicon chip use crypto-shredding when performing the \"Erase all content and settings\" action by discarding all the keys in 'effaceable storage'. This renders all user data on the device cryptographically inaccessible, in a very short amount of time.\n\n== Best practices ==\nStoring encryption keys securely is important for shredding to be effective. For instance, shredding has no effect when a symmetric or asymmetric encryption key has already been compromised. A Trusted Platform Module is meant to address this issue. A hardware security module is considered one of the most secure ways to use and store encryption keys.\nBring your own encryption refers to a cloud computing security model to help cloud service customers to use their own encryption software and manage their own encryption keys.\nCrypographic 'salting': Hashing can be inadequate for confidentiality, because the hash is always the same when entering the same data. For example: The hash of a specific social security number can be reverse engineered by the help of rainbow tables. Salt addresses this problem.\n\n== Security considerations ==\nThere are many security issues that should be considered when securing data. Some examples are listed in this section. The security issues listed here are not specific to crypto-shredding, and in general these may apply to all types of data encryption. In addition to crypto-shredding, data erasure, degaussing and physically shredding the physical device (disk) can mitigate the risk further.\n\nEncryption strength can weaken over time as computing speed becomes more efficient and more time is available to discover exploits in secure systems.\nBrute-force attack: If data is not adequately encrypted it may be possible to decrypt it through brute-force methods. Newer technology such as quantum computing increases the potential to allow brute-force attacks to become more efficient in the future. However, quantum computing is less effective against specific encryption methods such as symmetric encryption than others that are more vulnerable to brute-force attacks such as public-key encryption. Even when data is secured via use of symmetric encryption, there are methods such as Grover's algorithm that make these kinds of attacks more effective, though this can be mitigated by other enhancements, such as using larger key values.\nData in use: Data that is \"in use\" has specific vulnerabilities. For example, when (plaintext) encryption keys are temporarily stored in RAM, it may be vulnerable to cold boot attacks, hardware advanced persistent threats, rootkits/bootkits, computer hardware supply chain attacks, and physical threats from users who have access.\nData remanence is the ability of computer memory to retain previously stored information beyond its intended lifetime, which also increases its vulnerability to unintended access. For example: When data on a harddisk is encrypted after it has been stored, it is possible that unencrypted data may remain on the harddisk. Encrypting data does not necessarily ensure the data will be overwritten at the same location as the unencrypted data. In addition, any bad sectors on a harddisk cannot be encrypted after data has been written to those locations. Encrypting data at the time it is written is always more secure than encrypting it after it has been stored without encryption.\nHibernation presents additional threats when an encryption key is used. Once an encryption key is loaded into RAM and the machine is placed into hibernation, all memory, including the encryption key, may be stored on the harddisk, which is outside of the encryption key's safe storage location.\n\nWhat are the potential impacts of data erasure, degaussing, and physically shredding the physical device in addition to crypto-shredding?",

    "instruction": "Context: Privacy concerns with social networking services\n\n==Introduction==\nSince the arrival of early social networking sites in the early 2000s, online social networking platforms have expanded exponentially, with the biggest names in social media in the mid-2010s being Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat. The massive influx of personal information that has become available online and stored in the cloud has put user privacy at the forefront of discussion regarding the database's ability to safely store such personal information. The extent to which users and social media platform administrators can access user profiles has become a new topic of ethical consideration, and the legality, awareness, and boundaries of subsequent privacy violations are critical concerns in advance of the technological age.A social network is a social structure made up of a set of social actors (such as individuals or organizations), sets of dyadic ties, and other social interactions between actors. Privacy concerns with social networking services is a subset of data privacy, involving the right of mandating personal privacy concerning storing, re-purposing, provision to third parties, and displaying of information pertaining to oneself via the Internet. Social network security and privacy issues result from the large amounts of information these sites process each day. Features that invite users to participate in\u2014messages, invitations, photos, open platform applications and other applications are often the venues for others to gain access to a user's private information. In addition, the technologies needed to deal with user's information may intrude their privacy.\nThe advent of the Web 2.0 has caused social profiling and is a growing concern for internet privacy. Web 2.0 is the system that facilitates participatory information sharing and collaboration on the Internet, in social networking media websites like Facebook and MySpace. These social networking sites have seen a boom in their popularity beginning in the late 2000s. Through these websites many people are giving their personal information out on the internet. These social networks keep track of all interactions used on their sites and save them for later use. Issues include cyberstalking, location disclosure, social profiling, third party personal information disclosure, and government use of social network websites in investigations without the safeguard of a search warrant.\n\n== Causes ==\nThere are several causes that contribute to the invasion of privacy throughout social networking platforms. It has been recognized that \u201cby design, social media technologies contest mechanisms for control and access to personal information, as the sharing of user-generated content is central to their function.\" This proves that social networking companies need private information to become public so their sites can operate. They require people to share and connect with each other. This may not necessarily be a bad thing; however, one must be aware of the privacy concerns. Even with privacy settings, posts on the internet can still be shared with people beyond a user's followers or friends. One reason for this is that \u201cEnglish law is currently incapable of protecting those who share on social media from having their information disseminated further than they intend.\" Information always has the chance to be unintentionally spread online. Once something is posted on the internet, it becomes public and is no longer private. Users can turn privacy settings on for their accounts; however, that does not guarantee that information will not go beyond their intended audience. Pictures and posts can be saved and posts may never really get deleted. In 2013, the Pew Research Center found that \"60% of teenage Facebook users have private profiles.\u201d This proves that privacy is definitely something that people still wish to obtain.A person's life becomes much more public because of social networking. Social media sites have allowed people to connect with many more people than with just in person interactions. People can connect with users from all across the world that they may never have the chance to meet in person. This can have positive effects; however, this also raises many concerns about privacy. Information can be posted about a person that they do not want getting out. In the book It's Complicated, the author, Danah Boyd, explains that some people \u201cbelieve that a willingness to share in public spaces\u2014and, most certainly, any act of exhibitionism and publicity\u2014is incompatible with a desire for personal privacy.\" Once something is posted on the internet, it becomes accessible to multiple people and can even be shared beyond just assumed friends or followers. Many employers now look at a person's social media before hiring them for a job or position. Social media has become a tool that people use to find out information about a person's life. Someone can learn a lot about a person based on what they post before they even meet them once in person. The ability to achieve privacy is a never ending process. Boyd describes that \u201cachieving privacy requires the ability to control the social situation by navigating complex contextual cues, technical affordances, and social dynamics.\" Society is constantly changing; therefore, the ability to understand social situations to obtain privacy regularly has to be changed.\n\n\n*** Various levels of privacy offered ***\nSocial networking sites vary in the levels of privacy offered. For some social networking sites like Facebook, providing real names and other personal information is encouraged by the site (onto a page known as a 'Profile'). This information usually consists of the birth date, current address, and telephone number(s).  Some sites also allow users to provide more information about themselves such as interests, hobbies, favorite books or films, and even relationship status. However, there are other social network sites, such as Match.com, where most people prefer to be anonymous.  Thus, linking users to their real identity can sometimes be rather difficult.  Nevertheless,  individuals can sometimes be identified with face re-identification.  Studies have been done on two major social networking sites, and it is found that by overlapping 15% of the similar photographs, profile pictures with similar pictures over multiple sites can be matched to identify the users.\n\n\n*** People concern ***\n\u201cAccording to research conducted by the Boston Consulting Group, privacy of personal data is a top issue for 76 percent of global consumers and 83 percent of U.S. consumers.\u201d Six-in-ten Americans (61%) have said they would like to do more to protect their privacy.For sites that do encourage information disclosure, it has been noted that a majority of the users have no trouble disclosing their personal information to a large group of people. In 2005, a study was performed to analyze data of 540 Facebook profiles of students enrolled at Carnegie Mellon University.  It was revealed that 89% of the users gave genuine names, and 61% gave a photograph of themselves for easier identification. Majority of users also had not altered their privacy setting, allowing a large number of unknown users to have access to their personal information (the default setting originally allowed friends, friends of friends, and non-friends of the same network to have the full view of a user's profile).  It is possible for users to block other users from locating them on Facebook, but this must be done by individual basis, and would, therefore, appear not to be commonly used for a wide number of people. Most users do not realize that while they may make use of the security features on Facebook the default setting is restored after each update.  All of this has led to many concerns that users are displaying far too much information on social networking sites which may have serious implications on their privacy.  Facebook was criticized due to the perceived laxity regarding privacy in the default setting for users.The \u201cPrivacy Paradox\u201d is a phenomenon that occurs when individuals, who state that they have concerns about their privacy online, take no action to secure their accounts. Furthermore, while individuals may take extra security steps for other online accounts, such as those related to banking or finance, this does not extend to social media accounts. Some of these basic or simple security steps would include deleting cookies, browser history, or checking one's computer for spyware.  Some may attribute this lack of action to \u201cthird-person bias\u201d. This occurs when people are aware of risks, but then do not believe that these risks apply or relate to them as individuals. Another explanation is a simple risk reward analysis. Individuals may be willing to risk their privacy to reap the rewards of being active on social media. Oftentimes, the risk of being exploited for the private information shared on the internet is overshadowed by the rewards of exclusively sharing personal information that bolsters the appeal of the social media user.In the study by Van der Velden and El Emam, teenagers are described as \u201cactive users of social media, who seem to care about privacy, but who also reveal a considerable amount of personal information.\u201d This brings up the issue of what should be managed privately on social media, and is an example of the Privacy Paradox. This study in particular looked at teenagers with mental illness and how they interact on social media. Researchers found that \u201cit is a place where teenage patients stay up-to-date about their social life\u2014it is not seen as a place to discuss their diagnosis and treatment.\u201d Therefore, social media is a forum that needs self-protection and privacy. Privacy should be a main concern, especially for teens who may not be entirely informed about the importance and consequences of public versus private use. For example, the \u201cdiscrepancy between stated privacy concerns and the disclosure of private information.\u201d\n\n\n**** User awareness in social networking sites ****\nUsers are often the targets as well as the source of information in social networking. Users leave digital imprints during browsing of social networking sites or services.  It has been identified from few of the online studies, that users trust websites and social networking sites. As per trust referred, \"trust is defined in (Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman, 1995) as \"the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another party based on the expectation that the other will perform a particular action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party\" (p. 712)\". A survey  was conducted by Carnegie Mellon University, a majority of users provided their living city, phone numbers among other personal information, while user is clearly unaware of consequences of sharing certain information. Adding to this insight, is the social networking users are from various cities, remote villages, towns, cultures, traditions, religions, background, economic classes, education background, time zones and so on that highlight the significant gap in awareness.\nThe survey results of the paper suggest, \"These results show that the interaction of trust and privacy concern in social networking sites is not yet understood to a sufficient degree to allow accurate modeling of behavior and activity. The results of the study encourage further research in the effort to understand the development of relationships in the online social environment and the reasons for differences in behavior on different sites.\"\nAs per reference, a survey conducted among social networking users at Carnegie Mellon University was indicative of following as reasons for lack of user awareness:\n1) People's disregard of privacy risks due to trust in privacy and protection offered on social networking sites. 2) Availability of user's personal details to third-party tools/applications. 3) APIs and Frameworks also enable any user, who has the fair amount of knowledge to extract the user's data. 4) Cross-site forgery and other possible website threats.\nThere is hence a dire need for improving User's awareness swiftly, in order to address growing security and privacy concerns caused due to merely user's unawareness. Social networking sites themselves can take a responsibility and make such awareness possible by means of participatory methods by virtual online means.To improve user's awareness, a possible method is to have privacy-related trainings for people to understand privacy concerns with the use of social media websites or apps. The trainings can include information of how certain companies or apps help secure user's privacy, and skills to protect user's privacy.\n\n\n*** Data access methods ***\nThere are several ways for third parties to access user information. Flickr is an example of a social media website that provides geotagged photos that allows users to view the exact location of where a person is visiting or staying. Geotagged photos make it easy for third party users to see where an individual is located or traveling to. There is also growing use of phishing, which reveals sensitive information through secretive links and downloads through email, messages, and other communications. Social media has opened up an entirely new realm for hackers to get information from normal posts and messages.\n\n\n**** Share it with third parties ****\nNearly all of the most popular applications on Facebook\u2014including Farmville, Causes, and Quiz Planet\u2014have been sharing users' information with advertising and tracking companies.\nEven though Facebook's privacy policy says they can provide \"any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected\" to advertisers, they violate this policy. If a user clicked a specific ad in a page, Facebook will send the user address of this page to advertisers, which will directly lead to a profile page. In this case, it is easy to identify users' names. For example, Take With Me Learning is an app that allows teachers and students to keep track of their academic process. The app requires personal information that includes, school name, user's name, email, and age. But Take With Me Learning was created by a company that was known for illegally gathering student's personal information without their knowledge and selling it to advertisement companies. This company had violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), used to keep children safe from identity theft while using the internet. Most recently, Facebook has been scrutinized for the collection of users' data by Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica was collecting data from Facebook users after they agreed to take a psychology questionnaire. Not only could Cambridge Analytica access the data of the person who took the survey, they could also access all of the data of that person's Facebook friends. This data was then used to hopefully sway people's\u2019 beliefs in hopes that they would vote for a certain politician. While what Cambridge Analytica did by collecting the data may or may not be illegal, they then transferred the data they acquired to third parties so that it could be used to sway voters. Facebook was fined \u00a3500,000 in the UK, $5bn (\u00a34bn) in the US, and in 2020, the company was taken to court by Australia's privacy regulator with the perspective of imposing a fine of A$1.7m (\u00a3860,000).\n\n\n**** API ****\nApplication programming interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. By using query language, sharing content and data between communities and applications became much easier.\nAPIs simplify all that by limiting outside program access to a specific set of features\u2014often enough, requests for data of one sort or another. APIs clearly define exactly how a program will interact with the rest of the software world\u2014saving time.An API allows software to \u201cspeak with other software.\u201d Furthermore, an API can collect and provide information that is not publicly accessible. This is extremely enticing for researchers due to the greater number of possible avenues of research. The use of an API for data collection can be a focal point of the privacy conversation, because while the data can be anonymous, the difficulty is understanding when it becomes an invasion of privacy. Personal information can be collected in mass, but the debate over whether it breaches personal privacy is due to the inability to match this information with specific people.There have however been some concerns with API because of the recent scandal between Facebook and the political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica.  What happened was \u201cFacebook allowed a third-party developer to engineer an application for the sole purpose of gathering data. And the developer was able to exploit a loophole to gather information on not only people who used the app but all their friends \u2014 without them knowing.\u201d \n\n\n**** Search engines ****\nSearch engines are an easy way to find information without scanning every site yourself. Keywords that are typed into a search box will lead to the results. So it is necessary to make sure that the keywords typed are precise and correct.\nThere are many such search engines, some of which may lead the user to fake sites which may obtain personal information or are laden with viruses. Furthermore, some search engines, like DuckDuckGo, will not violate the user's privacy.\n\n\n**** Location data ****\nOn most social media websites, user's geographical location can be gathered either by users (through voluntary check-in applications like Foursquare and Facebook Places) or by applications (through technologies like IP address geolocation, cellphone network triangulation, RFID and GPS). The approach used matters less than the result which holds that the content produced is coupled with the geographical location where the user produced it. Additionally, many applications attach the contents of other forms of information like OS language, device type and capture time. The result is that by posting, tweeting or taking pictures, users produce and share an enormous amount of personal information.\n\n\n**** Email and phone number leaks ****\nMany large platforms reveal a part of a user's email address or phone number when using the 'forgotten password' function. Often the whole email address can be derived from this hint and phone digits can be compared with known numbers.\n\n\n*** Benefit from data ***\nThis accessible data along with data mining technology, users' information can be used in different ways to improve customer service.\nAccording to what you retweet, what you like and the hashtag, Twitter can recommend some topics and advertisements. Twitter's suggestions for whom to follow is done by this recommendation system.\nCommerce, such as Amazon, make use of users' information to recommend items for users. Recommendations are based on at least prior purchases, shopping cart, and wishlist. Affinity analysis is a data mining technique that used to understand the purchase behavior of customers.\nBy using machine learning method, whether a user is a potential follower of Starbucks can be predicted. In that case, it is possible to improve the quality and coverage of applications. In addition, user profiles can be used to identify similar users.\nAccording to Gary Kovacs's speech about Tracking our online trackers, when he used the internet to find an answer to a question, \"We are not even 2 bites into breakfast and there are already nearly 25 sites that are tracking me\", and he was navigated by 4 of them.\n\n== Privacy concerns ==\nStudies have shown that people's belief in the right to privacy is the most pivotal predictor in their attitudes concerning online privacy.\n\n\n*** Social profiling and third party disclosure ***\nThe Privacy Act of 1974 (a United States federal law) states:\n\n\"No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains [subject to 12 exceptions].\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(b).Disclosure in this context refers to any means of communication, be it written, oral, electronic or mechanical. This states that agencies are forbidden to give out, or disclose, the information of an individual without being given consent by the individual to release that information. However, it falls on the individual to prove that a wrongful disclosure, or disclosure in general, has occurred. Because of this social networking sites such as Facebook ask for permission when a third-party application is requesting the user's information.\nAlthough The Privacy Act of 1974 does a lot to limit privacy invasion through third party disclosure, it does list a series of twelve exceptions that deem disclosure permissible:\n\n1. For members of an agency who need such information \"in the performance of their duties\".\n2. If the Freedom of Information Act requires such information\n3. If the information that is disclosed \"is compatible with the purpose for which it was collected\".\n4. If the Bureau of Census needs such information to complete a particular census.\n5. If the third party explicitly informs the individual that the information collected will serve only as a form of \"statistical research\" and is not \"individually identifiable\".\n6. If it is historically relevant to be added to the National Archives and Records Administration.\n7. If such information was requested by a law enforcement agency.\n8. If such information is deemed beneficial to the \"health or safety of an individual\".\n9. If such information is requested by the House of Congress or by one of its subcommittees.\n10. If such information is requested by the head of the Government Accountability Office or by one \"of his authorized representatives\".\n11. If such information is requested through a court order.\n12. If such information is requested through the Debt Collection Act.Social profiling allows for Facebook and other social networking media websites of filtering through the advertisements, assigning specific ones to specific age groups, gender groups, and even ethnicities.Data aggregation sites like Spokeo have highlighted the feasibility of aggregating social data across social sites as well as integrating it with public records.  A 2011 study highlighted these issues by measuring the amount of unintended information leakage over a large number of users with the varying number of social networks. It identified and measured information that could be used in attacks against what-you-know security.\nStudies have also pointed to most social networks unintentionally providing third party advertising and tracking sites with personal information. It raises the issue of private information inadvertently being sent to third party advertising sites via Referrer strings or cookies.\nCivil libertarians worry that social networking sites, particularly Facebook, have greatly diminished user confidentiality in numerous ways. For one thing, when social media platforms store private data, they also have complete access to that material as well. To sustain their profitability, applications like Facebook examine and market personal information by logging data through cookies, small files that stockpile the data on someone's device. Companies, such as Facebook, carry extensive amounts of private user information on file, regarding individuals\u2019, \u201clikes, dislikes, and preferences\u201d, which are of high value to marketers. As Facebook reveals user information to advertising and marketing organizations, personalized endorsements will appear on news feeds based on \u201csurfing behavior, hobbies, or pop culture preferences\u201d. For those reasons, Facebook's critics fear that social networking companies may seek business ventures with stockholders by sharing user information in the exchange of profits. Additionally, they argue that since Facebook demonstrates an illusion of privacy presented by a \u201cfor-friends-only\u201d type of platform, individuals find themselves more inclined to showcase more personal information online. According to the critics, users might notice that the sponsorships and commercials are tailored to their disclosed private data, which could result in a sense of betrayal.\n\n\n*** Institutional ***\nA number of institutions have expressed concern over the lack of privacy granted to users on social networking sites.  These include schools, libraries, and Government agencies.\n\n\n**** Libraries ****\nLibraries in the particular, being concerned with the privacy of individuals, have debated on allowing library patrons to access social networking sites on public library computers.  While only 19% of librarians reportedly express real concern over social networking privacy, they have been particularly vocal in voicing their concerns.  Some have argued that the lack of privacy found on social networking sites is contrary to the ethics supported by Library organizations, and the latter should thus be extremely apprehensive about dealing with the former.  Supporters of this view present their argument from the code of ethics held by both the American Library Association and the UK based Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals, which affirms a commitment to upholding privacy as a fundamental right.  In 2008, a study was performed in fourteen public libraries in the UK which found that 50% blocked access to social networking sites.  Many school libraries have also blocked Facebook out of fear that children may be disclosing too much information on Facebook.  However, as of 2011, Facebook has taken efforts to combat this concern by deleting profiles of users under the age of thirteen.\n\n== Potential dangers ==\n\n\n*** Identity theft ***\nAs there is so much information provided other things can be deduced, such as the person's social security number, which can then be used as part of identity theft.  In 2009, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University published a study showing that it is possible to predict most and sometimes all of an individual's 9-digit Social Security number using information gleaned from social networks and online databases.  (See Predicting Social Security Numbers from Public Data by Acquisti and Gross). In response, various groups have advised that users either do not display their number, or hide it from Facebook 'friends' they do not personally know.  Cases have also appeared of users having photographs stolen from social networking sites in order to assist in identity theft. According to the Huffington Post, Bulgarian IT consultant Bogomil Shopov claimed in a recent blog to have purchased personal information on more than 1 million Facebook users, for the shockingly low price of US$5.00. The data reportedly included users' full names, email addresses, and links to their Facebook pages. The following information could be used to steal the users' identities : Full names including middle name, date of birth, hometown, relationship status, residential information, other hobbies and interest.\n\n\n*** Preteens and early teenagers ***\nAmong all other age groups, in general, the most vulnerable victims of private-information-sharing behavior are preteens and early teenagers. According to research, many teens report that social media and social networking services are important to building relationships and friendships. With this fact comes privacy concerns such as identity theft, stealing of personal information, and data usage by advertising companies. Besides from using social media to connect, teenagers use social networking services for political purposes and obtaining information. However, sometimes social media can become the place for harassment and disrespectful political debates that fuels resentment and rises privacy concerns.There have been age restrictions put on numerous websites but how effective they are is debatable. Findings have unveiled that informative opportunities regarding internet privacy as well as concerns from parents, teachers, and peers, play a significant role in impacting the internet user's behavior in regards to online privacy. Additionally, other studies have also found that the heightening of adolescents' concern towards their privacy will also lead to a greater probability that they will utilize privacy-protecting behaviors. In the technological culture that society is developing into, not only should adolescents' and parent's awareness be risen, but society as a whole should acknowledge the importance of online privacy.Preteens and early teenagers are particularly susceptible to social pressures that encourage young people to reveal personal data when posting online. Teens often post information about their personal life, such as activities they are doing, sharing their current locations, who they spend time with, as well their thoughts and opinions. They tend to share this information because they do not want to feel left out or judged by other adolescents who are practicing these sharing activities already. Teens are motivated to keep themselves up to date with the latest gossip, current trends, and trending news and, in doing so they are allowing themselves to become victims of cyberbullying, stalking, and in the future, could potentially harm them when pursuing job opportunities, and in the context of privacy, become more inclined to share their private information to the public. This is concerning because preteens and teenagers are the least educated on how public social media is, how to protect themselves online, and the detrimental consequences that could come from sharing too much personal information online.  As more and more young individuals are joining social media sites, they believe it is acceptable to post whatever they are thinking, as they don't realize the potential harm that information can do to them and how they are sacrificing their own privacy. \"Teens are sharing more information about themselves on social media sites than they did in the past.\" Preteens and teenagers are sharing information on social media sites such as Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, and more by posting pictures and videos of themselves unaware of the privacy they are sacrificing. Adolescents post their real name, birthdays, and email addresses to their social media profiles. Children have less mobility than they have had in the past. Everything these teenagers do online is so they can stay in the loop of social opportunities, and the concern with this is that they do this in a way that is not only traceable but in a very persistent environment that motivates people to continue sharing information about themselves as well. Consequently, they continue to use social media sites such as Facebook, despite knowing there exists potential privacy risks.California is also taking steps to protect the privacy of some social media users from users\u2019 own judgments. In 2013, California enacted a law that would require social media sites to allow young registered users to erase their own comments from sites. This is a first step in the United States toward the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d that has been debated around the world over the past decade.\n\n\n*** Sexual predators ***\nMost major social networking sites are committed to ensuring that use of their services are as safe as possible.  However, due to the high content of personal information placed on social networking sites, as well as the ability to hide behind a pseudo-identity, such sites have become increasingly popular for sexual predators online.  Further, lack of age verification mechanisms is a cause of concern in these social networking platforms. However, it was also suggested that the majority of these simply transferred to using the services provided by Facebook.  While the numbers may remain small, it has been noted that the number of sexual predators caught using social networking sites has been increasing, and has now reached an almost weekly basis. In worst cases children have become victims of pedophiles or lured to meet strangers.They say that sexual predators can lurk anonymously through the wormholes of cyberspace and access victim profiles online. A number of highly publicized cases have demonstrated the threat posed for users, such as Peter Chapman who, under a false name, added over 3,000 friends and went on to rape and murder a 17-year-old girl in 2009. In another case, a 12-year-old, Evergreen girl was safely found by the FBI with the help of Facebook, due to her mother learning of her daughter's conversation with a man she had met on the popular social networking application.\n\n\n*** Stalking ***\n\nThe potential ability for stalking users on social networking sites has been noted and shared. Popular social networking sites make it easy to build a web of friends and acquaintances and share with them your photos, whereabouts, contact information, and interests without ever getting the chance to actually meet them. With the amount of information that users post about themselves online, it is easy for users to become a victim of stalking without even being aware of the risk. 63% of Facebook profiles are visible to the public, meaning if you Google someone's name and you add \"+Facebook\" in the search bar you pretty much will see most of the person profile. A study of Facebook profiles from students at Carnegie Mellon University revealed that about 800 profiles included current resident and at least two classes being studied, theoretically allowing viewers to know the precise location of individuals at specific times. AOL attracted controversy over its instant messenger AIM which permits users to add 'buddies' without their knowing, and therefore track when a user is online.  Concerns have also been raised over the relative ease for people to read private messages or e-mails on social networking sites. Cyberstalking is a criminal offense that comes into play under state anti-stalking laws, slander laws, and harassment laws. A cyberstalking conviction can result in a restraining order, probation, or even criminal penalties against the assailant, including jail.Some applications are explicitly centered on \"cyber stalking.\" An application named \"Creepy\" can track a person's location on a map using photos uploaded to Twitter or Flickr. When a person uploads photos to a social networking site, others are able to track their most recent location. Some smartphones are able to embed the longitude and latitude coordinates into the photo and automatically send this information to the application. Anybody using the application can search for a specific person and then find their immediate location. This poses many potential threats to users who share their information with a large group of followers.Facebook \"Places,\" is a Facebook service, which publicizes user location information to the networking community. Users are allowed to \"check-in\" at various locations including retail stores, convenience stores, and restaurants. Also, users are able to create their own \"place,\" disclosing personal information onto the Internet. This form of location tracking is automated and must be turned off manually. Various settings must be turned off and manipulated in order for the user to ensure privacy. According to epic.org, Facebook users are recommended to: (1) disable \"Friends can check me in to Places,\" (2) customize \"Places I Check In,\" (3) disable \"People Here Now,\" and (4) uncheck \"Places I've Visited.\". Moreover, the Federal Trade Commission has received two complaints in regards to Facebook's \"unfair and deceptive\" trade practices, which are used to target advertising sectors of the online community. \"Places\" tracks user location information and is used primarily for advertising purposes. Each location tracked allows third party advertisers to customize advertisements that suit one's interests. Currently, the Federal Trade Commissioner along with the Electronic Privacy Information Center are shedding light on the issues of location data tracking on social networking sites.\n\n\n*** Unintentional fame ***\nUnintentional fame can harm a person's character, reputation, relationships, chance of employment, and privacy- ultimately infringing upon a person's right to the pursuit of happiness. Many cases of unintentional fame have led its victims to take legal action. The right to be forgotten is a legal concept that includes removing one's information from the media that was once available to the public. The right to be forgotten is currently enforced in the European Union and Argentina, and has been recognized in various cases in the United States, particularly in the case of Melvin v. Reid.  However, there is controversy surrounding the right to be forgotten in the United States as it conflicts with the public's right to know and the Constitution's First Amendment, restricting one's \u201cright to freedom of speech and freedom of expression\u201d (Amendment I).\nPrivacy concerns have also been raised over a number of high-profile incidents which can be considered embarrassing for users.  Various internet memes have been started on social networking sites or been used as a means towards their spread across the internet.  In 2002, a Canadian teenager became known as the Star Wars Kid after a video of him using a golf club as a light sabre was posted on the internet without his consent.  The video quickly became a hit, much to the embarrassment of the teenager, who claims to have suffered as a result.  Along with other incidents of videos being posted on social networking sites, this highlights the ability for personal information to be rapidly transferred between users.\n\n\n*** Employment ***\nIssues relating to privacy and employment are becoming a concern with regards to social networking sites. As of 2008, it has been estimated by CareerBuilder.com that one in five employers search social networking sites in order to screen potential candidates (increasing from only 11% in 2006).  For the majority of employers, such action is to acquire negative information about candidates.  For example, 41% of managers considered information relating to candidates' alcohol and drug use to be a top concern.   Other concerns investigated via social networking sites included poor communication skills, inappropriate photographs, inaccurate qualifications and bad-mouthing former employers/colleagues.  However, 24% manager claimed that information found on a social networking site persuaded them to hire a candidate, suggesting that a user image can be used in a positive way.\nWhile there is little doubt that employers will continue to use social networking sites as a means of monitoring staff and screening potential candidates, it has been noted that such actions may be illegal under in jurisdictions.  According to Workforce.com, employers who use Facebook or Myspace could potentially face legal action:\nIf a potential employer uses a social networking site to check out a job candidate and then rejects that person based on what they see, he or she could be charged with discrimination.  On August 1, 2012, Illinois joined the state of Maryland (law passed in March 2012) in prohibiting employer access to social media web sites of their employees and prospective employees.  A number of other states that are also considering such prohibitory legislation (California, Delaware, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, South Carolina and Washington), as is the United States Congress.  In April 2012, the Social Networking Online Protection Act (2012 H.R. 5050) was introduced in the United States House of Representatives, and the Password Protection Act of 2012 (2012 S. 3074) was introduced in the United States Senate in May 2012, which prohibit employers from requiring access to their employees' social media web sites.With the recent concerns about new technologies, the United States is now developing laws and regulations to protect certain aspects of people's information on different medias.[CR4]  For example, 12 states in the US currently have laws specifically restricting employers from demanding access to their employees\u2019 social media sites when those sites are not fully public. (The states that have passed these laws are Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington.)Monitoring of social networking sites is not limited to potential workers.  Issues relating to privacy are becoming an increasing concern for those currently in employment.  A number of high-profile cases have appeared in which individuals have been sacked for posting comments on social networking which have been considered disparaging to their current employers or fellow workers.  In 2009, sixteen-year-old Kimberley Swann was sacked from her position at Ivell Marketing and Logistics Limited after describing her job as 'boring'.  In 2008, Virgin Atlantic sacked thirteen cabin crew staff, after it emerged they used had criticized the company's safety standards and called passengers 'chavs' on Facebook. There is no federal law that we are aware of that an employer is breaking by monitoring employees on social networking sites. In fact, employers can even hire third-party companies to monitor online employee activity for them. According to an article by Read Write Web employers use the service to \"make sure that employees don't leak sensitive information on social networks or engage in any behavior that could damage a company's reputation.\" While employers may have found such usages of social networking sites convenient, complaints have been put forward by civil liberties groups and trade unions on the invasive approach adopted by many employers.  In response to the Kimberley Swann case, Brendan Barber, of the TUC union stated that:\nMost employers wouldn't dream of following their staff down the pub to see if they were sounding off about work to their friends,\" he said.\n\"Just because snooping on personal conversations is possible these days, it doesn't make it healthy.\"\nMonitoring of staff's social networking activities is also becoming an increasingly common method of ensuring that employees are not browsing websites during work hours.  It was estimated in 2010 that an average of two million employees spent over an hour a day on social networking sites, costing potentially \u00a314 billion.\n\n\n*** Online victimization ***\nSocial networks are designed for individuals to socially interact with other people over the Internet. However, some individuals engage in undesirable online social behaviors, which negatively impacts other people's online experiences. It has created a wide range of online interpersonal victimization. Some studies have shown that social network victimization appears largely in adolescent and teens, and the type of victimization includes sexual advances and harassment. Recent research has reported approximately 9% of online victimization involves social network activities. It has been noted that many of these victims are girls who have been sexually victimized over these social network sites. Research concludes that many of social network victimizations are associated with user behaviors and interaction with one another. Negative social behaviors such as aggressive attitudes and discussing sexual related topics motivate the offenders to achieve their goals. All in all, positive online social behaviors is promoted to help reduce and avoid online victimization.\n\n\n*** Surveillance ***\nWhile the concept of a worldwide communicative network seems to adhere to the public sphere model, market forces control access to such a resource. In 2010, investigation by The Wall Street Journal found that many of the most popular applications on Facebook were transmitting identifying information about users and their friends to advertisers and internet tracking companies, which is a violation of Facebook's privacy policy. The Wall Street Journal analyzed the ten most popular Facebook apps, including Zynga's FarmVille with 57 million users, and Zynga's Mafia Wars with 21.9 million users, and found that they were transmitting Facebook user IDs to data aggregators. Every online move leaves cyber footprints that are rapidly becoming fodder for research without people ever realizing it. Using social media for academic research is accelerating and raising ethical concerns along the way, as vast amounts of information collected by private companies \u2014 including Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter \u2014 are giving new insight into all aspects of everyday life. Our social media \"audience\" is bigger than we actually know; our followers or friends aren't the only ones that can see information about us. Social media sites are collecting data from us just by searching something such as \"favorite restaurant\" on our search engine. Facebook is transformed from a public space to a behavioral laboratory,\" says the study, which cites a Harvard-based research project of 1,700 college-based Facebook users in which it became possible to \"deanonymize parts of the data set,\" or cross-reference anonymous data to make student identification possible. Some of Facebook's research on user behavior found that 71% of people drafted at least one post that they never posted. Another analyzed 400,000 posts and found that children's communication with parents decreases in frequency from age 13 but then rises when they move out.\n\n\n*** Law enforcement prowling the networks ***\n\nThe FBI has dedicated undercover agents on Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn. One example of investigators using Facebook to nab a criminal is the case of Maxi Sopo.  Charged with bank fraud, and having escaped to Mexico, he was nowhere to be found until he started posting on Facebook.  Although his profile was private, his list of friends was not, and through this vector, where he met a former official of the Justice Department, he was eventually caught.In recent years, some state and local law enforcement agencies have also begun to rely on social media websites as resources. Although obtaining records of information not shared publicly by or about site users often requires a subpoena, public pages on sites such as Facebook and MySpace offer access to personal information that can be valuable to law enforcement. Police departments have reported using social media websites to assist in investigations, locate and track suspects, and monitor gang activity.On October 18, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was scheduled to begin using personal information collected using social media platforms to screen immigrants arriving in the U.S.  The department made this new measure known in a posting to the Federal Register in September 2017, noting that \u201c...social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information and search results...\u201d would be included in an applicant's immigration file.  This announcement, which was made relatively quietly, has received criticism from privacy advocates.  The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement in late September 2017 asserting that the planned use of social media is nothing new, with one department spokesperson saying DHS has been using social media to collect information for years.  According to a statement made to National Public Radio, DHS uses \u201c...social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information, and search results\u201d to keep updated records on persons of interest.  According to the DHS, the posting to the Federal Register was an effort to be transparent regarding information about social media that is already being collected from immigrants.\nGovernment use of SMMS or \u201cSocial media monitoring software can be used to geographically track us as we communicate. It can chart out our relationships, networks, and associations. It can monitor protests, identify the leaders of political and social movements, and measure our influence.\u201d SMMS is also a growing industry. SMMS \u201cproducts like XI Social Discovery, Geofeedia, Dataminr, Dunami, and SocioSpyder (to name just a few) are being purchased in droves by Fortune 500 companies, politicians, law enforcement, federal agencies, defense contractors, and the military. Even the CIA has a venture fund, In-Q-Tel, that invests in SMMS technology.\u201d\n\n\n*** Mob rule ***\nThe idea of the 'mob rule' can be described as a situation in which control is held by those outside the conventional or lawful realm. In response to the News International phone hacking scandal involving News of the World in the United Kingdom, a report was written to enact new media privacy regulations.\nThe British author of the Leveson Report on the ethics of the British press, Lord Justice Leveson, has drawn attention to the need to take action on protecting privacy on the internet. This movement is described by Lord Justice Leveson as a global megaphone for gossip: \"There is not only a danger of trial by Twitter, but also of an unending punishment, and no prospect of rehabilitation, by Google\".\n\n\n*** Location updates ***\nFoursquare, Facebook, Loopt are application which allow users to check- in and these capabilities allows a user to share their current location information to their connection. Some of them even update their travel plans on social networking applications. However, the disclosure of location information within these networks can cause privacy concerns among mobile users. Foursquare defines another framework of action for the user. It appears to be in the interest of Foursquare that users provide many personal data that are set as public. This is illustrated, among others, by the fact that, although all the respondents want high control over the (location) privacy settings, almost none of them ever checked the Foursquare privacy settings before.  Although there are algorithms using encryption, k-anonymity and noise injection algorithms, its better to understand how the location sharing works in these applications to see if they have good algorithms in place to protect location privacy.\n\n\n*** Invasive privacy agreements ***\nAnother privacy issue with social networks is the privacy agreement. The privacy agreement states that the social network owns all of the content that users upload. This includes pictures, videos, and messages are all stored in the social networks database even if the user decides to terminate his or her account.Privacy agreements oftentimes say that they can track a user's location and activity based on the device used for the site. For example, the privacy agreement for Facebook states that \"all devices that a person uses to access Facebook are recorded such as IP addresses, phone numbers, operating system and even GPS locations\". One main concern about privacy agreements are the length, because they take a lot of time to fully read and understand. Most privacy agreements state the most important information at the end because it is assumed that people will not read it completely.\nThe ethical dilemma lies in that upon the agreement to register for SNSs, the personal information disclosed is legally accessible and managed by the sites privately established online security operators and operating systems; leaving access of user data to be \"under the discretion\" of the site(s) operators. Giving rise to the moral obligation and responsibility of the sites operators to maintain private information to be within user control. However, due to the legality of outsourcing of user data upon registration- without prior discretion, data outsourcing has been frequented by SNSs operating systems- regardless of user privacy settings.Data outsourcing has been proven to be consistently exploited since the emergence of SNSs. Employers have often been found to hire individuals or companies to search deep into the SNSs user database to find \"less than pleasant\" information regarding applicants during the review process.\n\n== Reading a privacy statement in terms and conditions ==\nOne of the main concerns that people have with their security is the lack of visibility that policies and settings have in the social networks. It is often located in areas hard to see like the top left or right of the screen. Another concern is the lack of information that users get from the companies when there is a change in their policies. They always inform users about new updates, but it is difficult to get information about these changes.Most social networking sites require users to agree to Terms of Use policies before they use their services.  Controversially, these Terms of Use declarations that users must agree to often contain clauses permitting social networking operators to store data on users, or even share it with third parties.  Facebook has attracted attention over its policies regarding data storage, such as making it difficult to delete an account, holding onto data after an account is de-activated and being caught sharing personal data with third parties.\nThis section explains how to read the privacy statement in terms and conditions while signing up for any social networking site.What to look for in the privacy policy:\n\nWho owns the data that a user posts?\nWhat happens to the data when the user account is closed?\nHow does changes in the privacy policy be made aware to its users?\nThe location of the privacy policy that is effective\nWill the profile page be completely erased when a user deletes the account?\nWhere and how can a user complain in case of any breach in privacy?\nFor how long is the personal information stored?The answers to these questions will give an indication of how safe the social networking site is.\n\n== Key points to protect social networking privacy ==\n\n\n*** Realize the threats that will always exist ***\nThere are people out there who want\u2014and will do just about anything\u2014to get someone's private information. It's essential to realize that it's difficult to keep your privacy secured all the time. Among other factors, it has been observed that data loss is correlated positively with risky online behavior and forgoing the necessary antivirus and anti spyware programs to defend against breaches of private information via the internet.\n\n\n*** Be thorough all the time ***\nLogging off after every session can help protect account security. It is dangerous to keep your device logged on since others may have access to your social profiles while you are not paying attention.Full names and addresses are typically considered personal information. Children's safety may be compromised if their parents post their whereabouts in a site where others know who their real identities are.\n\n\n*** Know the sites ***\nRead the social networking site's fine prints. Many sites push its users to agree to terms that are best for the sites\u2014not the users. Users should be aware about the terms in case of emergencies. Exactly how to read the terms are explained above at \"Reading a Privacy Statement in Terms and Conditions\" part\nMake sure the social networking site is safe before sharing information. Users shouldn't be sharing information if they don't know who are using the websites since their personally identifiable information could be exposed to other users of the site.\nBe familiar with the privacy protection provided.  Users should take the extra time to get to know the privacy protection systems of various social networks they are or will be using. Only friends should be allowed to access their information. Check the privacy or security settings on every social networking site that they might have to use.\n\n\n*** Protect devices ***\nEncrypt devices. Users should use complex passwords on their computers and cell phones and change them from time to time. This will protect users' information in case these devices are stolen.\nInstall Anti-virus software. Others would be able to use viruses and other ways to invade a user's computer if he or she installed something unsafe.\nUse devices that can disable camera, microphone, which mostly used for privacy invasion.\n\n\n*** Be careful about taking drastic actions ***\nThe users' privacy may be threatened by any actions. Following actions needs special attention. \n(1) Adding a new friend. Facebook reports 8.7% of its total profiles are fake. A user should be sure about who the person is before adding it as a new friend.\n(2) Clicking on links. Many links which looks attractive like gift cards are specially designed by malicious users. Clicking on these links may result in losing personal information or money.\n(3) Think twice about posting revealing photos. A revealing photo could attract the attention of potential criminals.\n\n== Social networks ==\n\n\n*** Facebook ***\n\nFacebook has been scrutinized for a variety of privacy concerns due to changes in its privacy settings on the site generally over time as well as privacy concerns within Facebook applications. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, first launched Facebook in 2004, it was focused on universities and only those with .edu address could open an account. Furthermore, only those within one's university network could see their page. Some argue that initial users were much more willing to share private information for these reasons. As time went on, Facebook became more public allowing those outside universities, and furthermore, those without a specific network, to join and see pages of those in networks that were not their own. In 2006 Facebook introduced the News Feed, a feature that would highlight recent friend activity. By 2009, Facebook made \"more and more information public by default\". For example, in December 2009, \"Facebook drastically changed its privacy policies, allowing users to see each others' lists of friends, even if users had previously indicated they wanted to keep these lists private\". Also, \"the new settings made photos publicly available by default, often without users' knowledge\".Facebook recently updated its profile format allowing for people who are not \"friends\" of others to view personal information about other users, even when the profile is set to private. However, As of January 18, 2011 Facebook changed its decision to make home addresses and telephone numbers accessible to third party members, but it is still possible for third party members to have access to less exact personal information, like one's hometown and employment, if the user has entered the information into Facebook. EPIC Executive Director Marc Rotenberg said \"Facebook is trying to blur the line between public and private information. And the request for permission does not make clear to the user why the information is needed or how it will be used.\"Breakup Notifier is an example of a Facebook \"cyberstalking\" app, which was taken down on 23 February 2011. The app was later unblocked. The application notifies the user when the person they selected changes their relationship status. The concept became very popular, with the site attracting 700,000 visits in the first 36 hours and the app being downloaded 40,000 times. Before the app was blocked, it had more than 3.6 million downloads and 9,000 Facebook likes.In 2008, four years after the first introduction of Facebook, Facebook created an option to permanently delete information. Until then, the only option was to deactivate one's Facebook account, which still left the user's information within Facebook servers. After thousands of users complaints, Facebook obliged and created a tool which was located in the Help Section but later removed. To locate the tool to permanently delete a user's Facebook, he or she must manually search through Facebook's Help section by entering the request to delete the Facebook in the search box. Only then will a link be provided to prompt the user to delete his or her profile.These new privacy settings enraged some users, one of whom claimed, \"Facebook is trying to dupe hundreds of millions of users they've spent years attracting into exposing their data for Facebook's personal gain.\" However, other features like the News Feed faced an initial backlash but later became a fundamental and very much appreciated part of the Facebook experience. In response to user complaints, Facebook continued to add more and more privacy settings resulting in \"50 settings and more than 170 privacy options.\" However, many users complained that the new privacy settings were too confusing and were aimed at increasing the amount of public information on Facebook. Facebook management responded that \"there are always trade offs between providing comprehensive and precise granular controls and offering simple tools that may be broad and blunt.\" It appears as though users sometimes do not pay enough attention to privacy settings and arguably allow their information to be public even though it is possible to make it private. Studies have shown that users actually pay little attention to \"permissions they give to third party apps.\"Most users are not aware that they can modify the privacy settings and unless they modify them, their information is open to the public. On Facebook privacy settings can be accessed via the drop down menu under account in the top right corner. There users can change who can view their profile and what information can be displayed on their profile. In most cases profiles are open to either \"all my network and friends\" or \"all of my friends.\" Also, information that shows on a user's profile such as birthday, religious views, and relationship status can be removed via the privacy settings. If a user is under 13 years old they are not able to make a Facebook or a MySpace account, however, this is not regulated.Although Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO, and others in the management team usually respond in some manner to user concerns, they have been unapologetic about the trend towards less privacy. They have stated that they must continually \"be innovating and updating what our system is to reflect what the current social norms are.\" Their statements suggest that the Internet is becoming a more open, public space, and changes in Facebook privacy settings reflect this. However, Zuckerberg did admit that in the initial release of the News Feed, they \"did a bad job of explaining what the new features were and an even worse job of giving you control of them.\"Facebook's privacy settings have greatly evolved and are continuing to change over time. Zuckerberg \"believes the age of privacy is 'over,' and that norms have evolved considerably since he first co-founded the social networking site\".  Additionally, Facebook has been under fire for keeping track of one's Internet usage whether users are logged into the social media site or not.  A user may notice personalized ads under the 'Sponsored' area of the page.  \"The company uses cookies to log data such as the date, time, URL, and your IP address whenever you visit a site that has a Facebook plug-in, such as a 'Like' button.\"  Facebook claims this data is used to help improve one's experience on the website and to protect against 'malicious' activity.  Another issue of privacy that Facebook uses is the new facial recognition software. This feature includes the software to identify photos that users are tagged in by developing a template based on one's facial features.What is the face recognition setting on Facebook and how does it work? | Facebook Help Center\nSimilar to Rotenberg's claim that Facebook users are unclear of how or why their information has gone public, recently the Federal Trade Commission and Commerce Department have become involved. The Federal Trade Commission has recently released a report claiming that Internet companies and other industries will soon need to increase their protection for online users. Because online users often unknowingly opt in on making their information public, the FTC is urging Internet companies to make privacy notes simpler and easier for the public to understand, therefore increasing their option to opt out. Perhaps this new policy should also be implemented in the Facebook world. The Commerce Department claims that Americans, \"have been ill-served by a patchwork of privacy laws that contain broad gaps,\". Because of these broad gaps, Americans are more susceptible to identity theft and having their online activity tracked by others.\n\n\n**** Internet privacy and Facebook advertisements ****\nThe illegal activities on Facebook are very widespread, in particular, phishing attacks, allowing attackers to steal other people's passwords. The Facebook users are led to land on a page where they are asked for their login information, and their personal information is stolen in that way.\nAccording to the news from PC World Business Center which was published on April 22, 2010, we can know that a hacker named Kirllos illegally stole and sold 1.5 million Facebook IDs to some business companies who want to attract potential customers by using advertisements on Facebook. Their illegal approach is that they used accounts which were bought from hackers to send advertisements to friends of users. When friends see the advertisements, they will have opinion about them, because \"People will follow it because they believe it was a friend that told them to go to this link,\" said Randy Abrams, director of technical education with security vendor Eset. There were 2.2232% of the population on Facebook that believed or followed the advertisements of their friends. Even though the percentage is small, the amount of overall users on Facebook is more than 400 million worldwide. The influence of advertisements on Facebook is so huge and obvious. According to the blog of Alan who just posted advertisements on the Facebook, he earned $300 over the 4 days. That means he can earn $3 for every $1 put into it. The huge profit attracts hackers to steal users' login information on Facebook, and business people who want to buy accounts from hackers send advertisements to users' friends on Facebook.\nA leaked document from Facebook has revealed that the company was able to identify \"insecure, worthless, stressed or defeated\" emotions, especially in teenagers, and then proceeded to inform advertisers. While similar issues have arisen in the past, this continues to make individuals\u2019 emotional states seem more like a commodity. They are able to target certain age groups depending on the time that their advertisements appear.Recently, there have been allegations made against Facebook accusing the app of listening in on its users through their smartphone's microphone in order to gather information for advertisers. These rumors have been proven to be false as well as impossible. For one, because it does not have a specific buzzword to listen for like the Amazon Echo, Facebook would have to record everything its users say. This kind of \u201cconstant audio surveillance would produce about 33 times more data daily than Facebook currently consumes\u201d. Additionally, it would become immediately apparent to the user as their phone's battery life would be swiftly drained by the amount of power it would take to record every conversation. Finally, it is clear that Facebook doesn't need to listen in on its users\u2019 conversations because it already has plenty of access to their data and internet search history through cookies. Facebook specifically states in their Cookies Policy that they use cookies to help display ads that will peak the users interest.  They then use this information to help make recommendations for numerous businesses, organizations, associations, etc. to individuals who may be interested in the products, services or causes they offer.Security Breach\nIn September 2018, there was an incident of a security breach within Facebook. Hackers were able to access and steal personal information in nearly half of the 30 million accounts. The company initially believed that even more, around 50 million users,  were affected in an attack that gave the hackers control of accounts.\n\n\n**** Facebook friends study ****\nA study was conducted at Northeastern University by Alan Mislove and his colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, where an algorithm was created to try and discover personal attributes of a Facebook user by looking at their friend's list. They looked for information such as high school and college attended, major, hometown, graduation year and even what dorm a student may have lived in. The study revealed that only 5% of people thought to change their friend's list to private. For other users, 58% displayed university attended, 42% revealed employers, 35% revealed interests and 19% gave viewers public access to where they were located. Due to the correlation of Facebook friends and universities they attend, it was easy to discover where a Facebook user was based on their list of friends. This fact is one that has become very useful to advertisers targeting their audiences but is also a big risk for the privacy of all those with Facebook accounts.\n\n\n**** Facebook Emotion Study ****\n\nRecently, Facebook knowingly agreed and facilitated a controversial experiment; the experiment blatantly bypassed user privacy and demonstrates the dangers and complex ethical nature of the current networking management system. The \"one week study in January of 2012\" where over 600,000 users were randomly selected to unknowingly partake in a study to determine the effect of \"emotional alteration\" by Facebook posts. Apart from the ethical issue of conducting such a study with human emotion in the first place, this is just one of the means in which data outsourcing has been used as a breach of privacy without user disclosure.Several issues about Facebook are due to privacy concerns. An article titled \"Facebook and Online Privacy: Attitudes, Behaviors, and Unintended Consequences\" examines the awareness that Facebook users have on privacy issues. This study shows that the gratifications of using Facebook tend to outweigh the perceived threats to privacy. The most common strategy for privacy protection\u2014decreasing profile visibility through restricting access to friends\u2014is also a very weak mechanism; a quick fix rather than a systematic approach to protecting privacy. This study suggests that more education about privacy on Facebook would be beneficial to the majority of the Facebook user population.\nThe study also offers the perspective that most users do not realize that restricting access to their data does not sufficiently address the risks resulting from the amount, quality, and persistence of data they provide. Facebook users in our study report familiarity and use of privacy settings, they are still accepting people as \"friends\" that they have only heard of through others or do not know at all and, therefore, most have very large groups of \"friends\" that have access to widely uploaded information such as full names, birthdates, hometowns, and many pictures.  This study suggests that social network privacy does not merely exist within the realm of privacy settings, but privacy control is much within the hands of the user. Commentators have noted that online social networking poses a fundamental challenge to the theory of privacy as control. The stakes have been raised because digital technologies lack \"the relative transience of human memory,\" and can be trolled or data mined for information. For users who are unaware of all privacy concerns and issues, further education on the safety of disclosing certain types of information on Facebook is highly recommended.\n\n\n*** Instagram ***\nInstagram tracks users' photos even if they do not post them using a geotag. This is through the information within metadata, which is in all photos. Metadata contains information like the lens type, location, time, and more of the photo. Users can be tracked through metadata without the use of geotags. The app geotags an uploaded image regardless of whether the user chose to share its location or not. Therefore, anybody can view the exact location where an image was uploaded on a map. This is concerning due to the fact that most people upload photos from their home or other locations they frequent a lot, and the fact that locations are so easily shared raises privacy concerns of stalking and sexual predators being able to find their target in person after discovering them online. The new Search function on Instagram combines the search of places, people, and tags to look at nearly any location on earth, allowing them to scout out a vacation spot, look inside a restaurant, and even to experience an event like they were there in person. The privacy implications of this fact is that people and companies can now see into every corner of the world, culture, and people's private lives. Additionally, this is concerning for individual privacy, because when someone searches through these features on Instagram for a specific location or place, Instagram shows them the personal photos that their users have posted, along with the likes and comments on that photo regardless of whether the poster's account is private or not. With these features, completely random people, businesses, and governments can see aspects of Instagram users' private lives. The Search and Explore pages that collect data based on user tagging illustrates how Instagram was able to create value out of the databases of information they collect on users throughout their business operations.\n\n\n*** Swarm ***\nSwarm is a mobile app that lets users check-in to a location and potentially make plans and set up future meetings with people nearby. This app has made it easier for people in online communities to share their locations, as well as interact with others in this community through collecting rewards such as coins and stickers through competitions with other users. If a user is on Swarm, their exact location may be broadcast even if they didn't select their location to be \"checked-in.\" When users turn on their \"Neighborhood Sharing\" feature, their location is shared as the specific intersection that they are at, and this location in current time can be viewed simply by tapping their profile image. This is concerning because Swarm users may believe they are being discreet by sharing only which neighborhood they are in, while in fact they are sharing the exact pinpoint of their location. The privacy implications of this is that people are inadvertently sharing their exact location when they do not know that they are. This plays into the privacy concerns of social media in general, because it makes it easier for other users as well as the companies this location data is shared with to track Swarm members. This tracking makes it easier for people to find their next targets for identity theft, stalking, and sexual harassment.\n\n\n*** Spokeo ***\nSpokeo is a \"people-related\" search engine with results compiled through data aggregation. The site contains information such as age, relationship status, estimated personal wealth, immediate family members and home address of individual people. This information is compiled through what is already on the internet or in other public records, but the website does not guarantee accuracy.\nSpokeo has been faced with potential class action lawsuits from people who claim that the organization breaches the Fair Credit Reporting Act. In September, 2010, Jennifer Purcell claimed that the FCRA was violated by Spokeo marketing her personal information. Her case is pending in court. Also in 2010, Thomas Robins claimed that his personal information on the website was inaccurate and he was unable to edit it for accuracy. The case was dismissed because Robins did not claim that the site directly caused him actual harm. On February 15, 2011, Robins filed another suit, this time stating Spokeo has caused him \"imminent and ongoing\" harm.\n\n\n*** Twitter ***\nIn January 2011, the US government obtained a court order to force the social networking site, Twitter, to reveal information applicable surrounding certain subscribers involved in the WikiLeaks cases.  This outcome of this case is questionable because it deals with the user's First Amendment rights.  Twitter moved to reverse the court order, and supported the idea that internet users should be notified and given an opportunity to defend their constitutional rights in court before their rights are compromised.Twitter's privacy policy states that information is collected through their different web sites, application, SMS, services, APIs, and other third parties. When the user uses Twitter's service they consent to the collection, transfer, storage, manipulation, disclosure, and other uses of this information. In order to create a Twitter account, one must give a name, username, password, and email address. Any other information added to one's profile is completely voluntary.\nTwitter's servers automatically record data such as IP address, browser type, the referring domain, pages visited, mobile carrier, device and application IDS, and search terms. Any common account identifiers such as full IP address or username will be removed or deleted after 18 months.Twitter allows people to share information with their followers. Any messages that are not switched from the default privacy setting are public, and thus can be viewed by anyone with a Twitter account. The most recent 20 tweets are posted on a public timeline.\nDespite Twitter's best efforts to protect their users privacy, personal information can still be dangerous to share. There have been incidents of leaked tweets on Twitter. Leaked tweets are tweets that have been published from a private account but have been made public. This occurs when friends of someone with a private account retweet, or copy and paste, that person's tweet and so on and so forth until the tweet is made public. This can make private information public, and could possibly be dangerous.Another issue involving privacy on Twitter deals with users unknowingly disclosing their information through tweets. Twitter has location services attached to tweets, which some users don't even know are enabled. Many users tweet about being at home and attach their location to their tweet, revealing their personal home address. This information is represented as a latitude and longitude, which is completely open for any website or application to access. People also tweet about going on vacation and giving the times and places of where they are going and how long they will be gone for. This has led to numerous break ins and robberies. Twitter users can avoid location services by disabling them in their privacy settings.\n\n\n*** Teachers and MySpace ***\nTeachers' privacy on MySpace has created controversy across the world. They are forewarned by The Ohio News Association that if they have a MySpace account, it should be deleted.  Eschool News warns, \"Teachers, watch what you post online.\" The ONA also posted a memo advising teachers not to join these sites. Teachers can face consequences of license revocations, suspensions, and written reprimands.\nThe Chronicle of Higher Education wrote an article on April 27, 2007, entitled \"A MySpace Photo Costs a Student a Teaching Certificate\" about Stacy Snyder.  She was a student of Millersville University of Pennsylvania who was denied her teaching degree because of an allegedly unprofessional photo posted on MySpace, which involved her drinking with a pirate's hat on and a caption of \"Drunken Pirate\".  As a substitute, she was given an English degree.\n\n\n*** Other sites ***\nSites such as Sgrouples and Diaspora have attempted to introduce various forms of privacy protection into their networks, while companies like Safe Shepherd have created software to remove personal information from the net.Certain social media sites such as Ask.fm, Whisper, and Yik Yak allow users to interact anonymously. The problem with websites such as these is that \u201cdespite safeguards that allow users to report abuse, people on the site believe they can say almost anything without fear or consequences\u2014and they do.\" This is a privacy concern because users can say whatever they choose and the receiver of the message may never know who they are communicating with. Sites such as these allow for a large chance or cyberbullying or cyberstalking to occur. People seem to believe that since they can be anonymous, they have the freedom to say anything no matter how mean or malicious.\n\n\n*** Internet privacy and Blizzard Entertainment ***\nOn July 6, 2010, Blizzard Entertainment announced that it would display the real names tied to user accounts in its game forums. On July 9, 2010, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Mike Morhaime announced a reversal of the decision to force posters' real names to appear on Blizzard's forums. The reversal was made in response to subscriber feedback.\n\n\n*** Snapchat ***\nSnapchat is a mobile application created by Stanford graduates Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy in September 2011. Snapchat's main feature is that the application allows users to send a photo or video, referred to as a \"snap\", to recipients of choice for up to ten seconds before it disappears. If recipients of a snap try and screenshot the photo or video sent, a notification is sent to the original sender that it was screenshot and by whom. Snapchat also has a \"stories\" feature where users can send photos to their \"story\" and friends can view the story as many times as they want until it disappears after twenty-four hours. Users have the ability to make their snapchat stories viewable to all of their friends on their friends list, only specific friends, or the story can be made public and viewed by anyone that has a snapchat account. In addition to the stories feature, messages can be sent through Snapchat. Messages disappear after they are opened unless manually saved by the user by holding down on the message until a \"saved\" notification pops up. There is no notification sent to the users that their message has been saved by the recipient, however, there is a notification sent if the message is screenshot.\n\n\n**** 2015 Snapchat privacy policy update ****\nIn 2015, Snapchat updated their privacy policy, causing outrage from users because of changes in their ability to save user content. These rules were put in place to help Snapchat create new and cool features like being able to replay a Snapchat, and the idea of \u201clive\u201d Snapchat stories. These features require saving content to snapchat servers in order to release to other users at a later time. The update stated that it has the rights to reproduce, modify, and republish photos, as well as save those photos to Snapchat servers. Users felt uncomfortable with the idea that all photo content was saved and the idea of \u201cdisappearing photos\u201d advertised by Snapchat didn't actually disappear. There is no way to control what content is saved and what isn't. Snapchat responded to backlash by saying they needed this license to access our information in order to create new features, like the live snapchat feature.\n\n\n**** Live Stories ****\nWith the 2015 new update of Snapchat, users are able to do \u201cLive Stories,\u201d which are a \u201ccollection of crowdsourced snaps for a specific event or region.\u201d By doing that, you are allowing snapchat to share your location with not just your friends, but with everyone. According to Snapchat, once you pick the option of sharing your content through a Live Story, you are providing to the company \"unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and license to use your name, likeness, and voice in any and all media and distribution channels.\"\n\n\n**** Privacy concerns with Snapchat ****\nOn Snapchat, there is a new feature that was incorporated into the app in 2017 called Snap Maps. Snap Maps allows users to track other users\u2019 locations, but when people \u201cfirst use the feature, users can select whether they want to make their location visible to all of their friends, a select group of connections or to no one at all, which Snapchat refers to as \u2018ghost mode.\u2019\u201dThis feature however has raised privacy concerns because \u201c\u2018It is very easy to accidentally share everything that you've got with more people than you need too, and that's the scariest portion\u2019. Cyber security expert Charles Tendell told ABC News of the Snapchat update.\u201d For protecting younger users of Snapchat, \u201cExperts recommend that parents stay aware of updates to apps like Snapchat. They also suggest parents make sure they know who their kids' friends are on Snapchat and also talk to their children about who they add on Snapchat.\u201dAn additional concern users have with the privacy of Snapchat is the deletion of Snapchat's after 30 days. Many users become confused as to why it looks like someone has gotten into their account and opened all of their snapchat's which then increases their Snapscore. This has caused great concern over hackers getting into personal Snapchat accounts. To reassure users, Snapchat has added to their Support webpage explaining the expiration of snapchats after 30 days yet it is still very unclear. To clarify, this is exactly what happens: after 30 days, any unopened Snapchats will automatically be deleted or expire (which appears to the user as the same thing as being opened automatically). Therefore, this will change the user's Snapscore. After snaps expire, it will look like all of the snapchats have been opened, shown by many unfilled or open boxes.\n\n\n***** Snapchat Spectacles*****\nIn 2016, Snapchat released a new product called \u201cSnapchat Spectacles,\u201d which are sunglasses featuring a small camera that allow users to take photos and record up to 10 seconds of footage. The cameras in the Spectacles are connected to users\u2019 existing Snapchat accounts, so they can easily upload their content to the application. This new product has received negative feedback because the Spectacles do not stand out from normal sunglasses beyond the small cameras on the lenses. Therefore, users have the ability to record strangers without them knowing. Furthermore, the simplistic design may result in people using the glasses accidentally, mistaking them for regular glasses. Critics of Snapchat Spectacles argue that this product is an invasion of privacy for the people who do not know they are being recorded by individuals who are wearing the glasses. Many people believe that these spectacles pose a risk in a way that their physical location might be disclosed to various parties, making the user vulnerable. Proponents disagree, saying that the glasses are distinguishable enough that users and people around them will notice them. Another argument in favor of the glasses is that people are already exposing themselves to similar scenarios by being in public.\n\n\n****** 2016 Amnesty International Report ******\nIn October 2016, Amnesty International released a report ranking Snapchat along with ten other leading social media applications, including Facebook, iMessage, FaceTime, and Skype on how well they protect users\u2019 privacy. The report assessed Snapchat's use of encryption and found that it ranks poorly in how it uses encryption to protect users\u2019 security as a result of not using end-to-end encryption. Because of this, third parties have the ability to access Snapchats while they are being transferred from one device to another. The report also claimed that Snapchat does not explicitly inform users in its privacy policy of the application's level of encryption or any threats the application may pose to users\u2019 rights, which further reduced its overall score. Regardless of this report, Snapchat is currently considered the most trustworthy social media platform among users.\n\n\n**** The FTC ****\nIn 2014, allegations were made against Snapchat by the Federal Trade Commission \"FTC\" for deceiving users on its privacy and security measures. Snapchat's main appeal is its marketed ability to have users' photos disappear completely after the one to ten second time frame\u2014selected by the sender to the recipient\u2014is up. However, the FTC made a case claiming this was false, making Snapchat in violation of regulations implemented to prevent deceptive consumer information. One focus of the case was that the reality of a \"snap\" lifespan is longer than most users perceive; the app's privacy policy stated that Snapchat itself temporarily stored all snaps sent, but neglected to offer users a time period during which snaps had yet to be permanently deleted and could still be retrieved. As a result, many third-party applications were easily created for consumers that hold the ability to save \"snaps\" sent by users and screenshot \"snaps\" without notifying the sender.\nThe FTC also claimed that Snapchat took information from its users such as location and contact information without their consent. Despite not being written in their privacy policy, Snapchat transmitted location information from mobile devices to its analytics tracking service provider. Although \"Snapchat's privacy policy claimed that the app collected only your email, phone number, and Facebook ID to find friends for you to connect with, if you're an IOS user and entered your phone number to find friends, Snapchat collected the names and phone numbers of all the contacts in your mobile device address books without your notice or consent.\" It was disclosed that the Gibsonsec security group warned Snapchat of potential issues with their security, however no actions were taken to reinforce the system.  In early 2014, 4.6 million matched usernames and phone numbers of users were publicly leaked, adding to the existing privacy controversy of the application. Finally, the FTC claimed that Snapchat failed to secure its \"find friends\" feature by not requiring phone number verification in the registration process. Users could register accounts from numbers other than their own, giving users the ability to impersonate anyone they chose.  Snapchat had to release a public statement of apology to alert users of the misconducts and change their purpose to be a \"fast and fun way to communicate with photos\".\n\n\n*** WhatsApp ***\nWhatsApp, created in 2009, is a platform that allows users to communicate via text and voice message, video chatting, and document sharing for free. WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook in 2014, but the brand continues to be promote as a secure and reliable form of communication. The app can be downloaded and used on Android, iPhone, Mac or Windows PC, and Windows Phone devices without SMS fees or charges from a carrier. While asterisks across the WhatsApp website denote some hazards of fees and additional charges, this has become a popular application for consumers that communication with people overseas.\n\n\n**** Privacy and security with WhatsApp ****\nIn 2019, WhatsApp incorporated new privacy and security measures for their users including- Hide Muted Status and Frequently Forwarded. The hide muted status feature allows users to hide specific updates or interactions with specific users; however, if the user would decide to \"unhide\" their status or updates from certain users, a list of all updates will be shown to the previously blocked user (including the previously hidden status/updates). Similar to apps such as Snapchat and Instagram, users are notified when a story is forwarded, viewed, screenshotted, or shared. WhatsApp developers have added the Frequently Forwarded feature that notifies users if a message, status, or update has been forwarded 4 or more times.\n\n== Response to criticism ==\nMany social networking organizations have responded to the criticism and concerns over privacy brought up over time.  It is claimed that changes to default settings, the storage of data and sharing with third parties have all been updated and corrected in the light of criticism, and/or legal challenges.  However, many critics remain unsatisfied, noting that fundamental changes to privacy settings in many social networking sites remain minor and at times, inaccessible, and argue that social networking companies prefer to criticize users rather than adapt their policies.There are suggestions for individuals to obtain privacy by reducing or ending their own use of social media. This method does not succeed, since their information is still revealed by posts from their friends.There is ambiguity about how private IP addresses are. The Court of Justice of the European Union has ruled they need to be treated as personally identifiable information if the business receiving them, or a third party like a service provider, knows the name or street address of the IP address holder, which would be true for static IP addresses, not for dynamic addresses.\nCalifornia regulations say IP addresses need to be treated as personal information if the business itself, not a third party, can link them to name and street address.\nIn 2020, An Alberta court ruled that police can obtain the IP addresses and the names and addresses associated with them, without a search warrant. An investigation found the IP addresses which initiated online crimes, and the service provider gave police the names and addresses associated with those IP addresses.\n\nQuestion: How can users protect their privacy when using social media on mobile devices?\n\nAnswer:",

      "context": "Privacy concerns with social networking services\n\n==Introduction==\nSince the arrival of early social networking sites in the early 2000s, online social networking platforms have expanded exponentially, with the biggest names in social media in the mid-2010s being Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat. The massive influx of personal information that has become available online and stored in the cloud has put user privacy at the forefront of discussion regarding the database's ability to safely store such personal information. The extent to which users and social media platform administrators can access user profiles has become a new topic of ethical consideration, and the legality, awareness, and boundaries of subsequent privacy violations are critical concerns in advance of the technological age.A social network is a social structure made up of a set of social actors (such as individuals or organizations), sets of dyadic ties, and other social interactions between actors. Privacy concerns with social networking services is a subset of data privacy, involving the right of mandating personal privacy concerning storing, re-purposing, provision to third parties, and displaying of information pertaining to oneself via the Internet. Social network security and privacy issues result from the large amounts of information these sites process each day. Features that invite users to participate in\u2014messages, invitations, photos, open platform applications and other applications are often the venues for others to gain access to a user's private information. In addition, the technologies needed to deal with user's information may intrude their privacy.\nThe advent of the Web 2.0 has caused social profiling and is a growing concern for internet privacy. Web 2.0 is the system that facilitates participatory information sharing and collaboration on the Internet, in social networking media websites like Facebook and MySpace. These social networking sites have seen a boom in their popularity beginning in the late 2000s. Through these websites many people are giving their personal information out on the internet. These social networks keep track of all interactions used on their sites and save them for later use. Issues include cyberstalking, location disclosure, social profiling, third party personal information disclosure, and government use of social network websites in investigations without the safeguard of a search warrant.\n\n== Causes ==\nThere are several causes that contribute to the invasion of privacy throughout social networking platforms. It has been recognized that \u201cby design, social media technologies contest mechanisms for control and access to personal information, as the sharing of user-generated content is central to their function.\" This proves that social networking companies need private information to become public so their sites can operate. They require people to share and connect with each other. This may not necessarily be a bad thing; however, one must be aware of the privacy concerns. Even with privacy settings, posts on the internet can still be shared with people beyond a user's followers or friends. One reason for this is that \u201cEnglish law is currently incapable of protecting those who share on social media from having their information disseminated further than they intend.\" Information always has the chance to be unintentionally spread online. Once something is posted on the internet, it becomes public and is no longer private. Users can turn privacy settings on for their accounts; however, that does not guarantee that information will not go beyond their intended audience. Pictures and posts can be saved and posts may never really get deleted. In 2013, the Pew Research Center found that \"60% of teenage Facebook users have private profiles.\u201d This proves that privacy is definitely something that people still wish to obtain.A person's life becomes much more public because of social networking. Social media sites have allowed people to connect with many more people than with just in person interactions. People can connect with users from all across the world that they may never have the chance to meet in person. This can have positive effects; however, this also raises many concerns about privacy. Information can be posted about a person that they do not want getting out. In the book It's Complicated, the author, Danah Boyd, explains that some people \u201cbelieve that a willingness to share in public spaces\u2014and, most certainly, any act of exhibitionism and publicity\u2014is incompatible with a desire for personal privacy.\" Once something is posted on the internet, it becomes accessible to multiple people and can even be shared beyond just assumed friends or followers. Many employers now look at a person's social media before hiring them for a job or position. Social media has become a tool that people use to find out information about a person's life. Someone can learn a lot about a person based on what they post before they even meet them once in person. The ability to achieve privacy is a never ending process. Boyd describes that \u201cachieving privacy requires the ability to control the social situation by navigating complex contextual cues, technical affordances, and social dynamics.\" Society is constantly changing; therefore, the ability to understand social situations to obtain privacy regularly has to be changed.\n\n\n*** Various levels of privacy offered ***\nSocial networking sites vary in the levels of privacy offered. For some social networking sites like Facebook, providing real names and other personal information is encouraged by the site (onto a page known as a 'Profile'). This information usually consists of the birth date, current address, and telephone number(s).  Some sites also allow users to provide more information about themselves such as interests, hobbies, favorite books or films, and even relationship status. However, there are other social network sites, such as Match.com, where most people prefer to be anonymous.  Thus, linking users to their real identity can sometimes be rather difficult.  Nevertheless,  individuals can sometimes be identified with face re-identification.  Studies have been done on two major social networking sites, and it is found that by overlapping 15% of the similar photographs, profile pictures with similar pictures over multiple sites can be matched to identify the users.\n\n\n*** People concern ***\n\u201cAccording to research conducted by the Boston Consulting Group, privacy of personal data is a top issue for 76 percent of global consumers and 83 percent of U.S. consumers.\u201d Six-in-ten Americans (61%) have said they would like to do more to protect their privacy.For sites that do encourage information disclosure, it has been noted that a majority of the users have no trouble disclosing their personal information to a large group of people. In 2005, a study was performed to analyze data of 540 Facebook profiles of students enrolled at Carnegie Mellon University.  It was revealed that 89% of the users gave genuine names, and 61% gave a photograph of themselves for easier identification. Majority of users also had not altered their privacy setting, allowing a large number of unknown users to have access to their personal information (the default setting originally allowed friends, friends of friends, and non-friends of the same network to have the full view of a user's profile).  It is possible for users to block other users from locating them on Facebook, but this must be done by individual basis, and would, therefore, appear not to be commonly used for a wide number of people. Most users do not realize that while they may make use of the security features on Facebook the default setting is restored after each update.  All of this has led to many concerns that users are displaying far too much information on social networking sites which may have serious implications on their privacy.  Facebook was criticized due to the perceived laxity regarding privacy in the default setting for users.The \u201cPrivacy Paradox\u201d is a phenomenon that occurs when individuals, who state that they have concerns about their privacy online, take no action to secure their accounts. Furthermore, while individuals may take extra security steps for other online accounts, such as those related to banking or finance, this does not extend to social media accounts. Some of these basic or simple security steps would include deleting cookies, browser history, or checking one's computer for spyware.  Some may attribute this lack of action to \u201cthird-person bias\u201d. This occurs when people are aware of risks, but then do not believe that these risks apply or relate to them as individuals. Another explanation is a simple risk reward analysis. Individuals may be willing to risk their privacy to reap the rewards of being active on social media. Oftentimes, the risk of being exploited for the private information shared on the internet is overshadowed by the rewards of exclusively sharing personal information that bolsters the appeal of the social media user.In the study by Van der Velden and El Emam, teenagers are described as \u201cactive users of social media, who seem to care about privacy, but who also reveal a considerable amount of personal information.\u201d This brings up the issue of what should be managed privately on social media, and is an example of the Privacy Paradox. This study in particular looked at teenagers with mental illness and how they interact on social media. Researchers found that \u201cit is a place where teenage patients stay up-to-date about their social life\u2014it is not seen as a place to discuss their diagnosis and treatment.\u201d Therefore, social media is a forum that needs self-protection and privacy. Privacy should be a main concern, especially for teens who may not be entirely informed about the importance and consequences of public versus private use. For example, the \u201cdiscrepancy between stated privacy concerns and the disclosure of private information.\u201d\n\n\n**** User awareness in social networking sites ****\nUsers are often the targets as well as the source of information in social networking. Users leave digital imprints during browsing of social networking sites or services.  It has been identified from few of the online studies, that users trust websites and social networking sites. As per trust referred, \"trust is defined in (Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman, 1995) as \"the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another party based on the expectation that the other will perform a particular action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party\" (p. 712)\". A survey  was conducted by Carnegie Mellon University, a majority of users provided their living city, phone numbers among other personal information, while user is clearly unaware of consequences of sharing certain information. Adding to this insight, is the social networking users are from various cities, remote villages, towns, cultures, traditions, religions, background, economic classes, education background, time zones and so on that highlight the significant gap in awareness.\nThe survey results of the paper suggest, \"These results show that the interaction of trust and privacy concern in social networking sites is not yet understood to a sufficient degree to allow accurate modeling of behavior and activity. The results of the study encourage further research in the effort to understand the development of relationships in the online social environment and the reasons for differences in behavior on different sites.\"\nAs per reference, a survey conducted among social networking users at Carnegie Mellon University was indicative of following as reasons for lack of user awareness:\n1) People's disregard of privacy risks due to trust in privacy and protection offered on social networking sites. 2) Availability of user's personal details to third-party tools/applications. 3) APIs and Frameworks also enable any user, who has the fair amount of knowledge to extract the user's data. 4) Cross-site forgery and other possible website threats.\nThere is hence a dire need for improving User's awareness swiftly, in order to address growing security and privacy concerns caused due to merely user's unawareness. Social networking sites themselves can take a responsibility and make such awareness possible by means of participatory methods by virtual online means.To improve user's awareness, a possible method is to have privacy-related trainings for people to understand privacy concerns with the use of social media websites or apps. The trainings can include information of how certain companies or apps help secure user's privacy, and skills to protect user's privacy.\n\n\n*** Data access methods ***\nThere are several ways for third parties to access user information. Flickr is an example of a social media website that provides geotagged photos that allows users to view the exact location of where a person is visiting or staying. Geotagged photos make it easy for third party users to see where an individual is located or traveling to. There is also growing use of phishing, which reveals sensitive information through secretive links and downloads through email, messages, and other communications. Social media has opened up an entirely new realm for hackers to get information from normal posts and messages.\n\n\n**** Share it with third parties ****\nNearly all of the most popular applications on Facebook\u2014including Farmville, Causes, and Quiz Planet\u2014have been sharing users' information with advertising and tracking companies.\nEven though Facebook's privacy policy says they can provide \"any of the non-personally identifiable attributes we have collected\" to advertisers, they violate this policy. If a user clicked a specific ad in a page, Facebook will send the user address of this page to advertisers, which will directly lead to a profile page. In this case, it is easy to identify users' names. For example, Take With Me Learning is an app that allows teachers and students to keep track of their academic process. The app requires personal information that includes, school name, user's name, email, and age. But Take With Me Learning was created by a company that was known for illegally gathering student's personal information without their knowledge and selling it to advertisement companies. This company had violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), used to keep children safe from identity theft while using the internet. Most recently, Facebook has been scrutinized for the collection of users' data by Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica was collecting data from Facebook users after they agreed to take a psychology questionnaire. Not only could Cambridge Analytica access the data of the person who took the survey, they could also access all of the data of that person's Facebook friends. This data was then used to hopefully sway people's\u2019 beliefs in hopes that they would vote for a certain politician. While what Cambridge Analytica did by collecting the data may or may not be illegal, they then transferred the data they acquired to third parties so that it could be used to sway voters. Facebook was fined \u00a3500,000 in the UK, $5bn (\u00a34bn) in the US, and in 2020, the company was taken to court by Australia's privacy regulator with the perspective of imposing a fine of A$1.7m (\u00a3860,000).\n\n\n**** API ****\nApplication programming interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. By using query language, sharing content and data between communities and applications became much easier.\nAPIs simplify all that by limiting outside program access to a specific set of features\u2014often enough, requests for data of one sort or another. APIs clearly define exactly how a program will interact with the rest of the software world\u2014saving time.An API allows software to \u201cspeak with other software.\u201d Furthermore, an API can collect and provide information that is not publicly accessible. This is extremely enticing for researchers due to the greater number of possible avenues of research. The use of an API for data collection can be a focal point of the privacy conversation, because while the data can be anonymous, the difficulty is understanding when it becomes an invasion of privacy. Personal information can be collected in mass, but the debate over whether it breaches personal privacy is due to the inability to match this information with specific people.There have however been some concerns with API because of the recent scandal between Facebook and the political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica.  What happened was \u201cFacebook allowed a third-party developer to engineer an application for the sole purpose of gathering data. And the developer was able to exploit a loophole to gather information on not only people who used the app but all their friends \u2014 without them knowing.\u201d \n\n\n**** Search engines ****\nSearch engines are an easy way to find information without scanning every site yourself. Keywords that are typed into a search box will lead to the results. So it is necessary to make sure that the keywords typed are precise and correct.\nThere are many such search engines, some of which may lead the user to fake sites which may obtain personal information or are laden with viruses. Furthermore, some search engines, like DuckDuckGo, will not violate the user's privacy.\n\n\n**** Location data ****\nOn most social media websites, user's geographical location can be gathered either by users (through voluntary check-in applications like Foursquare and Facebook Places) or by applications (through technologies like IP address geolocation, cellphone network triangulation, RFID and GPS). The approach used matters less than the result which holds that the content produced is coupled with the geographical location where the user produced it. Additionally, many applications attach the contents of other forms of information like OS language, device type and capture time. The result is that by posting, tweeting or taking pictures, users produce and share an enormous amount of personal information.\n\n\n**** Email and phone number leaks ****\nMany large platforms reveal a part of a user's email address or phone number when using the 'forgotten password' function. Often the whole email address can be derived from this hint and phone digits can be compared with known numbers.\n\n\n*** Benefit from data ***\nThis accessible data along with data mining technology, users' information can be used in different ways to improve customer service.\nAccording to what you retweet, what you like and the hashtag, Twitter can recommend some topics and advertisements. Twitter's suggestions for whom to follow is done by this recommendation system.\nCommerce, such as Amazon, make use of users' information to recommend items for users. Recommendations are based on at least prior purchases, shopping cart, and wishlist. Affinity analysis is a data mining technique that used to understand the purchase behavior of customers.\nBy using machine learning method, whether a user is a potential follower of Starbucks can be predicted. In that case, it is possible to improve the quality and coverage of applications. In addition, user profiles can be used to identify similar users.\nAccording to Gary Kovacs's speech about Tracking our online trackers, when he used the internet to find an answer to a question, \"We are not even 2 bites into breakfast and there are already nearly 25 sites that are tracking me\", and he was navigated by 4 of them.\n\n== Privacy concerns ==\nStudies have shown that people's belief in the right to privacy is the most pivotal predictor in their attitudes concerning online privacy.\n\n\n*** Social profiling and third party disclosure ***\nThe Privacy Act of 1974 (a United States federal law) states:\n\n\"No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains [subject to 12 exceptions].\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a(b).Disclosure in this context refers to any means of communication, be it written, oral, electronic or mechanical. This states that agencies are forbidden to give out, or disclose, the information of an individual without being given consent by the individual to release that information. However, it falls on the individual to prove that a wrongful disclosure, or disclosure in general, has occurred. Because of this social networking sites such as Facebook ask for permission when a third-party application is requesting the user's information.\nAlthough The Privacy Act of 1974 does a lot to limit privacy invasion through third party disclosure, it does list a series of twelve exceptions that deem disclosure permissible:\n\n1. For members of an agency who need such information \"in the performance of their duties\".\n2. If the Freedom of Information Act requires such information\n3. If the information that is disclosed \"is compatible with the purpose for which it was collected\".\n4. If the Bureau of Census needs such information to complete a particular census.\n5. If the third party explicitly informs the individual that the information collected will serve only as a form of \"statistical research\" and is not \"individually identifiable\".\n6. If it is historically relevant to be added to the National Archives and Records Administration.\n7. If such information was requested by a law enforcement agency.\n8. If such information is deemed beneficial to the \"health or safety of an individual\".\n9. If such information is requested by the House of Congress or by one of its subcommittees.\n10. If such information is requested by the head of the Government Accountability Office or by one \"of his authorized representatives\".\n11. If such information is requested through a court order.\n12. If such information is requested through the Debt Collection Act.Social profiling allows for Facebook and other social networking media websites of filtering through the advertisements, assigning specific ones to specific age groups, gender groups, and even ethnicities.Data aggregation sites like Spokeo have highlighted the feasibility of aggregating social data across social sites as well as integrating it with public records.  A 2011 study highlighted these issues by measuring the amount of unintended information leakage over a large number of users with the varying number of social networks. It identified and measured information that could be used in attacks against what-you-know security.\nStudies have also pointed to most social networks unintentionally providing third party advertising and tracking sites with personal information. It raises the issue of private information inadvertently being sent to third party advertising sites via Referrer strings or cookies.\nCivil libertarians worry that social networking sites, particularly Facebook, have greatly diminished user confidentiality in numerous ways. For one thing, when social media platforms store private data, they also have complete access to that material as well. To sustain their profitability, applications like Facebook examine and market personal information by logging data through cookies, small files that stockpile the data on someone's device. Companies, such as Facebook, carry extensive amounts of private user information on file, regarding individuals\u2019, \u201clikes, dislikes, and preferences\u201d, which are of high value to marketers. As Facebook reveals user information to advertising and marketing organizations, personalized endorsements will appear on news feeds based on \u201csurfing behavior, hobbies, or pop culture preferences\u201d. For those reasons, Facebook's critics fear that social networking companies may seek business ventures with stockholders by sharing user information in the exchange of profits. Additionally, they argue that since Facebook demonstrates an illusion of privacy presented by a \u201cfor-friends-only\u201d type of platform, individuals find themselves more inclined to showcase more personal information online. According to the critics, users might notice that the sponsorships and commercials are tailored to their disclosed private data, which could result in a sense of betrayal.\n\n\n*** Institutional ***\nA number of institutions have expressed concern over the lack of privacy granted to users on social networking sites.  These include schools, libraries, and Government agencies.\n\n\n**** Libraries ****\nLibraries in the particular, being concerned with the privacy of individuals, have debated on allowing library patrons to access social networking sites on public library computers.  While only 19% of librarians reportedly express real concern over social networking privacy, they have been particularly vocal in voicing their concerns.  Some have argued that the lack of privacy found on social networking sites is contrary to the ethics supported by Library organizations, and the latter should thus be extremely apprehensive about dealing with the former.  Supporters of this view present their argument from the code of ethics held by both the American Library Association and the UK based Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals, which affirms a commitment to upholding privacy as a fundamental right.  In 2008, a study was performed in fourteen public libraries in the UK which found that 50% blocked access to social networking sites.  Many school libraries have also blocked Facebook out of fear that children may be disclosing too much information on Facebook.  However, as of 2011, Facebook has taken efforts to combat this concern by deleting profiles of users under the age of thirteen.\n\n== Potential dangers ==\n\n\n*** Identity theft ***\nAs there is so much information provided other things can be deduced, such as the person's social security number, which can then be used as part of identity theft.  In 2009, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University published a study showing that it is possible to predict most and sometimes all of an individual's 9-digit Social Security number using information gleaned from social networks and online databases.  (See Predicting Social Security Numbers from Public Data by Acquisti and Gross). In response, various groups have advised that users either do not display their number, or hide it from Facebook 'friends' they do not personally know.  Cases have also appeared of users having photographs stolen from social networking sites in order to assist in identity theft. According to the Huffington Post, Bulgarian IT consultant Bogomil Shopov claimed in a recent blog to have purchased personal information on more than 1 million Facebook users, for the shockingly low price of US$5.00. The data reportedly included users' full names, email addresses, and links to their Facebook pages. The following information could be used to steal the users' identities : Full names including middle name, date of birth, hometown, relationship status, residential information, other hobbies and interest.\n\n\n*** Preteens and early teenagers ***\nAmong all other age groups, in general, the most vulnerable victims of private-information-sharing behavior are preteens and early teenagers. According to research, many teens report that social media and social networking services are important to building relationships and friendships. With this fact comes privacy concerns such as identity theft, stealing of personal information, and data usage by advertising companies. Besides from using social media to connect, teenagers use social networking services for political purposes and obtaining information. However, sometimes social media can become the place for harassment and disrespectful political debates that fuels resentment and rises privacy concerns.There have been age restrictions put on numerous websites but how effective they are is debatable. Findings have unveiled that informative opportunities regarding internet privacy as well as concerns from parents, teachers, and peers, play a significant role in impacting the internet user's behavior in regards to online privacy. Additionally, other studies have also found that the heightening of adolescents' concern towards their privacy will also lead to a greater probability that they will utilize privacy-protecting behaviors. In the technological culture that society is developing into, not only should adolescents' and parent's awareness be risen, but society as a whole should acknowledge the importance of online privacy.Preteens and early teenagers are particularly susceptible to social pressures that encourage young people to reveal personal data when posting online. Teens often post information about their personal life, such as activities they are doing, sharing their current locations, who they spend time with, as well their thoughts and opinions. They tend to share this information because they do not want to feel left out or judged by other adolescents who are practicing these sharing activities already. Teens are motivated to keep themselves up to date with the latest gossip, current trends, and trending news and, in doing so they are allowing themselves to become victims of cyberbullying, stalking, and in the future, could potentially harm them when pursuing job opportunities, and in the context of privacy, become more inclined to share their private information to the public. This is concerning because preteens and teenagers are the least educated on how public social media is, how to protect themselves online, and the detrimental consequences that could come from sharing too much personal information online.  As more and more young individuals are joining social media sites, they believe it is acceptable to post whatever they are thinking, as they don't realize the potential harm that information can do to them and how they are sacrificing their own privacy. \"Teens are sharing more information about themselves on social media sites than they did in the past.\" Preteens and teenagers are sharing information on social media sites such as Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, and more by posting pictures and videos of themselves unaware of the privacy they are sacrificing. Adolescents post their real name, birthdays, and email addresses to their social media profiles. Children have less mobility than they have had in the past. Everything these teenagers do online is so they can stay in the loop of social opportunities, and the concern with this is that they do this in a way that is not only traceable but in a very persistent environment that motivates people to continue sharing information about themselves as well. Consequently, they continue to use social media sites such as Facebook, despite knowing there exists potential privacy risks.California is also taking steps to protect the privacy of some social media users from users\u2019 own judgments. In 2013, California enacted a law that would require social media sites to allow young registered users to erase their own comments from sites. This is a first step in the United States toward the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d that has been debated around the world over the past decade.\n\n\n*** Sexual predators ***\nMost major social networking sites are committed to ensuring that use of their services are as safe as possible.  However, due to the high content of personal information placed on social networking sites, as well as the ability to hide behind a pseudo-identity, such sites have become increasingly popular for sexual predators online.  Further, lack of age verification mechanisms is a cause of concern in these social networking platforms. However, it was also suggested that the majority of these simply transferred to using the services provided by Facebook.  While the numbers may remain small, it has been noted that the number of sexual predators caught using social networking sites has been increasing, and has now reached an almost weekly basis. In worst cases children have become victims of pedophiles or lured to meet strangers.They say that sexual predators can lurk anonymously through the wormholes of cyberspace and access victim profiles online. A number of highly publicized cases have demonstrated the threat posed for users, such as Peter Chapman who, under a false name, added over 3,000 friends and went on to rape and murder a 17-year-old girl in 2009. In another case, a 12-year-old, Evergreen girl was safely found by the FBI with the help of Facebook, due to her mother learning of her daughter's conversation with a man she had met on the popular social networking application.\n\n\n*** Stalking ***\n\nThe potential ability for stalking users on social networking sites has been noted and shared. Popular social networking sites make it easy to build a web of friends and acquaintances and share with them your photos, whereabouts, contact information, and interests without ever getting the chance to actually meet them. With the amount of information that users post about themselves online, it is easy for users to become a victim of stalking without even being aware of the risk. 63% of Facebook profiles are visible to the public, meaning if you Google someone's name and you add \"+Facebook\" in the search bar you pretty much will see most of the person profile. A study of Facebook profiles from students at Carnegie Mellon University revealed that about 800 profiles included current resident and at least two classes being studied, theoretically allowing viewers to know the precise location of individuals at specific times. AOL attracted controversy over its instant messenger AIM which permits users to add 'buddies' without their knowing, and therefore track when a user is online.  Concerns have also been raised over the relative ease for people to read private messages or e-mails on social networking sites. Cyberstalking is a criminal offense that comes into play under state anti-stalking laws, slander laws, and harassment laws. A cyberstalking conviction can result in a restraining order, probation, or even criminal penalties against the assailant, including jail.Some applications are explicitly centered on \"cyber stalking.\" An application named \"Creepy\" can track a person's location on a map using photos uploaded to Twitter or Flickr. When a person uploads photos to a social networking site, others are able to track their most recent location. Some smartphones are able to embed the longitude and latitude coordinates into the photo and automatically send this information to the application. Anybody using the application can search for a specific person and then find their immediate location. This poses many potential threats to users who share their information with a large group of followers.Facebook \"Places,\" is a Facebook service, which publicizes user location information to the networking community. Users are allowed to \"check-in\" at various locations including retail stores, convenience stores, and restaurants. Also, users are able to create their own \"place,\" disclosing personal information onto the Internet. This form of location tracking is automated and must be turned off manually. Various settings must be turned off and manipulated in order for the user to ensure privacy. According to epic.org, Facebook users are recommended to: (1) disable \"Friends can check me in to Places,\" (2) customize \"Places I Check In,\" (3) disable \"People Here Now,\" and (4) uncheck \"Places I've Visited.\". Moreover, the Federal Trade Commission has received two complaints in regards to Facebook's \"unfair and deceptive\" trade practices, which are used to target advertising sectors of the online community. \"Places\" tracks user location information and is used primarily for advertising purposes. Each location tracked allows third party advertisers to customize advertisements that suit one's interests. Currently, the Federal Trade Commissioner along with the Electronic Privacy Information Center are shedding light on the issues of location data tracking on social networking sites.\n\n\n*** Unintentional fame ***\nUnintentional fame can harm a person's character, reputation, relationships, chance of employment, and privacy- ultimately infringing upon a person's right to the pursuit of happiness. Many cases of unintentional fame have led its victims to take legal action. The right to be forgotten is a legal concept that includes removing one's information from the media that was once available to the public. The right to be forgotten is currently enforced in the European Union and Argentina, and has been recognized in various cases in the United States, particularly in the case of Melvin v. Reid.  However, there is controversy surrounding the right to be forgotten in the United States as it conflicts with the public's right to know and the Constitution's First Amendment, restricting one's \u201cright to freedom of speech and freedom of expression\u201d (Amendment I).\nPrivacy concerns have also been raised over a number of high-profile incidents which can be considered embarrassing for users.  Various internet memes have been started on social networking sites or been used as a means towards their spread across the internet.  In 2002, a Canadian teenager became known as the Star Wars Kid after a video of him using a golf club as a light sabre was posted on the internet without his consent.  The video quickly became a hit, much to the embarrassment of the teenager, who claims to have suffered as a result.  Along with other incidents of videos being posted on social networking sites, this highlights the ability for personal information to be rapidly transferred between users.\n\n\n*** Employment ***\nIssues relating to privacy and employment are becoming a concern with regards to social networking sites. As of 2008, it has been estimated by CareerBuilder.com that one in five employers search social networking sites in order to screen potential candidates (increasing from only 11% in 2006).  For the majority of employers, such action is to acquire negative information about candidates.  For example, 41% of managers considered information relating to candidates' alcohol and drug use to be a top concern.   Other concerns investigated via social networking sites included poor communication skills, inappropriate photographs, inaccurate qualifications and bad-mouthing former employers/colleagues.  However, 24% manager claimed that information found on a social networking site persuaded them to hire a candidate, suggesting that a user image can be used in a positive way.\nWhile there is little doubt that employers will continue to use social networking sites as a means of monitoring staff and screening potential candidates, it has been noted that such actions may be illegal under in jurisdictions.  According to Workforce.com, employers who use Facebook or Myspace could potentially face legal action:\nIf a potential employer uses a social networking site to check out a job candidate and then rejects that person based on what they see, he or she could be charged with discrimination.  On August 1, 2012, Illinois joined the state of Maryland (law passed in March 2012) in prohibiting employer access to social media web sites of their employees and prospective employees.  A number of other states that are also considering such prohibitory legislation (California, Delaware, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, South Carolina and Washington), as is the United States Congress.  In April 2012, the Social Networking Online Protection Act (2012 H.R. 5050) was introduced in the United States House of Representatives, and the Password Protection Act of 2012 (2012 S. 3074) was introduced in the United States Senate in May 2012, which prohibit employers from requiring access to their employees' social media web sites.With the recent concerns about new technologies, the United States is now developing laws and regulations to protect certain aspects of people's information on different medias.[CR4]  For example, 12 states in the US currently have laws specifically restricting employers from demanding access to their employees\u2019 social media sites when those sites are not fully public. (The states that have passed these laws are Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington.)Monitoring of social networking sites is not limited to potential workers.  Issues relating to privacy are becoming an increasing concern for those currently in employment.  A number of high-profile cases have appeared in which individuals have been sacked for posting comments on social networking which have been considered disparaging to their current employers or fellow workers.  In 2009, sixteen-year-old Kimberley Swann was sacked from her position at Ivell Marketing and Logistics Limited after describing her job as 'boring'.  In 2008, Virgin Atlantic sacked thirteen cabin crew staff, after it emerged they used had criticized the company's safety standards and called passengers 'chavs' on Facebook. There is no federal law that we are aware of that an employer is breaking by monitoring employees on social networking sites. In fact, employers can even hire third-party companies to monitor online employee activity for them. According to an article by Read Write Web employers use the service to \"make sure that employees don't leak sensitive information on social networks or engage in any behavior that could damage a company's reputation.\" While employers may have found such usages of social networking sites convenient, complaints have been put forward by civil liberties groups and trade unions on the invasive approach adopted by many employers.  In response to the Kimberley Swann case, Brendan Barber, of the TUC union stated that:\nMost employers wouldn't dream of following their staff down the pub to see if they were sounding off about work to their friends,\" he said.\n\"Just because snooping on personal conversations is possible these days, it doesn't make it healthy.\"\nMonitoring of staff's social networking activities is also becoming an increasingly common method of ensuring that employees are not browsing websites during work hours.  It was estimated in 2010 that an average of two million employees spent over an hour a day on social networking sites, costing potentially \u00a314 billion.\n\n\n*** Online victimization ***\nSocial networks are designed for individuals to socially interact with other people over the Internet. However, some individuals engage in undesirable online social behaviors, which negatively impacts other people's online experiences. It has created a wide range of online interpersonal victimization. Some studies have shown that social network victimization appears largely in adolescent and teens, and the type of victimization includes sexual advances and harassment. Recent research has reported approximately 9% of online victimization involves social network activities. It has been noted that many of these victims are girls who have been sexually victimized over these social network sites. Research concludes that many of social network victimizations are associated with user behaviors and interaction with one another. Negative social behaviors such as aggressive attitudes and discussing sexual related topics motivate the offenders to achieve their goals. All in all, positive online social behaviors is promoted to help reduce and avoid online victimization.\n\n\n*** Surveillance ***\nWhile the concept of a worldwide communicative network seems to adhere to the public sphere model, market forces control access to such a resource. In 2010, investigation by The Wall Street Journal found that many of the most popular applications on Facebook were transmitting identifying information about users and their friends to advertisers and internet tracking companies, which is a violation of Facebook's privacy policy. The Wall Street Journal analyzed the ten most popular Facebook apps, including Zynga's FarmVille with 57 million users, and Zynga's Mafia Wars with 21.9 million users, and found that they were transmitting Facebook user IDs to data aggregators. Every online move leaves cyber footprints that are rapidly becoming fodder for research without people ever realizing it. Using social media for academic research is accelerating and raising ethical concerns along the way, as vast amounts of information collected by private companies \u2014 including Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter \u2014 are giving new insight into all aspects of everyday life. Our social media \"audience\" is bigger than we actually know; our followers or friends aren't the only ones that can see information about us. Social media sites are collecting data from us just by searching something such as \"favorite restaurant\" on our search engine. Facebook is transformed from a public space to a behavioral laboratory,\" says the study, which cites a Harvard-based research project of 1,700 college-based Facebook users in which it became possible to \"deanonymize parts of the data set,\" or cross-reference anonymous data to make student identification possible. Some of Facebook's research on user behavior found that 71% of people drafted at least one post that they never posted. Another analyzed 400,000 posts and found that children's communication with parents decreases in frequency from age 13 but then rises when they move out.\n\n\n*** Law enforcement prowling the networks ***\n\nThe FBI has dedicated undercover agents on Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, LinkedIn. One example of investigators using Facebook to nab a criminal is the case of Maxi Sopo.  Charged with bank fraud, and having escaped to Mexico, he was nowhere to be found until he started posting on Facebook.  Although his profile was private, his list of friends was not, and through this vector, where he met a former official of the Justice Department, he was eventually caught.In recent years, some state and local law enforcement agencies have also begun to rely on social media websites as resources. Although obtaining records of information not shared publicly by or about site users often requires a subpoena, public pages on sites such as Facebook and MySpace offer access to personal information that can be valuable to law enforcement. Police departments have reported using social media websites to assist in investigations, locate and track suspects, and monitor gang activity.On October 18, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was scheduled to begin using personal information collected using social media platforms to screen immigrants arriving in the U.S.  The department made this new measure known in a posting to the Federal Register in September 2017, noting that \u201c...social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information and search results...\u201d would be included in an applicant's immigration file.  This announcement, which was made relatively quietly, has received criticism from privacy advocates.  The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement in late September 2017 asserting that the planned use of social media is nothing new, with one department spokesperson saying DHS has been using social media to collect information for years.  According to a statement made to National Public Radio, DHS uses \u201c...social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information, and search results\u201d to keep updated records on persons of interest.  According to the DHS, the posting to the Federal Register was an effort to be transparent regarding information about social media that is already being collected from immigrants.\nGovernment use of SMMS or \u201cSocial media monitoring software can be used to geographically track us as we communicate. It can chart out our relationships, networks, and associations. It can monitor protests, identify the leaders of political and social movements, and measure our influence.\u201d SMMS is also a growing industry. SMMS \u201cproducts like XI Social Discovery, Geofeedia, Dataminr, Dunami, and SocioSpyder (to name just a few) are being purchased in droves by Fortune 500 companies, politicians, law enforcement, federal agencies, defense contractors, and the military. Even the CIA has a venture fund, In-Q-Tel, that invests in SMMS technology.\u201d\n\n\n*** Mob rule ***\nThe idea of the 'mob rule' can be described as a situation in which control is held by those outside the conventional or lawful realm. In response to the News International phone hacking scandal involving News of the World in the United Kingdom, a report was written to enact new media privacy regulations.\nThe British author of the Leveson Report on the ethics of the British press, Lord Justice Leveson, has drawn attention to the need to take action on protecting privacy on the internet. This movement is described by Lord Justice Leveson as a global megaphone for gossip: \"There is not only a danger of trial by Twitter, but also of an unending punishment, and no prospect of rehabilitation, by Google\".\n\n\n*** Location updates ***\nFoursquare, Facebook, Loopt are application which allow users to check- in and these capabilities allows a user to share their current location information to their connection. Some of them even update their travel plans on social networking applications. However, the disclosure of location information within these networks can cause privacy concerns among mobile users. Foursquare defines another framework of action for the user. It appears to be in the interest of Foursquare that users provide many personal data that are set as public. This is illustrated, among others, by the fact that, although all the respondents want high control over the (location) privacy settings, almost none of them ever checked the Foursquare privacy settings before.  Although there are algorithms using encryption, k-anonymity and noise injection algorithms, its better to understand how the location sharing works in these applications to see if they have good algorithms in place to protect location privacy.\n\n\n*** Invasive privacy agreements ***\nAnother privacy issue with social networks is the privacy agreement. The privacy agreement states that the social network owns all of the content that users upload. This includes pictures, videos, and messages are all stored in the social networks database even if the user decides to terminate his or her account.Privacy agreements oftentimes say that they can track a user's location and activity based on the device used for the site. For example, the privacy agreement for Facebook states that \"all devices that a person uses to access Facebook are recorded such as IP addresses, phone numbers, operating system and even GPS locations\". One main concern about privacy agreements are the length, because they take a lot of time to fully read and understand. Most privacy agreements state the most important information at the end because it is assumed that people will not read it completely.\nThe ethical dilemma lies in that upon the agreement to register for SNSs, the personal information disclosed is legally accessible and managed by the sites privately established online security operators and operating systems; leaving access of user data to be \"under the discretion\" of the site(s) operators. Giving rise to the moral obligation and responsibility of the sites operators to maintain private information to be within user control. However, due to the legality of outsourcing of user data upon registration- without prior discretion, data outsourcing has been frequented by SNSs operating systems- regardless of user privacy settings.Data outsourcing has been proven to be consistently exploited since the emergence of SNSs. Employers have often been found to hire individuals or companies to search deep into the SNSs user database to find \"less than pleasant\" information regarding applicants during the review process.\n\n== Reading a privacy statement in terms and conditions ==\nOne of the main concerns that people have with their security is the lack of visibility that policies and settings have in the social networks. It is often located in areas hard to see like the top left or right of the screen. Another concern is the lack of information that users get from the companies when there is a change in their policies. They always inform users about new updates, but it is difficult to get information about these changes.Most social networking sites require users to agree to Terms of Use policies before they use their services.  Controversially, these Terms of Use declarations that users must agree to often contain clauses permitting social networking operators to store data on users, or even share it with third parties.  Facebook has attracted attention over its policies regarding data storage, such as making it difficult to delete an account, holding onto data after an account is de-activated and being caught sharing personal data with third parties.\nThis section explains how to read the privacy statement in terms and conditions while signing up for any social networking site.What to look for in the privacy policy:\n\nWho owns the data that a user posts?\nWhat happens to the data when the user account is closed?\nHow does changes in the privacy policy be made aware to its users?\nThe location of the privacy policy that is effective\nWill the profile page be completely erased when a user deletes the account?\nWhere and how can a user complain in case of any breach in privacy?\nFor how long is the personal information stored?The answers to these questions will give an indication of how safe the social networking site is.\n\n== Key points to protect social networking privacy ==\n\n\n*** Realize the threats that will always exist ***\nThere are people out there who want\u2014and will do just about anything\u2014to get someone's private information. It's essential to realize that it's difficult to keep your privacy secured all the time. Among other factors, it has been observed that data loss is correlated positively with risky online behavior and forgoing the necessary antivirus and anti spyware programs to defend against breaches of private information via the internet.\n\n\n*** Be thorough all the time ***\nLogging off after every session can help protect account security. It is dangerous to keep your device logged on since others may have access to your social profiles while you are not paying attention.Full names and addresses are typically considered personal information. Children's safety may be compromised if their parents post their whereabouts in a site where others know who their real identities are.\n\n\n*** Know the sites ***\nRead the social networking site's fine prints. Many sites push its users to agree to terms that are best for the sites\u2014not the users. Users should be aware about the terms in case of emergencies. Exactly how to read the terms are explained above at \"Reading a Privacy Statement in Terms and Conditions\" part\nMake sure the social networking site is safe before sharing information. Users shouldn't be sharing information if they don't know who are using the websites since their personally identifiable information could be exposed to other users of the site.\nBe familiar with the privacy protection provided.  Users should take the extra time to get to know the privacy protection systems of various social networks they are or will be using. Only friends should be allowed to access their information. Check the privacy or security settings on every social networking site that they might have to use.\n\n\n*** Protect devices ***\nEncrypt devices. Users should use complex passwords on their computers and cell phones and change them from time to time. This will protect users' information in case these devices are stolen.\nInstall Anti-virus software. Others would be able to use viruses and other ways to invade a user's computer if he or she installed something unsafe.\nUse devices that can disable camera, microphone, which mostly used for privacy invasion.\n\n\n*** Be careful about taking drastic actions ***\nThe users' privacy may be threatened by any actions. Following actions needs special attention. \n(1) Adding a new friend. Facebook reports 8.7% of its total profiles are fake. A user should be sure about who the person is before adding it as a new friend.\n(2) Clicking on links. Many links which looks attractive like gift cards are specially designed by malicious users. Clicking on these links may result in losing personal information or money.\n(3) Think twice about posting revealing photos. A revealing photo could attract the attention of potential criminals.\n\n== Social networks ==\n\n\n*** Facebook ***\n\nFacebook has been scrutinized for a variety of privacy concerns due to changes in its privacy settings on the site generally over time as well as privacy concerns within Facebook applications. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, first launched Facebook in 2004, it was focused on universities and only those with .edu address could open an account. Furthermore, only those within one's university network could see their page. Some argue that initial users were much more willing to share private information for these reasons. As time went on, Facebook became more public allowing those outside universities, and furthermore, those without a specific network, to join and see pages of those in networks that were not their own. In 2006 Facebook introduced the News Feed, a feature that would highlight recent friend activity. By 2009, Facebook made \"more and more information public by default\". For example, in December 2009, \"Facebook drastically changed its privacy policies, allowing users to see each others' lists of friends, even if users had previously indicated they wanted to keep these lists private\". Also, \"the new settings made photos publicly available by default, often without users' knowledge\".Facebook recently updated its profile format allowing for people who are not \"friends\" of others to view personal information about other users, even when the profile is set to private. However, As of January 18, 2011 Facebook changed its decision to make home addresses and telephone numbers accessible to third party members, but it is still possible for third party members to have access to less exact personal information, like one's hometown and employment, if the user has entered the information into Facebook. EPIC Executive Director Marc Rotenberg said \"Facebook is trying to blur the line between public and private information. And the request for permission does not make clear to the user why the information is needed or how it will be used.\"Breakup Notifier is an example of a Facebook \"cyberstalking\" app, which was taken down on 23 February 2011. The app was later unblocked. The application notifies the user when the person they selected changes their relationship status. The concept became very popular, with the site attracting 700,000 visits in the first 36 hours and the app being downloaded 40,000 times. Before the app was blocked, it had more than 3.6 million downloads and 9,000 Facebook likes.In 2008, four years after the first introduction of Facebook, Facebook created an option to permanently delete information. Until then, the only option was to deactivate one's Facebook account, which still left the user's information within Facebook servers. After thousands of users complaints, Facebook obliged and created a tool which was located in the Help Section but later removed. To locate the tool to permanently delete a user's Facebook, he or she must manually search through Facebook's Help section by entering the request to delete the Facebook in the search box. Only then will a link be provided to prompt the user to delete his or her profile.These new privacy settings enraged some users, one of whom claimed, \"Facebook is trying to dupe hundreds of millions of users they've spent years attracting into exposing their data for Facebook's personal gain.\" However, other features like the News Feed faced an initial backlash but later became a fundamental and very much appreciated part of the Facebook experience. In response to user complaints, Facebook continued to add more and more privacy settings resulting in \"50 settings and more than 170 privacy options.\" However, many users complained that the new privacy settings were too confusing and were aimed at increasing the amount of public information on Facebook. Facebook management responded that \"there are always trade offs between providing comprehensive and precise granular controls and offering simple tools that may be broad and blunt.\" It appears as though users sometimes do not pay enough attention to privacy settings and arguably allow their information to be public even though it is possible to make it private. Studies have shown that users actually pay little attention to \"permissions they give to third party apps.\"Most users are not aware that they can modify the privacy settings and unless they modify them, their information is open to the public. On Facebook privacy settings can be accessed via the drop down menu under account in the top right corner. There users can change who can view their profile and what information can be displayed on their profile. In most cases profiles are open to either \"all my network and friends\" or \"all of my friends.\" Also, information that shows on a user's profile such as birthday, religious views, and relationship status can be removed via the privacy settings. If a user is under 13 years old they are not able to make a Facebook or a MySpace account, however, this is not regulated.Although Zuckerberg, the Facebook CEO, and others in the management team usually respond in some manner to user concerns, they have been unapologetic about the trend towards less privacy. They have stated that they must continually \"be innovating and updating what our system is to reflect what the current social norms are.\" Their statements suggest that the Internet is becoming a more open, public space, and changes in Facebook privacy settings reflect this. However, Zuckerberg did admit that in the initial release of the News Feed, they \"did a bad job of explaining what the new features were and an even worse job of giving you control of them.\"Facebook's privacy settings have greatly evolved and are continuing to change over time. Zuckerberg \"believes the age of privacy is 'over,' and that norms have evolved considerably since he first co-founded the social networking site\".  Additionally, Facebook has been under fire for keeping track of one's Internet usage whether users are logged into the social media site or not.  A user may notice personalized ads under the 'Sponsored' area of the page.  \"The company uses cookies to log data such as the date, time, URL, and your IP address whenever you visit a site that has a Facebook plug-in, such as a 'Like' button.\"  Facebook claims this data is used to help improve one's experience on the website and to protect against 'malicious' activity.  Another issue of privacy that Facebook uses is the new facial recognition software. This feature includes the software to identify photos that users are tagged in by developing a template based on one's facial features.What is the face recognition setting on Facebook and how does it work? | Facebook Help Center\nSimilar to Rotenberg's claim that Facebook users are unclear of how or why their information has gone public, recently the Federal Trade Commission and Commerce Department have become involved. The Federal Trade Commission has recently released a report claiming that Internet companies and other industries will soon need to increase their protection for online users. Because online users often unknowingly opt in on making their information public, the FTC is urging Internet companies to make privacy notes simpler and easier for the public to understand, therefore increasing their option to opt out. Perhaps this new policy should also be implemented in the Facebook world. The Commerce Department claims that Americans, \"have been ill-served by a patchwork of privacy laws that contain broad gaps,\". Because of these broad gaps, Americans are more susceptible to identity theft and having their online activity tracked by others.\n\n\n**** Internet privacy and Facebook advertisements ****\nThe illegal activities on Facebook are very widespread, in particular, phishing attacks, allowing attackers to steal other people's passwords. The Facebook users are led to land on a page where they are asked for their login information, and their personal information is stolen in that way.\nAccording to the news from PC World Business Center which was published on April 22, 2010, we can know that a hacker named Kirllos illegally stole and sold 1.5 million Facebook IDs to some business companies who want to attract potential customers by using advertisements on Facebook. Their illegal approach is that they used accounts which were bought from hackers to send advertisements to friends of users. When friends see the advertisements, they will have opinion about them, because \"People will follow it because they believe it was a friend that told them to go to this link,\" said Randy Abrams, director of technical education with security vendor Eset. There were 2.2232% of the population on Facebook that believed or followed the advertisements of their friends. Even though the percentage is small, the amount of overall users on Facebook is more than 400 million worldwide. The influence of advertisements on Facebook is so huge and obvious. According to the blog of Alan who just posted advertisements on the Facebook, he earned $300 over the 4 days. That means he can earn $3 for every $1 put into it. The huge profit attracts hackers to steal users' login information on Facebook, and business people who want to buy accounts from hackers send advertisements to users' friends on Facebook.\nA leaked document from Facebook has revealed that the company was able to identify \"insecure, worthless, stressed or defeated\" emotions, especially in teenagers, and then proceeded to inform advertisers. While similar issues have arisen in the past, this continues to make individuals\u2019 emotional states seem more like a commodity. They are able to target certain age groups depending on the time that their advertisements appear.Recently, there have been allegations made against Facebook accusing the app of listening in on its users through their smartphone's microphone in order to gather information for advertisers. These rumors have been proven to be false as well as impossible. For one, because it does not have a specific buzzword to listen for like the Amazon Echo, Facebook would have to record everything its users say. This kind of \u201cconstant audio surveillance would produce about 33 times more data daily than Facebook currently consumes\u201d. Additionally, it would become immediately apparent to the user as their phone's battery life would be swiftly drained by the amount of power it would take to record every conversation. Finally, it is clear that Facebook doesn't need to listen in on its users\u2019 conversations because it already has plenty of access to their data and internet search history through cookies. Facebook specifically states in their Cookies Policy that they use cookies to help display ads that will peak the users interest.  They then use this information to help make recommendations for numerous businesses, organizations, associations, etc. to individuals who may be interested in the products, services or causes they offer.Security Breach\nIn September 2018, there was an incident of a security breach within Facebook. Hackers were able to access and steal personal information in nearly half of the 30 million accounts. The company initially believed that even more, around 50 million users,  were affected in an attack that gave the hackers control of accounts.\n\n\n**** Facebook friends study ****\nA study was conducted at Northeastern University by Alan Mislove and his colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems, where an algorithm was created to try and discover personal attributes of a Facebook user by looking at their friend's list. They looked for information such as high school and college attended, major, hometown, graduation year and even what dorm a student may have lived in. The study revealed that only 5% of people thought to change their friend's list to private. For other users, 58% displayed university attended, 42% revealed employers, 35% revealed interests and 19% gave viewers public access to where they were located. Due to the correlation of Facebook friends and universities they attend, it was easy to discover where a Facebook user was based on their list of friends. This fact is one that has become very useful to advertisers targeting their audiences but is also a big risk for the privacy of all those with Facebook accounts.\n\n\n**** Facebook Emotion Study ****\n\nRecently, Facebook knowingly agreed and facilitated a controversial experiment; the experiment blatantly bypassed user privacy and demonstrates the dangers and complex ethical nature of the current networking management system. The \"one week study in January of 2012\" where over 600,000 users were randomly selected to unknowingly partake in a study to determine the effect of \"emotional alteration\" by Facebook posts. Apart from the ethical issue of conducting such a study with human emotion in the first place, this is just one of the means in which data outsourcing has been used as a breach of privacy without user disclosure.Several issues about Facebook are due to privacy concerns. An article titled \"Facebook and Online Privacy: Attitudes, Behaviors, and Unintended Consequences\" examines the awareness that Facebook users have on privacy issues. This study shows that the gratifications of using Facebook tend to outweigh the perceived threats to privacy. The most common strategy for privacy protection\u2014decreasing profile visibility through restricting access to friends\u2014is also a very weak mechanism; a quick fix rather than a systematic approach to protecting privacy. This study suggests that more education about privacy on Facebook would be beneficial to the majority of the Facebook user population.\nThe study also offers the perspective that most users do not realize that restricting access to their data does not sufficiently address the risks resulting from the amount, quality, and persistence of data they provide. Facebook users in our study report familiarity and use of privacy settings, they are still accepting people as \"friends\" that they have only heard of through others or do not know at all and, therefore, most have very large groups of \"friends\" that have access to widely uploaded information such as full names, birthdates, hometowns, and many pictures.  This study suggests that social network privacy does not merely exist within the realm of privacy settings, but privacy control is much within the hands of the user. Commentators have noted that online social networking poses a fundamental challenge to the theory of privacy as control. The stakes have been raised because digital technologies lack \"the relative transience of human memory,\" and can be trolled or data mined for information. For users who are unaware of all privacy concerns and issues, further education on the safety of disclosing certain types of information on Facebook is highly recommended.\n\n\n*** Instagram ***\nInstagram tracks users' photos even if they do not post them using a geotag. This is through the information within metadata, which is in all photos. Metadata contains information like the lens type, location, time, and more of the photo. Users can be tracked through metadata without the use of geotags. The app geotags an uploaded image regardless of whether the user chose to share its location or not. Therefore, anybody can view the exact location where an image was uploaded on a map. This is concerning due to the fact that most people upload photos from their home or other locations they frequent a lot, and the fact that locations are so easily shared raises privacy concerns of stalking and sexual predators being able to find their target in person after discovering them online. The new Search function on Instagram combines the search of places, people, and tags to look at nearly any location on earth, allowing them to scout out a vacation spot, look inside a restaurant, and even to experience an event like they were there in person. The privacy implications of this fact is that people and companies can now see into every corner of the world, culture, and people's private lives. Additionally, this is concerning for individual privacy, because when someone searches through these features on Instagram for a specific location or place, Instagram shows them the personal photos that their users have posted, along with the likes and comments on that photo regardless of whether the poster's account is private or not. With these features, completely random people, businesses, and governments can see aspects of Instagram users' private lives. The Search and Explore pages that collect data based on user tagging illustrates how Instagram was able to create value out of the databases of information they collect on users throughout their business operations.\n\n\n*** Swarm ***\nSwarm is a mobile app that lets users check-in to a location and potentially make plans and set up future meetings with people nearby. This app has made it easier for people in online communities to share their locations, as well as interact with others in this community through collecting rewards such as coins and stickers through competitions with other users. If a user is on Swarm, their exact location may be broadcast even if they didn't select their location to be \"checked-in.\" When users turn on their \"Neighborhood Sharing\" feature, their location is shared as the specific intersection that they are at, and this location in current time can be viewed simply by tapping their profile image. This is concerning because Swarm users may believe they are being discreet by sharing only which neighborhood they are in, while in fact they are sharing the exact pinpoint of their location. The privacy implications of this is that people are inadvertently sharing their exact location when they do not know that they are. This plays into the privacy concerns of social media in general, because it makes it easier for other users as well as the companies this location data is shared with to track Swarm members. This tracking makes it easier for people to find their next targets for identity theft, stalking, and sexual harassment.\n\n\n*** Spokeo ***\nSpokeo is a \"people-related\" search engine with results compiled through data aggregation. The site contains information such as age, relationship status, estimated personal wealth, immediate family members and home address of individual people. This information is compiled through what is already on the internet or in other public records, but the website does not guarantee accuracy.\nSpokeo has been faced with potential class action lawsuits from people who claim that the organization breaches the Fair Credit Reporting Act. In September, 2010, Jennifer Purcell claimed that the FCRA was violated by Spokeo marketing her personal information. Her case is pending in court. Also in 2010, Thomas Robins claimed that his personal information on the website was inaccurate and he was unable to edit it for accuracy. The case was dismissed because Robins did not claim that the site directly caused him actual harm. On February 15, 2011, Robins filed another suit, this time stating Spokeo has caused him \"imminent and ongoing\" harm.\n\n\n*** Twitter ***\nIn January 2011, the US government obtained a court order to force the social networking site, Twitter, to reveal information applicable surrounding certain subscribers involved in the WikiLeaks cases.  This outcome of this case is questionable because it deals with the user's First Amendment rights.  Twitter moved to reverse the court order, and supported the idea that internet users should be notified and given an opportunity to defend their constitutional rights in court before their rights are compromised.Twitter's privacy policy states that information is collected through their different web sites, application, SMS, services, APIs, and other third parties. When the user uses Twitter's service they consent to the collection, transfer, storage, manipulation, disclosure, and other uses of this information. In order to create a Twitter account, one must give a name, username, password, and email address. Any other information added to one's profile is completely voluntary.\nTwitter's servers automatically record data such as IP address, browser type, the referring domain, pages visited, mobile carrier, device and application IDS, and search terms. Any common account identifiers such as full IP address or username will be removed or deleted after 18 months.Twitter allows people to share information with their followers. Any messages that are not switched from the default privacy setting are public, and thus can be viewed by anyone with a Twitter account. The most recent 20 tweets are posted on a public timeline.\nDespite Twitter's best efforts to protect their users privacy, personal information can still be dangerous to share. There have been incidents of leaked tweets on Twitter. Leaked tweets are tweets that have been published from a private account but have been made public. This occurs when friends of someone with a private account retweet, or copy and paste, that person's tweet and so on and so forth until the tweet is made public. This can make private information public, and could possibly be dangerous.Another issue involving privacy on Twitter deals with users unknowingly disclosing their information through tweets. Twitter has location services attached to tweets, which some users don't even know are enabled. Many users tweet about being at home and attach their location to their tweet, revealing their personal home address. This information is represented as a latitude and longitude, which is completely open for any website or application to access. People also tweet about going on vacation and giving the times and places of where they are going and how long they will be gone for. This has led to numerous break ins and robberies. Twitter users can avoid location services by disabling them in their privacy settings.\n\n\n*** Teachers and MySpace ***\nTeachers' privacy on MySpace has created controversy across the world. They are forewarned by The Ohio News Association that if they have a MySpace account, it should be deleted.  Eschool News warns, \"Teachers, watch what you post online.\" The ONA also posted a memo advising teachers not to join these sites. Teachers can face consequences of license revocations, suspensions, and written reprimands.\nThe Chronicle of Higher Education wrote an article on April 27, 2007, entitled \"A MySpace Photo Costs a Student a Teaching Certificate\" about Stacy Snyder.  She was a student of Millersville University of Pennsylvania who was denied her teaching degree because of an allegedly unprofessional photo posted on MySpace, which involved her drinking with a pirate's hat on and a caption of \"Drunken Pirate\".  As a substitute, she was given an English degree.\n\n\n*** Other sites ***\nSites such as Sgrouples and Diaspora have attempted to introduce various forms of privacy protection into their networks, while companies like Safe Shepherd have created software to remove personal information from the net.Certain social media sites such as Ask.fm, Whisper, and Yik Yak allow users to interact anonymously. The problem with websites such as these is that \u201cdespite safeguards that allow users to report abuse, people on the site believe they can say almost anything without fear or consequences\u2014and they do.\" This is a privacy concern because users can say whatever they choose and the receiver of the message may never know who they are communicating with. Sites such as these allow for a large chance or cyberbullying or cyberstalking to occur. People seem to believe that since they can be anonymous, they have the freedom to say anything no matter how mean or malicious.\n\n\n*** Internet privacy and Blizzard Entertainment ***\nOn July 6, 2010, Blizzard Entertainment announced that it would display the real names tied to user accounts in its game forums. On July 9, 2010, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Mike Morhaime announced a reversal of the decision to force posters' real names to appear on Blizzard's forums. The reversal was made in response to subscriber feedback.\n\n\n*** Snapchat ***\nSnapchat is a mobile application created by Stanford graduates Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy in September 2011. Snapchat's main feature is that the application allows users to send a photo or video, referred to as a \"snap\", to recipients of choice for up to ten seconds before it disappears. If recipients of a snap try and screenshot the photo or video sent, a notification is sent to the original sender that it was screenshot and by whom. Snapchat also has a \"stories\" feature where users can send photos to their \"story\" and friends can view the story as many times as they want until it disappears after twenty-four hours. Users have the ability to make their snapchat stories viewable to all of their friends on their friends list, only specific friends, or the story can be made public and viewed by anyone that has a snapchat account. In addition to the stories feature, messages can be sent through Snapchat. Messages disappear after they are opened unless manually saved by the user by holding down on the message until a \"saved\" notification pops up. There is no notification sent to the users that their message has been saved by the recipient, however, there is a notification sent if the message is screenshot.\n\n\n**** 2015 Snapchat privacy policy update ****\nIn 2015, Snapchat updated their privacy policy, causing outrage from users because of changes in their ability to save user content. These rules were put in place to help Snapchat create new and cool features like being able to replay a Snapchat, and the idea of \u201clive\u201d Snapchat stories. These features require saving content to snapchat servers in order to release to other users at a later time. The update stated that it has the rights to reproduce, modify, and republish photos, as well as save those photos to Snapchat servers. Users felt uncomfortable with the idea that all photo content was saved and the idea of \u201cdisappearing photos\u201d advertised by Snapchat didn't actually disappear. There is no way to control what content is saved and what isn't. Snapchat responded to backlash by saying they needed this license to access our information in order to create new features, like the live snapchat feature.\n\n\n**** Live Stories ****\nWith the 2015 new update of Snapchat, users are able to do \u201cLive Stories,\u201d which are a \u201ccollection of crowdsourced snaps for a specific event or region.\u201d By doing that, you are allowing snapchat to share your location with not just your friends, but with everyone. According to Snapchat, once you pick the option of sharing your content through a Live Story, you are providing to the company \"unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and license to use your name, likeness, and voice in any and all media and distribution channels.\"\n\n\n**** Privacy concerns with Snapchat ****\nOn Snapchat, there is a new feature that was incorporated into the app in 2017 called Snap Maps. Snap Maps allows users to track other users\u2019 locations, but when people \u201cfirst use the feature, users can select whether they want to make their location visible to all of their friends, a select group of connections or to no one at all, which Snapchat refers to as \u2018ghost mode.\u2019\u201dThis feature however has raised privacy concerns because \u201c\u2018It is very easy to accidentally share everything that you've got with more people than you need too, and that's the scariest portion\u2019. Cyber security expert Charles Tendell told ABC News of the Snapchat update.\u201d For protecting younger users of Snapchat, \u201cExperts recommend that parents stay aware of updates to apps like Snapchat. They also suggest parents make sure they know who their kids' friends are on Snapchat and also talk to their children about who they add on Snapchat.\u201dAn additional concern users have with the privacy of Snapchat is the deletion of Snapchat's after 30 days. Many users become confused as to why it looks like someone has gotten into their account and opened all of their snapchat's which then increases their Snapscore. This has caused great concern over hackers getting into personal Snapchat accounts. To reassure users, Snapchat has added to their Support webpage explaining the expiration of snapchats after 30 days yet it is still very unclear. To clarify, this is exactly what happens: after 30 days, any unopened Snapchats will automatically be deleted or expire (which appears to the user as the same thing as being opened automatically). Therefore, this will change the user's Snapscore. After snaps expire, it will look like all of the snapchats have been opened, shown by many unfilled or open boxes.\n\n\n***** Snapchat Spectacles*****\nIn 2016, Snapchat released a new product called \u201cSnapchat Spectacles,\u201d which are sunglasses featuring a small camera that allow users to take photos and record up to 10 seconds of footage. The cameras in the Spectacles are connected to users\u2019 existing Snapchat accounts, so they can easily upload their content to the application. This new product has received negative feedback because the Spectacles do not stand out from normal sunglasses beyond the small cameras on the lenses. Therefore, users have the ability to record strangers without them knowing. Furthermore, the simplistic design may result in people using the glasses accidentally, mistaking them for regular glasses. Critics of Snapchat Spectacles argue that this product is an invasion of privacy for the people who do not know they are being recorded by individuals who are wearing the glasses. Many people believe that these spectacles pose a risk in a way that their physical location might be disclosed to various parties, making the user vulnerable. Proponents disagree, saying that the glasses are distinguishable enough that users and people around them will notice them. Another argument in favor of the glasses is that people are already exposing themselves to similar scenarios by being in public.\n\n\n****** 2016 Amnesty International Report ******\nIn October 2016, Amnesty International released a report ranking Snapchat along with ten other leading social media applications, including Facebook, iMessage, FaceTime, and Skype on how well they protect users\u2019 privacy. The report assessed Snapchat's use of encryption and found that it ranks poorly in how it uses encryption to protect users\u2019 security as a result of not using end-to-end encryption. Because of this, third parties have the ability to access Snapchats while they are being transferred from one device to another. The report also claimed that Snapchat does not explicitly inform users in its privacy policy of the application's level of encryption or any threats the application may pose to users\u2019 rights, which further reduced its overall score. Regardless of this report, Snapchat is currently considered the most trustworthy social media platform among users.\n\n\n**** The FTC ****\nIn 2014, allegations were made against Snapchat by the Federal Trade Commission \"FTC\" for deceiving users on its privacy and security measures. Snapchat's main appeal is its marketed ability to have users' photos disappear completely after the one to ten second time frame\u2014selected by the sender to the recipient\u2014is up. However, the FTC made a case claiming this was false, making Snapchat in violation of regulations implemented to prevent deceptive consumer information. One focus of the case was that the reality of a \"snap\" lifespan is longer than most users perceive; the app's privacy policy stated that Snapchat itself temporarily stored all snaps sent, but neglected to offer users a time period during which snaps had yet to be permanently deleted and could still be retrieved. As a result, many third-party applications were easily created for consumers that hold the ability to save \"snaps\" sent by users and screenshot \"snaps\" without notifying the sender.\nThe FTC also claimed that Snapchat took information from its users such as location and contact information without their consent. Despite not being written in their privacy policy, Snapchat transmitted location information from mobile devices to its analytics tracking service provider. Although \"Snapchat's privacy policy claimed that the app collected only your email, phone number, and Facebook ID to find friends for you to connect with, if you're an IOS user and entered your phone number to find friends, Snapchat collected the names and phone numbers of all the contacts in your mobile device address books without your notice or consent.\" It was disclosed that the Gibsonsec security group warned Snapchat of potential issues with their security, however no actions were taken to reinforce the system.  In early 2014, 4.6 million matched usernames and phone numbers of users were publicly leaked, adding to the existing privacy controversy of the application. Finally, the FTC claimed that Snapchat failed to secure its \"find friends\" feature by not requiring phone number verification in the registration process. Users could register accounts from numbers other than their own, giving users the ability to impersonate anyone they chose.  Snapchat had to release a public statement of apology to alert users of the misconducts and change their purpose to be a \"fast and fun way to communicate with photos\".\n\n\n*** WhatsApp ***\nWhatsApp, created in 2009, is a platform that allows users to communicate via text and voice message, video chatting, and document sharing for free. WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook in 2014, but the brand continues to be promote as a secure and reliable form of communication. The app can be downloaded and used on Android, iPhone, Mac or Windows PC, and Windows Phone devices without SMS fees or charges from a carrier. While asterisks across the WhatsApp website denote some hazards of fees and additional charges, this has become a popular application for consumers that communication with people overseas.\n\n\n**** Privacy and security with WhatsApp ****\nIn 2019, WhatsApp incorporated new privacy and security measures for their users including- Hide Muted Status and Frequently Forwarded. The hide muted status feature allows users to hide specific updates or interactions with specific users; however, if the user would decide to \"unhide\" their status or updates from certain users, a list of all updates will be shown to the previously blocked user (including the previously hidden status/updates). Similar to apps such as Snapchat and Instagram, users are notified when a story is forwarded, viewed, screenshotted, or shared. WhatsApp developers have added the Frequently Forwarded feature that notifies users if a message, status, or update has been forwarded 4 or more times.\n\n== Response to criticism ==\nMany social networking organizations have responded to the criticism and concerns over privacy brought up over time.  It is claimed that changes to default settings, the storage of data and sharing with third parties have all been updated and corrected in the light of criticism, and/or legal challenges.  However, many critics remain unsatisfied, noting that fundamental changes to privacy settings in many social networking sites remain minor and at times, inaccessible, and argue that social networking companies prefer to criticize users rather than adapt their policies.There are suggestions for individuals to obtain privacy by reducing or ending their own use of social media. This method does not succeed, since their information is still revealed by posts from their friends.There is ambiguity about how private IP addresses are. The Court of Justice of the European Union has ruled they need to be treated as personally identifiable information if the business receiving them, or a third party like a service provider, knows the name or street address of the IP address holder, which would be true for static IP addresses, not for dynamic addresses.\nCalifornia regulations say IP addresses need to be treated as personal information if the business itself, not a third party, can link them to name and street address.\nIn 2020, An Alberta court ruled that police can obtain the IP addresses and the names and addresses associated with them, without a search warrant. An investigation found the IP addresses which initiated online crimes, and the service provider gave police the names and addresses associated with those IP addresses."

    "instruction": "2017 Macron e-mail leaks\n\n==Introduction==\nThe 2017 Macron e-mail leaks were leaks of more than 20,000 e-mails related to the campaign of Emmanuel Macron during the 2017 French presidential elections, two days before the final vote. The leaks garnered an abundance of media attention due to how quickly news of the leak spread throughout the Internet, aided in large part by bots and spammers and drew accusations that the government of Russia under Vladimir Putin was responsible. The e-mails were shared by WikiLeaks and several American alt-right activists through social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, and 4chan.Originally posted on a filesharing site called PasteBin, the e-mails had little to no effect on the final vote as they were dumped just hours before a 44-hour media blackout that is legally required by French electoral law.The campaign said the e-mails had been \"fraudulently obtained\" and that false documents were mingled with genuine ones in order \"to create confusion and misinformation.\" Numerama, an online publication focusing on digital life, described the leaked material as \"utterly mundane\", consisting of \"the contents of a hard drive and several emails of co-workers and En Marche political officials.\" United States Senator from Virginia, Mark Warner cited the e-mail leak as a reinforcement of the cause behind the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Nonetheless, the Russian government denied all allegations of foreign electoral intervention.\n\n== Background ==\n\nAfter the first round of the 2017 French presidential election produced no majority winner, the top two candidates proceeded to a runoff election to be held on 7 May of that year. Emmanuel Macron of the En Marche! party and Marine Le Pen of the National Front both began campaigning across France on their competing points of view. The election was characterized by widespread dissatisfaction with the administration of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and the French governmental establishment as a whole.The election was widely regarded as a referendum between the internationalist centrism of Macron and the populist far-right ideology of Le Pen. After a slew of events considered to be detrimental to globalization and a triumph of nationalism and isolationism, such as the Brexit referendum, and the election of Donald Trump, many international observers viewed the French election as another possible trendsetting event for Western politics. Le Pen's anti-immigration, anti-NATO, and anti-European Union stances attracted her the widespread support of far-right politicians and activists as far as the United States, like Donald Trump, and raised questions about possible appeasement of Russia. Russia-funded media outlets such as Russia Today and Sputnik News consistently portrayed Le Pen in a positive light, and her campaign had even secured millions of Euros from a Russian lender in 2014.In the United States, Le Pen was praised by President Donald Trump on several occasions, and she saw widespread support and praise by large numbers of online conservative trolls and Internet alt-right activists on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and 4chan, who simultaneously attacked Macron.\nThese trolls used spamming of Internet memes and misinformation as tactics to assail Macron; accusing him of being a \"globalist puppet\" and a supporter of Islamic immigration. This was not a new strategy, it had been executed to much success during the 2016 United States presidential election. Legions of pro-Trump Internet users and bots had spammed social media and rapidly spread anti-Clinton news releases and leaks across the web as was the case with the Democratic National Committee leaks and the John Podesta e-mail leaks, allegedly with aid from the Kremlin. Prior to the election, American national security officials warned the French government of the high probability of Russian digital meddling in the election, according to the Director of the National Security Agency, Mike Rogers.\n\n== E-mail leaks ==\nOn Friday 5 May 2017, two days before the scheduled vote in the presidential election, the campaign of Emmanuel Macron claimed that it had been the target of a \"massive hack\". At the same time at least 9 gigabytes of data were dumped on an anonymous file sharing site called Pastebin using a profile called 'EMLEAKS'. The drop was made just hours before an election media blackout was due to take place in advance of Sunday's elections, as legally mandated under French electoral law which prevented Macron from issuing an effective response but also limited media coverage of the hack and subsequent leak. The e-mails, totaling 21,075, along with other data was quickly posted to the anonymous message board, 4chan, where it was shared by alt-right activists, notably Jack Posobiec, on Twitter  who had them translated by the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois wing of right-wing outlet The Rebel Media. It has been remarked that at that time, Rebel Media's Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois wing consisted solely of radio personality \u00c9ric Duhaime.The e-mail leak spread swiftly under the hashtag #MacronLeaks on Twitter and Facebook. Within three and a half hours of first being used, #MacronLeaks had reached 47,000 tweets. On Jack Posobiec's Twitter, the hashtag was retweeted 87 times within five minutes, likely pointing to the use of bots. WikiLeaks mentioned the leaks in subsequent tweets 15 times, contributing the most to the news' spread. Within a short period of time, #MacronLeaks was trending in France and was on a banner on the Drudge Report homepage. In another sign of bot use the ten most active accounts using the #MacronLeaks hashtag posted over 1,300 tweets in just over three hours. One particular account, posted 294 tweets in a span of two hours. Analysis shows that the hashtag was mentioned more times by American accounts than French ones, but posts concerning them were, by a slim margin, written more often in French than English.The leaked e-mails were claimed to show evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Macron and his campaign including the committing of tax evasion and election fraud. A less suggestive examination of the e-mails by Numerama, a French online publication focusing on technological news, described the leaked emails as \"utterly mundane\", consisting of \"the contents of a hard drive and several emails of co-workers and En Marche political officials.\" Leaked documents included \"memos, bills, loans for amounts that are hardly over-the-top, recommendations and other reservations, amidst, of course, exchanges that are strictly personal and private \u2014 personal notes on the rain and sunshine, a confirmation email for the publishing of a book, reservation of a table for friends, etc.\"\n\n\n*** Reaction ***\nIn response to the attack, Emmanuel Macron said it was \"democratic destabilisation, like that seen during the last presidential campaign in the United States\" and said the hackers had mixed falsified documents with genuine ones, \"in order to sow doubt and disinformation.\" Vice President of the National Front Florian Philippot and Le Pen adviser said in a tweet, \"Will #MacronLeaks teach us something that investigative journalism has deliberately killed?\" The French election commission warned media in the country that publishing the e-mails or discussing them so close to the election would be a violation of the law and issued a statement that in part read, \"On the eve of the most important election for our institutions, the commission calls on everyone present on internet sites and social networks, primarily the media, but also all citizens, to show responsibility and not to pass on this content, so as not to distort the sincerity of the ballot.\" The leak did not appear to have any impact on the French presidential election which continued as scheduled and ended with a Macron victory by a margin of 32%. Despite this, French security officials commenced an investigation into the hacking shortly after the election.Shortly after the alt-right media boosted the leak, chief of Macron's campaign Mounir Mahjoubi stated that they have been watching GRU hacking attempts since February, and let them steal a carefully prepared cache of trivial and forged documents. After this was confirmed against the leaks contents, its credibility was seriously undermined.In the United States, U.S. Senator from Virginia and ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner said the hacking and subsequent leak only emboldened his committee's investigation, and former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said in a tweet, \"Victory for Macron, for France, the EU, & the world. Defeat to those interfering w/democracy. (But the media says I can't talk about that).\"\n\n== Perpetrators ==\n\nAn assessment by Flashpoint, an American cybersecurity firm, stated that they determined with \"moderate confidence\" that the group behind the hacking and leak was APT28, better known as 'Fancy Bear', a hacking group with ties to Russian military intelligence. Metadata pulled from the dump revealed the name 'Georgy Petrovich Roshka', likely an alias, which has ties to a Moscow-based intelligence contractor. Many similarities, including the use of social media bots in an attempt to scrub metadata, also pointed to Fancy Bear. However, on 1 June 2017, Guillaume Poupard, the head of France's premier cybersecurity agency said in an interview with the Associated Press the hack, \"was so generic and simple that it could have been practically anyone\". On 9 May, two days after the election, Mike Rogers, head of the NSA, said in sworn testimony with the United States Senate he had been made aware of Russian attempts to hack French election infrastructure, though he did not mention anything related to the identities of those behind the Macron email hacking. This followed a French announcement that electronic voting for France's overseas citizens would be discontinued in light of cybersecurity threats.According to the Le Monde newspaper and with the work based on non-public rapport of Google and FireEye, the GRU is responsible.Vladimir Putin has denied claims of election interference, claiming Russia has also been targeted.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question.

    "instruction": "Context: DenyHosts\n\n==Introduction==\nDenyHosts is a log-based intrusion-prevention security tool for SSH servers written in Python. It is intended to prevent brute-force attacks on SSH servers by monitoring invalid login attempts in the authentication log and blocking the originating IP addresses. DenyHosts is developed by Phil Schwartz, who is also the developer of Kodos Python Regular Expression Debugger.\n\n\n\n== Operation ==\nDenyHosts checks the end of the authentication log for recent failed login attempts. It records information about their originating IP addresses and compares the number of invalid attempts to a user-specified threshold.

PAP is specified in RFC 1334.\nAlmost all network operating systems support PPP with PAP, as do most network access servers. PAP is also used in PPPoE, for authenticating DSL users.\nAs the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) sends data unencrypted and \"in the clear\", PAP is vulnerable to any attacker who can observe the PPP session.  An attacker can see the users name, password, and any other information associated with the PPP session. Some additional security can be gained on the PPP link by using CHAP or EAP. However, there are always tradeoffs when choosing an authentication method, and there is no single answer for which is more secure.\nWhen PAP is used in PPP, it is considered a weak authentication scheme. Weak schemes are simpler and have lighter computational overhead than more complex schemes such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), but they are much more vulnerable to attack. While weak schemes are used where the transport layer is expected to be physically secure, such as a home DSL link. Where the transport layer is not physically secure a system such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is used instead.\n\n\n\n== Other uses of PAP ==\nPAP is also used to describe password authentication in other protocols such as RADIUS and Diameter.

    "instruction": "Bayesian poisoning\n\n==Introduction==\nBayesian poisoning is a technique used by e-mail spammers to attempt to degrade the effectiveness of spam filters that rely on Bayesian spam filtering. Bayesian filtering relies on Bayesian probability to determine whether an incoming mail is spam or is not spam. The spammer hopes that the addition of random (or even carefully selected) words that are unlikely to appear in a spam message will cause the spam filter to believe the message to be legitimate\u2014a statistical type II error.\nSpammers also hope to cause the spam filter to have a higher false positive rate by turning previously innocent words into spammy words in the Bayesian database (statistical type I errors) because a user who trains their spam filter on a poisoned message will be indicating to the filter that the words added by the spammer are a good indication of spam.\n\n== Empirical results ==\n\n\n*** Graham-Cumming ***\nAt the Spam Conference held at MIT in 2004 John Graham-Cumming presented two possible attacks on POPFile's Bayesian engine. One was unsuccessful and the other worked, but was impractical. In doing this they identified two types of poisoning attack: passive (where words are added without any feedback to the spammer) and active (where the spammer gets feedback after the spam has been received).\nThe passive method of adding random words to a small spam was ineffective as a method of attack: only 0.04% of the modified spam messages were delivered. The active attack involved adding random words to a small spam and using a web bug to determine whether the spam was received. If it was, another Bayesian system was trained using the same poison words. After sending 10,000 spams to a single user he determined a small set of words that could be used to get a spam through.\nThe simple countermeasure of disabling remote images (web bugs) in emails eliminates this problem.\n\n\n*** Wittel and Wu ***\nAt the Conference on Email and Anti-Spam in 2004, Wittel and Wu presented a paper in which they showed that the passive addition of random words to spam was ineffective against CRM114, but effective against SpamBayes with 100 words added per spam.\nThey also showed that a smarter passive attack, adding common English words, was still ineffective against CRM114, but was even more effective against SpamBayes. They needed to add only 50 words to a spam to get it past SpamBayes.\nHowever, Wittel and Wu's testing has been criticized due to the minimal header information that was present in the emails they were using; most Bayesian spam filters make extensive use of header information and other message metadata in determining the likelihood that a message is spam.

      "context": "Bayesian poisoning\n\n==Introduction==\nBayesian poisoning is a technique used by e-mail spammers to attempt to degrade the effectiveness of spam filters that rely on Bayesian spam filtering. Bayesian filtering relies on Bayesian probability to determine whether an incoming mail is spam or is not spam. The spammer hopes that the addition of random (or even carefully selected) words that are unlikely to appear in a spam message will cause the spam filter to believe the message to be legitimate\u2014a statistical type II error.\nSpammers also hope to cause the spam filter to have a higher false positive rate by turning previously innocent words into spammy words in the Bayesian database (statistical type I errors) because a user who trains their spam filter on a poisoned message will be indicating to the filter that the words added by the spammer are a good indication of spam.\n\n== Empirical results ==\n\n\n*** Graham-Cumming ***\nAt the Spam Conference held at MIT in 2004 John Graham-Cumming presented two possible attacks on POPFile's Bayesian engine. One was unsuccessful and the other worked, but was impractical. In doing this they identified two types of poisoning attack: passive (where words are added without any feedback to the spammer) and active (where the spammer gets feedback after the spam has been received).\nThe passive method of adding random words to a small spam was ineffective as a method of attack: only 0.04% of the modified spam messages were delivered. The active attack involved adding random words to a small spam and using a web bug to determine whether the spam was received. If it was, another Bayesian system was trained using the same poison words. After sending 10,000 spams to a single user he determined a small set of words that could be used to get a spam through.\nThe simple countermeasure of disabling remote images (web bugs) in emails eliminates this problem.\n\n\n*** Wittel and Wu ***\nAt the Conference on Email and Anti-Spam in 2004, Wittel and Wu presented a paper in which they showed that the passive addition of random words to spam was ineffective against CRM114, but effective against SpamBayes with 100 words added per spam.\nThey also showed that a smarter passive attack, adding common English words, was still ineffective against CRM114, but was even more effective against SpamBayes. They needed to add only 50 words to a spam to get it past SpamBayes.\nHowever, Wittel and Wu's testing has been criticized due to the minimal header information that was present in the emails they were using; most Bayesian spam filters make extensive use of header information and other message metadata in determining the likelihood that a message is spam. A discussion of the SpamBayes results and some counter evidence can be found in the SpamBayes mailing list archive.All of these attacks are type II attacks: attacks that attempt to get spam delivered.

The attack's name was coined in early 2010 by Aza Raskin, a security researcher and design expert. The attack takes advantage of user trust and inattention to detail in regard to tabs, and the ability of browsers to navigate across a page's origin in inactive tabs a long time after the page is loaded. Tabnabbing is different from most phishing attacks in that the user no longer remembers that a certain tab was the result of a link unrelated to the login page, because the fake login page is loaded in one of the long-lived open tabs in their browser.The attack causes the browser to navigate to the impersonated page after the page has been left unattended for some time. A user who returns after a while and sees the login page may be induced to believe the page is legitimate and enter their login, password and other details that will be used for improper purposes. The attack can be made more likely to succeed if the attacker is able to check for well known websites the user has loaded in the past or in other tabs, and loads a simulation of the same sites. This attack can be done even if JavaScript is disabled, using the \"meta refresh\" meta element, an HTML attribute used for page redirection that causes a reload of a specified new page after a given time interval.The NoScript extension for Mozilla Firefox defends both from the JavaScript-based and from the scriptless attack, based on meta refresh, by preventing inactive tabs from changing the location of the page.

    "instruction": "Captive portal\n\n==Introduction==\nA captive portal is a web page accessed with a web browser that is displayed to newly connected users of a Wi-Fi or wired network before they are granted broader access to network resources. Captive portals are commonly used to present a landing or log-in page which may require authentication, payment, acceptance of an end-user license agreement, acceptable use policy, survey completion, or other valid credentials that both the host and user agree to adhere by. Captive portals are used for a broad range of mobile and pedestrian broadband services \u2013 including cable and commercially provided Wi-Fi and home hotspots. A captive portal can also be used to provide access to enterprise or residential wired networks, such as apartment houses, hotel rooms, and business centers.\nThe captive portal is presented to the client and is stored either at the gateway or on a web server hosting the web page. Depending on the feature set of the gateway, websites or TCP ports can be white-listed so that the user would not have to interact with the captive portal in order to use them. The MAC address of attached clients can also be used to bypass the login process for specified devices.\nWISPr refers to this web browser-based authentication method as the Universal Access Method (UAM).\n\n\n\n== Uses ==\nCaptive portals are primarily used in open wireless networks where the users are shown a welcome message informing them of the conditions of access (allowed ports, liability, etc.). Administrators tend to do this so that their own users take responsibility for their actions and to avoid any legal responsibility. Whether this delegation of responsibility is legally valid is a matter of debate.Often captive portals are used for marketing and commercial communication purposes. Access to the Internet over open Wi-Fi is prohibited until the user exchanges personal data by filling out a web-based registration form in a web browser. The web-based form either automatically opens in a web browser, or appears when the user opens a web browser and tries to visit any web page. In other words, the user is \"captive\" - unable to access the Internet freely until the user is granted access to the Internet and has \"completed\" the captive portal. This allows the provider of this service to display or send advertisements to users who connect to the Wi-Fi access point. This type of service is also sometimes known as \"social Wi-Fi\", as they may ask for a social network account to login (such as Facebook). Over the past few years, such social Wi-Fi captive portals have become commonplace with various companies offering marketing centered around Wi-Fi data collection. \nThe user can find many types of content in the captive portal, and it's frequent to allow access to the Internet in exchange for viewing content or performing a certain action (often, providing personal data to enable commercial contact); thus, the marketing use of the captive portal is a tool for lead generation (business contacts or potential clients).\n\n== Implementation ==\nThere are various ways to implement a captive portal.\n\n\n*** HTTP redirect ***\nA common method is to direct all World Wide Web traffic to a web server, which returns an HTTP redirect to a captive portal. When a modern, Internet-enabled device first connects to a network, it sends out an HTTP request to a detection URL predefined by its vendor and expects an HTTP status code 200 OK or 204 No Content. If the device receives a HTTP 200 status code, it assumes it has unlimited internet access. Captive portal prompts are displayed when you are able to manipulate this first HTTP message to return a HTTP status code of 302 (redirect) to the captive portal of your choice. RFC 6585 specifies 511 Network Authentication Required code.\n\n\n*** ICMP redirect ***\nClient traffic can also be redirected using ICMP redirect on the layer 3 level.\n\n\n*** Redirect by DNS ***\nWhen a client requests a resource on a remote host by name, DNS is queried to resolve that hostname. In a captive portal, the firewall will make sure that only the DNS server(s) provided by the network's DHCP can be used by unauthenticated clients (or, alternatively, it will forward all DNS requests by unauthenticated clients to that DNS server). This DNS server will return the IP address of the captive portal page as a result of all DNS lookups.\nIn order to perform redirection by DNS the captive portal uses DNS hijacking to perform an action similar to a man-in-the-middle attack. To limit the impact of DNS poisoning, a TTL of 0 is typically used.\n\n== Detection ==\nCaptive portal detection URLs typically return a minimal, standardized response when not behind a captive portal. When the device receives the expected response, it concludes that it has direct internet access. If the response is different, the device assumes it is behind a captive portal and triggers the captive portal login process.\n\n== Limitations ==\n\n\n*** Security ***\nCaptive portals have been known to have incomplete firewall rule sets.\n\n\n**** DNS tunneling ****\nIn some deployments, the rule set will route DNS requests from clients to the Internet, or the provided DNS server will fulfill arbitrary DNS requests from the client. This allows a client to bypass the captive portal and access the open Internet by tunneling arbitrary traffic within DNS packets.\n\n\n**** Automatic submission ****\nSome captive portals may be configured to allow appropriately equipped user agents to detect the captive portal and automatically authenticate. User agents and supplemental applications such as Apple's Captive Portal Assistant can sometimes transparently bypass the display of captive portal content against the wishes of the service operator as long as they have access to correct credentials, or they may attempt to authenticate with incorrect or obsolete credentials, resulting in unintentional consequences such as accidental account locking.\n\n\n**** MAC spoofing ****\nA captive portal that uses MAC addresses to track connected devices can sometimes be circumvented by re-using the MAC address of a previously authenticated device. Once a device has been authenticated to the captive portal using valid credentials, the gateway adds that device's MAC address to its allowlist; since MAC addresses can easily be spoofed, any other device can pretend to be the authenticated device and bypass the captive portal. Once the IP and MAC addresses of other connecting computers are found to be authenticated, any machine can spoof the MAC address and Internet Protocol (IP) address of the authenticated target, and be allowed a route through the gateway. For this reason some captive portal solutions created extended authentication mechanisms to limit the risk for usurpation.\n\n\n*** Require Web Browser ***\nCaptive portals often require the use of a web browser; users who first use an email client or other application that relies on the Internet may find the connection not working without explanation, and will then need to open a web browser to validate. This may be problematic for users who do not have any web browser installed on their operating system. It is however sometimes possible to use email and other facilities that do not rely on DNS (e.g. if the application specifies the connection IP address rather than the hostname). A similar problem can occur if the client uses AJAX or joins the network with pages already loaded into its web browser, causing undefined behavior (for example, corrupt messages appear) when such a page tries HTTP requests to its origin server. \nSimilarly, as HTTPS connections cannot be redirected (at least not without triggering security warnings), a web browser that only attempts to access secure websites before being authorized by the captive portal will see those attempts fail without explanation (the usual symptom is that the intended website appears to be down or inaccessible).\nPlatforms that have Wi-Fi and a TCP/IP stack but do not have a web browser that supports HTTPS cannot use many captive portals. Such platforms include the Nintendo DS running a game that uses Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Non-browser authentication is possible using WISPr, an XML-based authentication protocol for this purpose, or MAC-based authentication or authentications based on other protocols.\nIt is also possible for a platform vendor to enter into a service contract with the operator of a large number of captive portal hotspots to allow free or discounted access to the platform vendor's servers via the hotspot's walled garden. For example, in 2005 Nintendo and Wayport partnered to provide free Wi-Fi access to Nintendo DS users at certain McDonald's restaurants.

    "instruction": "Context: Round (cryptography)\n\n==Introduction==\nIn cryptography, a round or round function is a basic transformation that is repeated (iterated) multiple times inside the algorithm. Splitting a large algorithmic function into rounds simplifies both implementation and cryptanalysis.For example, encryption using an oversimplified three-round cipher can be written as \n  \n    \n      \n        C\n        =\n        \n          R\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          R\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          R\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        (\n        P\n        )\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C=R_{3}(R_{2}(R_{1}(P)))}\n  , where C is the ciphertext and P is the plaintext.

Parameterization is essential to reduce the self-similarity of the cipher, which could lead to slide attacks.Increasing the number of rounds \"almost always\" protects against differential and linear cryptanalysis, as for these tools the effort grows exponentially with the number of rounds. Simply increasing the number of rounds does not necessarily make weak ciphers into strong ones, as some attacks do not depend on the number of rounds.The idea of an iterative cipher using repeated application of simple non-commutating operations producing diffusion and confusion goes as far back as 1945, to the then-secret version of C. E. Shannon's work \"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems\"; Shannon was inspired by mixing transformations used in the field of dynamical systems theory (cf. horseshoe map). Most of the modern ciphers use iterative design with number of rounds usually chosen between 8 and 32 (with 64 and even 80 used in cryptographic hashes).For some Feistel-like cipher descriptions, notably the one of the RC5, a term \"half-round\" is used to define the transformation of part of the data (a distinguishing feature of the Feistel design). This operation corresponds to a full round in traditional descriptions of Feistel ciphers (like DES).\n\n== Round constants ==\nInserting round-dependent constants into the encryption process breaks the symmetry between rounds and thus thwarts the most obvious slide attacks. The technique is a standard feature of most modern block ciphers. However, a poor choice of round constants or unintended interrelations between the constants and other cipher components could still allow slide attacks (e.g., attacking the initial version of the format-preserving encryption mode FF3).Many lightweight ciphers utilize very simple key scheduling: the round keys come from adding the round constants to the encryption key. A poor choice of round constants in this case might make the cipher vulnerable to invariant attacks; ciphers broken this way include SCREAM and Midori64.\n\n== Optimization ==\nDaemen and Rijmen assert that one of the goals of optimizing the cipher is reducing the overall workload, the product of the round complexity and the number of rounds. There are two approaches to address this goal:\nlocal optimization improves the worst-case behavior of a single round (two rounds for Feistel ciphers);\nglobal optimization optimizes the worst-case behavior of more than one round, allowing the use of less sophisticated components.\n\n== Reduced-round ciphers ==\nCryptanalysis techniques include the use of versions of ciphers with fewer rounds than specified by their designers. Since a single round is usually cryptographically weak, many attacks that fail to work against the full version of ciphers will work on such reduced-round variants.

    "instruction": "2011 PlayStation Network outage\n\n==Introduction==\nThe 2011 PlayStation Network outage (sometimes referred to as the PSN Hack) was the result of an \"external intrusion\" on Sony's PlayStation Network and Qriocity services, in which personal details from approximately 77 million accounts were compromised and prevented users of PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable consoles from accessing the service. The attack occurred between April 17 and April 19, 2011, forcing Sony to deactivate the PlayStation Network servers on April 20. On May 4, Sony confirmed that personally identifiable information from each of the 77 million accounts had been exposed. The outage lasted 23 days.At the time of the outage, with a count of 77 million registered PlayStation Network accounts, it was not only one of the largest data security breaches, but also the longest PS Network outage in history. It surpassed the 2007 TJX hack which affected 45 million customers. Government officials in various countries voiced concern over the theft and Sony's one-week delay before warning its users.\nSony stated on April 26 that it was attempting to get online services running \"within a week.\" On May 14, Sony released PlayStation 3 firmware version 3.61 as a security patch. The firmware required users to change their account's password upon signing in. At the time the firmware was released, the network was still offline. Regional restoration was announced by Kazuo Hirai in a video from Sony. A map of regional restoration and the network within the United States was shared as the service was coming back online.\n\n== Prelude ==\nIn March 2010, Sony had released a firmware update for the PlayStation 3, which had patched functionality to use 3rd Party Operating Systems, such as Linux, on the System. This had caused outrage in the System's modding community, as the 3rd Party Operating Systems were used frequently in modification.\nOn January 2, 2011, George Hotz had successfully jailbroke the PlayStation 3 firmware. A day later, he had started distributing the jailbreak through his website.\nOn January 11, 2011, Sony had filed a lawsuit against Hotz, for distributing software to jailbreak their systems on his website.On April 2, 2011, a group of hackers claiming to be Anonymous, had declared \"Operation Sony\". Later the same week, On April 11, Sony had dropped the lawsuit with Hotz.On April 13, the group had released a video in text to speech, calling for \"A day of Sony Protest\".\n\n== Timeline of the outage ==\nOn April 20, 2011, Sony acknowledged on the official PlayStation Blog that it was \"aware certain functions of the PlayStation Network\" were down. Upon attempting to sign in via the PlayStation 3, users received a message indicating that the network was \"undergoing maintenance\". The following day, Sony asked its customers for patience while the cause of outage was investigated and stated that it may take \"a full day or two\" to get the service fully functional again.The company later announced an \"external intrusion\" had affected the PlayStation Network and Qriocity services. This intrusion occurred between April 17 and April 19. On April 20, Sony suspended all PlayStation Network and Qriocity services worldwide. Sony expressed their regrets for the downtime and called the task of repairing the system \"time-consuming\" but would lead to a stronger network infrastructure and additional security. On April 25, Sony spokesman Patrick Seybold reiterated on the PlayStation Blog that fixing and enhancing the network was a \"time intensive\" process with no estimated time of completion. However, the next day Sony stated that there was a \"clear path to have PlayStation Network and Qriocity systems back online\", with some services expected to be restored within a week. Furthermore, Sony acknowledged the \"compromise of personal information as a result of an illegal intrusion on our systems.\"On May 1 Sony announced a \"Welcome Back\" program for customers affected by the outage. The company also confirmed that some PSN and Qriocity services would be available during the first week of May. The list of services expected to become available included:\n\nRestoration of Online game-play across the PlayStation 3 (PS3) and PSP (PlayStation Portable) systems\nThis includes titles requiring online verification and downloaded games\nAccess to Music Unlimited powered by Qriocity for PS3/PSP for existing subscribers\nAccess to account management and password reset\nAccess to download un-expired Movie Rentals on PS3, PSP and MediaGo\nPlayStation Home\nFriends List\nChat Functionality\nOn May 2 Sony issued a press release, according to which the Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) services had been taken offline for maintenance due to potentially related activities during the initial criminal hack. Over 12,000 credit card numbers, albeit in encrypted form, from non-U.S. cardholders and additional information from 24.7 million SOE accounts may have been accessed.During the week, Sony sent a letter to the US House of Representatives, answering questions and concerns about the event. In the letter Sony announced that they would be providing Identity Theft insurance policies in the amount of US$1 million per user of the PlayStation Network and Qriocity services, despite no reports of credit card fraud being indicated. This was later confirmed on the PlayStation Blog, where it was announced that the service, AllClear ID Plus powered by Debix, would be available to users in the United States free for 12 months, and would include Internet surveillance, complete identity repair in the event of theft and a $1 million identity theft insurance policy for each user.On May 6 Sony stated they had begun \"final stages of internal testing\" for the PlayStation Network, which had been rebuilt. However, the following day Sony reported that they would not be able to bring services back online within the one-week timeframe given on May 1, because \"the extent of the attack on Sony Online Entertainment servers\" had not been known at the time. SOE confirmed on their Twitter account that their games would not be available until some time after the weekend.Reuters began reporting the event as \"the biggest Internet security break-in ever\". A Sony spokesperson said:\nSony had removed the personal details of 2,500 people stolen by hackers and posted on a website\nThe data included names and some addresses, which were in a database created in 2001\nNo date had been fixed for the restartOn May 14 various services began coming back online on a country-by-country basis, starting with North America. These services included: sign-in for PSN and Qriocity services (including password resetting), online game-play on PS3 and PSP, playback of rental video content, Music Unlimited service (PS3 and PC), access to third party services (such as Netflix, Hulu, Vudu and MLB.tv), friends list, chat functionality and PlayStation Home. The actions came with a firmware update for the PS3, version 3.61. As of May 15 service in Japan and East Asia had not yet been approved.On May 18 SOE shut down the password reset page on their site following the discovery of another exploit that allowed users to reset other users' passwords, using the other user's email address and date of birth. Sign-in using PSN details to various other Sony websites was also disabled, but console sign-ins were not affected.On May 23 Sony stated that the outage costs were $171 million.\n\n== Sony response ==\n\n\n*** US House of Representatives ***\nSony reported on May 4 to the PlayStation Blog that:\n\nKazuo Hirai, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Sony Computer Entertainment America, submitted written answers to questions posed by the United States House subcommittee about the large-scale, criminal cyber-attack we have experienced.\nSony relayed via the letter that:\n\nIn summary, we told the subcommittee that in dealing with this cyber attack we followed four key principles:\nAct with care and caution.\nProvide relevant information to the public when it has been verified.\nTake responsibility for our obligations to our customers.\nWork with law enforcement authorities.\nWe also informed the subcommittee of the following:\n\nSony has been the victim of a very carefully planned, very professional, highly sophisticated criminal cyber attack.\nWe discovered that the intruders had planted a file on one of our Sony Online Entertainment servers named \u201cAnonymous\u201d with the words \u201cWe are Legion.\u201d\nBy April 25, forensic teams were able to confirm the scope of the personal data they believed had been taken, and could not rule out whether credit card information had been accessed. On April 26, we notified customers of those facts.\nAs of today, the major credit card companies have not reported any fraudulent transactions that they believe are the direct result of this cyber attack.\nProtecting individuals\u2019 personal data is the highest priority and ensuring that the Internet can be made secure for commerce is also essential. Worldwide, countries and businesses will have to come together to ensure the safety of commerce over the Internet and find ways to combat cybercrime and cyber terrorism.\nWe are taking a number of steps to prevent future breaches, including enhanced levels of data protection and encryption; enhanced ability to detect software intrusions, unauthorized access and unusual activity patterns; additional firewalls; establishment of a new data center in an undisclosed location with increased security; and the naming of a new Chief Information Security Officer.\n\n\n*** Explanation of delays ***\nOn April 26, 2011 Sony explained on the PlayStation Blog why it took so long to inform PSN users of the data theft:\nThere\u2019s a difference in timing between when we identified there was an intrusion and when we learned of consumers\u2019 data being compromised. We learned there was an intrusion April 19th and subsequently shut the services down. We then brought in outside experts to help us learn how the intrusion occurred and to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident. It was necessary to conduct several days of forensic analysis, and it took our experts until yesterday to understand the scope of the breach. We then shared that information with our consumers and announced it publicly this afternoon.\n\n\n*** Sony investigation ***\nPossible data theft led Sony to provide an update in regards to a criminal investigation in a blog posted on April 27: \"We are currently working with law enforcement on this matter as well as a recognized technology security firm to conduct a complete investigation. This malicious attack against our system and against our customers is a criminal act and we are proceeding aggressively to find those responsible.\"On May 3 Sony Computer Entertainment CEO Kazuo Hirai reiterated this and said the \"external intrusion\" which had caused them to shut down the PlayStation Network constituted a \"criminal cyber attack\". Hirai expanded further, claiming that Sony systems had been under attack prior to the outage \"for the past month and half\", suggesting a concerted attempt to target Sony.On May 4 Sony announced that it was adding Data Forte to the investigation team of Guidance Software and Protiviti in analysing the attacks. Legal aspects of the case were handled by Baker & McKenzie. Sony stated their belief that Anonymous, a decentralized unorganized loosely affiliated group of hackers and activists may have performed the attack. No Anons claimed any involvement.Upon learning that a breach had occurred, Sony launched an internal investigation. Sony reported, in its letter to the United States Congress:\n\nOne of our first calls was to the FBI, and this is an active, on-going investigation.\nHave you identified how the breach occurred?\n\nYes, we believe so. Sony Network Entertainment America is continuing its investigation into this criminal intrusion, and more detailed information could be discovered during this process. We are reluctant to make full details publicly available because the information is the subject of an on-going criminal investigation and also the information could be used to exploit vulnerabilities in systems other than Sony's that have similar architecture to the PlayStation Network.\n\n\n*** Inability to use PlayStation 3 content ***\nWhile most games remained playable in their offline modes, the PlayStation 3 was unable to play certain Capcom titles in any form. Streaming video providers throughout different regions such as Hulu, Vudu, Netflix and LoveFilm displayed the same maintenance message. Some users claimed to be able to use Netflix's streaming service  but others were unable.\n\n== Criticism of Sony ==\n\n\n*** Delayed warning of possible data theft ***\n\nOn April 26, nearly a week after the outage, Sony confirmed that it \"cannot rule out the possibility\" that personally identifiable information such as PlayStation Network account username, password, home address, and email address had been compromised. Sony also mentioned the possibility that credit card data was taken\u2014after claiming that encryption had been placed on the databases, which would partially satisfy PCI Compliance for storing credit card information on a server.\nSubsequent to the announcement on both the official blog and by e-mail, users were asked to safeguard credit card transactions by checking bank statements. This warning came nearly a week after the initial \"external intrusion\" and while the Network was turned off.Some disputed this explanation and queried that if Sony deemed the situation so severe that they had to turn off the network, Sony should have warned users of possible data theft sooner than on April 26. Concerns have been raised over violations of PCI Compliance and the failure to immediately notify users. US Senator Richard Blumenthal wrote to Sony Computer Entertainment America CEO Jack Tretton questioning the delay.Sony replied in a letter to the subcommittee:\n\nYour statement indicated you have no evidence at this time that credit card information was obtained, yet you cannot rule out this possibility. Please explain why you do not believe credit card information was obtained and why you cannot determine if the data was in fact taken.\nAs stated above, Sony Network Entertainment America has not been able to conclude with certainty through the forensic analysis done to date that credit card information was not transferred from the PlayStation Network system. We know that for other personal information contained in the account database, the hacker made queries to the database, and the external forensics teams have seen large amounts of data transferred in response to those queries. Our forensics teams have not seen the queries and corresponding data transfers of the credit card information.\n\n\n*** Unencrypted personal details ***\nCredit card data was encrypted, but Sony admitted that other user information was not encrypted at the time of the intrusion. The Daily Telegraph reported that \"If the provider stores passwords unencrypted, then it's very easy for somebody else \u2013 not just an external attacker, but members of staff or contractors working on Sony's site \u2013 to get access and discover those passwords, potentially using them for nefarious means.\"\nOn May 2, Sony clarified the \"unencrypted\" status of users' passwords, stating that:\nWhile the passwords that were stored were not \u201cencrypted,\u201d they were transformed using a cryptographic hash function. There is a difference between these two types of security measures which is why we said the passwords had not been encrypted. But I want to be very clear that the passwords were not stored in our database in cleartext form.\n\n\n*** British Information Commissioner's Office ***\nFollowing a formal investigation of Sony for breaches of the UK's Data Protection Act 1998, the Information Commissioner's Office issued a statement highly critical of the security Sony had in place:\n\nIf you are responsible for so many payment card details and log-in details then keeping that personal data secure has to be your priority. In this case that just didn't happen, and when the database was targeted \u2013 albeit in a determined criminal attack \u2013 the security measures in place were simply not good enough.\nThere's no disguising that this is a business that should have known better. It is a company that trades on its technical expertise, and there's no doubt in my mind that they had access to both the technical knowledge and the resources to keep this information safe.\nSony was fined \u00a3250,000 ($395k) for security measures so poor they did not comply with the British law.\n\n== Sony Online Entertainment outage ==\nOn May 3 Sony stated in a press release that there may be a correlation between the attack that had occurred on April 16 towards the PlayStation Network and one that compromised Sony Online Entertainment on May 2. This portion of the attack resulted in the theft of information on 24.6 million Sony Online Entertainment account holders. The database contained 12,700 credit card numbers, particularly those of non-U.S. residents, and had not been in use since 2007 as much of the data applied to expired cards and deleted accounts. Sony updated this information the following day by stating that only 900 cards on the database were still valid. The attack resulted in the suspension of SOE servers and Facebook games. SOE granted 30 days of free time, plus one day for each day the server was down, to users of Clone Wars Adventures, DC Universe Online, EverQuest, EverQuest II, EverQuest Online Adventures, Free Realms, Pirates of the Burning Sea, PlanetSide, Poxnora, Star Wars Galaxies and Vanguard: Saga of Heroes, as well as other forms of compensation for all other Sony Online games.\nSecurity experts Eugene Lapidous of AnchorFree, Chester Wisniewski of Sophos Canada and Avner Levin of Ryerson University (now Toronto Metropolitan University) criticized Sony, questioning its methods of securing user data. Lapidous called the breach \"difficult to excuse\" and Wisniewski called it \"an act of hubris or simply gross incompetence\".\n\n== Reaction ==\n\n\n*** Compensation to users ***\nSony hosted special events after the PlayStation Network returned to service. Sony stated that they had plans for PS3 versions of DC Universe Online and Free Realms to help alleviate some of their losses. In a press conference in Tokyo on May 1, Sony announced a \"Welcome Back\" program. As well as \"selected PlayStation entertainment content\" the program promised to include 30 days free membership of PlayStation Plus for all PSN members, while existing PlayStation Plus members received an additional 30 days on their subscription. Qriocity subscribers received 30 days. Sony promised other content and services over the coming weeks. Sony offered one year free identity theft protection to all users with details forthcoming.\nHulu compensated PlayStation 3 users for the inability to use their service during the outage by offering one week of free service to Hulu Plus members.On May 16, 2011, Sony announced that two PlayStation 3 games and two PSP games would be offered for free from lists of five and four,\u2020 respectively. The games available varied by region and were only available in countries which had access to the PlayStation Store prior to the outage. On May 27, 2011, Sony announced the \"welcome back\" package for Japan and the Asia region (Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia). In the Asia region, a theme - Dokodemo Issyo Spring Theme - was offered for free in addition to the games available in the \"welcome back\" package.^\u2020  5 PSP games are offered in the Japanese market.\n\n^\u2021  Version of Killzone Liberation offered does not offer online gameplay functionality.\n\n\n*** Government reaction ***\nThe data theft concerned authorities around the world. Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos, said the breach \"certainly ranks as one of the biggest data losses ever to affect individuals\".The British Information Commissioner's Office stated that Sony would be questioned, and that an investigation would take place to discover whether Sony had taken adequate precautions to protect customer details. Under the UK's Data Protection Act, Sony was fined \u00a3250,000 for the breach.Privacy Commissioner of Canada Jennifer Stoddart confirmed that the Canadian authorities would investigate. The Commissioner's office conveyed their concern as to why the authorities in Canada weren't informed of a security breach earlier.US Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut demanded answers from Sony about the data breach by emailing SCEA CEO Jack Tretton arguing about the delay in informing its customers and insisting that Sony do more for its customers than just offer free credit reporting services. Blumenthal later called for an investigation by the US Department of Justice to find the person or persons responsible and to determine if Sony was liable for the way that it handled the situation.Congresswoman Mary Bono Mack and Congressman G. K. Butterfield sent a letter to Sony, demanding information on when the breach was discovered and how the crisis would be handled.Sony had been asked to testify before a congressional hearing on security and to answer questions about the breach of security on May 2, but sent a written response instead.\n\n\n*** Legal action against Sony ***\nA lawsuit was posted on April 27 by Kristopher Johns from Birmingham, Alabama on behalf of all PlayStation users alleging Sony \"failed to encrypt data and establish adequate firewalls to handle a server intrusion contingency, failed to provide prompt and adequate warnings of security breaches, and unreasonably delayed in bringing the PSN service back online.\" According to the complaint filed in the lawsuit, Sony failed to notify members of a possible security breach and storing members' credit card information, a violation of PCI Compliance\u2014the digital security standard for the Payment Card Industry.\nA Canadian lawsuit against Sony USA, Sony Canada and Sony Japan claimed damages up to C$1 billion including free credit monitoring and identity theft insurance. The plaintiff was quoted as saying, \"If you can't trust a huge multi-national corporation like Sony to protect your private information, who can you trust? It appears to me that Sony focuses more on protecting its games than its PlayStation users\".In October 2012 a California judge dismissed a lawsuit against Sony over the PSN security breach, ruling that Sony had not violated California's consumer-protection laws, citing \"there is no such thing as perfect security\".In 2013 United Kingdom Information Commissioner's Office charged Sony with a \u00a3250,000 penalty for putting a large amount of personal and financial data of PSN clients  at risk.\n\n\n*** Credit card fraud ***\nAs of May 2011, there were no verifiable reports of credit card fraud related to the outage. There were reports on the Internet that some PlayStation users experienced credit card fraud; however, they were yet to be linked to the incident. Users who registered a credit card for use only with Sony also reported credit card fraud. Sony said that the CSC codes requested by their services were not stored, but hackers may have been able to decrypt or record credit card details while inside Sony's network.Sony stated in their letter to the subcommittee:\n\nHow many PlayStation Network account holders provided credit card information to Sony Computer Entertainment?\nGlobally, approximately 12.3 million account holders had credit card information on file on the PlayStation Network system. In the United States, approximately 5.6 million account holders had credit card information on file on the system. These numbers include active and expired credit cards.\n\nAs of today, the major credit card companies have not reported that they have seen any increase in the number of fraudulent credit card transactions as a result of the attack, and they have not reported to us any fraudulent transactions that they believe are a direct result of the intrusions described above.\nOn May 5, a letter from Sony Corporation of America CEO and President Sir Howard Stringer emphasized that there had been no evidence of credit card fraud and that a $1 million identity theft insurance policy would be available to PSN and Qriocity users:\nTo date, there is no confirmed evidence any credit card or personal information has been misused, and we continue to monitor the situation closely. We are also moving ahead with plans to help protect our customers from identity theft around the world. A program for U.S. PlayStation Network and Qriocity customers that includes a $1 million identity theft insurance policy per user was launched earlier today and announcements for other regions will be coming soon.\n\n== Change to terms and conditions ==\nIt has been suggested that a change to the PSN terms and conditions announced on September 15, 2011, was motivated by the large damages being claimed by class action suits against Sony, in an effort to minimise the company's losses. The new agreement required users to agree to give up their right (to join together as a group in a class action) to sue Sony over any future security breach, without first trying to resolve legal issues with an arbitrator. This included any ongoing class action suits initiated prior to August 20, 2011.\nAnother clause, which removed a user's right to trial by jury should the user opt out of the clause (by sending a letter to Sony), says:\n\nIf the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Section 15 will be unenforceable, and the dispute will be decided by a court and you and the Sony Entity you have a dispute with each agree to waive in that instance, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.\nSony guaranteed that a court of law in the respective country, in this case the US, would hold jurisdiction in regards to any rules or changes in the Sony PSN ToS:\nThese Terms of Service and all questions relating to the performance, interpretation, breach or enforcement of these Terms of Service, or the rights, obligations and liabilities of you and us under them are governed by the laws of the State of California.  You agree that all disputes, claims or litigation arising from or related in any way to these Terms of Service and our relationship with you will be litigated only in a court of competent jurisdiction located in San Mateo County, State of California.  You agree to be subject to personal jurisdiction and venue in that location.\nRead the text above and answer this question: What was the impact of the 2011 PlayStation Network outage on the availability of certain Capcom titles and streaming video providers on the PlayStation 3?",

      "context": "2011 PlayStation Network outage\n\n==Introduction==\nThe 2011 PlayStation Network outage (sometimes referred to as the PSN Hack) was the result of an \"external intrusion\" on Sony's PlayStation Network and Qriocity services, in which personal details from approximately 77 million accounts were compromised and prevented users of PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable consoles from accessing the service. The attack occurred between April 17 and April 19, 2011, forcing Sony to deactivate the PlayStation Network servers on April 20. On May 4, Sony confirmed that personally identifiable information from each of the 77 million accounts had been exposed. The outage lasted 23 days.At the time of the outage, with a count of 77 million registered PlayStation Network accounts, it was not only one of the largest data security breaches, but also the longest PS Network outage in history. It surpassed the 2007 TJX hack which affected 45 million customers. Government officials in various countries voiced concern over the theft and Sony's one-week delay before warning its users.\nSony stated on April 26 that it was attempting to get online services running \"within a week.\" On May 14, Sony released PlayStation 3 firmware version 3.61 as a security patch. The firmware required users to change their account's password upon signing in. At the time the firmware was released, the network was still offline. Regional restoration was announced by Kazuo Hirai in a video from Sony. A map of regional restoration and the network within the United States was shared as the service was coming back online.\n\n== Prelude ==\nIn March 2010, Sony had released a firmware update for the PlayStation 3, which had patched functionality to use 3rd Party Operating Systems, such as Linux, on the System. This had caused outrage in the System's modding community, as the 3rd Party Operating Systems were used frequently in modification.\nOn January 2, 2011, George Hotz had successfully jailbroke the PlayStation 3 firmware. A day later, he had started distributing the jailbreak through his website.\nOn January 11, 2011, Sony had filed a lawsuit against Hotz, for distributing software to jailbreak their systems on his website.On April 2, 2011, a group of hackers claiming to be Anonymous, had declared \"Operation Sony\". Later the same week, On April 11, Sony had dropped the lawsuit with Hotz.On April 13, the group had released a video in text to speech, calling for \"A day of Sony Protest\".\n\n== Timeline of the outage ==\nOn April 20, 2011, Sony acknowledged on the official PlayStation Blog that it was \"aware certain functions of the PlayStation Network\" were down. Upon attempting to sign in via the PlayStation 3, users received a message indicating that the network was \"undergoing maintenance\".

Some users claimed to be able to use Netflix's streaming service  but others were unable.\n\n== Criticism of Sony ==\n\n\n*** Delayed warning of possible data theft ***\n\nOn April 26, nearly a week after the outage, Sony confirmed that it \"cannot rule out the possibility\" that personally identifiable information such as PlayStation Network account username, password, home address, and email address had been compromised. Sony also mentioned the possibility that credit card data was taken\u2014after claiming that encryption had been placed on the databases, which would partially satisfy PCI Compliance for storing credit card information on a server.\nSubsequent to the announcement on both the official blog and by e-mail, users were asked to safeguard credit card transactions by checking bank statements. This warning came nearly a week after the initial \"external intrusion\" and while the Network was turned off.Some disputed this explanation and queried that if Sony deemed the situation so severe that they had to turn off the network, Sony should have warned users of possible data theft sooner than on April 26. Concerns have been raised over violations of PCI Compliance and the failure to immediately notify users. US Senator Richard Blumenthal wrote to Sony Computer Entertainment America CEO Jack Tretton questioning the delay.Sony replied in a letter to the subcommittee:\n\nYour statement indicated you have no evidence at this time that credit card information was obtained, yet you cannot rule out this possibility. Please explain why you do not believe credit card information was obtained and why you cannot determine if the data was in fact taken.\nAs stated above, Sony Network Entertainment America has not been able to conclude with certainty through the forensic analysis done to date that credit card information was not transferred from the PlayStation Network system. We know that for other personal information contained in the account database, the hacker made queries to the database, and the external forensics teams have seen large amounts of data transferred in response to those queries. Our forensics teams have not seen the queries and corresponding data transfers of the credit card information.\n\n\n*** Unencrypted personal details ***\nCredit card data was encrypted, but Sony admitted that other user information was not encrypted at the time of the intrusion. The Daily Telegraph reported that \"If the provider stores passwords unencrypted, then it's very easy for somebody else \u2013 not just an external attacker, but members of staff or contractors working on Sony's site \u2013 to get access and discover those passwords, potentially using them for nefarious means.\"\nOn May 2, Sony clarified the \"unencrypted\" status of users' passwords, stating that:\nWhile the passwords that were stored were not \u201cencrypted,\u201d they were transformed using a cryptographic hash function. There is a difference between these two types of security measures which is why we said the passwords had not been encrypted. But I want to be very clear that the passwords were not stored in our database in cleartext form.\n\n\n*** British Information Commissioner's Office ***\nFollowing a formal investigation of Sony for breaches of the UK's Data Protection Act 1998, the Information Commissioner's Office issued a statement highly critical of the security Sony had in place:\n\nIf you are responsible for so many payment card details and log-in details then keeping that personal data secure has to be your priority. In this case that just didn't happen, and when the database was targeted \u2013 albeit in a determined criminal attack \u2013 the security measures in place were simply not good enough.\nThere's no disguising that this is a business that should have known better. It is a company that trades on its technical expertise, and there's no doubt in my mind that they had access to both the technical knowledge and the resources to keep this information safe.\nSony was fined \u00a3250,000 ($395k) for security measures so poor they did not comply with the British law.\n\n== Sony Online Entertainment outage ==\nOn May 3 Sony stated in a press release that there may be a correlation between the attack that had occurred on April 16 towards the PlayStation Network and one that compromised Sony Online Entertainment on May 2. This portion of the attack resulted in the theft of information on 24.6 million Sony Online Entertainment account holders. The database contained 12,700 credit card numbers, particularly those of non-U.S. residents, and had not been in use since 2007 as much of the data applied to expired cards and deleted accounts. Sony updated this information the following day by stating that only 900 cards on the database were still valid. The attack resulted in the suspension of SOE servers and Facebook games. SOE granted 30 days of free time, plus one day for each day the server was down, to users of Clone Wars Adventures, DC Universe Online, EverQuest, EverQuest II, EverQuest Online Adventures, Free Realms, Pirates of the Burning Sea, PlanetSide, Poxnora, Star Wars Galaxies and Vanguard: Saga of Heroes, as well as other forms of compensation for all other Sony Online games.\nSecurity experts Eugene Lapidous of AnchorFree, Chester Wisniewski of Sophos Canada and Avner Levin of Ryerson University (now Toronto Metropolitan University) criticized Sony, questioning its methods of securing user data. Lapidous called the breach \"difficult to excuse\" and Wisniewski called it \"an act of hubris or simply gross incompetence\".\n\n== Reaction ==\n\n\n*** Compensation to users ***\nSony hosted special events after the PlayStation Network returned to service. Sony stated that they had plans for PS3 versions of DC Universe Online and Free Realms to help alleviate some of their losses. In a press conference in Tokyo on May 1, Sony announced a \"Welcome Back\" program. As well as \"selected PlayStation entertainment content\" the program promised to include 30 days free membership of PlayStation Plus for all PSN members, while existing PlayStation Plus members received an additional 30 days on their subscription. Qriocity subscribers received 30 days. Sony promised other content and services over the coming weeks. Sony offered one year free identity theft protection to all users with details forthcoming.\nHulu compensated PlayStation 3 users for the inability to use their service during the outage by offering one week of free service to Hulu Plus members.On May 16, 2011, Sony announced that two PlayStation 3 games and two PSP games would be offered for free from lists of five and four,\u2020 respectively. The games available varied by region and were only available in countries which had access to the PlayStation Store prior to the outage. On May 27, 2011, Sony announced the \"welcome back\" package for Japan and the Asia region (Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia). In the Asia region, a theme - Dokodemo Issyo Spring Theme - was offered for free in addition to the games available in the \"welcome back\" package.^\u2020  5 PSP games are offered in the Japanese market.\n\n^\u2021  Version of Killzone Liberation offered does not offer online gameplay functionality.\n\n\n*** Government reaction ***\nThe data theft concerned authorities around the world. Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at Sophos, said the breach \"certainly ranks as one of the biggest data losses ever to affect individuals\".The British Information Commissioner's Office stated that Sony would be questioned, and that an investigation would take place to discover whether Sony had taken adequate precautions to protect customer details. Under the UK's Data Protection Act, Sony was fined \u00a3250,000 for the breach.Privacy Commissioner of Canada Jennifer Stoddart confirmed that the Canadian authorities would investigate. The Commissioner's office conveyed their concern as to why the authorities in Canada weren't informed of a security breach earlier.US Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut demanded answers from Sony about the data breach by emailing SCEA CEO Jack Tretton arguing about the delay in informing its customers and insisting that Sony do more for its customers than just offer free credit reporting services. Blumenthal later called for an investigation by the US Department of Justice to find the person or persons responsible and to determine if Sony was liable for the way that it handled the situation.Congresswoman Mary Bono Mack and Congressman G. K. Butterfield sent a letter to Sony, demanding information on when the breach was discovered and how the crisis would be handled.Sony had been asked to testify before a congressional hearing on security and to answer questions about the breach of security on May 2, but sent a written response instead.\n\n\n*** Legal action against Sony ***\nA lawsuit was posted on April 27 by Kristopher Johns from Birmingham, Alabama on behalf of all PlayStation users alleging Sony \"failed to encrypt data and establish adequate firewalls to handle a server intrusion contingency, failed to provide prompt and adequate warnings of security breaches, and unreasonably delayed in bringing the PSN service back online.\" According to the complaint filed in the lawsuit, Sony failed to notify members of a possible security breach and storing members' credit card information, a violation of PCI Compliance\u2014the digital security standard for the Payment Card Industry.\nA Canadian lawsuit against Sony USA, Sony Canada and Sony Japan claimed damages up to C$1 billion including free credit monitoring and identity theft insurance. The plaintiff was quoted as saying, \"If you can't trust a huge multi-national corporation like Sony to protect your private information, who can you trust? It appears to me that Sony focuses more on protecting its games than its PlayStation users\".In October 2012 a California judge dismissed a lawsuit against Sony over the PSN security breach, ruling that Sony had not violated California's consumer-protection laws, citing \"there is no such thing as perfect security\".In 2013 United Kingdom Information Commissioner's Office charged Sony with a \u00a3250,000 penalty for putting a large amount of personal and financial data of PSN clients  at risk.\n\n\n*** Credit card fraud ***\nAs of May 2011, there were no verifiable reports of credit card fraud related to the outage. There were reports on the Internet that some PlayStation users experienced credit card fraud; however, they were yet to be linked to the incident. Users who registered a credit card for use only with Sony also reported credit card fraud. Sony said that the CSC codes requested by their services were not stored, but hackers may have been able to decrypt or record credit card details while inside Sony's network.Sony stated in their letter to the subcommittee:\n\nHow many PlayStation Network account holders provided credit card information to Sony Computer Entertainment?\nGlobally, approximately 12.3 million account holders had credit card information on file on the PlayStation Network system. In the United States, approximately 5.6 million account holders had credit card information on file on the system. These numbers include active and expired credit cards.\n\nAs of today, the major credit card companies have not reported that they have seen any increase in the number of fraudulent credit card transactions as a result of the attack, and they have not reported to us any fraudulent transactions that they believe are a direct result of the intrusions described above.\nOn May 5, a letter from Sony Corporation of America CEO and President Sir Howard Stringer emphasized that there had been no evidence of credit card fraud and that a $1 million identity theft insurance policy would be available to PSN and Qriocity users:\nTo date, there is no confirmed evidence any credit card or personal information has been misused, and we continue to monitor the situation closely. We are also moving ahead with plans to help protect our customers from identity theft around the world. A program for U.S. PlayStation Network and Qriocity customers that includes a $1 million identity theft insurance policy per user was launched earlier today and announcements for other regions will be coming soon.\n\n== Change to terms and conditions ==\nIt has been suggested that a change to the PSN terms and conditions announced on September 15, 2011, was motivated by the large damages being claimed by class action suits against Sony, in an effort to minimise the company's losses. The new agreement required users to agree to give up their right (to join together as a group in a class action) to sue Sony over any future security breach, without first trying to resolve legal issues with an arbitrator. This included any ongoing class action suits initiated prior to August 20, 2011.\nAnother clause, which removed a user's right to trial by jury should the user opt out of the clause (by sending a letter to Sony), says:\n\nIf the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Section 15 will be unenforceable, and the dispute will be decided by a court and you and the Sony Entity you have a dispute with each agree to waive in that instance, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.\nSony guaranteed that a court of law in the respective country, in this case the US, would hold jurisdiction in regards to any rules or changes in the Sony PSN ToS:\nThese Terms of Service and all questions relating to the performance, interpretation, breach or enforcement of these Terms of Service, or the rights, obligations and liabilities of you and us under them are governed by the laws of the State of California.  You agree that all disputes, claims or litigation arising from or related in any way to these Terms of Service and our relationship with you will be litigated only in a court of competent jurisdiction located in San Mateo County, State of California.  You agree to be subject to personal jurisdiction and venue in that location."

    "instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nAttack patterns\n\n==Introduction==\nIn computer science, attack patterns are a group of rigorous methods for finding bugs or errors in code related to computer security.\nAttack patterns are often used for testing purposes and are very important for ensuring that potential vulnerabilities are prevented.  The attack patterns themselves can be used to highlight areas which need to be considered for security hardening in a software application. They also provide, either physically or in reference, the common solution pattern for preventing the attack.  Such a practice can be termed defensive coding patterns.\nAttack patterns define a series of repeatable steps that can be applied to simulate an attack against the security of a system.\n\n\n\n== Categories ==\nThere are several different ways to categorize attack patterns. One way is to group them into general categories, such as: Architectural, Physical, and External (see details below). Another way of categorizing attack patterns is to group them by a specific technology or type of technology (e.g. database attack patterns, web application attack patterns, network attack patterns, etc. or SQL Server attack patterns, Oracle Attack Patterns, .Net attack patterns, Java attack patterns, etc.)\n\n\n*** Using general categories ***\nArchitectural attack patterns are used to attack flaws in the architectural design of the system.  These are things like weaknesses in protocols, authentication strategies, and system modularization.  These are more logic-based attacks than actual bit-manipulation attacks. \nPhysical attack patterns are targeted at the code itself.  These are things such as  SQL injection attacks, buffer overflows, race conditions, and some of the more common forms of attacks that have become popular in the news. \nExternal attack patterns include attacks such as trojan horse attacks, viruses, and worms.  These are not generally solvable by software-design approaches because they operate relatively independently from the attacked program.  However, vulnerabilities in a piece of software can lead to these attacks being successful on a system running the vulnerable code.  An example of this is the vulnerable edition of Microsoft SQL Server, which allowed the Slammer worm to propagate itself.  The approach taken to these attacks is generally to revise the vulnerable code.\n\n== Structure ==\nAttack Patterns are structured very much like structure of Design patterns. Using this format is helpful for standardizing the development of attack patterns and ensures that certain information about each pattern is always documented the same way. \nA recommended structure for recording Attack Patterns is as follows: \n\nPattern Name The label given to the pattern which is commonly used to refer to the pattern in question.\n\nType & Subtypes The pattern type and its associated subtypes aid in classification of the pattern.  This allows users to rapidly locate and identify pattern groups that they will have to deal with in their security efforts.  \nEach pattern will have a type, and zero or more subtypes that identify the category of the attack pattern. Typical types include Injection Attack, Denial of Service Attack, Cryptanalysis Attack, etc.  Examples of typical subtypes for Denial Of Service, for example, would be:  DOS \u2013 Resource Starvation, DOS-System Crash, DOS-Policy Abuse. \nAnother important use of this field is to ensure that true patterns are not repeated unnecessarily.  Often it is easy to confuse a new exploit with a new attack.  New exploits are created all the time for the same attack patterns.  The Buffer Overflow Attack Pattern is a good example.  There are many known exploits and viruses that take advantage of a Buffer Overflow vulnerability.  But they all follow the same pattern.  Therefore, the Type and Subtype classification mechanism provides a way to classify a pattern.  If the pattern you are creating doesn't have a unique Type and Subtype, chances are it is a new exploit for an existing pattern. \nThis section is also used to indicate if it is possible to automate the attack.  If it is possible to automate the attack, it is recommended to provide a sample in the Sample Attack Code section which is described below.\n\nAlso Known AsCertain attacks may be known by several different names.  This field is used to list those other names. \n\nDescriptionThis is a description of the attack itself, and where it may have originated from.  It is essentially a free-form field that can be used to record information that doesn\u2019t easily fit into the other fields. \n\nAttacker IntentThis field identifies the intended result of the attacker.  This indicates the attacker\u2019s main target and goal for the attack itself.  For example, The Attacker Intent of a DOS \u2013 Bandwidth Starvation attack is to make the target web site unreachable to legitimate traffic.  \n\nMotivationThis field records the attacker\u2019s reason for attempting this attack.  It may be to crash a system in order to cause financial harm to the organization, or it may be to execute the theft of critical data in order to create financial gain for the attacker.  \nThis field is slightly different from the Attacker Intent field in that it describes why the attacker may want to achieve the Intent listed in the Attacker Intent field, rather than the physical result of the attack.\n\nExploitable VulnerabilityThis field indicates the specific type of vulnerability that creates the attack opportunity in the first place.  An example of this in an Integer Overflow attack would be that the integer-based input field is not checking size of the value of the incoming data to ensure that the target variable is capable of managing the incoming value.  This is the vulnerability that the associated exploit will take advantage of in order to carry out the attack.  \n\nParticipantsThe Participants are one or more entities that are required for this attack to succeed.  This includes the victim systems as well as the attacker and the attacker\u2019s tools or system components.  The name of the entity should be accompanied by a brief description of their role in the attack and how they interact with each other. \n\nProcess DiagramThese are one or more diagrams of the attack to visually explain how the attack is executed.  This diagram can take whatever form is appropriate but it is recommended that the diagram be similar to a system or class diagram showing data flows and the components involved.\n\nDependencies and ConditionsEvery attack must have some context to operate in and the conditions that make the attack possible.  This section describes what conditions are required and what other systems or situations need to be in place in order for the attack to succeed.  For example, for the attacker to be able to execute an Integer Overflow attack, they must have access to the vulnerable application.  That will be common amongst most of the attacks.  However, if the vulnerability only exposes itself when the target is running on a remote RPC server, that would also be a condition that would be noted here. \n\nSample Attack CodeIf it is possible to demonstrate the exploit code, this section provides a location to store the demonstration code.  In some cases, such as a Denial of Service attack, specific code may not be possible.  However, in Overflow, and Cross Site Scripting type attacks, sample code would be very useful. \n\nExisting ExploitsExploits can be automated or manual.  Automated exploits are often found as viruses, worms and hacking tools.  If there are any existing exploits known for the attack this section should be used to list a reference to those exploits.  These references can be internal such as corporate knowledge bases, or external such as the various CERT, and Virus databases. \nExploits are not to be confused with vulnerabilities.  An Exploit is an automated or manual attack that utilises the vulnerability.  It is not a listing of a vulnerability found in a particular product for example.  \n\nFollow-On AttacksFollow-on attacks are any other attacks that may be enabled by this particular attack pattern.  For example, a Buffer Overflow attack pattern, is usually followed by Escalation of Privilege attacks, Subversion attacks or setting up for Trojan Horse /Backdoor attacks.  This field can be particularly useful when researching an attack and identifying what other potential attacks may have been carried out or set up. \n\nMitigation TypesThe mitigation types are the basic types of mitigation strategies that would be used to prevent the attack pattern.  This would commonly refer to Security Patterns and Defensive Coding Patterns.  Mitigation Types can also be used as a means of classifying various attack patterns.  By classifying Attack Patterns in this manner, libraries can be developed to implement particular mitigation types which can then be used to mitigate entire classes of Attack Patterns.  These libraries can then be used and reused throughout various applications to ensure consistent and reliable coverage against particular types of attacks. \n\nRecommended MitigationSince this is an attack pattern, the recommended mitigation for the attack can be listed here in brief. Ideally, this will point the user to a more thorough mitigation pattern for this class of attack.  \n\nRelated PatternsThis section will have a few subsections such as Related Patterns, Mitigation Patterns, Security Patterns, and Architectural Patterns.  These are references to patterns that can support, relate to or mitigate the attack and the listing for the related pattern should note that. \nAn example of related patterns for an Integer Overflow Attack Pattern is:\nMitigation Patterns \u2013 Filtered Input Pattern, Self Defending Properties pattern \nRelated Patterns \u2013 Buffer Overflow Pattern  \n\nRelated Alerts, Listings and PublicationsThis section lists all the references to related alerts listings and publications such as listings in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, CERT, SANS, and any related vendor alerts.  These listings should be hyperlinked to the online alerts and listings in order to ensure it references the most up to date information possible. \n\nCVE: [1]\nCWE: [2]\nCERT: [3]Various Vendor Notification Sites.\n\nHow do Architectural attack patterns differ from Physical attack patterns?",

This section describes what conditions are required and what other systems or situations need to be in place in order for the attack to succeed.  For example, for the attacker to be able to execute an Integer Overflow attack, they must have access to the vulnerable application.  That will be common amongst most of the attacks.  However, if the vulnerability only exposes itself when the target is running on a remote RPC server, that would also be a condition that would be noted here. \n\nSample Attack CodeIf it is possible to demonstrate the exploit code, this section provides a location to store the demonstration code.  In some cases, such as a Denial of Service attack, specific code may not be possible.  However, in Overflow, and Cross Site Scripting type attacks, sample code would be very useful. \n\nExisting ExploitsExploits can be automated or manual.  Automated exploits are often found as viruses, worms and hacking tools.  If there are any existing exploits known for the attack this section should be used to list a reference to those exploits.  These references can be internal such as corporate knowledge bases, or external such as the various CERT, and Virus databases. \nExploits are not to be confused with vulnerabilities.  An Exploit is an automated or manual attack that utilises the vulnerability.  It is not a listing of a vulnerability found in a particular product for example.  \n\nFollow-On AttacksFollow-on attacks are any other attacks that may be enabled by this particular attack pattern.  For example, a Buffer Overflow attack pattern, is usually followed by Escalation of Privilege attacks, Subversion attacks or setting up for Trojan Horse /Backdoor attacks.  This field can be particularly useful when researching an attack and identifying what other potential attacks may have been carried out or set up. \n\nMitigation TypesThe mitigation types are the basic types of mitigation strategies that would be used to prevent the attack pattern.  This would commonly refer to Security Patterns and Defensive Coding Patterns.  Mitigation Types can also be used as a means of classifying various attack patterns.  By classifying Attack Patterns in this manner, libraries can be developed to implement particular mitigation types which can then be used to mitigate entire classes of Attack Patterns.  These libraries can then be used and reused throughout various applications to ensure consistent and reliable coverage against particular types of attacks. \n\nRecommended MitigationSince this is an attack pattern, the recommended mitigation for the attack can be listed here in brief. Ideally, this will point the user to a more thorough mitigation pattern for this class of attack.  \n\nRelated PatternsThis section will have a few subsections such as Related Patterns, Mitigation Patterns, Security Patterns, and Architectural Patterns.  These are references to patterns that can support, relate to or mitigate the attack and the listing for the related pattern should note that. \nAn example of related patterns for an Integer Overflow Attack Pattern is:\nMitigation Patterns \u2013 Filtered Input Pattern, Self Defending Properties pattern \nRelated Patterns \u2013 Buffer Overflow Pattern  \n\nRelated Alerts, Listings and PublicationsThis section lists all the references to related alerts listings and publications such as listings in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, CERT, SANS, and any related vendor alerts.  These listings should be hyperlinked to the online alerts and listings in order to ensure it references the most up to date information possible. \n\nCVE: [1]\nCWE: [2]\nCERT: [3]Various Vendor Notification Sites."

These systems are typically implemented as an overlay to an existing Wireless LAN infrastructure, although they may be deployed standalone to enforce no-wireless policies within an organization.  Some advanced wireless infrastructure has integrated WIPS capabilities.\nLarge organizations with many employees are particularly vulnerable to security breaches caused by rogue access points.  If an employee (trusted entity) in a location brings in an easily available wireless router, the entire network can be exposed to anyone within range of the signals.\nIn July 2009, the PCI Security Standards Council published wireless guidelines for PCI DSS recommending the use of WIPS to automate wireless scanning for large organizations.\n\n== Intrusion detection ==\nA wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) monitors the radio spectrum for the presence of unauthorized, rogue access points and the use of wireless attack tools. The system monitors the radio spectrum used by wireless LANs, and immediately alerts a systems administrator whenever a rogue access point is detected. Conventionally it is achieved by comparing the MAC address of the participating wireless devices.\nRogue devices can spoof MAC address of an authorized network device as their own. New research uses fingerprinting approach to weed out devices with spoofed MAC addresses. The idea is to compare the unique signatures exhibited by the signals emitted by each wireless device against the known signatures of pre-authorized, known wireless devices.\n\n== Intrusion prevention ==\nIn addition to intrusion detection, a WIPS also includes features that prevent against the threat automatically. For automatic \nprevention, it is required that the WIPS is able to accurately detect and automatically classify a threat.\nThe following types of threats can be prevented by a good WIPS:\n\nRogue access points \u2013 WIPS should understand the difference between rogue APs and external (neighbor's) APs\nMis-configured AP\nClient mis-association\nUnauthorized association\nMan-in-the-middle attack\nAd hoc networks\nMAC spoofing\nHoneypot / evil twin attack\nDenial-of-service attack\n\n== Implementation ==\nWIPS configurations consist of three components:\n\nSensors \u2014 These devices contain antennas and radios that scan the wireless spectrum for packets and are installed throughout areas to be protected\nServer \u2014 The WIPS server centrally analyzes packets captured by sensors\nConsole \u2014 The console provides the primary user interface into the system for administration and reportingA simple intrusion detection system can be a single computer, connected to a wireless signal processing device, and antennas placed throughout the facility.  For huge organizations, a Multi Network Controller provides central control of multiple WIPS servers, while for SOHO or SMB customers, all the functionality of WIPS is available in single box.\nIn a WIPS implementation, users first define the operating wireless policies in the WIPS. The WIPS sensors then analyze the traffic in the air and send this information to WIPS server. The WIPS server correlates the information, validates it against the defined policies, and classifies if it is a threat. The administrator of the WIPS is then notified of the threat, or, if a policy has been set accordingly, the WIPS takes automatic protection measures.\nWIPS is configured as either a network implementation or a hosted implementation.\n\n\n*** Network implementation ***\nIn a network WIPS implementation, server, sensors and the console are all placed inside a private network and are not accessible from the Internet.\nSensors communicate with the server over a private network using a private port. Since the server resides on the private network, users can access the console only from within the private network.\nA network implementation is suitable for organizations where all locations are within the private network.\n\n\n*** Hosted implementation ***\nIn a hosted WIPS implementation, sensors are installed inside a private network. However, the server is hosted in secure data center and is accessible on the Internet. Users can access the WIPS console from anywhere on the Internet. A hosted WIPS implementation is as secure as a network implementation because the data flow is encrypted between sensors and server, as well as between server and console. A hosted WIPS implementation requires very little configuration because the sensors are programmed to automatically look for the server on the Internet over a secure TLS connection.\nFor a large organization with locations that are not a part of a private network, a hosted WIPS implementation simplifies deployment significantly because sensors connect to the Server over the Internet without requiring any special configuration.

    "instruction": "Operation Newscaster\n\n==Introduction==\n\"Operation Newscaster\", as labelled by American firm iSIGHT Partners in 2014, is a cyber espionage covert operation directed at military and political figures using social networking, allegedly done by Iran. The operation has been described as \"creative\", \"long-term\" and \"unprecedented\". According to iSIGHT Partners, it is \"the most elaborate cyber espionage campaign using social engineering that has been uncovered to date from any nation\".\n\n\n\n== ISight's perceptions ==\n\nOn 29 May 2014, Texas-based cyber espionage research firm iSIGHT Partners released a report, uncovering an operation it labels \"Newscaster\" since at-least 2011, has targeted at least 2,000 people in United States, Israel, Britain, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.The victims who are not identified in the document due to security reasons, are senior U.S. military and diplomatic personnel, congresspeople, journalists, lobbyists, think tankers and defense contractors, including a four-star admiral.The firm couldn\u2019t determine what data the hackers may have stolen.According to the iSIGHT Partners report, hackers used 14 \"elaborated fake\" personas claiming to work in journalism, government, and defense contracting and were active in Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, YouTube and Blogger. To establish trust and credibility, the users fabricated a fictitious journalism website, NewsOnAir.org, using content from the media like Associated Press, BBC, Reuters and populated their profiles with fictitious personal content. They then tried to befriend target victims and sent them \"friendly messages\" with Spear-phishing to steal email passwords and attacks and infecting them to a \"not particularly sophisticated\" malware for data exfiltration.The report says NewsOnAir.org was registered in Tehran and likely hosted by an Iranian provider. The Persian word \"Parastoo\" (\u067e\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0648; meaning swallow) was used as a password for malware associated with the group, which appeared to work during business hours in Tehran as they took Thursday and Friday off. iSIGHT Partners could not confirm whether the hackers had ties to the Iranian government.\n\n== Analysis ==\nAccording to Al Jazeera, Chinese army's cyber unit carried out scores of similar phishing schemes.Morgan Marquis-Boire, a researcher at the University of Toronto stated that the campaign \"appeared to be the work of the same actors performing malware attacks on Iranian dissidents and journalists for at least two years\".Franz-Stefan Gady, a senior fellow at the EastWest Institute and a founding member of the Worldwide Cybersecurity Initiative, stated that \u201cThey\u2019re not doing this for a quick buck, to extrapolate data and extort an organization. They\u2019re in it for the long haul. Sophisticated human engineering has been the preferred method of state actors\u201d.\n\n== Reactions ==\nFacebook spokesman said the company discovered the hacking group while investigating suspicious friend requests and removed all of the fake profiles.\nLinkedIn spokesman said they are investigating the report, though none of the 14 fake profiles uncovered were currently active.\nTwitter declined to comment.\nFederal Bureau of Investigation told Al Jazeera \"it was aware of the report but that it had no comment\".\n\nHow did the hackers in Operation Newscaster use content from the media in their campaign, as described in the iSIGHT Partners report?",

According to iSIGHT Partners, it is \"the most elaborate cyber espionage campaign using social engineering that has been uncovered to date from any nation\".\n\n\n\n== ISight's perceptions ==\n\nOn 29 May 2014, Texas-based cyber espionage research firm iSIGHT Partners released a report, uncovering an operation it labels \"Newscaster\" since at-least 2011, has targeted at least 2,000 people in United States, Israel, Britain, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.The victims who are not identified in the document due to security reasons, are senior U.S. military and diplomatic personnel, congresspeople, journalists, lobbyists, think tankers and defense contractors, including a four-star admiral.The firm couldn\u2019t determine what data the hackers may have stolen.According to the iSIGHT Partners report, hackers used 14 \"elaborated fake\" personas claiming to work in journalism, government, and defense contracting and were active in Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, YouTube and Blogger. To establish trust and credibility, the users fabricated a fictitious journalism website, NewsOnAir.org, using content from the media like Associated Press, BBC, Reuters and populated their profiles with fictitious personal content. They then tried to befriend target victims and sent them \"friendly messages\" with Spear-phishing to steal email passwords and attacks and infecting them to a \"not particularly sophisticated\" malware for data exfiltration.The report says NewsOnAir.org was registered in Tehran and likely hosted by an Iranian provider. The Persian word \"Parastoo\" (\u067e\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0648; meaning swallow) was used as a password for malware associated with the group, which appeared to work during business hours in Tehran as they took Thursday and Friday off. iSIGHT Partners could not confirm whether the hackers had ties to the Iranian government.\n\n== Analysis ==\nAccording to Al Jazeera, Chinese army's cyber unit carried out scores of similar phishing schemes.Morgan Marquis-Boire, a researcher at the University of Toronto stated that the campaign \"appeared to be the work of the same actors performing malware attacks on Iranian dissidents and journalists for at least two years\".Franz-Stefan Gady, a senior fellow at the EastWest Institute and a founding member of the Worldwide Cybersecurity Initiative, stated that \u201cThey\u2019re not doing this for a quick buck, to extrapolate data and extort an organization. They\u2019re in it for the long haul. Sophisticated human engineering has been the preferred method of state actors\u201d.\n\n== Reactions ==\nFacebook spokesman said the company discovered the hacking group while investigating suspicious friend requests and removed all of the fake profiles.\nLinkedIn spokesman said they are investigating the report, though none of the 14 fake profiles uncovered were currently active.\nTwitter declined to comment.\nFederal Bureau of Investigation told Al Jazeera \"it was aware of the report but that it had no comment\"."

    "instruction": "Computer-aided audit tools\n\n==Introduction==\nComputer-assisted audit tool (CAATs) or computer-assisted audit tools and techniques (CAATTs) is a growing field within the IT audit profession. CAATs is the practice of using computers to automate the IT audit processes. CAATs normally include using basic office productivity software such as spreadsheets, word processors and text editing programs and more advanced software packages involving use statistical analysis and business intelligence tools. But also more dedicated specialized software are available (see below).\nCAATs have become synonymous with data analytics in the audit process.\n\n== Traditional auditing vs CAATs ==\n\n\n*** Traditional audit example ***\nThe traditional method of auditing allows auditors to build conclusions based upon a limited sample of a population, rather than an examination of all available or a large sample of data.\n\n\n*** CAATTs alternative ***\nCAATTs, not CAATs,  addresses these problems. CAATTs, as it is commonly used, is the practice of analyzing large volumes of data looking for anomalies. A well-designed CAATTs audit will not be a sample, but rather a complete review of all transactions. Using CAATTs the auditor will extract every transaction the business unit performed during the period reviewed. The auditor will then test that data to determine if there are any problems in the data.\n\n\n*** Traditional audit vs CAATTs on specific risks ***\nAnother advantage of CAATTs is that it allows auditors to test for specific risks. For example, an insurance company may want to ensure that it doesn't pay any claims after a policy is terminated. Using traditional audit techniques this risk would be very difficult to test. The auditor would \"randomly select\" a \"statistically valid\" sample of claims (usually if any of those claims were processed after a policy was terminated). Since the insurance company might process millions of claims the odds that any of those 30\u201350 \"randomly selected\" claims occurred after the policy was terminated is extremely unlikely.\nUsing CAATTs the auditor can select every claim that had a date of service after the policy termination date. The auditor then can determine if any claims were inappropriately paid. If they were, the auditor can then figure out why the controls to prevent this failure. In a real-life audit, the CAATTs auditor noted that several claims had been paid after policies were terminated. Using CAATTs the auditor was able to identify every claim that was paid and the exact dollar amount incorrectly paid by the insurance company. Furthermore, the auditor was able to identify the reason why these claims were paid. The reason why they were paid was because the participant paid their premium. The insurance company, having received a payment, paid the claims. Then after paying the claim the participant's check bounced. When the check bounced, the participant's policy was retrospectively terminated, but the claim was still paid costing the company hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.\nWhich looks better in an audit report:\n\"Audit reviewed 50 transactions and noted one transaction that was processed incorrectly\"\nor\n\"Audit used CAATTs and tested every transaction over the past year. We noted XXX exceptions wherein the company paid YYY dollars on terminated policies.\"\nHowever, the CAATTs driven review is limited only to the data saved on files in accordance with a systematic pattern. Much data is never documented this way. In addition saved data often contains deficiencies, is poorly classified, is not easy to get, and it might be hard to become convinced about its integrity. So, for the present CAATTs is a complement to an auditor's tools and techniques. In certain audits, CAATTs can't be used at all. But there are also audits that simply can't be made with due care and efficiently without CAATTs.\n\n== Specialized software ==\nIn the most general terms, CAATTs can refer to any computer program utilized to improve the audit process. Generally, however, it is used to refer to any data extraction and analysis software. This would include programs such as data analysis and extraction tools, spreadsheets (e.g. Excel), databases (e.g. Access), statistical analysis (e.g. SAS), generalized audit software (e.g. ACL, Arbutus, EAS), business intelligence (e.g. Crystal Reports and Business Objects), etc.\nBenefits of audit software include:\n\nThey are independent of the system being audited and will use a read-only copy of the file to avoid any corruption of an organization\u2019s data.\nMany audit-specific routines are used such as sampling.\nProvides documentation of each test performed in the software that can be used as documentation in the auditor\u2019s work papers.Audit specialized software may perform the following functions:\n\nData queries.\nData stratification.\nSample extractions.\nMissing sequence identification.\nStatistical analysis.\nCalculations.\nDuplicate transaction identification.\nPivot table creation.\nCross tabulation.\n\n== CAATs Education and Professional Development ==\n\n\n*** CAATs Courses ***\nCAATs are the fundamental tool that is used by the auditors. This tool facilitates them to make search from the irregularities from the given data. With the help of this tool, the auditors and accountants of any firm will be able to provide more analytical results. These tools are used throughout every business environment and also in the industry sectors too. With the help of computer-assisted audit techniques, more forensic accounting with more analysis can be done. It\u2019s really a helpful tool that helps the firm auditor to work in an efficient and productive manner. Working with the CAATs, it is essential for the accountant or the auditor to select the right data, the selection process is very much tricky, and you need to be professional for it. After selecting the right data, import that to the CAATs, now the tool will automatically generate the analytical data. This tool contributes to the efficiency of the auditors. The fundamental course outline  include:\n\nComputer Auditing Overview\nLegal and Ethical Issues for Computer Auditors\nUnderstanding CAATs\nComputer Auditing Project Planning\nData Access Skill and Knowledge\nData Verify Skill and Knowledge\nData Analysis Skill and Knowledge\nAudit Finding Report Skill and Knowledge\n\n\n*** CAATs Certification Program ***\nThere are several certification programs from various CAATs vendors and professional associations as the following:\n\nInternational Certified CAATs Practitioner (ICCP): established by the International Computer Auditing Education Association (ICAEA).\nACL\u2122 Certified Data Analyst (ACDA): established by ACL Services Ltd.\nCertified IDEA Data Analyst (CIDA):  established by CaseWare Analytics.\nJacksoft Certified CAATs Practitioner (JCCP): established by Jacksoft Commerce Automation Ltd.\n\n== Other uses of CAATs ==\nIn addition to using data analysis software, the auditor uses CAATs throughout the audit for the following activities while performing data analysis:\n\n\n*** Creation of electronic work papers ***\nKeeping electronic work papers on a centralized audit file or database will allow the auditor to navigate through current and archived working papers with ease. The database will make it easier for auditors to coordinate current audits and ensure they consider findings from prior or related projects. Additionally, the auditor will be able to electronically standardize audit forms and formats, which can improve both the quality and consistency of the audit working papers.\n\n\n*** Fraud detection ***\nCAATs provide auditors with tools that can identify unexpected or unexplained patterns in data that may indicate fraud. Whether the CAATs is simple or complex, data analysis provides many benefits in the prevention and detection of fraud.\nCAATs can assist the auditor in detecting fraud by performing and creating the following,\n\n\n*** Analytical tests ***\nEvaluations of financial information made by studying plausible relationships among both financial and non-financial data to assess whether account balances appear reasonable (AU 329). Examples include ratio, trend, and Benford's Law tests.\n\n\n*** Data analysis reports ***\nReports produced using specific audit commands such as filtering records and joining data files.\n\n\n*** Continuous monitoring ***\nContinuous monitoring is an ongoing process for acquiring, analyzing, and reporting on business data to identify and respond to operational business risks. For auditors to ensure a comprehensive approach to acquire, analyze, and report on business data, they must make certain the organization continuously monitors user activity on all computer systems, business transactions and processes, and application controls.\n\n\n*** Curb stoning in surveys ***\nCurb stoning is the term for instances where a surveyor completes a survey form by making up data. Because some of the data should conform with Benford's law, this practice can be detected using CAATTs which provide the capability of performing such tests.\n\n\n*** Note on the acronyms CAATTs vs CAATs ***\nCAATTs and CAATs are used interchangeably. While CAATs has emerged as the more common spelling, CAATTs is the more precise acronym. The acronym CAATTs solves one of the two problems with defining the acronym. CAATs means:\nComputer Aided (or Assisted) Audit Techniques (or Tools and Techniques)\nThe first \"A\" and the \"T\" can have two different meanings depending on who uses the term. By using the term CAATTs, one is clearly incorporating both \"Tools\" AND \"Techniques.\"\n\n== Comparison of tools ==\n\n\n*** Comparison by specification ***\n\n\n*** Comparison by analysis features ***\nThe following table compares features of specialized computer-aided audit tools.

Rabin.1  In this form, the sender sends a message to the receiver with probability 1/2, while the sender remains oblivious as to whether or not the receiver received the message.  Rabin's oblivious transfer scheme is based on the RSA cryptosystem.  A more useful form of oblivious transfer called 1\u20132 oblivious transfer or \"1 out of 2 oblivious transfer\", was developed later by Shimon Even, Oded Goldreich, and Abraham Lempel,2 in order to build protocols for secure multiparty computation. It is generalized to \"1 out of n oblivious transfer\" where the user gets exactly one database element without the server getting to know which element was queried, and without the user knowing anything about the other elements that were not retrieved. The latter notion of oblivious transfer is a strengthening of private information retrieval, in which the database is not kept private.\nClaude Cr\u00e9peau showed that Rabin's oblivious transfer is equivalent to 1\u20132 oblivious transfer.3Further work has revealed oblivious transfer to be a fundamental and important problem in cryptography.  It is considered one of the critical problems in the field, because of the importance of the applications that can be built based on it. In particular, it is complete for secure multiparty computation: that is, given an implementation of oblivious transfer it is possible to securely evaluate any polynomial time computable function without any additional primitive.4\n\n== Rabin's oblivious transfer protocol ==\nIn Rabin's oblivious transfer protocol, the sender generates an RSA public modulus N\n\n== 1\u20132 oblivious transfer ==\nIn a 1\u20132 oblivious transfer protocol, Alice the sender has two messages m0 and m1, and wants to ensure that the receiver only learns one.

Specifically, a sender has n messages, and the receiver has an index i, and the receiver wishes to receive the i-th among the sender's messages, without the sender learning i, while the sender wants to ensure that the receiver receive only one of the n messages.\n1-out-of-n oblivious transfer is incomparable to private information retrieval (PIR). \nOn the one hand, 1-out-of-n oblivious transfer imposes an additional privacy requirement for the database: namely, that the receiver learn at most one of the database entries. On the other hand, PIR requires communication sublinear in n, whereas 1-out-of-n oblivious transfer has no such requirement. However, assuming single server PIR is a sufficient assumption in order to construct  1-out-of-2 Oblivious Transfer 14.\n1-out-of-n oblivious transfer protocol with sublinear communication was first constructed (as a generalization of single-server PIR) by Eyal Kushilevitz and Rafail Ostrovsky 15. More efficient constructions were proposed by Moni Naor and Benny Pinkas,10 William Aiello, Yuval Ishai and Omer Reingold,11 Sven Laur and Helger Lipmaa.12. In 2017, Kolesnikov et al.,13 proposed an efficient 1-n oblivious transfer protocol which requires roughly 4x the cost of 1-2 oblivious transfer in amortized setting.\nBrassard, Cr\u00e9peau and Robert further generalized this notion to k-n oblivious transfer,5 wherein the receiver obtains a set of k messages from the n message collection.  The set of k messages may be received simultaneously (\"non-adaptively\"), or they may be requested consecutively, with each request based on previous messages received.6\n\n== Generalized oblivious transfer ==\nk-n Oblivious transfer is a special case of generalized oblivious transfer, which was presented by Ishai and Kushilevitz.7 In that setting, the sender has a set U of n messages, and the transfer constraints are specified by a collection A of permissible subsets of U.\nThe receiver may obtain any subset of the messages in U that appears in the collection A. The sender should remain oblivious of the selection made by the receiver, while the receiver cannot learn the value of the messages outside the subset of messages that he chose to obtain. The collection A is monotone decreasing, in the sense that it is closed under containment (i.e., if a given subset B is in the collection A, so are all of the subsets of B).\nThe solution proposed by Ishai and Kushilevitz uses the parallel invocations of 1-2 oblivious transfer while making use of a special model of private protocols. Later on, other solutions that are based on secret sharing were published \u2013 one by Bhavani Shankar, Kannan Srinathan, and C. Pandu Rangan,8 and another by Tamir Tassa.9\n\n== Origins ==\nIn the early seventies Stephen Wiesner introduced a primitive called multiplexing in his seminal paper \"Conjugate Coding\",\nwhich was the starting point of quantum cryptography.[1] Unfortunately it took more than ten years to be published. Even though\nthis primitive was equivalent to what was later called 1\u20132 oblivious transfer, Wiesner did not see its application to cryptography.\n\n== Quantum oblivious transfer ==\nProtocols for oblivious transfer can be implemented with quantum systems. In contrast to other tasks in quantum cryptography, like quantum key distribution, it has been shown that quantum oblivious transfer cannot be implemented with unconditional security, i.e. the security of quantum oblivious transfer protocols cannot be guaranteed only from the laws of quantum physics.\n\nQuestion: What is 1-2 oblivious transfer and how is it different from Rabin's oblivious transfer?\n\nAnswer:",

Bob does not want Alice to know which one he receives.\nAlice generates an RSA key pair, comprising the modulus \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  , the public exponent \n  \n    \n      \n        e\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle e}\n   and the private exponent \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d}\n  .\nShe also generates two random values, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          x\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{0},x_{1}}\n   and sends them to Bob along with her public modulus and exponent.\nBob picks \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b}\n   to be either 0 or 1, and selects \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            b\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{b}}\n  .\nBob generates a random value \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k}\n   uses it to blind \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            b\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{b}}\n   by computing \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n\n== 1-out-of-n oblivious transfer and k-out-of-n oblivious transfer ==\nA 1-out-of-n oblivious transfer protocol can be defined as a natural generalization of a 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer protocol. Specifically, a sender has n messages, and the receiver has an index i, and the receiver wishes to receive the i-th among the sender's messages, without the sender learning i, while the sender wants to ensure that the receiver receive only one of the n messages.\n1-out-of-n oblivious transfer is incomparable to private information retrieval (PIR). \nOn the one hand, 1-out-of-n oblivious transfer imposes an additional privacy requirement for the database: namely, that the receiver learn at most one of the database entries. On the other hand, PIR requires communication sublinear in n, whereas 1-out-of-n oblivious transfer has no such requirement. However, assuming single server PIR is a sufficient assumption in order to construct  1-out-of-2 Oblivious Transfer 14.\n1-out-of-n oblivious transfer protocol with sublinear communication was first constructed (as a generalization of single-server PIR) by Eyal Kushilevitz and Rafail Ostrovsky 15. More efficient constructions were proposed by Moni Naor and Benny Pinkas,10 William Aiello, Yuval Ishai and Omer Reingold,11 Sven Laur and Helger Lipmaa.12. In 2017, Kolesnikov et al.,13 proposed an efficient 1-n oblivious transfer protocol which requires roughly 4x the cost of 1-2 oblivious transfer in amortized setting.\nBrassard, Cr\u00e9peau and Robert further generalized this notion to k-n oblivious transfer,5 wherein the receiver obtains a set of k messages from the n message collection.  The set of k messages may be received simultaneously (\"non-adaptively\"), or they may be requested consecutively, with each request based on previous messages received.6\n\n== Generalized oblivious transfer ==\nk-n Oblivious transfer is a special case of generalized oblivious transfer, which was presented by Ishai and Kushilevitz.7 In that setting, the sender has a set U of n messages, and the transfer constraints are specified by a collection A of permissible subsets of U.\nThe receiver may obtain any subset of the messages in U that appears in the collection A. The sender should remain oblivious of the selection made by the receiver, while the receiver cannot learn the value of the messages outside the subset of messages that he chose to obtain. The collection A is monotone decreasing, in the sense that it is closed under containment (i.e., if a given subset B is in the collection A, so are all of the subsets of B).\nThe solution proposed by Ishai and Kushilevitz uses the parallel invocations of 1-2 oblivious transfer while making use of a special model of private protocols. Later on, other solutions that are based on secret sharing were published \u2013 one by Bhavani Shankar, Kannan Srinathan, and C. Pandu Rangan,8 and another by Tamir Tassa.9\n\n== Origins ==\nIn the early seventies Stephen Wiesner introduced a primitive called multiplexing in his seminal paper \"Conjugate Coding\",\nwhich was the starting point of quantum cryptography.[1] Unfortunately it took more than ten years to be published. Even though\nthis primitive was equivalent to what was later called 1\u20132 oblivious transfer, Wiesner did not see its application to cryptography.\n\n== Quantum oblivious transfer ==\nProtocols for oblivious transfer can be implemented with quantum systems. In contrast to other tasks in quantum cryptography, like quantum key distribution, it has been shown that quantum oblivious transfer cannot be implemented with unconditional security, i.e. the security of quantum oblivious transfer protocols cannot be guaranteed only from the laws of quantum physics."

    "instruction": "International cybercrime\n\n==Introduction==\nThere is no commonly agreed single definition of \u201ccybercrime\u201d. It refers to illegal internet-mediated activities that often take place in global electronic networks. Cybercrime is \"international\" or \"transnational\" \u2013 there are \u2018no cyber-borders between countries'. International cybercrimes often challenge the effectiveness of domestic and international law, and law enforcement. Because existing laws in many countries are not tailored to deal with cybercrime, criminals increasingly conduct crimes on the Internet in order to take advantages of the less severe punishments or difficulties of being traced. No matter, in developing or developed countries, governments and industries have gradually realized the colossal threats of cybercrime on economic and political security and public interests. However, complexity in types and forms of cybercrime increases the difficulty to fight back. In this sense, fighting cybercrime calls for international cooperation. Various organizations and governments have already made joint efforts in establishing global standards of legislation and law enforcement both on a regional and on an international scale. China\u2013United States cooperation is one of the most striking progress recently, because they are the top two source countries of cybercrime.\nInformation and communication technology (ICT) plays an important role in helping ensure interoperability and security based on global standards. General countermeasures have been adopted in cracking down cybercrime, such as legal measures in perfecting legislation and technical measures in tracking down crimes over the network, Internet content control, using public or private proxy and computer forensics, encryption and plausible deniability, etc. Due to the heterogeneity of law enforcement and technical countermeasures of different countries, this article will mainly focus on legislative and regulatory initiatives of international cooperation.\n\n\n\n== Typology ==\nIn terms of cybercrime, we may often associate it with various forms of Internet attacks, such as hacking, Trojans, malware (keyloggers), botnet, Denial-of-Service (DoS), spoofing, phishing, and vishing. Though cybercrime encompasses a broad range of illegal activities, it can be generally divided into five categories:\n\n\n*** Intrusive Offenses ***\nIllegal Access:  \u201cHacking\u201d is one of the major forms of offenses that refers to unlawful access to a computer system.\nData Espionage: Offenders can intercept communications between users (such as e-mails) by targeting communication infrastructure such as fixed lines or wireless, and any Internet service (e.g., e-mail servers, chat or VoIP communications).\nData Interference: Offenders can violate the integrity of data and interfere with them by deleting, suppressing, or altering data and restricting access to them.\n\n\n*** Content-related offenses ***\nPornographic Material (Child-Pornography): Sexually related content was among the first content to be commercially distributed over the Internet.\nRacism, Hate Speech, Glorification of Violence: Radical groups use mass communication systems such as the Internet to spread propaganda.\nReligious Offenses: A growing number of websites present material that is in some countries covered by provisions related to religious offenses, e.g., anti-religious written statements.\nSpam: Offenders send out bulk mails by unidentified source and the mail server often contains useless advertisements and pictures.\n\n\n*** Copyright and trademark-related offenses ***\nCommon copyright offenses: cyber copyright infringement of software, music or films.\nTrademark violations: A well-known aspect of global trade. The most serious offenses include phishing and domain or name-related offenses, such as cybersquatting.\n\n\n*** Computer-related offenses ***\nFraud: online auction fraud, advance fee fraud, credit card fraud, Internet banking\nForgery: manipulation of digital documents.\nIdentity theft: It refers to stealing private information including Social Security Numbers (SSN), passport numbers, Date of birth, addresses, phone numbers, and passwords for non-financial and financial accounts.\n\n\n*** Combination offenses ***\nCyberterrorism: The main purposes of it are propaganda, information gathering, preparation of real-world attacks, publication of training material, communication, terrorist financing and attacks against critical infrastructure.\nCyberwarfare: It describes the use of ICTs in conducting warfare using the Internet.\nCyberlaundering: Conducting crime through the use of virtual currencies, online casinos etc.\n\n== Threats ==\nSimilar to conventional crime, economic benefits, power, revenge, adventure, ideology and lust are the core driving forces of cybercrime. Major threats caused by those motivations can be categorized as following:\nEconomic security, reputation and social trust are severely challenged by cyber fraud, counterfeiting, impersonation and concealment of identity, extortion, electronic money laundering, copyright infringement and tax evasion.\nPublic interest and national security is threatened by dissemination of offensive material \u2014e.g., pornographic, defamatory or inflammatory/intrusive communication\u2014 cyber stalking/harassment, Child pornography and paedophilia, electronic vandalism/terrorism.\nPrivacy, domestic and even diplomatic information security are harmed by unauthorized access and misuse of ICT, denial of services, and illegal interception of communication.Domestic, as well as international security are threatened by cybercrime due to its transnational characteristic. No single country can really handle this big issue on their own. It is imperative for us to collaborate and defend cybercrime on a global scale.\n\n== International trends ==\nAs more and more criminals are aware of potentially large economic gains that can be achieved with cybercrime, they tend to switch from simple adventure and vandalism to more targeted attacks, especially platforms where valuable information highly concentrates, such as computer, mobile devices and the Cloud. There are several emerging international trends of cybercrime.\n\nPlatform switch: Cybercrime is switching its battle ground from Windows-system PCs to other platforms, including mobile phones, tablet computers, and VoIP. Because a significant threshold in vulnerabilities has been reached. PC vendors are building better security into their products by providing faster updates, patches and user alert to potential flaws. Besides, global mobile devices\u2019 penetration\u2014from smart phones to tablet PCs\u2014accessing the Internet by 2013 will surpass 1 billion, creating more opportunities for cybercrime. The massively successful banking Trojan, Zeus is already being adapted for the mobile platform. Smishing, or SMS phishing, is another method cyber criminals are using to exploit mobile devices, which users download after falling prey to a social engineering ploy, is designed to defeat the SMS-based two-factor authentication most banks use to confirm online funds transfers by customers. VoIP systems are being used to support vishing (telephone-based phishing) schemes, which are now growing in popularity.\nSocial engineering scams: It refers to a non-technical kind of intrusion, in the form of e-mails or social networking chats, that relies heavily on human interaction and often involves fooling potential victims into downloading malware or leaking personal data. Social engineering is nevertheless highly effective for attacking well-protected computer systems with the exploitation of trust. Social networking becomes an increasingly important tool for cyber criminals to recruit money mules to assist their money laundering operations around the globe. Spammers are not only spoofing social networking messages to persuade targets to click on links in emails \u2014 they are taking advantage of users\u2019 trust of their social networking connections to attract new victims.\nHighly targeted: The newest twist in \"hypertargeting\" is malware that is meant to disrupt industrial systems \u2014 such as the Stuxnet network worm, which exploits zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft. The first known copy of the worm was discovered in a plant in Germany. A subsequent variant led to a widespread global outbreak.\nDissemination and use of malware: malware generally takes the form of a virus, a worm, a Trojan horse, or spyware. In 2009, the majority of malware connects to host Web sites registered in the U.S.A. (51.4%), with China second (17.2%), and Spain third (15.7%). A primary means of malware dissemination is email. It is truly international in scope.\nIntellectual property theft (IP theft): It is estimated that 90% of the software, DVDs, and CDs sold in some countries are counterfeit, and that the total global trade in counterfeit goods is more than $600 billion a year. In the USA alone, IP theft costs businesses an estimated $250 billion annually, and 750,000 jobs.\n\n== International legislative responses and cooperation ==\n\n\n*** International responses ***\nG8\nGroup of Eight (G8) is made up of the heads of eight industrialized countries: the U.S., the United Kingdom, Russia, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, and Canada.\nIn 1997, G8 released a Ministers' Communiqu\u00e9 that includes an action plan and principles to combat cybercrime and protect data and systems from unauthorized impairment. G8 also mandates that all law enforcement personnel must be trained and equipped to address cybercrime, and designates all member countries to have a point of contact on a 24 hours a day/7 days a week basis.United Nations\nIn 1990 the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution dealing with computer crime legislation.\nIn 2000 the UN GA adopted a resolution on combating the criminal misuse of information technology.\nIn 2002 the UN GA adopted a second resolution on the criminal misuse of information technology.ITU\nThe International Telecommunication Union (ITU), as a specialized agency within the United Nations, plays a leading role in the standardization and development of telecommunications and cybersecurity issues. The ITU was the lead agency of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS).\nIn 2003, Geneva Declaration of Principles and the Geneva Plan of Action were released, which highlights the importance of measures in the fight against cybercrime.\nIn 2005, the Tunis Commitment and the Tunis Agenda were adopted for the Information Society.\nCouncil of Europe\nCouncil of Europe is an international organisation focusing on the development of human rights and democracy in its 47 European member states.\nIn 2001, the Convention on Cybercrime, the first international convention aimed at Internet criminal behaviors, was co-drafted by the Council of Europe with the addition of USA, Canada, and Japan and signed by its 46 member states. But only 25 countries ratified later. [8] It aims at providing the basis of an effective legal framework for fighting cybercrime, through harmonization of cybercriminal offenses qualification, provision for laws empowering law enforcement and enabling international cooperation.\n\n\n*** Regional responses ***\nAPEC\nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is an international forum that seeks to promote promoting open trade and practical economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region.\nIn 2002, APEC issued Cybersecurity Strategy which is included in the Shanghai Declaration. The strategy outlined six areas for co-operation among member economies including legal developments, information sharing and co-operation, security and technical guidelines, public awareness, and training and education.\nOECD\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an international economic organisation of 34 countries founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade.\nIn 1990, the Information, Computer and Communications Policy (ICCP) Committee created an Expert Group to develop a set of guidelines for information security that was drafted until 1992 and then adopted by the OECD Council. In 2002, OECD announced the completion of \"Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks: Towards a Culture of Security\".\nEuropean Union\n\nIn 2001, the European Commission published a communication titled \"Creating a Safer Information Society by Improving the Security of Information Infrastructures and Combating Computer-related Crime\".\nIn 2002, EU presented a proposal for a \u201cFramework Decision on Attacks against Information Systems\u201d. The Framework Decision takes note of Convention on Cybercrime, but concentrates on the harmonisation of substantive criminal law provisions that are designed to protect infrastructure elements.\nCommonwealth\nIn 2002, the Commonwealth of Nations presented a model law on cybercrime that provides a legal framework to harmonise legislation within the Commonwealth and enable international cooperation. The model law was intentionally drafted in accordance with the Convention on Cybercrime.ECOWAS\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is a regional group of west African Countries founded in 1975 it has fifteen member states. In 2009, ECOWAS adopted the Directive on Fighting Cybercrime in ECOWAS that provides a legal framework for the member states, which includes substantive criminal law as well as procedural law.GCC\nIn 2007, the Arab League and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) recommended at a conference seeking a joint approach that takes into consideration international standards.\n\n\n*** Voluntary industry response ***\nDuring the past few years, public-private partnerships have emerged as a promising approach for tackling cybersecurity issues around the globe. Executive branch agencies (e.g., the Federal Trade Commission in US), regulatory agencies (e.g., Australian Communications and Media Authority), separate agencies (e.g., ENISA in the EU) and industry (e.g., MAAWG, \u2026) are all involved in partnership.\nIn 2004, the London Action Plan was founded, which aims at promoting international spam enforcement cooperation and address spam related problems, such as online fraud and deception, phishing, and dissemination of viruses.\n\n== Case analysis ==\n\n\n*** U.S. ***\nAccording to Sophos, the U.S. remains the top-spamming country and the source of about one-fifth of the world's spam. Cross-border cyber-exfiltration operations are in tension with international legal norms, so U.S. law enforcement efforts to collect foreign cyber evidence raises complex jurisdictional questions. Since fighting cybercrime involves great amount of sophisticated legal and other measures, only milestones rather than full texts are provided here.\n\n\n**** Legal and regulatory measures ****\nThe first federal computer crime statute was the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984 (CFAA).\nIn 1986, Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) was an amendment to the federal wiretap law.\n\u201cNational Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996\u201d.\n\u201cCyberspace Electronic Security Act of 1999\u201d.\n\u201cPatriot Act of 2001\u201d.\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) was enacted in 1998.\nCyber Security Enhancement Act (CSEA) was passed in 2002.\nCan-spam law issued in 2003 and subsequent implementation measures were made by FCC and FTC.In 2005 the USA passed the Anti-Phishing Act which added two new crimes to the US Code.In 2009, the Obama Administration released Cybersecurity Report and policy.\nCybersecurity Act of 2010, a bill seeking to increase collaboration between the public and the private sector on cybersecurity issues.A number of agencies have been set up in the U.S. to fight against cybercrime, including the FBI, National Infrastructure Protection Center, National White Collar Crime Center, Internet Fraud Complaint Center, Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Department of Justice (DoJ), Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Unit of the DoJ, and Computer Emergency Readiness Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) at Carnegie-Mellon, and so on.CyberSafe is a public service project designed to educate end users of the Internet about the critical need for personal computer security.\n\n\n**** Technical measures ****\nCloud computing: It can make infrastructures more resilient to attacks and functions as data backup as well. However, as the Cloud concentrates more and more sensitive data, it becomes increasingly attractive to cybercriminals.\nBetter encryption methods are developed to deal with phishing, smishing and other illegal data interception activities.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation has set up special technical units and developed Carnivore, a computer surveillance system which can intercept all packets that are sent to and from the ISP where it is installed, to assist in the investigation of cybercrime.\n\n\n**** Industry collaboration ****\nPublic-private partnership: in 2006, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) signed an agreement with the United States Department of Commerce (United States Department of Commerce) that they partnered through the Multistakeholder Model of consultation.\nIn 2008, the second annual Cyber Storm Exercise conference was held, involving nine states, four foreign governments, 18 federal agencies and 40 private companies.In 2010, National Cyber Security Alliance\u2019s public awareness campaign was launched in partnership with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Trade Commission, and others.Incentives for ISP: Though the cost of security measures increases, Internet Service Providers (ISP) are encouraged to fight against cybercrime to win consumer support, good reputation and brand image among consumer and peer ISP as well.\n\n\n**** International cooperation ****\nUSA has signed and also ratified Convention on Cybercrime.\nUnited States has actively participated in G8/OECD/APEC/OAS/U.S.-China cooperation in cracking down international cyber crime.\n\n\n**** Future challenges ****\nPrivacy in tracking down cybercrime is being challenged and becomes a controversial issue.\nPublic-private partnership. As the U.S. government gets more involved in the development of IT products, many companies worry this may stifle their innovation, even undermining efforts to develop more secure technology products. New legislative proposals now being considered by the U.S. Congress could be potentially intrusive on private industry, which may prevent enterprises from responding effectively to emerging and changing threats. Cyber attacks and security breaches are increasing in frequency and sophistication, they are targeting organizations and individuals with malware and anonymization techniques that can evade current security controls. Current perimeter-intrusion detection, signature-based malware, and anti-virus solutions are providing little defense. Relatively few organizations have recognized organized cyber criminal networks, rather than hackers, as their greatest potential cyber security threat; even fewer are prepared to address this threat.\n\n\n*** China ***\nIn January 2009, China was ranked No.3 spam-producing country in the world, according to data compiled by security vendor Sophos. Sophos now ranks China as spam producer No.20, right behind Spain.China's underground economy is booming with estimated 10 billion RMB in 2009. Hacking, malware and spam are immensely popular. With patriotic hacktivism, people hack to defend the country.\n\n\n**** Legal and regulatory measures ****\nCriminal Law \u2013 the basic law identifies the law enforcement concerning cybercrime.\nIn 2000, the Decision on Internet Security of the Standing Committee of the NPC was passed.\nIn 2000, China issued a series of Internet rules that prohibit anyone to propagate pornography, virus and scams.\nIn 2003, China signed UN General Assembly Resolution 57/239 on \u201cCreation of a global culture of cybersecurity\u201d.\nIn 2003, China signed Geneva Declaration of Principles of the World Summit on the Information Society.\nIn 2006, an anti-spam initiative was launched.\nIn July 2006, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), which included China, issued a statement that its members should implement cybercrime and cybersecurity laws \u201cin accordance with their national conditions and by referring to relevant international instruments\u201d.\nIn 2009, ASEAN-China framework agreement on network and information security emergency response were adopted.\nIn 2009, agreement within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on information security was made.\n\n\n**** Technical measures ****\nInternet censorship: China has made it tougher to register new Internet domains and has put on stricter content control to help reduce spam.\"Golden Shield Project\" or \"The Great Firewall of China\": a national Internet control and censorship project.\nIn 2009, Green Dam software: It restricts access to a secret list of sites, and monitors users\u2019activity.Operating system change: China is trying to get around this by using Linux, though with a lot of technical impediments to solve.\n\n\n**** Industry collaboration ****\nInternet Society of China \u2014 the group behind China's anti-spam effort \u2014 is working on standards and better ways of cooperating to fight cybercrime.\nISPs have become better at working with customers to cut down on the spam problem.\n\n\n**** International cooperation ****\nIn 2005, China signed up for the London Action Plan on spam, an international effort to curb the problem.\nAnti-Spam \u201cBeijing Declaration\u201d2006 International Anti-Spam Summit was held.\nThe APEC Working Group on Telecommunications agreed an action plan for 2010\u20132015 that included \u201cfostering a safe and trusted ICT environment\u201d.\nIn January 2011, the United States and China committed for the first time at head of state level to work together on a bilateral basis on issues of cybersecurity. \"Fighting Spam to Build Trust\" will be the first effort to help overcome the trust deficit between China and the United States on cybersecurity. Cyber Security China Summit 2011 will be held in Shanghai.\n\n\n**** Achievement and future challenges ****\nSuccessfully cracking down spam volume in 2009. However, insufficient criminal laws and regulations are great impediments in fighting cybercrime. A lack of electronic evidence laws or regulations, low rank of existing internet control regulations and technological impediments altogether limit the efficiency of Chinese governments' law enforcement.\nQ: What is the main purpose of cyberterrorism, and what are its primary methods?",

Though cybercrime encompasses a broad range of illegal activities, it can be generally divided into five categories:\n\n\n*** Intrusive Offenses ***\nIllegal Access:  \u201cHacking\u201d is one of the major forms of offenses that refers to unlawful access to a computer system.\nData Espionage: Offenders can intercept communications between users (such as e-mails) by targeting communication infrastructure such as fixed lines or wireless, and any Internet service (e.g., e-mail servers, chat or VoIP communications).\nData Interference: Offenders can violate the integrity of data and interfere with them by deleting, suppressing, or altering data and restricting access to them.\n\n\n*** Content-related offenses ***\nPornographic Material (Child-Pornography): Sexually related content was among the first content to be commercially distributed over the Internet.\nRacism, Hate Speech, Glorification of Violence: Radical groups use mass communication systems such as the Internet to spread propaganda.\nReligious Offenses: A growing number of websites present material that is in some countries covered by provisions related to religious offenses, e.g., anti-religious written statements.\nSpam: Offenders send out bulk mails by unidentified source and the mail server often contains useless advertisements and pictures.\n\n\n*** Copyright and trademark-related offenses ***\nCommon copyright offenses: cyber copyright infringement of software, music or films.\nTrademark violations: A well-known aspect of global trade. The most serious offenses include phishing and domain or name-related offenses, such as cybersquatting.\n\n\n*** Computer-related offenses ***\nFraud: online auction fraud, advance fee fraud, credit card fraud, Internet banking\nForgery: manipulation of digital documents.\nIdentity theft: It refers to stealing private information including Social Security Numbers (SSN), passport numbers, Date of birth, addresses, phone numbers, and passwords for non-financial and financial accounts.\n\n\n*** Combination offenses ***\nCyberterrorism: The main purposes of it are propaganda, information gathering, preparation of real-world attacks, publication of training material, communication, terrorist financing and attacks against critical infrastructure.\nCyberwarfare: It describes the use of ICTs in conducting warfare using the Internet.\nCyberlaundering: Conducting crime through the use of virtual currencies, online casinos etc.\n\n== Threats ==\nSimilar to conventional crime, economic benefits, power, revenge, adventure, ideology and lust are the core driving forces of cybercrime. Major threats caused by those motivations can be categorized as following:\nEconomic security, reputation and social trust are severely challenged by cyber fraud, counterfeiting, impersonation and concealment of identity, extortion, electronic money laundering, copyright infringement and tax evasion.\nPublic interest and national security is threatened by dissemination of offensive material \u2014e.g., pornographic, defamatory or inflammatory/intrusive communication\u2014 cyber stalking/harassment, Child pornography and paedophilia, electronic vandalism/terrorism.\nPrivacy, domestic and even diplomatic information security are harmed by unauthorized access and misuse of ICT, denial of services, and illegal interception of communication.Domestic, as well as international security are threatened by cybercrime due to its transnational characteristic. No single country can really handle this big issue on their own. It is imperative for us to collaborate and defend cybercrime on a global scale.\n\n== International trends ==\nAs more and more criminals are aware of potentially large economic gains that can be achieved with cybercrime, they tend to switch from simple adventure and vandalism to more targeted attacks, especially platforms where valuable information highly concentrates, such as computer, mobile devices and the Cloud. There are several emerging international trends of cybercrime.\n\nPlatform switch: Cybercrime is switching its battle ground from Windows-system PCs to other platforms, including mobile phones, tablet computers, and VoIP. Because a significant threshold in vulnerabilities has been reached. PC vendors are building better security into their products by providing faster updates, patches and user alert to potential flaws. Besides, global mobile devices\u2019 penetration\u2014from smart phones to tablet PCs\u2014accessing the Internet by 2013 will surpass 1 billion, creating more opportunities for cybercrime. The massively successful banking Trojan, Zeus is already being adapted for the mobile platform. Smishing, or SMS phishing, is another method cyber criminals are using to exploit mobile devices, which users download after falling prey to a social engineering ploy, is designed to defeat the SMS-based two-factor authentication most banks use to confirm online funds transfers by customers. VoIP systems are being used to support vishing (telephone-based phishing) schemes, which are now growing in popularity.\nSocial engineering scams: It refers to a non-technical kind of intrusion, in the form of e-mails or social networking chats, that relies heavily on human interaction and often involves fooling potential victims into downloading malware or leaking personal data. Social engineering is nevertheless highly effective for attacking well-protected computer systems with the exploitation of trust. Social networking becomes an increasingly important tool for cyber criminals to recruit money mules to assist their money laundering operations around the globe. Spammers are not only spoofing social networking messages to persuade targets to click on links in emails \u2014 they are taking advantage of users\u2019 trust of their social networking connections to attract new victims.\nHighly targeted: The newest twist in \"hypertargeting\" is malware that is meant to disrupt industrial systems \u2014 such as the Stuxnet network worm, which exploits zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft. The first known copy of the worm was discovered in a plant in Germany. A subsequent variant led to a widespread global outbreak.\nDissemination and use of malware: malware generally takes the form of a virus, a worm, a Trojan horse, or spyware. In 2009, the majority of malware connects to host Web sites registered in the U.S.A. (51.4%), with China second (17.2%), and Spain third (15.7%). A primary means of malware dissemination is email. It is truly international in scope.\nIntellectual property theft (IP theft): It is estimated that 90% of the software, DVDs, and CDs sold in some countries are counterfeit, and that the total global trade in counterfeit goods is more than $600 billion a year. In the USA alone, IP theft costs businesses an estimated $250 billion annually, and 750,000 jobs.\n\n== International legislative responses and cooperation ==\n\n\n*** International responses ***\nG8\nGroup of Eight (G8) is made up of the heads of eight industrialized countries: the U.S., the United Kingdom, Russia, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, and Canada.\nIn 1997, G8 released a Ministers' Communiqu\u00e9 that includes an action plan and principles to combat cybercrime and protect data and systems from unauthorized impairment. G8 also mandates that all law enforcement personnel must be trained and equipped to address cybercrime, and designates all member countries to have a point of contact on a 24 hours a day/7 days a week basis.United Nations\nIn 1990 the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution dealing with computer crime legislation.\nIn 2000 the UN GA adopted a resolution on combating the criminal misuse of information technology.\nIn 2002 the UN GA adopted a second resolution on the criminal misuse of information technology.ITU\nThe International Telecommunication Union (ITU), as a specialized agency within the United Nations, plays a leading role in the standardization and development of telecommunications and cybersecurity issues. The ITU was the lead agency of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS).\nIn 2003, Geneva Declaration of Principles and the Geneva Plan of Action were released, which highlights the importance of measures in the fight against cybercrime.\nIn 2005, the Tunis Commitment and the Tunis Agenda were adopted for the Information Society.\nCouncil of Europe\nCouncil of Europe is an international organisation focusing on the development of human rights and democracy in its 47 European member states.\nIn 2001, the Convention on Cybercrime, the first international convention aimed at Internet criminal behaviors, was co-drafted by the Council of Europe with the addition of USA, Canada, and Japan and signed by its 46 member states. But only 25 countries ratified later. [8] It aims at providing the basis of an effective legal framework for fighting cybercrime, through harmonization of cybercriminal offenses qualification, provision for laws empowering law enforcement and enabling international cooperation.\n\n\n*** Regional responses ***\nAPEC\nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is an international forum that seeks to promote promoting open trade and practical economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region.\nIn 2002, APEC issued Cybersecurity Strategy which is included in the Shanghai Declaration. The strategy outlined six areas for co-operation among member economies including legal developments, information sharing and co-operation, security and technical guidelines, public awareness, and training and education.\nOECD\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an international economic organisation of 34 countries founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade.\nIn 1990, the Information, Computer and Communications Policy (ICCP) Committee created an Expert Group to develop a set of guidelines for information security that was drafted until 1992 and then adopted by the OECD Council. In 2002, OECD announced the completion of \"Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks: Towards a Culture of Security\".\nEuropean Union\n\nIn 2001, the European Commission published a communication titled \"Creating a Safer Information Society by Improving the Security of Information Infrastructures and Combating Computer-related Crime\".\nIn 2002, EU presented a proposal for a \u201cFramework Decision on Attacks against Information Systems\u201d. The Framework Decision takes note of Convention on Cybercrime, but concentrates on the harmonisation of substantive criminal law provisions that are designed to protect infrastructure elements.\nCommonwealth\nIn 2002, the Commonwealth of Nations presented a model law on cybercrime that provides a legal framework to harmonise legislation within the Commonwealth and enable international cooperation. The model law was intentionally drafted in accordance with the Convention on Cybercrime.ECOWAS\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is a regional group of west African Countries founded in 1975 it has fifteen member states. In 2009, ECOWAS adopted the Directive on Fighting Cybercrime in ECOWAS that provides a legal framework for the member states, which includes substantive criminal law as well as procedural law.GCC\nIn 2007, the Arab League and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) recommended at a conference seeking a joint approach that takes into consideration international standards.\n\n\n*** Voluntary industry response ***\nDuring the past few years, public-private partnerships have emerged as a promising approach for tackling cybersecurity issues around the globe. Executive branch agencies (e.g., the Federal Trade Commission in US), regulatory agencies (e.g., Australian Communications and Media Authority), separate agencies (e.g., ENISA in the EU) and industry (e.g., MAAWG, \u2026) are all involved in partnership.\nIn 2004, the London Action Plan was founded, which aims at promoting international spam enforcement cooperation and address spam related problems, such as online fraud and deception, phishing, and dissemination of viruses.\n\n== Case analysis ==\n\n\n*** U.S. ***\nAccording to Sophos, the U.S. remains the top-spamming country and the source of about one-fifth of the world's spam. Cross-border cyber-exfiltration operations are in tension with international legal norms, so U.S. law enforcement efforts to collect foreign cyber evidence raises complex jurisdictional questions. Since fighting cybercrime involves great amount of sophisticated legal and other measures, only milestones rather than full texts are provided here.\n\n\n**** Legal and regulatory measures ****\nThe first federal computer crime statute was the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984 (CFAA).\nIn 1986, Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) was an amendment to the federal wiretap law.\n\u201cNational Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996\u201d.\n\u201cCyberspace Electronic Security Act of 1999\u201d.\n\u201cPatriot Act of 2001\u201d.\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) was enacted in 1998.\nCyber Security Enhancement Act (CSEA) was passed in 2002.\nCan-spam law issued in 2003 and subsequent implementation measures were made by FCC and FTC.In 2005 the USA passed the Anti-Phishing Act which added two new crimes to the US Code.In 2009, the Obama Administration released Cybersecurity Report and policy.\nCybersecurity Act of 2010, a bill seeking to increase collaboration between the public and the private sector on cybersecurity issues.A number of agencies have been set up in the U.S. to fight against cybercrime, including the FBI, National Infrastructure Protection Center, National White Collar Crime Center, Internet Fraud Complaint Center, Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Department of Justice (DoJ), Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Unit of the DoJ, and Computer Emergency Readiness Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) at Carnegie-Mellon, and so on.CyberSafe is a public service project designed to educate end users of the Internet about the critical need for personal computer security.\n\n\n**** Technical measures ****\nCloud computing: It can make infrastructures more resilient to attacks and functions as data backup as well. However, as the Cloud concentrates more and more sensitive data, it becomes increasingly attractive to cybercriminals.\nBetter encryption methods are developed to deal with phishing, smishing and other illegal data interception activities.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation has set up special technical units and developed Carnivore, a computer surveillance system which can intercept all packets that are sent to and from the ISP where it is installed, to assist in the investigation of cybercrime.\n\n\n**** Industry collaboration ****\nPublic-private partnership: in 2006, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) signed an agreement with the United States Department of Commerce (United States Department of Commerce) that they partnered through the Multistakeholder Model of consultation.\nIn 2008, the second annual Cyber Storm Exercise conference was held, involving nine states, four foreign governments, 18 federal agencies and 40 private companies.In 2010, National Cyber Security Alliance\u2019s public awareness campaign was launched in partnership with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Trade Commission, and others.Incentives for ISP: Though the cost of security measures increases, Internet Service Providers (ISP) are encouraged to fight against cybercrime to win consumer support, good reputation and brand image among consumer and peer ISP as well.\n\n\n**** International cooperation ****\nUSA has signed and also ratified Convention on Cybercrime.\nUnited States has actively participated in G8/OECD/APEC/OAS/U.S.-China cooperation in cracking down international cyber crime.\n\n\n**** Future challenges ****\nPrivacy in tracking down cybercrime is being challenged and becomes a controversial issue.\nPublic-private partnership. As the U.S. government gets more involved in the development of IT products, many companies worry this may stifle their innovation, even undermining efforts to develop more secure technology products. New legislative proposals now being considered by the U.S. Congress could be potentially intrusive on private industry, which may prevent enterprises from responding effectively to emerging and changing threats. Cyber attacks and security breaches are increasing in frequency and sophistication, they are targeting organizations and individuals with malware and anonymization techniques that can evade current security controls. Current perimeter-intrusion detection, signature-based malware, and anti-virus solutions are providing little defense. Relatively few organizations have recognized organized cyber criminal networks, rather than hackers, as their greatest potential cyber security threat; even fewer are prepared to address this threat.\n\n\n*** China ***\nIn January 2009, China was ranked No.3 spam-producing country in the world, according to data compiled by security vendor Sophos. Sophos now ranks China as spam producer No.20, right behind Spain.China's underground economy is booming with estimated 10 billion RMB in 2009. Hacking, malware and spam are immensely popular. With patriotic hacktivism, people hack to defend the country.\n\n\n**** Legal and regulatory measures ****\nCriminal Law \u2013 the basic law identifies the law enforcement concerning cybercrime.\nIn 2000, the Decision on Internet Security of the Standing Committee of the NPC was passed.\nIn 2000, China issued a series of Internet rules that prohibit anyone to propagate pornography, virus and scams.\nIn 2003, China signed UN General Assembly Resolution 57/239 on \u201cCreation of a global culture of cybersecurity\u201d.\nIn 2003, China signed Geneva Declaration of Principles of the World Summit on the Information Society.\nIn 2006, an anti-spam initiative was launched.\nIn July 2006, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), which included China, issued a statement that its members should implement cybercrime and cybersecurity laws \u201cin accordance with their national conditions and by referring to relevant international instruments\u201d.\nIn 2009, ASEAN-China framework agreement on network and information security emergency response were adopted.\nIn 2009, agreement within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on information security was made.\n\n\n**** Technical measures ****\nInternet censorship: China has made it tougher to register new Internet domains and has put on stricter content control to help reduce spam.\"Golden Shield Project\" or \"The Great Firewall of China\": a national Internet control and censorship project.\nIn 2009, Green Dam software: It restricts access to a secret list of sites, and monitors users\u2019activity.Operating system change: China is trying to get around this by using Linux, though with a lot of technical impediments to solve.\n\n\n**** Industry collaboration ****\nInternet Society of China \u2014 the group behind China's anti-spam effort \u2014 is working on standards and better ways of cooperating to fight cybercrime.\nISPs have become better at working with customers to cut down on the spam problem.\n\n\n**** International cooperation ****\nIn 2005, China signed up for the London Action Plan on spam, an international effort to curb the problem.\nAnti-Spam \u201cBeijing Declaration\u201d2006 International Anti-Spam Summit was held.\nThe APEC Working Group on Telecommunications agreed an action plan for 2010\u20132015 that included \u201cfostering a safe and trusted ICT environment\u201d.\nIn January 2011, the United States and China committed for the first time at head of state level to work together on a bilateral basis on issues of cybersecurity. \"Fighting Spam to Build Trust\" will be the first effort to help overcome the trust deficit between China and the United States on cybersecurity. Cyber Security China Summit 2011 will be held in Shanghai.\n\n\n**** Achievement and future challenges ****\nSuccessfully cracking down spam volume in 2009. However, insufficient criminal laws and regulations are great impediments in fighting cybercrime. A lack of electronic evidence laws or regulations, low rank of existing internet control regulations and technological impediments altogether limit the efficiency of Chinese governments' law enforcement."

    "instruction": "Context: 3-subset meet-in-the-middle attack\n\n==Introduction==\nThe 3-subset meet-in-the-middle (hereafter shortened MITM) attack is a variant of the generic meet-in-the-middle attack, which is used in cryptology for hash and block cipher cryptanalysis. The 3-subset variant opens up the possibility to apply MITM attacks on ciphers, where it is not trivial to divide the keybits into two independent key-spaces, as required by the MITM attack.\nThe 3-subset variant relaxes the restriction for the key-spaces to be independent, by moving the intersecting parts of the keyspaces into a subset, which contains the keybits common between the two key-spaces.\n\n\n\n== Procedure ==\nAs with general MITM attacks, the attack is split into two phases: A key-reducing phase and a key-verification phase. In the first phase, the domain of key-candidates is reduced, by applying the MITM attack. In the second phase, the found key-candidates are tested on another plain-/ciphertext pair to filter away the wrong key(s).\n\n\n*** Key-reducing phase ***\nIn the key-reducing phase, the attacked cipher is split into two subciphers, \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        g\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle g}\n  , with each their independent keybits, as is normal with MITM attacks. Instead of having to conform to the limitation that the keybits of the two subciphers should be independent, the 3-subset attack allows for splitting the cipher into two subciphers, where some of the bits are allowed to be used in both of the subciphers.\nThis is done by splitting the key into three subsets instead, namely:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A_{0}}\n\n== Example ==\nThe following example is based on the attack done by Rechberger and Bogdanov on the KTANTAN cipher-family. The naming-conventions used in their paper is also used for this example. The attack reduces the computational complexity of KTANTAN32 to \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            75.170\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{75.170}}\n  , down from \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            80\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{80}}\n   if compared with a bruteforce attack.

The same goes for KTANTAN48 and KTANTAN64, which complexities can be seen at the end of the example.\nThe attack is possible, due to weaknesses exploited in KTANTAN's bit-wise key-schedule. It is applicable to both KTANTAN32, KTANTAN48 and KTANTAN64, since all the variations uses the same key-schedule. It is not applicable to the related KANTAN family of block-ciphers, due to the variations in the key-schedule between KTANTAN and KANTAN.\n\n\n*** Overview of KTANTAN ***\nKTANTAN is a lightweight block-cipher, meant for constrained platforms such as RFID tags, where a cryptographic primitive such as AES, would be either impossible (given the hardware) or too expensive to implement. It was invented by Canniere, Dunkelman and Knezevic in 2009. It takes a block size of either 32, 48 or 64 bits, and encrypts it using an 80-bit key over 254 rounds. Each round utilizes two bits of the key (selected by the key schedule) as round key.\n\n\n*** Attack ***\n\n\n**** Preparation ****\nIn preparation to the attack, weaknesses in the key schedule of KTANTAN that allows the 3-subset MITM attack was identified. \nSince only two key-bits are used each round, the diffusion of the key per round is small - the safety lies in the number of rounds. Due to this structure of the key-schedule, it was possible to find a large number of consecutive rounds, which never utilized certain key-bits.\nMore precisely, the authors of the attack found that:\n\nRound 1 to 111 never uses the key-bits: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          k\n          \n            32\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            39\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            44\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            61\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            66\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            75\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k_{32},k_{39},k_{44},k_{61},k_{66},k_{75}}\n  \nRound 131 to 254 never uses the key-bits: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          k\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            20\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            41\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            47\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            63\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            74\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k_{3},k_{20},k_{41},k_{47},k_{63},k_{74}}\n  This characteristics of the key-schedule is used for staging the 3-subset MITM attack, as we now are able to split the cipher into two blocks with independent key-bits.

The attack reduces the computational complexity of KTANTAN32 to \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            75.170\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{75.170}}\n  , down from \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            80\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{80}}\n   if compared with a bruteforce attack.

The same goes for KTANTAN48 and KTANTAN64, which complexities can be seen at the end of the example.\nThe attack is possible, due to weaknesses exploited in KTANTAN's bit-wise key-schedule. It is applicable to both KTANTAN32, KTANTAN48 and KTANTAN64, since all the variations uses the same key-schedule. It is not applicable to the related KANTAN family of block-ciphers, due to the variations in the key-schedule between KTANTAN and KANTAN.\n\n\n*** Overview of KTANTAN ***\nKTANTAN is a lightweight block-cipher, meant for constrained platforms such as RFID tags, where a cryptographic primitive such as AES, would be either impossible (given the hardware) or too expensive to implement. It was invented by Canniere, Dunkelman and Knezevic in 2009. It takes a block size of either 32, 48 or 64 bits, and encrypts it using an 80-bit key over 254 rounds. Each round utilizes two bits of the key (selected by the key schedule) as round key.\n\n\n*** Attack ***\n\n\n**** Preparation ****\nIn preparation to the attack, weaknesses in the key schedule of KTANTAN that allows the 3-subset MITM attack was identified. \nSince only two key-bits are used each round, the diffusion of the key per round is small - the safety lies in the number of rounds. Due to this structure of the key-schedule, it was possible to find a large number of consecutive rounds, which never utilized certain key-bits.\nMore precisely, the authors of the attack found that:\n\nRound 1 to 111 never uses the key-bits: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          k\n          \n            32\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            39\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            44\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            61\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            66\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            75\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k_{32},k_{39},k_{44},k_{61},k_{66},k_{75}}\n  \nRound 131 to 254 never uses the key-bits: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          k\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            20\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            41\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            47\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            63\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          k\n          \n            74\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k_{3},k_{20},k_{41},k_{47},k_{63},k_{74}}\n  This characteristics of the key-schedule is used for staging the 3-subset MITM attack, as we now are able to split the cipher into two blocks with independent key-bits.

    "instruction": "Spamdexing\n\n==Introduction==\nSpamdexing (also known as search engine spam, search engine poisoning, black-hat search engine optimization, search spam or web spam) is the deliberate manipulation of search engine indexes. It involves a number of methods, such as link building and repeating unrelated phrases, to manipulate the relevance or prominence of resources indexed in a manner inconsistent with the purpose of the indexing system.Spamdexing could be considered to be a part of search engine optimization, although there are many SEO methods that improve the quality and appearance of the content of web sites and serve content useful to many users.\n\n== Overview ==\nSearch engines use a variety of algorithms to determine relevancy ranking. Some of these include determining whether the search term appears in the body text or URL of a web page. Many search engines check for instances of spamdexing and will remove suspect pages from their indexes. Also, search-engine operators can quickly block the results listing from entire websites that use spamdexing, perhaps in response to user complaints of false matches. The rise of spamdexing in the mid-1990s made the leading search engines of the time less useful. Using unethical methods to make websites rank higher in search engine results than they otherwise would is commonly referred to in the SEO (search engine optimization) industry as \"black-hat SEO\". These methods are more focused on breaking the search-engine-promotion rules and guidelines. In addition to this, the perpetrators run the risk of their websites being severely penalized by the Google Panda and Google Penguin search-results ranking algorithms.Common spamdexing techniques can be classified into two broad classes: content spam (or term spam) and link spam.\n\n== Content spam ==\nThese techniques involve altering the logical view that a search engine has over the page's contents. They all aim at variants of the vector space model for information retrieval on text collections.\n\n\n*** Keyword stuffing ***\nKeyword stuffing involves the calculated placement of keywords within a page to raise the keyword count, variety, and density of the page. This is useful to make a page appear to be relevant for a web crawler in a way that makes it more likely to be found. Example: A promoter of a Ponzi scheme wants to attract web surfers to a site where he advertises his scam. He places hidden text appropriate for a fan page of a popular music group on his page, hoping that the page will be listed as a fan site and receive many visits from music lovers. Older versions of indexing programs simply counted how often a keyword appeared, and used that to determine relevance levels. Most modern search engines have the ability to analyze a page for keyword stuffing and determine whether the frequency is consistent with other sites created specifically to attract search engine traffic. Also, large webpages are truncated, so that massive dictionary lists cannot be indexed on a single webpage. (However, spammers can circumvent this webpage-size limitation merely by setting up multiple webpages, either independently or linked to each other.)\n\n\n*** Hidden or invisible text ***\nUnrelated hidden text is disguised by making it the same color as the background, using a tiny font size, or hiding it within HTML code such as \"no frame\" sections, alt attributes, zero-sized DIVs, and \"no script\" sections. People manually screening red-flagged websites for a search-engine company might temporarily or permanently block an entire website for having invisible text on some of its pages. However, hidden text is not always spamdexing: it can also be used to enhance accessibility.\n\n\n*** Meta-tag stuffing ***\nThis involves repeating keywords in the meta tags, and using meta keywords that are unrelated to the site's content. This tactic has been ineffective since 2005.\n\n\n*** Doorway pages ***\n\"Gateway\" or doorway pages are low-quality web pages created with very little content, which are instead stuffed with very similar keywords and phrases. They are designed to rank highly within the search results, but serve no purpose to visitors looking for information. A doorway page will generally have \"click here to enter\" on the page; autoforwarding can also be used for this purpose. In 2006, Google ousted vehicle manufacturer BMW for using \"doorway pages\" to the company's German site, BMW.de.\n\n\n*** Scraper sites ***\nScraper sites are created using various programs designed to \"scrape\" search-engine results pages or other sources of content and create \"content\" for a website. The specific presentation of content on these sites is unique, but is merely an amalgamation of content taken from other sources, often without permission. Such websites are generally full of advertising (such as pay-per-click ads), or they redirect the user to other sites. It is even feasible for scraper sites to outrank original websites for their own information and organization names.\n\n\n*** Article spinning ***\nArticle spinning involves rewriting existing articles, as opposed to merely scraping content from other sites, to avoid penalties imposed by search engines for duplicate content. This process is undertaken by hired writers or automated using a thesaurus database or a neural network.\n\n\n*** Machine translation ***\nSimilarly to article spinning, some sites use machine translation to render their content in several languages, with no human editing, resulting in unintelligible texts that nonetheless continue to be indexed by search engines, thereby attracting traffic.\n\n== Link spam ==\nLink spam is defined as links between pages that are present for reasons\nother than merit. Link spam takes advantage of link-based ranking algorithms, which gives websites higher rankings the more other highly ranked websites link to it. These techniques also aim at influencing other link-based ranking techniques such as the HITS algorithm.\n\n\n*** Link farms ***\n\nLink farms are tightly-knit networks of websites that link to each other for the sole purpose of exploiting the search engine ranking algorithms. These are also known facetiously as mutual admiration societies. Use of links farms has greatly reduced with the launch of Google's first Panda Update in February 2011, which introduced significant improvements in its spam-detection algorithm.\n\n\n*** Private blog networks ***\nBlog networks (PBNs) are a group of authoritative websites used as a source of contextual links that point to the owner's main website to achieve higher search engine ranking. Owners of PBN websites use expired domains or auction domains that have backlinks from high-authority websites. Google targeted and penalized PBN users on several occasions with several massive deindexing campaigns since 2014.\n\n\n*** Hidden links ***\nPutting hyperlinks where visitors will not see them is used to increase link popularity. Highlighted link text can help rank a webpage higher for matching that phrase.\n\n\n*** Sybil attack ***\nA Sybil attack is the forging of multiple identities for malicious intent, named after the famous dissociative identity disorder patient and the book about her that shares her name, \"Sybil\". A spammer may create multiple web sites at different domain names that all link to each other, such as fake blogs (known as spam blogs).\n\n\n*** Spam blogs ***\n\nSpam blogs are blogs created solely for commercial promotion and the passage of link authority to target sites. Often these \"splogs\" are designed in a misleading manner that will give the effect of a legitimate website but upon close inspection will often be written using spinning software or be very poorly written with barely readable content. They are similar in nature to link farms.\n\n\n*** Guest blog spam ***\nGuest blog spam is the process of placing guest blogs on websites for the sole purpose of gaining a link to another website or websites. Unfortunately, these are often confused with legitimate forms of guest blogging with other motives than placing links. This technique was made famous by Matt Cutts, who publicly declared \"war\" against this form of link spam.\n\n\n*** Buying expired domains ***\n\nSome link spammers utilize expired domain crawler software or monitor DNS records for domains that will expire soon, then buy them when they expire and replace the pages with links to their pages. However, it is possible but not confirmed that Google resets the link data on expired domains. To maintain all previous Google ranking data for the domain, it is advisable that a buyer grab the domain before it is \"dropped\".\nSome of these techniques may be applied for creating a Google bomb\u2014that is, to cooperate with other users to boost the ranking of a particular page for a particular query.\n\n\n*** Using world-writable pages ***\n\nWeb sites that can be edited by users can be used by spamdexers to insert links to spam sites if the appropriate anti-spam measures are not taken.\nAutomated spambots can rapidly make the user-editable portion of a site unusable.\nProgrammers have developed a variety of automated spam prevention techniques to block or at least slow down spambots.\n\n\n**** Spam in blogs ****\n\nSpam in blogs is the placing or solicitation of links randomly on other sites, placing a desired keyword into the hyperlinked text of the inbound link. Guest books, forums, blogs, and any site that accepts visitors' comments are particular targets and are often victims of drive-by spamming where automated software creates nonsense posts with links that are usually irrelevant and unwanted.\n\n\n**** Comment spam ****\nComment spam is a form of link spam that has arisen in web pages that allow dynamic user editing such as wikis, blogs, and guestbooks. It can be problematic because agents can be written that automatically randomly select a user edited web page, such as a Wikipedia article, and add spamming links.\n\n\n**** Wiki spam ****\n\nWiki spam is when a spammer uses the open editability of wiki systems to place links from the wiki site to the spam site.\n\n\n**** Referrer log spamming ****\nReferrer spam takes place when a spam perpetrator or facilitator accesses a web page (the referee), by following a link from another web page (the referrer), so that the referee is given the address of the referrer by the person's Internet browser. Some websites have a referrer log which shows which pages link to that site. By having a robot randomly access many sites enough times, with a message or specific address given as the referrer, that message or Internet address then appears in the referrer log of those sites that have referrer logs. Since some Web search engines base the importance of sites on the number of different sites linking to them, referrer-log spam may increase the search engine rankings of the spammer's sites.  Also, site administrators who notice the referrer log entries in their logs may follow the link back to the spammer's referrer page.\n\n\n**** Countermeasures ****\nBecause of the large amount of spam posted to user-editable webpages, Google proposed a \"nofollow\" tag that could be embedded with links. A link-based search engine, such as Google's PageRank system, will not use the link to increase the score of the linked website if the link carries a nofollow tag. This ensures that spamming links to user-editable websites will not raise the sites ranking with search engines. Nofollow is used by several major websites, including Wordpress, Blogger and Wikipedia.\n\n== Other types ==\n\n\n*** Mirror websites ***\nA mirror site is the hosting of multiple websites with conceptually similar content but using different URLs. Some search engines give a higher rank to results where the keyword searched for appears in the URL.\n\n\n*** URL redirection ***\nURL redirection is the taking of the user to another page without his or her intervention, e.g., using META refresh tags, Flash,  JavaScript, Java or Server side redirects. However, 301 Redirect, or permanent redirect, is not considered as a malicious behavior.\n\n\n*** Cloaking ***\nCloaking refers to any of several means to serve a page to the search-engine spider that is different from that seen by human users. It can be an attempt to mislead search engines regarding the content on a particular web site. Cloaking, however, can also be used to ethically increase accessibility of a site to users with disabilities or provide human users with content that search engines aren't able to process or parse. It is also used to deliver content based on a user's location; Google itself uses IP delivery, a form of cloaking, to deliver results. Another form of cloaking is code swapping, i.e., optimizing a page for top ranking and then swapping another page in its place once a top ranking is achieved. Google refers to these type of redirects as Sneaky Redirects.\n\n== Countermeasures ==\n\n\n*** Page omission by search engine ***\nSpamdexed pages are sometimes eliminated from search results by the search engine.\n\n\n*** Page omission by user ***\nUsers can employ search operators for filtering. For Google, a keyword preceded by \"-\" (minus) will omit sites that contains the keyword in their pages or in the URL of the pages from search result. As an example, the search \"-<unwanted site>\" will eliminate sites that contains word \"<unwanted site>\" in their pages and the pages whose URL contains \"<unwanted site>\".\nUsers could also use the Google Chrome extension \"Personal Blocklist (by Google)\", launched by Google in 2011 as part of countermeasures against content farming. Via the extension, users could block a specific page, or set of pages from appearing in their search results. As of 2021, the original extension appears to be removed, although similar-functioning extensions may be used.\nPossible solutions to overcome search-redirection poisoning redirecting to illegal internet pharmacies include notification of operators of vulnerable legitimate domains. Further, manual evaluation of SERPs, previously published link-based and content-based algorithms as well as tailor-made automatic detection and classification engines can be used as benchmarks in the effective identification of pharma scam campaigns.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question.

Link spam takes advantage of link-based ranking algorithms, which gives websites higher rankings the more other highly ranked websites link to it. These techniques also aim at influencing other link-based ranking techniques such as the HITS algorithm.\n\n\n*** Link farms ***\n\nLink farms are tightly-knit networks of websites that link to each other for the sole purpose of exploiting the search engine ranking algorithms. These are also known facetiously as mutual admiration societies. Use of links farms has greatly reduced with the launch of Google's first Panda Update in February 2011, which introduced significant improvements in its spam-detection algorithm.\n\n\n*** Private blog networks ***\nBlog networks (PBNs) are a group of authoritative websites used as a source of contextual links that point to the owner's main website to achieve higher search engine ranking. Owners of PBN websites use expired domains or auction domains that have backlinks from high-authority websites. Google targeted and penalized PBN users on several occasions with several massive deindexing campaigns since 2014.\n\n\n*** Hidden links ***\nPutting hyperlinks where visitors will not see them is used to increase link popularity. Highlighted link text can help rank a webpage higher for matching that phrase.\n\n\n*** Sybil attack ***\nA Sybil attack is the forging of multiple identities for malicious intent, named after the famous dissociative identity disorder patient and the book about her that shares her name, \"Sybil\". A spammer may create multiple web sites at different domain names that all link to each other, such as fake blogs (known as spam blogs).\n\n\n*** Spam blogs ***\n\nSpam blogs are blogs created solely for commercial promotion and the passage of link authority to target sites. Often these \"splogs\" are designed in a misleading manner that will give the effect of a legitimate website but upon close inspection will often be written using spinning software or be very poorly written with barely readable content. They are similar in nature to link farms.\n\n\n*** Guest blog spam ***\nGuest blog spam is the process of placing guest blogs on websites for the sole purpose of gaining a link to another website or websites. Unfortunately, these are often confused with legitimate forms of guest blogging with other motives than placing links. This technique was made famous by Matt Cutts, who publicly declared \"war\" against this form of link spam.\n\n\n*** Buying expired domains ***\n\nSome link spammers utilize expired domain crawler software or monitor DNS records for domains that will expire soon, then buy them when they expire and replace the pages with links to their pages. However, it is possible but not confirmed that Google resets the link data on expired domains. To maintain all previous Google ranking data for the domain, it is advisable that a buyer grab the domain before it is \"dropped\".\nSome of these techniques may be applied for creating a Google bomb\u2014that is, to cooperate with other users to boost the ranking of a particular page for a particular query.\n\n\n*** Using world-writable pages ***\n\nWeb sites that can be edited by users can be used by spamdexers to insert links to spam sites if the appropriate anti-spam measures are not taken.\nAutomated spambots can rapidly make the user-editable portion of a site unusable.\nProgrammers have developed a variety of automated spam prevention techniques to block or at least slow down spambots.\n\n\n**** Spam in blogs ****\n\nSpam in blogs is the placing or solicitation of links randomly on other sites, placing a desired keyword into the hyperlinked text of the inbound link. Guest books, forums, blogs, and any site that accepts visitors' comments are particular targets and are often victims of drive-by spamming where automated software creates nonsense posts with links that are usually irrelevant and unwanted.\n\n\n**** Comment spam ****\nComment spam is a form of link spam that has arisen in web pages that allow dynamic user editing such as wikis, blogs, and guestbooks. It can be problematic because agents can be written that automatically randomly select a user edited web page, such as a Wikipedia article, and add spamming links.\n\n\n**** Wiki spam ****\n\nWiki spam is when a spammer uses the open editability of wiki systems to place links from the wiki site to the spam site.\n\n\n**** Referrer log spamming ****\nReferrer spam takes place when a spam perpetrator or facilitator accesses a web page (the referee), by following a link from another web page (the referrer), so that the referee is given the address of the referrer by the person's Internet browser. Some websites have a referrer log which shows which pages link to that site. By having a robot randomly access many sites enough times, with a message or specific address given as the referrer, that message or Internet address then appears in the referrer log of those sites that have referrer logs. Since some Web search engines base the importance of sites on the number of different sites linking to them, referrer-log spam may increase the search engine rankings of the spammer's sites.  Also, site administrators who notice the referrer log entries in their logs may follow the link back to the spammer's referrer page.\n\n\n**** Countermeasures ****\nBecause of the large amount of spam posted to user-editable webpages, Google proposed a \"nofollow\" tag that could be embedded with links. A link-based search engine, such as Google's PageRank system, will not use the link to increase the score of the linked website if the link carries a nofollow tag. This ensures that spamming links to user-editable websites will not raise the sites ranking with search engines. Nofollow is used by several major websites, including Wordpress, Blogger and Wikipedia.\n\n== Other types ==\n\n\n*** Mirror websites ***\nA mirror site is the hosting of multiple websites with conceptually similar content but using different URLs. Some search engines give a higher rank to results where the keyword searched for appears in the URL.\n\n\n*** URL redirection ***\nURL redirection is the taking of the user to another page without his or her intervention, e.g., using META refresh tags, Flash,  JavaScript, Java or Server side redirects. However, 301 Redirect, or permanent redirect, is not considered as a malicious behavior.\n\n\n*** Cloaking ***\nCloaking refers to any of several means to serve a page to the search-engine spider that is different from that seen by human users. It can be an attempt to mislead search engines regarding the content on a particular web site. Cloaking, however, can also be used to ethically increase accessibility of a site to users with disabilities or provide human users with content that search engines aren't able to process or parse. It is also used to deliver content based on a user's location; Google itself uses IP delivery, a form of cloaking, to deliver results. Another form of cloaking is code swapping, i.e., optimizing a page for top ranking and then swapping another page in its place once a top ranking is achieved. Google refers to these type of redirects as Sneaky Redirects.\n\n== Countermeasures ==\n\n\n*** Page omission by search engine ***\nSpamdexed pages are sometimes eliminated from search results by the search engine.\n\n\n*** Page omission by user ***\nUsers can employ search operators for filtering. For Google, a keyword preceded by \"-\" (minus) will omit sites that contains the keyword in their pages or in the URL of the pages from search result. As an example, the search \"-<unwanted site>\" will eliminate sites that contains word \"<unwanted site>\" in their pages and the pages whose URL contains \"<unwanted site>\".\nUsers could also use the Google Chrome extension \"Personal Blocklist (by Google)\", launched by Google in 2011 as part of countermeasures against content farming. Via the extension, users could block a specific page, or set of pages from appearing in their search results. As of 2021, the original extension appears to be removed, although similar-functioning extensions may be used.\nPossible solutions to overcome search-redirection poisoning redirecting to illegal internet pharmacies include notification of operators of vulnerable legitimate domains. Further, manual evaluation of SERPs, previously published link-based and content-based algorithms as well as tailor-made automatic detection and classification engines can be used as benchmarks in the effective identification of pharma scam campaigns."

    "instruction": "International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance\n\n==Introduction==\nThe International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance (also called the \"Necessary and Proportionate Principles\" or just \"the Principles\") is a document which attempts to \"clarify how international human rights law applies in the current digital environment\".\nCommunications surveillance (that is to say, mass surveillance of communications) conflicts with a number of international human rights, mainly that of privacy. As a result, communications surveillance may only occur when prescribed by law necessary to achieve legitimate aim, and proportionate to the aim used.The document consists of 13 principles developed to provide society groups, industry, governments, and others with a framework to assess whether current and proposed surveillance laws or statutes conflict with International Human Rights law.\n\n== Political Support Prior to the Publication of the Principles ==\nThe initial release followed a report from the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Opinion in April 2013, which highlights the widespread practice of states surveying communications, stating that such surveillance severely undermines citizens' ability to enjoy a private life, freely express themselves and enjoy their other fundamental human rights.In July 2013 the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, emphasized the importance of applying human right standards and democratic safeguards to surveillance and law enforcement activities:\"While concerns about national security and criminal activity may justify the exceptional and narrowly-tailored use of surveillance programmes, surveillance without adequate safeguards to protect the right to privacy actually risk impacting negatively on the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\"\n\n== Purpose ==\nThe purpose of the principles was to provide civil society groups, states, the courts, legislative and regulatory bodies, industry and others with a framework to evaluate whether current or proposed surveillance laws comply with International Human Rights.The concern was that key protections to privacy had been eroded away with technological advancements, therefore needed robust support in some areas to raise international human rights to the standards which had developed in the pre-digital age.\n\n== The Principles ==\nThe following is a summary of the document containing the principles. All below is source from the actual document itself, except where noted.\n\n\n*** Preamble ***\nThe preamble of the document recognizes that Communications Surveillance interferes with the Right to privacy, therefore can only be used when it is prescribed by law, necessary to achieve a legitimate aim, and proportionate to the aim pursued. The view of the document is that existing human rights law has not kept up with the progression of technology. The preamble states that the threat to these rights combined with the increase in popularity of using communications content and metadata that states are not placing \"sufficient restrictions on how they can be subsequently used by States\".\n\n\n*** Scope of Application ***\nTo get the correct scope and purpose of application for the document, it is required to be read and interpreted as part of a larger framework rather than as individual principles.\nApplication of this document is to apply both within states and extra territorially, regardless of purpose.\nIt is to apply for protection of the individual from the state, and also states there is an obligation of states to protect individuals from non-state actors.The document states that unless the principles are applied this way, a State conducting Communications Surveillance may not meet International Human Rights obligations. The principles are stated to \"articulate the duties and obligations of States when engaging in Communications Surveillance\".\n\n\n*** Changing Definitions and Technology ***\nThis section of the document is dedicated to the interpretation of certain terms found throughout the document, and highlighting that some of the legal definitions used may not have effectively kept pace with technological change, and require reiteration. \nThe principles state that the because of the increased ability of communications surveillance, the existing legal framework which currently distinguishes between 'content' and 'non-content' is no longer appropriate, and protection from all types of surveillance should be given a higher legal priority.\n\n\n*** The Principles ***\n\n\n**** Legality ****\nAny limitation imposed on an International Human Rights must be prescribed by law. Sufficient notice should be given if a proposed law is going to limit one of these rights. The law should be clear, and given periodic review to ensure it remains effective given the speed of technological development.\n\n\n**** Legitimate Aim ****\nCommunications surveillance should only be used by permitted state authorities where necessary in a democratic society. Any situation where discrimination arises should not be used.\n\n\n**** Necessity ****\nSurveillance laws should be limited to those which are necessary to achieve a legitimate aim, or where there are multiple means but Communications Surveillance is the least intrusive method on International Human Rights. The onus of establishing necessity should remain with the state\n\n\n**** Adequacy ****\nAny communications surveillance authorized by law must be appropriate for the legitimate aim it is fulfilling.\n\n\n**** Proportionality ****\nCommunications Surveillance is regarded as a highly intrusive act, and therefore must consider the sensitivity and severity of the situation. The state should establish the following prior to conducting communications surveillance:\n\nThere is a high chance of serious crime or specific threat\nThere is a high degree of probability that relevant evidence will be obtained.\nOther less invasive techniques have been exhausted, such that communications surveillance is the least intrusive method\nInformation collected will be confined to only which is relevant\nExcess information obtained will be returned or destroyed\nThe information accesses will be used by the specific authority for the purpose the authority was given\nThe requested authority to use communications surveillance does not undermine the purpose of the right to privacy or other fundamental freedoms.\n\n\n**** Competent Judicial Authority ****\nThe authority determining the validity of the communications surveillance must be independent of those conducting the surveillance, and be competent when making these decisions.\n\n\n**** Due Process ****\nThat everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by a competent judicial authority. Due process can be used interchangeably with \"procedural fairness\" and \"natural justice\"\n\n\n**** User Notification ****\nThose subjects of Communication Surveillance should be given the opportunity to challenge the decision when a decision authorizing Surveillance has been issued. The materials presented in support of the application should be available for those subjects. Delay in notification is acceptable where notification would frustrate the purpose of communication surveillance and authorization is granted by a competent judicial authority.\n\n\n**** Transparency ****\nInformation about use and amount of Communication Surveillance should be available to those who request it. States should provide the requestor with information sufficient to ascertain the nature of the request and determine the size of both the request and those who will be affected by it. Records of requests for communications surveyed should also be published.\n\n\n**** Public Oversight ****\nStates should establish an independent position to oversee the use of Communications Surveillance and to ensure transparency and accountability. The person(s) in this position would have sufficient authority to access all potentially relevant information, to assess whether the State is making legitimate use of its lawful capabilities, to evaluate whether the State has met its transparency obligations, and to make public determinations as to the lawfulness of those actions. The document in this instance makes reference to the United Kingdom's Interception of Communications Commissioner as an example of such an independent oversight mechanism.\n\n\n**** Integrity of communication and systems ****\nStates should not require those service providers or software/hardware vendors to build surveillance/monitoring capability into their systems. People have a right to express themselves anonymously.\n\n\n**** Safeguards for International Cooperation ****\nWhere a state has entered into a mutual legal assistance treaty(MLAT) or other multi-jurisdictional agreement where more than one legal jurisdiction overlaps, the laws that apply are those which have the higher level of protection for the individual. MLAT's should also be transparent, publicly available and subject to guarantees of procedural fairness\n\n\n**** Safeguards against illegitimate access and right to effective remedy ****\nCommunications surveillance by third parties should be prohibited with sufficient penalties. Protection for whistle-blowers should be enacted. Any information obtained by means not consistent with these principles should be inadmissible as evidence. Once information collected by communications surveillance has been used for the purpose for which it was collected it should be promptly destroyed or returned.\n\n== Response ==\nIn October 2013, The Principles were promoted in a brief filed before the President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies. They claim that \"In a world of ever more complex technology, it is increasingly unclear whether the distinction between \"meta-data\" and other information carries much weight.\"The Center for Democracy and Technology released a report noting overlap between the Principles and a December 9, 2013 proposal by tech groups such as AOL, Apple, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter, and Yahoo!.Now, the principles have over 400 organizations from across the world supporting the principles along with over 40 Experts, Academics and prominent individuals from over 17 countries, and 6 elected officials or political parties from 5 countries.The principles are now being used as model for reform of surveillance law and policy around the world and to provide a benchmark for measuring whether a State's surveillance practices comply with International Human Rights Law.\n\nQ: What is the principle of Transparency in the document on International Principles on the Application of Human Rights to Communications Surveillance?",

    "instruction": "Zip bomb\n\n==Introduction==\nIn computing, a zip bomb, also known as a decompression bomb or zip of death, is a malicious archive file designed to crash or render useless the program  or system reading it. It is often employed to disable antivirus software, in order to create an opening for more traditional malware.A zip bomb allows a program to function normally, but, instead of hijacking the program's operation, creates an archive that requires an excessive amount of time, disk space, or memory to unpack.Most modern antivirus programs can detect whether a file is a zip bomb in order to avoid unpacking it.\n\n== Details and use ==\nA zip bomb is usually a small file for ease of transport and to avoid suspicion. However, when the file is unpacked, its contents are more than the system can handle.\nOne example of a zip bomb is the file 42.zip, which is a zip file consisting of 42 kilobytes of compressed data, containing five layers of nested zip files in sets of 16, each bottom-layer archive containing a 4.3-gigabyte (4294967295 bytes; 4 GiB \u2212 1 B) file for a total of 4.5 petabytes (4503599626321920 bytes; 4 PiB \u2212 1 MiB) of uncompressed data. This zip bomb is freely available for download online. In many anti-virus scanners, only a few layers of recursion are performed on archives to help prevent attacks that would cause a buffer overflow, an out-of-memory condition, or exceed an acceptable amount of program execution time.\nZip bombs often rely on repetition of identical files to achieve their extreme compression ratios. Dynamic programming methods can be employed to limit traversal of such files, so that only one file is followed recursively at each level, effectively converting their exponential growth to linear.\nThere are also zip files that, when uncompressed, yield identical copies of themselves. A sophisticated form of zip bomb exploits the specifications of zip files and the Deflate compression algorithm to create bombs without the use of nested layers as used in 42.zip.\n\nQ: How do sophisticated zip bombs exploit the specifications of zip files and the Deflate compression algorithm?",

      "context": "Zip bomb\n\n==Introduction==\nIn computing, a zip bomb, also known as a decompression bomb or zip of death, is a malicious archive file designed to crash or render useless the program  or system reading it. It is often employed to disable antivirus software, in order to create an opening for more traditional malware.A zip bomb allows a program to function normally, but, instead of hijacking the program's operation, creates an archive that requires an excessive amount of time, disk space, or memory to unpack.Most modern antivirus programs can detect whether a file is a zip bomb in order to avoid unpacking it.\n\n== Details and use ==\nA zip bomb is usually a small file for ease of transport and to avoid suspicion. However, when the file is unpacked, its contents are more than the system can handle.\nOne example of a zip bomb is the file 42.zip, which is a zip file consisting of 42 kilobytes of compressed data, containing five layers of nested zip files in sets of 16, each bottom-layer archive containing a 4.3-gigabyte (4294967295 bytes; 4 GiB \u2212 1 B) file for a total of 4.5 petabytes (4503599626321920 bytes; 4 PiB \u2212 1 MiB) of uncompressed data. This zip bomb is freely available for download online. In many anti-virus scanners, only a few layers of recursion are performed on archives to help prevent attacks that would cause a buffer overflow, an out-of-memory condition, or exceed an acceptable amount of program execution time.\nZip bombs often rely on repetition of identical files to achieve their extreme compression ratios. Dynamic programming methods can be employed to limit traversal of such files, so that only one file is followed recursively at each level, effectively converting their exponential growth to linear.\nThere are also zip files that, when uncompressed, yield identical copies of themselves. A sophisticated form of zip bomb exploits the specifications of zip files and the Deflate compression algorithm to create bombs without the use of nested layers as used in 42.zip."

    "instruction": "Punchscan\n\n==Introduction==\nPunchscan is an optical scan vote counting system invented by cryptographer David Chaum. Punchscan is designed to offer integrity, privacy, and transparency. The system is voter-verifiable, provides an end-to-end (E2E) audit mechanism, and issues a ballot receipt to each voter. The system won grand prize at the 2007 University Voting Systems Competition.\nThe computer software which Punchscan incorporates is open-source; the source code was released on 2 November 2006 under a revised BSD licence. However, Punchscan is software independent; it draws its security from cryptographic functions instead of relying on software security like DRE voting machines. For this reason, Punchscan can be run on closed source operating systems, like Microsoft Windows, and still maintain unconditional integrity.\nThe Punchscan team, with additional contributors, has since developed Scantegrity.\n\n== Voting procedure ==\n\nA Punchscan ballot has two layers of paper. On the top layer, the candidates are listed with a symbol or letter beside their name. Below the candidate list, there are a series of round holes in the top layer of the ballot. Inside the holes on the bottom layer, the corresponding symbols are printed.\nTo cast a vote for a candidate, the voter must locate the hole with the symbol corresponding to the symbol beside the candidate's name. This hole is marked with a Bingo-style ink dauber, which is purposely larger than the hole. The voter then separates the ballot, chooses either the top or the bottom layer to keep as a receipt, and shreds the other layer. The receipt is scanned at the polling station for tabulation.\nThe order of the symbols beside the candidate names is generated randomly for each ballot, and thus differs from ballot to ballot. Likewise for the order of the symbols in the holes. For this reason, the receipt does not contain enough information to determine which candidate the vote was cast for. If the top layer is kept, the order of the symbols through the holes is unknown. If the bottom layer is kept, the order of the symbols beside the candidates name is unknown. Therefore, the voter cannot prove to someone else how they voted, which prevents vote buying or voter intimidation.\n\n== Tabulation procedure ==\nAs an example, consider a two candidate election between Coke and Pepsi, as illustrated in the preceding diagram. The order of the letters beside the candidates' names could be A and then B, or B and then A. We will call this ordering \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          P\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P_{1}}\n  , and let \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          P\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P_{1}}\n\n== Basic auditing procedures ==\nThe voter's ballot receipt does not indicate which candidate the voter cast their ballot for, and therefore it is not secret information. After an election, the election authority will post an image of each receipt online. The voter can look up their ballot by typing in the serial number and they can check that information held by the election authority matches their ballot. This way, the voter can be confident that their ballot was cast as intended.\nAny voter or interested party can also inspect part of the database to ensure the results were calculated correctly. They cannot inspect the whole database, otherwise they could link votes to ballot serial numbers. However, half of the database can be safely inspected without breaking privacy. A random choice is made between opening \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        \n          D\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          D\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          D\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{D_{1},D_{2},D_{3}\\}}\n   or \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        \n          D\n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          D\n          \n            4\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \n          D\n          \n            5\n          \n        \n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{D_{3},D_{4},D_{5}\\}}\n   (this choice can be derived from the secret key or from a true random source, such as dice or the stock market). This procedure allows the voter to be confident that the set of all ballots were counted as cast.\nIf all ballots are counted as cast and cast as intended, then all ballots are counted as intended. Therefore, the integrity of the election can be proven to a very high probability.\n\n== Additional security ==\nTo further increase the integrity of a Punchscan election, several further steps can be taken to protect against a completely corrupt election authority.\n\n\n*** Multiple databases ***\nSince \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          D\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D_{1}}\n  , \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          D\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D_{2}}\n  , and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          D\n          \n            5\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D_{5}}\n   in the database are all generated pseudorandomly, multiple databases can be created with different random values for these columns. Each database is independent of the others, allowing the first half of some of the databases to be opened and inspected and the second half of others. Each database must produce the same final tally. Thus if an election authority were to tamper with the database to skew the final tally, they would have to tamper with each of the databases. The probability of the tampering being uncovered in the audit increases with the number of independent databases.\n\n\n*** Commitments ***\nPrior to an election, the election authority prints the ballots and creates the database(s). Part of this creation process involves committing to the unique information contained on each ballot and in the databases. This is accomplished by applying a cryptographic one-way function to the information. Though the result of this function, the commitment, is made public, the actual information being committed to remains sealed. Because the function is one-way, it is computationally infeasible to determine the information on the sealed ballot given only its publicly posted commitment.\n\n\n*** Ballot inspection ***\nPrior to an election, twice as many ballots are produced as the number intended to use in the election. Half of these ballots are selected randomly (or each candidate could choose a fraction of the ballots) and opened. The rows in the database corresponding to these selected ballots can be checked to ensure the calculations are correct and not tampered with. Since the election authority does not know a priori which ballots will be selected, passing this audit means the database is well formed with a very high probability. Furthermore, the ballots can be checked against their commitments to ensure with high probability that the ballot commitments are correct.\n\nBased on the above text, answer a question.

    "instruction": "Information security\n\n==Introduction==\nInformation security, sometimes shortened to InfoSec, is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. It is part of information risk management. It typically involves preventing or reducing the probability of unauthorized/inappropriate access to data, or the unlawful use, disclosure, disruption, deletion, corruption, modification, inspection, recording, or devaluation of information. It also involves actions intended to reduce the adverse impacts of such incidents. Protected information may take any form, e.g. electronic or physical, tangible (e.g. paperwork) or intangible (e.g. knowledge). Information security's primary focus is the balanced protection of the data confidentiality, data integrity, and data availability of data (also known as the CIA triad) while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation, all without hampering organization productivity. This is largely achieved through a structured risk management process that involves: \n\nidentifying information and related assets, plus potential threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts;\nevaluating the risks\ndeciding how to address or treat the risks i.e. to avoid, mitigate, share or accept them\nwhere risk mitigation is required, selecting or designing appropriate security controls and implementing them\nmonitoring the activities, making adjustments as necessary to address any issues, changes and improvement opportunitiesTo standardize this discipline, academics and professionals collaborate to offer guidance, policies, and industry standards on password, antivirus software, firewall, encryption software, legal liability, security awareness and training, and so forth. This standardization may be further driven by a wide variety of laws and regulations that affect how data is accessed, processed, stored, transferred and destroyed. However, the implementation of any standards and guidance within an entity may have limited effect if a culture of continual improvement is not adopted.\n\n\n\n== Definition ==\n\nVarious definitions of information security are suggested below, summarized from different sources:\n\n\"Preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Note: In addition, other properties, such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability can also be involved.\" (ISO/IEC 27000:2009)\n\"The protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\" (CNSS, 2010)\n\"Ensures that only authorized users (confidentiality) have access to accurate and complete information (integrity) when required (availability).\" (ISACA, 2008)\n\"Information Security is the process of protecting the intellectual property of an organisation.\"  (Pipkin, 2000)\n\"...information security is a risk management discipline, whose job is to manage the cost of information risk to the business.\" (McDermott and Geer, 2001)\n\"A well-informed sense of assurance that information risks and controls are in balance.\" (Anderson, J., 2003)\n\"Information security is the protection of information and minimizes the risk of exposing information to unauthorized parties.\" (Venter and Eloff, 2003)\n\"Information Security is a multidisciplinary area of study and professional activity which is concerned with the development and implementation of security mechanisms of all available types (technical, organizational, human-oriented and legal) in order to keep information in all its locations (within and outside the organization's perimeter) and, consequently, information systems, where information is created, processed, stored, transmitted and destroyed, free from threats. Threats to information and information systems may be categorized and a corresponding security goal may be defined for each category of threats. A set of security goals, identified as a result of a threat analysis, should be revised periodically to ensure its adequacy and conformance with the evolving environment. The currently relevant set of security goals may include: confidentiality, integrity, availability, privacy, authenticity & trustworthiness, non-repudiation, accountability and auditability.\" (Cherdantseva and Hilton, 2013)\nInformation and information resource security using telecommunication system or devices means protecting information, information systems or books from unauthorized access, damage, theft, or destruction (Kurose and Ross, 2010).\n\n== Overview ==\nAt the core of information security is information assurance, the act of maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information, ensuring that information is not compromised in any way when critical issues arise. These issues include but are not limited to natural disasters, computer/server malfunction, and physical theft. While paper-based business operations are still prevalent, requiring their own set of information security practices, enterprise digital initiatives are increasingly being emphasized, with information assurance now typically being dealt with by information technology (IT) security specialists. These specialists apply information security to technology (most often some form of computer system). It is worthwhile to note that a computer does not necessarily mean a home desktop. A computer is any device with a processor and some memory. Such devices can range from non-networked standalone devices as simple as calculators, to networked mobile computing devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. IT security specialists are almost always found in any major enterprise/establishment due to the nature and value of the data within larger businesses. They are responsible for keeping all of the technology within the company secure from malicious cyber attacks that often attempt to acquire critical private information or gain control of the internal systems.The field of information security has grown and evolved significantly in recent years. It offers many areas for specialization, including securing networks and allied infrastructure, securing applications and databases, security testing, information systems auditing, business continuity planning, electronic record discovery, and digital forensics. Information security professionals are very stable in their employment. As of 2013 more than 80 percent of professionals had no change in employer or employment over a period of a year, and the number of professionals is projected to continuously grow more than 11 percent annually from 2014 to 2019.\n\n\n*** Threats ***\nInformation security threats come in many different forms. Some of the most common threats today are software attacks, theft of intellectual property, theft of identity, theft of equipment or information, sabotage, and information extortion. Viruses, worms, phishing attacks, and Trojan horses are a few common examples of software attacks. The theft of intellectual property has also been an extensive issue for many businesses in the information technology (IT) field. Identity theft is the attempt to act as someone else usually to obtain that person's personal information or to take advantage of their access to vital information through social engineering. Theft of equipment or information is becoming more prevalent today due to the fact that most devices today are mobile, are prone to theft and have also become far more desirable as the amount of data capacity increases. Sabotage usually consists of the destruction of an organization's website in an attempt to cause loss of confidence on the part of its customers. Information extortion consists of theft of a company's property or information as an attempt to receive a payment in exchange for returning the information or property back to its owner, as with ransomware. There are many ways to help protect yourself from some of these attacks but one of the most functional precautions is conduct periodical user awareness. The number one threat to any organisation are users or internal employees, they are also called insider threats.Governments, military, corporations, financial institutions, hospitals, non-profit organisations, and private businesses amass a great deal of confidential information about their employees, customers, products, research, and financial status. Should confidential information about a business's customers or finances or new product line fall into the hands of a competitor or a black hat hacker, a business and its customers could suffer widespread, irreparable financial loss, as well as damage to the company's reputation. From a business perspective, information security must be balanced against cost; the Gordon-Loeb Model provides a mathematical economic approach for addressing this concern.For the individual, information security has a significant effect on privacy, which is viewed very differently in various cultures.\n\n\n**** Responses to threats ****\nPossible responses to a security threat or risk are:\nreduce/mitigate \u2013 implement safeguards and countermeasures to eliminate vulnerabilities or block threats\nassign/transfer \u2013 place the cost of the threat onto another entity or organization such as purchasing insurance or outsourcing\naccept \u2013 evaluate if the cost of the countermeasure outweighs the possible cost of loss due to the threat\n\n== Basic principles ==\n\n\n*** Key concepts ***\n\nThe CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability is at the heart of information security. (The members of the classic InfoSec triad\u2014confidentiality, integrity, and availability\u2014are interchangeably referred to in the literature as security attributes, properties, security goals, fundamental aspects, information criteria, critical information characteristics and basic building blocks.) However, debate continues about whether or not this CIA triad is sufficient to address rapidly changing technology and business requirements, with recommendations to consider expanding on the intersections between availability and confidentiality, as well as the relationship between security and privacy. Other principles such as \"accountability\" have sometimes been proposed; it has been pointed out that issues such as non-repudiation do not fit well within the three core concepts.The triad seems to have first been mentioned in a NIST publication in 1977.In 1992 and revised in 2002, the OECD's Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks proposed the nine generally accepted principles: awareness, responsibility, response, ethics, democracy, risk assessment, security design and implementation, security management, and reassessment. Building upon those, in 2004 the NIST's Engineering Principles for Information Technology Security proposed 33 principles. From each of these derived guidelines and practices.\nIn 1998, Donn Parker proposed an alternative model for the classic CIA triad that he called the six atomic elements of information. The elements are confidentiality, possession, integrity, authenticity, availability, and utility. The merits of the Parkerian Hexad are a subject of debate amongst security professionals.In 2011, The Open Group published the information security management standard O-ISM3. This standard proposed an operational definition of the key concepts of security, with elements called \"security objectives\", related to access control (9), availability (3), data quality (1), compliance, and technical (4). In 2009, DoD Software Protection Initiative Archived 2016-09-25 at the Wayback Machine released the Three Tenets of Cybersecurity Archived 2020-05-10 at the Wayback Machine which are System Susceptibility, Access to the Flaw, and Capability to Exploit the Flaw. Neither of these models are widely adopted.\n\n\n**** Confidentiality ****\nIn information security, confidentiality \"is the property, that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.\" While similar to \"privacy,\" the two words are not interchangeable. Rather, confidentiality is a component of privacy that implements to protect our data from unauthorized viewers. Examples of confidentiality of electronic data being compromised include laptop theft, password theft, or sensitive emails being sent to the incorrect individuals.\n\n\n**** Integrity ****\nIn IT security, data integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle. This means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner. This is not the same thing as referential integrity in databases, although it can be viewed as a special case of consistency as understood in the classic ACID model of transaction processing. Information security systems typically incorporate controls to ensure their own integrity, in particular protecting the kernel or core functions against both deliberate and accidental threats. Multi-purpose and multi-user computer systems aim to compartmentalize the data and processing such that no user or process can adversely impact another: the controls may not succeed however, as we see in incidents such as malware infections, hacks, data theft, fraud, and privacy breaches.More broadly, integrity is an information security principle that involves human/social, process, and commercial integrity, as well as data integrity. As such it touches on aspects such as credibility, consistency, truthfulness, completeness, accuracy, timeliness, and assurance.\n\n\n**** Availability ****\nFor any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be available when it is needed. This means the computing systems used to store and process the information, the security controls used to protect it, and the communication channels used to access it must be functioning correctly. High availability systems aim to remain available at all times, preventing service disruptions due to power outages, hardware failures, and system upgrades. Ensuring availability also involves preventing denial-of-service attacks, such as a flood of incoming messages to the target system, essentially forcing it to shut down.In the realm of information security, availability can often be viewed as one of the most important parts of a successful information security program. Ultimately end-users need to be able to perform job functions; by ensuring availability an organization is able to perform to the standards that an organization's stakeholders expect. This can involve topics such as proxy configurations, outside web access, the ability to access shared drives and the ability to send emails. Executives oftentimes do not understand the technical side of information security and look at availability as an easy fix, but this often requires collaboration from many different organizational teams, such as network operations, development operations, incident response, and policy/change management. A successful information security team involves many different key roles to mesh and align for the CIA triad to be provided effectively.\n\n\n**** Non-repudiation ****\nIn law, non-repudiation implies one's intention to fulfill their obligations to a contract. It also implies that one party of a transaction cannot deny having received a transaction, nor can the other party deny having sent a transaction.It is important to note that while technology such as cryptographic systems can assist in non-repudiation efforts, the concept is at its core a legal concept transcending the realm of technology. It is not, for instance, sufficient to show that the message matches a digital signature signed with the sender's private key, and thus only the sender could have sent the message, and nobody else could have altered it in transit (data integrity). The alleged sender could in return demonstrate that the digital signature algorithm is vulnerable or flawed, or allege or prove that his signing key has been compromised. The fault for these violations may or may not lie with the sender, and such assertions may or may not relieve the sender of liability, but the assertion would invalidate the claim that the signature necessarily proves authenticity and integrity. As such, the sender may repudiate the message (because authenticity and integrity are pre-requisites for non-repudiation).\n\n== Risk management ==\n\nBroadly speaking, risk is the likelihood that something bad will happen that causes harm to an informational asset (or the loss of the asset). A vulnerability is a weakness that could be used to endanger or cause harm to an informational asset. A threat is anything (man-made or act of nature) that has the potential to cause harm. The likelihood that a threat will use a vulnerability to cause harm creates a risk. When a threat does use a vulnerability to inflict harm, it has an impact. In the context of information security, the impact is a loss of availability, integrity, and confidentiality, and possibly other losses (lost income, loss of life, loss of real property).The Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) Review Manual 2006 defines risk management as \"the process of identifying vulnerabilities and threats to the information resources used by an organization in achieving business objectives, and deciding what countermeasures, if any, to take in reducing risk to an acceptable level, based on the value of the information resource to the organization.\"There are two things in this definition that may need some clarification. First, the process of risk management is an ongoing, iterative process. It must be repeated indefinitely. The business environment is constantly changing and new threats and vulnerabilities emerge every day. Second, the choice of countermeasures (controls) used to manage risks must strike a balance between productivity, cost, effectiveness of the countermeasure, and the value of the informational asset being protected. Furthermore, these processes have limitations as security breaches are generally rare and emerge in a specific context which may not be easily duplicated. Thus, any process and countermeasure should itself be evaluated for vulnerabilities. It is not possible to identify all risks, nor is it possible to eliminate all risk. The remaining risk is called \"residual risk.\"\nA risk assessment is carried out by a team of people who have knowledge of specific areas of the business. Membership of the team may vary over time as different parts of the business are assessed. The assessment may use a subjective qualitative analysis based on informed opinion, or where reliable dollar figures and historical information is available, the analysis may use quantitative analysis.\nResearch has shown that the most vulnerable point in most information systems is the human user, operator, designer, or other human. The ISO/IEC 27002:2005 Code of practice for information security management recommends the following be examined during a risk assessment:\n\nsecurity policy,\norganization of information security,\nasset management,\nhuman resources security,\nphysical and environmental security,\ncommunications and operations management,\naccess control,\ninformation systems acquisition, development, and maintenance,\ninformation security incident management,\nbusiness continuity management\nregulatory compliance.In broad terms, the risk management process consists of:\nIdentification of assets and estimating their value. Include: people, buildings, hardware, software, data (electronic, print, other), supplies.\nConduct a threat assessment. Include: Acts of nature, acts of war, accidents, malicious acts originating from inside or outside the organization.\nConduct a vulnerability assessment, and for each vulnerability, calculate the probability that it will be exploited. Evaluate policies, procedures, standards, training, physical security, quality control, technical security.\nCalculate the impact that each threat would have on each asset. Use qualitative analysis or quantitative analysis.\nIdentify, select and implement appropriate controls. Provide a proportional response. Consider productivity, cost effectiveness, and value of the asset.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of the control measures. Ensure the controls provide the required cost effective protection without discernible loss of productivity.For any given risk, management can choose to accept the risk based upon the relative low value of the asset, the relative low frequency of occurrence, and the relative low impact on the business. Or, leadership may choose to mitigate the risk by selecting and implementing appropriate control measures to reduce the risk. In some cases, the risk can be transferred to another business by buying insurance or outsourcing to another business. The reality of some risks may be disputed. In such cases leadership may choose to deny the risk.\n\n\n*** Security controls ***\n\nSelecting and implementing proper security controls will initially help an organization bring down risk to acceptable levels. Control selection should follow and should be based on the risk assessment. Controls can vary in nature, but fundamentally they are ways of protecting the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information. ISO/IEC 27001 has defined controls in different areas. Organizations can implement additional controls according to requirement of the organization. ISO/IEC 27002 offers a guideline for organizational information security standards.\n\n\n**** Administrative ****\nAdministrative controls (also called procedural controls) consist of approved written policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines. Administrative controls form the framework for running the business and managing people. They inform people on how the business is to be run and how day-to-day operations are to be conducted. Laws and regulations created by government bodies are also a type of administrative control because they inform the business. Some industry sectors have policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines that must be followed \u2013 the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) required by Visa and MasterCard is such an example. Other examples of administrative controls include the corporate security policy, password policy, hiring policies, and disciplinary policies.Administrative controls form the basis for the selection and implementation of logical and physical controls. Logical and physical controls are manifestations of administrative controls, which are of paramount importance.\n\n\n**** Logical ****\nLogical controls (also called technical controls) use software and data to monitor and control access to information and computing systems. Passwords, network and host-based firewalls, network intrusion detection systems, access control lists, and data encryption are examples of logical controls.An important logical control that is frequently overlooked is the principle of least privilege, which requires that an individual, program or system process not be granted any more access privileges than are necessary to perform the task. A blatant example of the failure to adhere to the principle of least privilege is logging into Windows as user Administrator to read email and surf the web. Violations of this principle can also occur when an individual collects additional access privileges over time. This happens when employees' job duties change, employees are promoted to a new position, or employees are transferred to another department. The access privileges required by their new duties are frequently added onto their already existing access privileges, which may no longer be necessary or appropriate.\n\n\n**** Physical ****\nPhysical controls monitor and control the environment of the work place and computing facilities. They also monitor and control access to and from such facilities and include doors, locks, heating and air conditioning, smoke and fire alarms, fire suppression systems, cameras, barricades, fencing, security guards, cable locks, etc. Separating the network and workplace into functional areas are also physical controls.An important physical control that is frequently overlooked is separation of duties, which ensures that an individual can not complete a critical task by himself. For example, an employee who submits a request for reimbursement should not also be able to authorize payment or print the check. An applications programmer should not also be the server administrator or the database administrator; these roles and responsibilities must be separated from one another.\n\n\n*** Defense in depth ***\n\nInformation security must protect information throughout its lifespan, from the initial creation of the information on through to the final disposal of the information. The information must be protected while in motion and while at rest. During its lifetime, information may pass through many different information processing systems and through many different parts of information processing systems. There are many different ways the information and information systems can be threatened. To fully protect the information during its lifetime, each component of the information processing system must have its own protection mechanisms. The building up, layering on, and overlapping of security measures is called \"defense in depth.\" In contrast to a metal chain, which is famously only as strong as its weakest link, the defense in depth strategy aims at a structure where, should one defensive measure fail, other measures will continue to provide protection.Recall the earlier discussion about administrative controls, logical controls, and physical controls. The three types of controls can be used to form the basis upon which to build a defense in depth strategy. With this approach, defense in depth can be conceptualized as three distinct layers or planes laid one on top of the other. Additional insight into defense in depth can be gained by thinking of it as forming the layers of an onion, with data at the core of the onion, people the next outer layer of the onion, and network security, host-based security, and application security forming the outermost layers of the onion. Both perspectives are equally valid, and each provides valuable insight into the implementation of a good defense in depth strategy.\n\n\n*** Classification ***\nAn important aspect of information security and risk management is recognizing the value of information and defining appropriate procedures and protection requirements for the information. Not all information is equal and so not all information requires the same degree of protection. This requires information to be assigned a security classification. The first step in information classification is to identify a member of senior management as the owner of the particular information to be classified. Next, develop a classification policy. The policy should describe the different classification labels, define the criteria for information to be assigned a particular label, and list the required security controls for each classification.Some factors that influence which classification information should be assigned include how much value that information has to the organization, how old the information is and whether or not the information has become obsolete. Laws and other regulatory requirements are also important considerations when classifying information. The Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) and its Business Model for Information Security also serves as a tool for security professionals to examine security from a systems perspective, creating an environment where security can be managed holistically, allowing actual risks to be addressed.The type of information security classification labels selected and used will depend on the nature of the organization, with examples being:\nIn the business sector, labels such as: Public, Sensitive, Private, Confidential.\nIn the government sector, labels such as: Unclassified, Unofficial, Protected, Confidential, Secret, Top Secret, and their non-English equivalents.\nIn cross-sectoral formations, the Traffic Light Protocol, which consists of: White, Green, Amber, and Red.\nIn the personal sector, one label such as Financial. This includes activities related to managing money, such as online banking.All employees in the organization, as well as business partners, must be trained on the classification schema and understand the required security controls and handling procedures for each classification. The classification of a particular information asset that has been assigned should be reviewed periodically to ensure the classification is still appropriate for the information and to ensure the security controls required by the classification are in place and are followed in their right procedures.\n\n\n*** Access control ***\nAccess to protected information must be restricted to people who are authorized to access the information. The computer programs, and in many cases the computers that process the information, must also be authorized. This requires that mechanisms be in place to control the access to protected information. The sophistication of the access control mechanisms should be in parity with the value of the information being protected; the more sensitive or valuable the information the stronger the control mechanisms need to be. The foundation on which access control mechanisms are built start with identification and authentication.Access control is generally considered in three steps: identification, authentication, and authorization.\n\n\n**** Identification ****\nIdentification is an assertion of who someone is or what something is. If a person makes the statement \"Hello, my name is John Doe\" they are making a claim of who they are. However, their claim may or may not be true. Before John Doe can be granted access to protected information it will be necessary to verify that the person claiming to be John Doe really is John Doe. Typically the claim is in the form of a username. By entering that username you are claiming \"I am the person the username belongs to\".\n\n\n**** Authentication ****\nAuthentication is the act of verifying a claim of identity. When John Doe goes into a bank to make a withdrawal, he tells the bank teller he is John Doe, a claim of identity. The bank teller asks to see a photo ID, so he hands the teller his driver's license. The bank teller checks the license to make sure it has John Doe printed on it and compares the photograph on the license against the person claiming to be John Doe. If the photo and name match the person, then the teller has authenticated that John Doe is who he claimed to be. Similarly, by entering the correct password, the user is providing evidence that he/she is the person the username belongs to.There are three different types of information that can be used for authentication:\nSomething you know: things such as a PIN, a password, or your mother's maiden name\nSomething you have: a driver's license or a magnetic swipe card\nSomething you are: biometrics, including palm prints, fingerprints, voice prints, and retina (eye) scansStrong authentication requires providing more than one type of authentication information (two-factor authentication). The username is the most common form of identification on computer systems today and the password is the most common form of authentication. Usernames and passwords have served their purpose, but they are increasingly inadequate. Usernames and passwords are slowly being replaced or supplemented with more sophisticated authentication mechanisms such as Time-based One-time Password algorithms.\n\n\n**** Authorization ****\nAfter a person, program or computer has successfully been identified and authenticated then it must be determined what informational resources they are permitted to access and what actions they will be allowed to perform (run, view, create, delete, or change). This is called authorization. Authorization to access information and other computing services begins with administrative policies and procedures. The policies prescribe what information and computing services can be accessed, by whom, and under what conditions. The access control mechanisms are then configured to enforce these policies. Different computing systems are equipped with different kinds of access control mechanisms. Some may even offer a choice of different access control mechanisms. The access control mechanism a system offers will be based upon one of three approaches to access control, or it may be derived from a combination of the three approaches.The non-discretionary approach consolidates all access control under a centralized administration. The access to information and other resources is usually based on the individuals function (role) in the organization or the tasks the individual must perform. The discretionary approach gives the creator or owner of the information resource the ability to control access to those resources. In the mandatory access control approach, access is granted or denied basing upon the security classification assigned to the information resource.Examples of common access control mechanisms in use today include role-based access control, available in many advanced database management systems; simple file permissions provided in the UNIX and Windows operating systems; Group Policy Objects provided in Windows network systems; and Kerberos, RADIUS, TACACS, and the simple access lists used in many firewalls and routers.To be effective, policies and other security controls must be enforceable and upheld. Effective policies ensure that people are held accountable for their actions. The U.S. Treasury's guidelines for systems processing sensitive or proprietary information, for example, states that all failed and successful authentication and access attempts must be logged, and all access to information must leave some type of audit trail.Also, the need-to-know principle needs to be in effect when talking about access control. This principle gives access rights to a person to perform their job functions. This principle is used in the government when dealing with difference clearances. Even though two employees in different departments have a top-secret clearance, they must have a need-to-know in order for information to be exchanged. Within the need-to-know principle, network administrators grant the employee the least amount of privilege to prevent employees from accessing more than what they are supposed to. Need-to-know helps to enforce the confidentiality-integrity-availability triad. Need-to-know directly impacts the confidential area of the triad.\n\n\n*** Cryptography ***\n\nInformation security uses cryptography to transform usable information into a form that renders it unusable by anyone other than an authorized user; this process is called encryption. Information that has been encrypted (rendered unusable) can be transformed back into its original usable form by an authorized user who possesses the cryptographic key, through the process of decryption. Cryptography is used in information security to protect information from unauthorized or accidental disclosure while the information is in transit (either electronically or physically) and while information is in storage.Cryptography provides information security with other useful applications as well, including improved authentication methods, message digests, digital signatures, non-repudiation, and encrypted network communications. Older, less secure applications such as Telnet and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) are slowly being replaced with more secure applications such as Secure Shell (SSH) that use encrypted network communications. Wireless communications can be encrypted using protocols such as WPA/WPA2 or the older (and less secure) WEP. Wired communications (such as ITU\u2011T G.hn) are secured using AES for encryption and X.1035 for authentication and key exchange. Software applications such as GnuPG or PGP can be used to encrypt data files and email.Cryptography can introduce security problems when it is not implemented correctly. Cryptographic solutions need to be implemented using industry-accepted solutions that have undergone rigorous peer review by independent experts in cryptography. The length and strength of the encryption key is also an important consideration. A key that is weak or too short will produce weak encryption. The keys used for encryption and decryption must be protected with the same degree of rigor as any other confidential information. They must be protected from unauthorized disclosure and destruction, and they must be available when needed. Public key infrastructure (PKI) solutions address many of the problems that surround key management.\n\n== Process ==\nThe terms \"reasonable and prudent person\", \"due care\", and \"due diligence\" have been used in the fields of finance, securities, and law for many years. In recent years these terms have found their way into the fields of computing and information security. U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines now make it possible to hold corporate officers liable for failing to exercise due care and due diligence in the management of their information systems.In the business world, stockholders, customers, business partners, and governments have the expectation that corporate officers will run the business in accordance with accepted business practices and in compliance with laws and other regulatory requirements. This is often described as the \"reasonable and prudent person\" rule. A prudent person takes due care to ensure that everything necessary is done to operate the business by sound business principles and in a legal, ethical manner. A prudent person is also diligent (mindful, attentive, ongoing) in their due care of the business.\nIn the field of information security, Harris\noffers the following definitions of due care and due diligence:\n\n\"Due care are steps that are taken to show that a company has taken responsibility for the activities that take place within the corporation and has taken the necessary steps to help protect the company, its resources, and employees.\" And, [Due diligence are the] \"continual activities that make sure the protection mechanisms are continually maintained and operational.\"\nAttention should be made to two important points in these definitions. First, in due care, steps are taken to show; this means that the steps can be verified, measured, or even produce tangible artifacts. Second, in due diligence, there are continual activities; this means that people are actually doing things to monitor and maintain the protection mechanisms, and these activities are ongoing.Organizations have a responsibility with practicing duty of care when applying information security. The Duty of Care Risk Analysis Standard (DoCRA) provides principles and practices for evaluating risk. It considers all parties that could be affected by those risks. DoCRA helps evaluate safeguards if they are appropriate in protecting others from harm while presenting a reasonable burden. With increased data breach litigation, companies must balance security controls, compliance, and its mission.\n\n\n*** Security governance ***\n\nThe Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, in a publication titled Governing for Enterprise Security (GES) Implementation Guide, defines characteristics of effective security governance. These include:\nAn enterprise-wide issue\nLeaders are accountable\nViewed as a business requirement\nRisk-based\nRoles, responsibilities, and segregation of duties defined\nAddressed and enforced in policy\nAdequate resources committed\nStaff aware and trained\nA development life cycle requirement\nPlanned, managed, measurable, and measured\nReviewed and audited\n\n\n*** Incident response plans ***\nAn incident response plan (IRP) is a group of policies that dictate an organizations reaction to a cyber attack. Once an security breach has been identified, for example by Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) or Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) (if configured to do so),  the plan is initiated. It is important to note that there can be legal implications to a data breach. Knowing local and federal laws is critical. Every plan is unique to the needs of the organization, and it can involve skill sets that are not part of an IT team. For example, a lawyer may be included in the response plan to help navigate legal implications to a data breach.As mentioned above every plan is unique but most plans will include the following:\n\n\n**** Preparation ****\nGood preparation includes the development of an Incident Response Team (IRT). Skills need to be used by this team would be, penetration testing, computer forensics, network security, etc. This team should also keep track of trends in cybersecurity and modern attack strategies. A training program for end users is important as well as most modern attack strategies target users on the network.\n\n\n**** Identification ****\nThis part of the incident response plan identifies if there was a security event. When an end user reports information or an admin notices irregularities, an investigation is launched. An incident log is a crucial part of this step. All of the members of the team should be updating this log to ensure that information flows as fast as possible. If it has been identified that a security breach has occurred the next step should be activated.\n\n\n**** Containment ****\nIn this phase, the IRT works to isolate the areas that the breach took place to limit the scope of the security event. During this phase it is important to preserve information forensically so it can be analyzed later in the process. Containment could be as simple as physically containing a server room or as complex as segmenting a network to not allow the spread of a virus.\n\n\n**** Eradication ****\nThis is where the threat that was identified is removed from the affected systems. This could include deleting malicious files, terminating compromised accounts, or deleting other components. Some events do not require this step, however it is important to fully understand the event before moving to this step. This will help to ensure that the threat is completely removed.\n\n\n**** Recovery ****\nThis stage is where the systems are restored back to original operation. This stage could include the recovery of data, changing user access information, or updating firewall rules or policies to prevent a breach in the future. Without executing this step, the system could still be vulnerable to future security threats.\n\n\n**** Lessons Learned ****\nIn this step information that has been gathered during this process is used to make future decisions on security. This step is crucial to the ensure that future events are prevented. Using this information to further train admins is critical to the process. This step can also be used to process information that is distributed from other entities who have experienced a security event.\n\n\n*** Change management ***\n\nChange management is a formal process for directing and controlling alterations to the information processing environment. This includes alterations to desktop computers, the network, servers, and software. The objectives of change management are to reduce the risks posed by changes to the information processing environment and improve the stability and reliability of the processing environment as changes are made. It is not the objective of change management to prevent or hinder necessary changes from being implemented.Any change to the information processing environment introduces an element of risk. Even apparently simple changes can have unexpected effects. One of management's many responsibilities is the management of risk. Change management is a tool for managing the risks introduced by changes to the information processing environment. Part of the change management process ensures that changes are not implemented at inopportune times when they may disrupt critical business processes or interfere with other changes being implemented.Not every change needs to be managed. Some kinds of changes are a part of the everyday routine of information processing and adhere to a predefined procedure, which reduces the overall level of risk to the processing environment. Creating a new user account or deploying a new desktop computer are examples of changes that do not generally require change management. However, relocating user file shares, or upgrading the Email server pose a much higher level of risk to the processing environment and are not a normal everyday activity. The critical first steps in change management are (a) defining change (and communicating that definition) and (b) defining the scope of the change system.Change management is usually overseen by a change review board composed of representatives from key business areas, security, networking, systems administrators, database administration, application developers, desktop support, and the help desk. The tasks of the change review board can be facilitated with the use of automated work flow application. The responsibility of the change review board is to ensure the organization's documented change management procedures are followed. The change management process is as follows\nRequest: Anyone can request a change. The person making the change request may or may not be the same person that performs the analysis or implements the change. When a request for change is received, it may undergo a preliminary review to determine if the requested change is compatible with the organizations business model and practices, and to determine the amount of resources needed to implement the change.\nApprove: Management runs the business and controls the allocation of resources therefore, management must approve requests for changes and assign a priority for every change. Management might choose to reject a change request if the change is not compatible with the business model, industry standards or best practices. Management might also choose to reject a change request if the change requires more resources than can be allocated for the change.\nPlan: Planning a change involves discovering the scope and impact of the proposed change; analyzing the complexity of the change; allocation of resources and, developing, testing, and documenting both implementation and back-out plans. Need to define the criteria on which a decision to back out will be made.\nTest: Every change must be tested in a safe test environment, which closely reflects the actual production environment, before the change is applied to the production environment. The backout plan must also be tested.\nSchedule: Part of the change review board's responsibility is to assist in the scheduling of changes by reviewing the proposed implementation date for potential conflicts with other scheduled changes or critical business activities.\nCommunicate: Once a change has been scheduled it must be communicated. The communication is to give others the opportunity to remind the change review board about other changes or critical business activities that might have been overlooked when scheduling the change. The communication also serves to make the help desk and users aware that a change is about to occur. Another responsibility of the change review board is to ensure that scheduled changes have been properly communicated to those who will be affected by the change or otherwise have an interest in the change.\nImplement: At the appointed date and time, the changes must be implemented. Part of the planning process was to develop an implementation plan, testing plan and, a back out plan. If the implementation of the change should fail or, the post implementation testing fails or, other \"drop dead\" criteria have been met, the back out plan should be implemented.\nDocument: All changes must be documented. The documentation includes the initial request for change, its approval, the priority assigned to it, the implementation, testing and back out plans, the results of the change review board critique, the date/time the change was implemented, who implemented it, and whether the change was implemented successfully, failed or postponed.\nPost-change review: The change review board should hold a post-implementation review of changes. It is particularly important to review failed and backed out changes. The review board should try to understand the problems that were encountered, and look for areas for improvement.Change management procedures that are simple to follow and easy to use can greatly reduce the overall risks created when changes are made to the information processing environment. Good change management procedures improve the overall quality and success of changes as they are implemented. This is accomplished through planning, peer review, documentation, and communication.ISO/IEC 20000, The Visible OPS Handbook: Implementing ITIL in 4 Practical and Auditable Steps (Full book summary), and ITIL all provide valuable guidance on implementing an efficient and effective change management program information security.\n\n== Business continuity ==\nBusiness continuity management (BCM) concerns arrangements aiming to protect an organization's critical business functions from interruption due to incidents, or at least minimize the effects. BCM is essential to any organization to keep technology and business in line with current threats to the continuation of business as usual. The BCM should be included in an organizations risk analysis plan to ensure that all of the necessary business functions have what they need to keep going in the event of any type of threat to any business function.It encompasses:\n\nAnalysis of requirements, e.g., identifying critical business functions, dependencies and potential failure points, potential threats and hence incidents or risks of concern to the organization;\nSpecification, e.g., maximum tolerable outage periods; recovery point objectives (maximum acceptable periods of data loss);\nArchitecture and design, e.g., an appropriate combination of approaches including resilience (e.g. engineering IT systems and processes for high availability, avoiding or preventing situations that might interrupt the business), incident and emergency management (e.g., evacuating premises, calling the emergency services, triage/situation assessment and invoking recovery plans), recovery (e.g., rebuilding) and contingency management (generic capabilities to deal positively with whatever occurs using whatever resources are available);\nImplementation, e.g., configuring and scheduling backups, data transfers, etc., duplicating and strengthening critical elements; contracting with service and equipment suppliers;\nTesting, e.g., business continuity exercises of various types, costs and assurance levels;\nManagement, e.g., defining strategies, setting objectives and goals; planning and directing the work; allocating funds, people and other resources; prioritization relative to other activities; team building, leadership, control, motivation and coordination with other business functions and activities (e.g., IT, facilities, human resources, risk management, information risk and security, operations); monitoring the situation, checking and updating the arrangements when things change; maturing the approach through continuous improvement, learning and appropriate investment;\nAssurance, e.g., testing against specified requirements; measuring, analyzing, and reporting key parameters; conducting additional tests, reviews and audits for greater confidence that the arrangements will go to plan if invoked.Whereas BCM takes a broad approach to minimizing disaster-related risks by reducing both the probability and the severity of incidents, a disaster recovery plan (DRP) focuses specifically on resuming business operations as quickly as possible after a disaster. A disaster recovery plan, invoked soon after a disaster occurs, lays out the steps necessary to recover critical information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure. Disaster recovery planning includes establishing a planning group, performing risk assessment, establishing priorities, developing recovery strategies, preparing inventories and documentation of the plan, developing verification criteria and procedure, and lastly implementing the plan.\n\n== Laws and regulations ==\n\nBelow is a partial listing of governmental laws and regulations in various parts of the world that have, had, or will have, a significant effect on data processing and information security. Important industry sector regulations have also been included when they have a significant impact on information security.\nThe UK Data Protection Act 1998 makes new provisions for the regulation of the processing of information relating to individuals, including the obtaining, holding, use or disclosure of such information. The European Union Data Protection Directive (EUDPD) requires that all E.U. members adopt national regulations to standardize the protection of data privacy for citizens throughout the E.U.\nThe Computer Misuse Act 1990 is an Act of the U.K. Parliament making computer crime (e.g., hacking) a criminal offense. The act has become a model upon which several other countries, including Canada and the Republic of Ireland, have drawn inspiration from when subsequently drafting their own information security laws.\nThe E.U.'s Data Retention Directive (annulled) required internet service providers and phone companies to keep data on every electronic message sent and phone call made for between six months and two years.\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232 g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a U.S. Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record.\nThe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's (FFIEC) security guidelines for auditors specifies requirements for online banking security.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 requires the adoption of national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers, health insurance plans, and employers. Additionally, it requires health care providers, insurance providers and employers to safeguard the security and privacy of health data.\nThe Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA), also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, protects the privacy and security of private financial information that financial institutions collect, hold, and process.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) requires publicly traded companies to assess the effectiveness of their internal controls for financial reporting in annual reports they submit at the end of each fiscal year. Chief information officers are responsible for the security, accuracy, and the reliability of the systems that manage and report the financial data. The act also requires publicly traded companies to engage with independent auditors who must attest to, and report on, the validity of their assessments.\nThe Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) establishes comprehensive requirements for enhancing payment account data security. It was developed by the founding payment brands of the PCI Security Standards Council \u2014 including American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB, MasterCard Worldwide, and Visa International \u2014 to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures on a global basis. The PCI DSS is a multifaceted security standard that includes requirements for security management, policies, procedures, network architecture, software design, and other critical protective measures.\nState security breach notification laws (California and many others) require businesses, nonprofits, and state institutions to notify consumers when unencrypted \"personal information\" may have been compromised, lost, or stolen.\nThe Personal Information Protection and Electronics Document Act (PIPEDA) of Canada supports and promotes electronic commerce by protecting personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in certain circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic means to communicate or record information or transactions and by amending the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision Act.\nGreece's Hellenic Authority for Communication Security and Privacy (ADAE) (Law 165/2011) establishes and describes the minimum information security controls that should be deployed by every company which provides electronic communication networks and/or services in Greece in order to protect customers' confidentiality. These include both managerial and technical controls (e.g., log records should be stored for two years).\nGreece's Hellenic Authority for Communication Security and Privacy (ADAE) (Law 205/2013) concentrates around the protection of the integrity and availability of the services and data offered by Greek telecommunication companies. The law forces these and other related companies to build, deploy, and test appropriate business continuity plans and redundant infrastructures.The US Department of Defense (DoD) issued DoD Directive 8570 in 2004, supplemented by DoD Directive 8140, requiring all DoD employees and all DoD contract personnel involved in information assurance roles and activities to earn and maintain various industry Information Technology (IT) certifications in an effort to ensure that all DoD personnel involved in network infrastructure defense have minimum levels of IT industry recognized knowledge, skills and abilities (KSA). Andersson and Reimers (2019) report these certifications range from CompTIA's A+ and Security+ through the ICS2.org's CISSP, etc..\n\n== Culture ==\nDescribing more than simply how security aware employees are, information security culture is the ideas, customs, and social behaviors of an organization that impact information security in both positive and negative ways. Cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness towards information security within an organization. The way employees think and feel about security and the actions they take can have a big impact on information security in organizations. Roer & Petric (2017) identify seven core dimensions of information security culture in organizations:\nAttitudes: Employees' feelings and emotions about the various activities that pertain to the organizational security of information.\nBehaviors: Actual or intended activities and risk-taking actions of employees that have direct or indirect impact on information security.\nCognition: Employees' awareness, verifiable knowledge, and beliefs regarding practices, activities, and self-efficacy relation that are related to information security.\nCommunication: Ways employees communicate with each other, sense of belonging, support for security issues, and incident reporting.\nCompliance: Adherence to organizational security policies, awareness of the existence of such policies and the ability to recall the substance of such policies.\nNorms: Perceptions of security-related organizational conduct and practices that are informally deemed either normal or deviant by employees and their peers, e.g. hidden expectations regarding security behaviors and unwritten rules regarding uses of information-communication technologies.\nResponsibilities: Employees' understanding of the roles and responsibilities they have as a critical factor in sustaining or endangering the security of information, and thereby the organization.Andersson and Reimers (2014) found that employees often do not see themselves as part of the organization Information Security \"effort\" and often take actions that ignore organizational information security best interests. Research shows information security culture needs to be improved continuously. In Information Security Culture from Analysis to Change, authors commented, \"It's a never ending process, a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance.\" To manage the information security culture, five steps should be taken: pre-evaluation, strategic planning, operative planning, implementation, and post-evaluation.\nPre-Evaluation: to identify the awareness of information security within employees and to analyze current security policy\nStrategic Planning: to come up a better awareness-program, we need to set clear targets. Clustering people is helpful to achieve it\nOperative Planning: create a good security culture based on internal communication, management buy-in, security awareness, and training programs\nImplementation: should feature commitment of management, communication with organizational members, courses for all organizational members, and commitment of the employees\nPost-evaluation: to better gauge the effectiveness of the prior steps and build on continuous improvement\n\n== Sources of standards ==\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an international standards organization organized as a consortium of national standards institutions from 167 countries, coordinated through a secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland. ISO is the world's largest developer of international standards. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is an international standards organization that deals with electrotechnology and cooperates closely with ISO. ISO/IEC 15443: \"Information technology \u2013 Security techniques \u2013 A framework for IT security assurance\", ISO/IEC 27002: \"Information technology \u2013 Security techniques \u2013 Code of practice for information security management\", ISO/IEC 20000: \"Information technology \u2013 Service management\", and ISO/IEC 27001: \"Information technology \u2013 Security techniques \u2013 Information security management systems \u2013 Requirements\" are of particular interest to information security professionals.\nThe US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a non-regulatory federal agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce. The NIST Computer Security Division\ndevelops standards, metrics, tests, and validation programs as well as publishes standards and guidelines to increase secure IT planning, implementation, management, and operation. NIST is also the custodian of the U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard publications (FIPS).\nThe Internet Society is a professional membership society with more than 100 organizations and over 20,000 individual members in over 180 countries. It provides leadership in addressing issues that confront the future of the internet, and it is the organizational home for the groups responsible for internet infrastructure standards, including the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Architecture Board (IAB). The ISOC hosts the Requests for Comments (RFCs) which includes the Official Internet Protocol Standards and the RFC-2196 Site Security Handbook.\nThe Information Security Forum (ISF) is a global nonprofit organization of several hundred leading organizations in financial services, manufacturing, telecommunications, consumer goods, government, and other areas. It undertakes research into information security practices and offers advice in its biannual Standard of Good Practice and more detailed advisories for members.\nThe Institute of Information Security Professionals (IISP) is an independent, non-profit body governed by its members, with the principal objective of advancing the professionalism of information security practitioners and thereby the professionalism of the industry as a whole. The institute developed the IISP Skills Framework. This framework describes the range of competencies expected of information security and information assurance professionals in the effective performance of their roles. It was developed through collaboration between both private and public sector organizations, world-renowned academics, and security leaders.The German Federal Office for Information Security (in German Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI)) BSI-Standards 100\u20131 to 100-4 are a set of recommendations including \"methods, processes, procedures, approaches and measures relating to information security\". The BSI-Standard 100-2 IT-Grundschutz Methodology describes how information security management can be implemented and operated. The standard includes a very specific guide, the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs (also known as IT-Grundschutz Catalogs). Before 2005, the catalogs were formerly known as \"IT Baseline Protection Manual\". The Catalogs are a collection of documents useful for detecting and combating security-relevant weak points in the IT environment (IT cluster). The collection encompasses as of September 2013 over 4,400 pages with the introduction and catalogs. The IT-Grundschutz approach is aligned with to the ISO/IEC 2700x family.\nThe European Telecommunications Standards Institute standardized a catalog of information security indicators, headed by the Industrial Specification Group (ISG) ISI.\n\nWhat is an incident response plan (IRP)?",

      "context": "Information security\n\n==Introduction==\nInformation security, sometimes shortened to InfoSec, is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. It is part of information risk management. It typically involves preventing or reducing the probability of unauthorized/inappropriate access to data, or the unlawful use, disclosure, disruption, deletion, corruption, modification, inspection, recording, or devaluation of information. It also involves actions intended to reduce the adverse impacts of such incidents. Protected information may take any form, e.g. electronic or physical, tangible (e.g. paperwork) or intangible (e.g. knowledge). Information security's primary focus is the balanced protection of the data confidentiality, data integrity, and data availability of data (also known as the CIA triad) while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation, all without hampering organization productivity. This is largely achieved through a structured risk management process that involves: \n\nidentifying information and related assets, plus potential threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts;\nevaluating the risks\ndeciding how to address or treat the risks i.e. to avoid, mitigate, share or accept them\nwhere risk mitigation is required, selecting or designing appropriate security controls and implementing them\nmonitoring the activities, making adjustments as necessary to address any issues, changes and improvement opportunitiesTo standardize this discipline, academics and professionals collaborate to offer guidance, policies, and industry standards on password, antivirus software, firewall, encryption software, legal liability, security awareness and training, and so forth. This standardization may be further driven by a wide variety of laws and regulations that affect how data is accessed, processed, stored, transferred and destroyed. However, the implementation of any standards and guidance within an entity may have limited effect if a culture of continual improvement is not adopted.\n\n\n\n== Definition ==\n\nVarious definitions of information security are suggested below, summarized from different sources:\n\n\"Preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Note: In addition, other properties, such as authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability can also be involved.\" (ISO/IEC 27000:2009)\n\"The protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\" (CNSS, 2010)\n\"Ensures that only authorized users (confidentiality) have access to accurate and complete information (integrity) when required (availability).\" (ISACA, 2008)\n\"Information Security is the process of protecting the intellectual property of an organisation.\"  (Pipkin, 2000)\n\"...information security is a risk management discipline, whose job is to manage the cost of information risk to the business.\" (McDermott and Geer, 2001)\n\"A well-informed sense of assurance that information risks and controls are in balance.\" (Anderson, J., 2003)\n\"Information security is the protection of information and minimizes the risk of exposing information to unauthorized parties.\" (Venter and Eloff, 2003)\n\"Information Security is a multidisciplinary area of study and professional activity which is concerned with the development and implementation of security mechanisms of all available types (technical, organizational, human-oriented and legal) in order to keep information in all its locations (within and outside the organization's perimeter) and, consequently, information systems, where information is created, processed, stored, transmitted and destroyed, free from threats. Threats to information and information systems may be categorized and a corresponding security goal may be defined for each category of threats. A set of security goals, identified as a result of a threat analysis, should be revised periodically to ensure its adequacy and conformance with the evolving environment. The currently relevant set of security goals may include: confidentiality, integrity, availability, privacy, authenticity & trustworthiness, non-repudiation, accountability and auditability.\" (Cherdantseva and Hilton, 2013)\nInformation and information resource security using telecommunication system or devices means protecting information, information systems or books from unauthorized access, damage, theft, or destruction (Kurose and Ross, 2010).\n\n== Overview ==\nAt the core of information security is information assurance, the act of maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information, ensuring that information is not compromised in any way when critical issues arise. These issues include but are not limited to natural disasters, computer/server malfunction, and physical theft. While paper-based business operations are still prevalent, requiring their own set of information security practices, enterprise digital initiatives are increasingly being emphasized, with information assurance now typically being dealt with by information technology (IT) security specialists. These specialists apply information security to technology (most often some form of computer system). It is worthwhile to note that a computer does not necessarily mean a home desktop. A computer is any device with a processor and some memory. Such devices can range from non-networked standalone devices as simple as calculators, to networked mobile computing devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. IT security specialists are almost always found in any major enterprise/establishment due to the nature and value of the data within larger businesses. They are responsible for keeping all of the technology within the company secure from malicious cyber attacks that often attempt to acquire critical private information or gain control of the internal systems.The field of information security has grown and evolved significantly in recent years. It offers many areas for specialization, including securing networks and allied infrastructure, securing applications and databases, security testing, information systems auditing, business continuity planning, electronic record discovery, and digital forensics. Information security professionals are very stable in their employment. As of 2013 more than 80 percent of professionals had no change in employer or employment over a period of a year, and the number of professionals is projected to continuously grow more than 11 percent annually from 2014 to 2019.\n\n\n*** Threats ***\nInformation security threats come in many different forms. Some of the most common threats today are software attacks, theft of intellectual property, theft of identity, theft of equipment or information, sabotage, and information extortion. Viruses, worms, phishing attacks, and Trojan horses are a few common examples of software attacks. The theft of intellectual property has also been an extensive issue for many businesses in the information technology (IT) field. Identity theft is the attempt to act as someone else usually to obtain that person's personal information or to take advantage of their access to vital information through social engineering. Theft of equipment or information is becoming more prevalent today due to the fact that most devices today are mobile, are prone to theft and have also become far more desirable as the amount of data capacity increases. Sabotage usually consists of the destruction of an organization's website in an attempt to cause loss of confidence on the part of its customers. Information extortion consists of theft of a company's property or information as an attempt to receive a payment in exchange for returning the information or property back to its owner, as with ransomware. There are many ways to help protect yourself from some of these attacks but one of the most functional precautions is conduct periodical user awareness. The number one threat to any organisation are users or internal employees, they are also called insider threats.Governments, military, corporations, financial institutions, hospitals, non-profit organisations, and private businesses amass a great deal of confidential information about their employees, customers, products, research, and financial status. Should confidential information about a business's customers or finances or new product line fall into the hands of a competitor or a black hat hacker, a business and its customers could suffer widespread, irreparable financial loss, as well as damage to the company's reputation. From a business perspective, information security must be balanced against cost; the Gordon-Loeb Model provides a mathematical economic approach for addressing this concern.For the individual, information security has a significant effect on privacy, which is viewed very differently in various cultures.\n\n\n**** Responses to threats ****\nPossible responses to a security threat or risk are:\nreduce/mitigate \u2013 implement safeguards and countermeasures to eliminate vulnerabilities or block threats\nassign/transfer \u2013 place the cost of the threat onto another entity or organization such as purchasing insurance or outsourcing\naccept \u2013 evaluate if the cost of the countermeasure outweighs the possible cost of loss due to the threat\n\n== Basic principles ==\n\n\n*** Key concepts ***\n\nThe CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability is at the heart of information security. (The members of the classic InfoSec triad\u2014confidentiality, integrity, and availability\u2014are interchangeably referred to in the literature as security attributes, properties, security goals, fundamental aspects, information criteria, critical information characteristics and basic building blocks.) However, debate continues about whether or not this CIA triad is sufficient to address rapidly changing technology and business requirements, with recommendations to consider expanding on the intersections between availability and confidentiality, as well as the relationship between security and privacy. Other principles such as \"accountability\" have sometimes been proposed; it has been pointed out that issues such as non-repudiation do not fit well within the three core concepts.The triad seems to have first been mentioned in a NIST publication in 1977.In 1992 and revised in 2002, the OECD's Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks proposed the nine generally accepted principles: awareness, responsibility, response, ethics, democracy, risk assessment, security design and implementation, security management, and reassessment. Building upon those, in 2004 the NIST's Engineering Principles for Information Technology Security proposed 33 principles. From each of these derived guidelines and practices.\nIn 1998, Donn Parker proposed an alternative model for the classic CIA triad that he called the six atomic elements of information. The elements are confidentiality, possession, integrity, authenticity, availability, and utility. The merits of the Parkerian Hexad are a subject of debate amongst security professionals.In 2011, The Open Group published the information security management standard O-ISM3. This standard proposed an operational definition of the key concepts of security, with elements called \"security objectives\", related to access control (9), availability (3), data quality (1), compliance, and technical (4). In 2009, DoD Software Protection Initiative Archived 2016-09-25 at the Wayback Machine released the Three Tenets of Cybersecurity Archived 2020-05-10 at the Wayback Machine which are System Susceptibility, Access to the Flaw, and Capability to Exploit the Flaw. Neither of these models are widely adopted.\n\n\n**** Confidentiality ****\nIn information security, confidentiality \"is the property, that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.\" While similar to \"privacy,\" the two words are not interchangeable. Rather, confidentiality is a component of privacy that implements to protect our data from unauthorized viewers. Examples of confidentiality of electronic data being compromised include laptop theft, password theft, or sensitive emails being sent to the incorrect individuals.\n\n\n**** Integrity ****\nIn IT security, data integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle. This means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner. This is not the same thing as referential integrity in databases, although it can be viewed as a special case of consistency as understood in the classic ACID model of transaction processing. Information security systems typically incorporate controls to ensure their own integrity, in particular protecting the kernel or core functions against both deliberate and accidental threats. Multi-purpose and multi-user computer systems aim to compartmentalize the data and processing such that no user or process can adversely impact another: the controls may not succeed however, as we see in incidents such as malware infections, hacks, data theft, fraud, and privacy breaches.More broadly, integrity is an information security principle that involves human/social, process, and commercial integrity, as well as data integrity. As such it touches on aspects such as credibility, consistency, truthfulness, completeness, accuracy, timeliness, and assurance.\n\n\n**** Availability ****\nFor any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be available when it is needed. This means the computing systems used to store and process the information, the security controls used to protect it, and the communication channels used to access it must be functioning correctly. High availability systems aim to remain available at all times, preventing service disruptions due to power outages, hardware failures, and system upgrades. Ensuring availability also involves preventing denial-of-service attacks, such as a flood of incoming messages to the target system, essentially forcing it to shut down.In the realm of information security, availability can often be viewed as one of the most important parts of a successful information security program. Ultimately end-users need to be able to perform job functions; by ensuring availability an organization is able to perform to the standards that an organization's stakeholders expect. This can involve topics such as proxy configurations, outside web access, the ability to access shared drives and the ability to send emails. Executives oftentimes do not understand the technical side of information security and look at availability as an easy fix, but this often requires collaboration from many different organizational teams, such as network operations, development operations, incident response, and policy/change management. A successful information security team involves many different key roles to mesh and align for the CIA triad to be provided effectively.\n\n\n**** Non-repudiation ****\nIn law, non-repudiation implies one's intention to fulfill their obligations to a contract. It also implies that one party of a transaction cannot deny having received a transaction, nor can the other party deny having sent a transaction.It is important to note that while technology such as cryptographic systems can assist in non-repudiation efforts, the concept is at its core a legal concept transcending the realm of technology. It is not, for instance, sufficient to show that the message matches a digital signature signed with the sender's private key, and thus only the sender could have sent the message, and nobody else could have altered it in transit (data integrity). The alleged sender could in return demonstrate that the digital signature algorithm is vulnerable or flawed, or allege or prove that his signing key has been compromised. The fault for these violations may or may not lie with the sender, and such assertions may or may not relieve the sender of liability, but the assertion would invalidate the claim that the signature necessarily proves authenticity and integrity. As such, the sender may repudiate the message (because authenticity and integrity are pre-requisites for non-repudiation).\n\n== Risk management ==\n\nBroadly speaking, risk is the likelihood that something bad will happen that causes harm to an informational asset (or the loss of the asset). A vulnerability is a weakness that could be used to endanger or cause harm to an informational asset. A threat is anything (man-made or act of nature) that has the potential to cause harm. The likelihood that a threat will use a vulnerability to cause harm creates a risk. When a threat does use a vulnerability to inflict harm, it has an impact. In the context of information security, the impact is a loss of availability, integrity, and confidentiality, and possibly other losses (lost income, loss of life, loss of real property).The Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) Review Manual 2006 defines risk management as \"the process of identifying vulnerabilities and threats to the information resources used by an organization in achieving business objectives, and deciding what countermeasures, if any, to take in reducing risk to an acceptable level, based on the value of the information resource to the organization.\"There are two things in this definition that may need some clarification. First, the process of risk management is an ongoing, iterative process. It must be repeated indefinitely. The business environment is constantly changing and new threats and vulnerabilities emerge every day. Second, the choice of countermeasures (controls) used to manage risks must strike a balance between productivity, cost, effectiveness of the countermeasure, and the value of the informational asset being protected. Furthermore, these processes have limitations as security breaches are generally rare and emerge in a specific context which may not be easily duplicated. Thus, any process and countermeasure should itself be evaluated for vulnerabilities. It is not possible to identify all risks, nor is it possible to eliminate all risk. The remaining risk is called \"residual risk.\"\nA risk assessment is carried out by a team of people who have knowledge of specific areas of the business. Membership of the team may vary over time as different parts of the business are assessed. The assessment may use a subjective qualitative analysis based on informed opinion, or where reliable dollar figures and historical information is available, the analysis may use quantitative analysis.\nResearch has shown that the most vulnerable point in most information systems is the human user, operator, designer, or other human. The ISO/IEC 27002:2005 Code of practice for information security management recommends the following be examined during a risk assessment:\n\nsecurity policy,\norganization of information security,\nasset management,\nhuman resources security,\nphysical and environmental security,\ncommunications and operations management,\naccess control,\ninformation systems acquisition, development, and maintenance,\ninformation security incident management,\nbusiness continuity management\nregulatory compliance.In broad terms, the risk management process consists of:\nIdentification of assets and estimating their value. Include: people, buildings, hardware, software, data (electronic, print, other), supplies.\nConduct a threat assessment. Include: Acts of nature, acts of war, accidents, malicious acts originating from inside or outside the organization.\nConduct a vulnerability assessment, and for each vulnerability, calculate the probability that it will be exploited. Evaluate policies, procedures, standards, training, physical security, quality control, technical security.\nCalculate the impact that each threat would have on each asset. Use qualitative analysis or quantitative analysis.\nIdentify, select and implement appropriate controls. Provide a proportional response. Consider productivity, cost effectiveness, and value of the asset.\nEvaluate the effectiveness of the control measures. Ensure the controls provide the required cost effective protection without discernible loss of productivity.For any given risk, management can choose to accept the risk based upon the relative low value of the asset, the relative low frequency of occurrence, and the relative low impact on the business. Or, leadership may choose to mitigate the risk by selecting and implementing appropriate control measures to reduce the risk. In some cases, the risk can be transferred to another business by buying insurance or outsourcing to another business. The reality of some risks may be disputed. In such cases leadership may choose to deny the risk.\n\n\n*** Security controls ***\n\nSelecting and implementing proper security controls will initially help an organization bring down risk to acceptable levels. Control selection should follow and should be based on the risk assessment. Controls can vary in nature, but fundamentally they are ways of protecting the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information. ISO/IEC 27001 has defined controls in different areas. Organizations can implement additional controls according to requirement of the organization. ISO/IEC 27002 offers a guideline for organizational information security standards.\n\n\n**** Administrative ****\nAdministrative controls (also called procedural controls) consist of approved written policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines. Administrative controls form the framework for running the business and managing people. They inform people on how the business is to be run and how day-to-day operations are to be conducted. Laws and regulations created by government bodies are also a type of administrative control because they inform the business. Some industry sectors have policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines that must be followed \u2013 the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) required by Visa and MasterCard is such an example. Other examples of administrative controls include the corporate security policy, password policy, hiring policies, and disciplinary policies.Administrative controls form the basis for the selection and implementation of logical and physical controls. Logical and physical controls are manifestations of administrative controls, which are of paramount importance.\n\n\n**** Logical ****\nLogical controls (also called technical controls) use software and data to monitor and control access to information and computing systems. Passwords, network and host-based firewalls, network intrusion detection systems, access control lists, and data encryption are examples of logical controls.An important logical control that is frequently overlooked is the principle of least privilege, which requires that an individual, program or system process not be granted any more access privileges than are necessary to perform the task. A blatant example of the failure to adhere to the principle of least privilege is logging into Windows as user Administrator to read email and surf the web. Violations of this principle can also occur when an individual collects additional access privileges over time. This happens when employees' job duties change, employees are promoted to a new position, or employees are transferred to another department. The access privileges required by their new duties are frequently added onto their already existing access privileges, which may no longer be necessary or appropriate.\n\n\n**** Physical ****\nPhysical controls monitor and control the environment of the work place and computing facilities. They also monitor and control access to and from such facilities and include doors, locks, heating and air conditioning, smoke and fire alarms, fire suppression systems, cameras, barricades, fencing, security guards, cable locks, etc. Separating the network and workplace into functional areas are also physical controls.An important physical control that is frequently overlooked is separation of duties, which ensures that an individual can not complete a critical task by himself. For example, an employee who submits a request for reimbursement should not also be able to authorize payment or print the check. An applications programmer should not also be the server administrator or the database administrator; these roles and responsibilities must be separated from one another.\n\n\n*** Defense in depth ***\n\nInformation security must protect information throughout its lifespan, from the initial creation of the information on through to the final disposal of the information. The information must be protected while in motion and while at rest. During its lifetime, information may pass through many different information processing systems and through many different parts of information processing systems. There are many different ways the information and information systems can be threatened. To fully protect the information during its lifetime, each component of the information processing system must have its own protection mechanisms. The building up, layering on, and overlapping of security measures is called \"defense in depth.\" In contrast to a metal chain, which is famously only as strong as its weakest link, the defense in depth strategy aims at a structure where, should one defensive measure fail, other measures will continue to provide protection.Recall the earlier discussion about administrative controls, logical controls, and physical controls. The three types of controls can be used to form the basis upon which to build a defense in depth strategy. With this approach, defense in depth can be conceptualized as three distinct layers or planes laid one on top of the other. Additional insight into defense in depth can be gained by thinking of it as forming the layers of an onion, with data at the core of the onion, people the next outer layer of the onion, and network security, host-based security, and application security forming the outermost layers of the onion. Both perspectives are equally valid, and each provides valuable insight into the implementation of a good defense in depth strategy.\n\n\n*** Classification ***\nAn important aspect of information security and risk management is recognizing the value of information and defining appropriate procedures and protection requirements for the information. Not all information is equal and so not all information requires the same degree of protection. This requires information to be assigned a security classification. The first step in information classification is to identify a member of senior management as the owner of the particular information to be classified. Next, develop a classification policy. The policy should describe the different classification labels, define the criteria for information to be assigned a particular label, and list the required security controls for each classification.Some factors that influence which classification information should be assigned include how much value that information has to the organization, how old the information is and whether or not the information has become obsolete. Laws and other regulatory requirements are also important considerations when classifying information. The Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) and its Business Model for Information Security also serves as a tool for security professionals to examine security from a systems perspective, creating an environment where security can be managed holistically, allowing actual risks to be addressed.The type of information security classification labels selected and used will depend on the nature of the organization, with examples being:\nIn the business sector, labels such as: Public, Sensitive, Private, Confidential.\nIn the government sector, labels such as: Unclassified, Unofficial, Protected, Confidential, Secret, Top Secret, and their non-English equivalents.\nIn cross-sectoral formations, the Traffic Light Protocol, which consists of: White, Green, Amber, and Red.\nIn the personal sector, one label such as Financial. This includes activities related to managing money, such as online banking.All employees in the organization, as well as business partners, must be trained on the classification schema and understand the required security controls and handling procedures for each classification. The classification of a particular information asset that has been assigned should be reviewed periodically to ensure the classification is still appropriate for the information and to ensure the security controls required by the classification are in place and are followed in their right procedures.\n\n\n*** Access control ***\nAccess to protected information must be restricted to people who are authorized to access the information. The computer programs, and in many cases the computers that process the information, must also be authorized. This requires that mechanisms be in place to control the access to protected information. The sophistication of the access control mechanisms should be in parity with the value of the information being protected; the more sensitive or valuable the information the stronger the control mechanisms need to be. The foundation on which access control mechanisms are built start with identification and authentication.Access control is generally considered in three steps: identification, authentication, and authorization.\n\n\n**** Identification ****\nIdentification is an assertion of who someone is or what something is. If a person makes the statement \"Hello, my name is John Doe\" they are making a claim of who they are. However, their claim may or may not be true. Before John Doe can be granted access to protected information it will be necessary to verify that the person claiming to be John Doe really is John Doe. Typically the claim is in the form of a username. By entering that username you are claiming \"I am the person the username belongs to\".\n\n\n**** Authentication ****\nAuthentication is the act of verifying a claim of identity. When John Doe goes into a bank to make a withdrawal, he tells the bank teller he is John Doe, a claim of identity. The bank teller asks to see a photo ID, so he hands the teller his driver's license. The bank teller checks the license to make sure it has John Doe printed on it and compares the photograph on the license against the person claiming to be John Doe. If the photo and name match the person, then the teller has authenticated that John Doe is who he claimed to be. Similarly, by entering the correct password, the user is providing evidence that he/she is the person the username belongs to.There are three different types of information that can be used for authentication:\nSomething you know: things such as a PIN, a password, or your mother's maiden name\nSomething you have: a driver's license or a magnetic swipe card\nSomething you are: biometrics, including palm prints, fingerprints, voice prints, and retina (eye) scansStrong authentication requires providing more than one type of authentication information (two-factor authentication). The username is the most common form of identification on computer systems today and the password is the most common form of authentication. Usernames and passwords have served their purpose, but they are increasingly inadequate. Usernames and passwords are slowly being replaced or supplemented with more sophisticated authentication mechanisms such as Time-based One-time Password algorithms.\n\n\n**** Authorization ****\nAfter a person, program or computer has successfully been identified and authenticated then it must be determined what informational resources they are permitted to access and what actions they will be allowed to perform (run, view, create, delete, or change). This is called authorization. Authorization to access information and other computing services begins with administrative policies and procedures. The policies prescribe what information and computing services can be accessed, by whom, and under what conditions. The access control mechanisms are then configured to enforce these policies. Different computing systems are equipped with different kinds of access control mechanisms. Some may even offer a choice of different access control mechanisms. The access control mechanism a system offers will be based upon one of three approaches to access control, or it may be derived from a combination of the three approaches.The non-discretionary approach consolidates all access control under a centralized administration. The access to information and other resources is usually based on the individuals function (role) in the organization or the tasks the individual must perform. The discretionary approach gives the creator or owner of the information resource the ability to control access to those resources. In the mandatory access control approach, access is granted or denied basing upon the security classification assigned to the information resource.Examples of common access control mechanisms in use today include role-based access control, available in many advanced database management systems; simple file permissions provided in the UNIX and Windows operating systems; Group Policy Objects provided in Windows network systems; and Kerberos, RADIUS, TACACS, and the simple access lists used in many firewalls and routers.To be effective, policies and other security controls must be enforceable and upheld. Effective policies ensure that people are held accountable for their actions. The U.S. Treasury's guidelines for systems processing sensitive or proprietary information, for example, states that all failed and successful authentication and access attempts must be logged, and all access to information must leave some type of audit trail.Also, the need-to-know principle needs to be in effect when talking about access control. This principle gives access rights to a person to perform their job functions. This principle is used in the government when dealing with difference clearances. Even though two employees in different departments have a top-secret clearance, they must have a need-to-know in order for information to be exchanged. Within the need-to-know principle, network administrators grant the employee the least amount of privilege to prevent employees from accessing more than what they are supposed to. Need-to-know helps to enforce the confidentiality-integrity-availability triad. Need-to-know directly impacts the confidential area of the triad.\n\n\n*** Cryptography ***\n\nInformation security uses cryptography to transform usable information into a form that renders it unusable by anyone other than an authorized user; this process is called encryption. Information that has been encrypted (rendered unusable) can be transformed back into its original usable form by an authorized user who possesses the cryptographic key, through the process of decryption. Cryptography is used in information security to protect information from unauthorized or accidental disclosure while the information is in transit (either electronically or physically) and while information is in storage.Cryptography provides information security with other useful applications as well, including improved authentication methods, message digests, digital signatures, non-repudiation, and encrypted network communications. Older, less secure applications such as Telnet and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) are slowly being replaced with more secure applications such as Secure Shell (SSH) that use encrypted network communications. Wireless communications can be encrypted using protocols such as WPA/WPA2 or the older (and less secure) WEP. Wired communications (such as ITU\u2011T G.hn) are secured using AES for encryption and X.1035 for authentication and key exchange. Software applications such as GnuPG or PGP can be used to encrypt data files and email.Cryptography can introduce security problems when it is not implemented correctly. Cryptographic solutions need to be implemented using industry-accepted solutions that have undergone rigorous peer review by independent experts in cryptography. The length and strength of the encryption key is also an important consideration. A key that is weak or too short will produce weak encryption. The keys used for encryption and decryption must be protected with the same degree of rigor as any other confidential information. They must be protected from unauthorized disclosure and destruction, and they must be available when needed. Public key infrastructure (PKI) solutions address many of the problems that surround key management.\n\n== Process ==\nThe terms \"reasonable and prudent person\", \"due care\", and \"due diligence\" have been used in the fields of finance, securities, and law for many years. In recent years these terms have found their way into the fields of computing and information security. U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines now make it possible to hold corporate officers liable for failing to exercise due care and due diligence in the management of their information systems.In the business world, stockholders, customers, business partners, and governments have the expectation that corporate officers will run the business in accordance with accepted business practices and in compliance with laws and other regulatory requirements. This is often described as the \"reasonable and prudent person\" rule. A prudent person takes due care to ensure that everything necessary is done to operate the business by sound business principles and in a legal, ethical manner. A prudent person is also diligent (mindful, attentive, ongoing) in their due care of the business.\nIn the field of information security, Harris\noffers the following definitions of due care and due diligence:\n\n\"Due care are steps that are taken to show that a company has taken responsibility for the activities that take place within the corporation and has taken the necessary steps to help protect the company, its resources, and employees.\" And, [Due diligence are the] \"continual activities that make sure the protection mechanisms are continually maintained and operational.\"\nAttention should be made to two important points in these definitions. First, in due care, steps are taken to show; this means that the steps can be verified, measured, or even produce tangible artifacts. Second, in due diligence, there are continual activities; this means that people are actually doing things to monitor and maintain the protection mechanisms, and these activities are ongoing.Organizations have a responsibility with practicing duty of care when applying information security. The Duty of Care Risk Analysis Standard (DoCRA) provides principles and practices for evaluating risk. It considers all parties that could be affected by those risks. DoCRA helps evaluate safeguards if they are appropriate in protecting others from harm while presenting a reasonable burden. With increased data breach litigation, companies must balance security controls, compliance, and its mission.\n\n\n*** Security governance ***\n\nThe Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, in a publication titled Governing for Enterprise Security (GES) Implementation Guide, defines characteristics of effective security governance. These include:\nAn enterprise-wide issue\nLeaders are accountable\nViewed as a business requirement\nRisk-based\nRoles, responsibilities, and segregation of duties defined\nAddressed and enforced in policy\nAdequate resources committed\nStaff aware and trained\nA development life cycle requirement\nPlanned, managed, measurable, and measured\nReviewed and audited\n\n\n*** Incident response plans ***\nAn incident response plan (IRP) is a group of policies that dictate an organizations reaction to a cyber attack. Once an security breach has been identified, for example by Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) or Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) (if configured to do so),  the plan is initiated. It is important to note that there can be legal implications to a data breach. Knowing local and federal laws is critical. Every plan is unique to the needs of the organization, and it can involve skill sets that are not part of an IT team. For example, a lawyer may be included in the response plan to help navigate legal implications to a data breach.As mentioned above every plan is unique but most plans will include the following:\n\n\n**** Preparation ****\nGood preparation includes the development of an Incident Response Team (IRT). Skills need to be used by this team would be, penetration testing, computer forensics, network security, etc. This team should also keep track of trends in cybersecurity and modern attack strategies. A training program for end users is important as well as most modern attack strategies target users on the network.\n\n\n**** Identification ****\nThis part of the incident response plan identifies if there was a security event. When an end user reports information or an admin notices irregularities, an investigation is launched. An incident log is a crucial part of this step. All of the members of the team should be updating this log to ensure that information flows as fast as possible. If it has been identified that a security breach has occurred the next step should be activated.\n\n\n**** Containment ****\nIn this phase, the IRT works to isolate the areas that the breach took place to limit the scope of the security event. During this phase it is important to preserve information forensically so it can be analyzed later in the process. Containment could be as simple as physically containing a server room or as complex as segmenting a network to not allow the spread of a virus.\n\n\n**** Eradication ****\nThis is where the threat that was identified is removed from the affected systems. This could include deleting malicious files, terminating compromised accounts, or deleting other components. Some events do not require this step, however it is important to fully understand the event before moving to this step. This will help to ensure that the threat is completely removed.\n\n\n**** Recovery ****\nThis stage is where the systems are restored back to original operation. This stage could include the recovery of data, changing user access information, or updating firewall rules or policies to prevent a breach in the future. Without executing this step, the system could still be vulnerable to future security threats.\n\n\n**** Lessons Learned ****\nIn this step information that has been gathered during this process is used to make future decisions on security. This step is crucial to the ensure that future events are prevented. Using this information to further train admins is critical to the process. This step can also be used to process information that is distributed from other entities who have experienced a security event.\n\n\n*** Change management ***\n\nChange management is a formal process for directing and controlling alterations to the information processing environment. This includes alterations to desktop computers, the network, servers, and software. The objectives of change management are to reduce the risks posed by changes to the information processing environment and improve the stability and reliability of the processing environment as changes are made. It is not the objective of change management to prevent or hinder necessary changes from being implemented.Any change to the information processing environment introduces an element of risk. Even apparently simple changes can have unexpected effects. One of management's many responsibilities is the management of risk. Change management is a tool for managing the risks introduced by changes to the information processing environment. Part of the change management process ensures that changes are not implemented at inopportune times when they may disrupt critical business processes or interfere with other changes being implemented.Not every change needs to be managed. Some kinds of changes are a part of the everyday routine of information processing and adhere to a predefined procedure, which reduces the overall level of risk to the processing environment. Creating a new user account or deploying a new desktop computer are examples of changes that do not generally require change management. However, relocating user file shares, or upgrading the Email server pose a much higher level of risk to the processing environment and are not a normal everyday activity. The critical first steps in change management are (a) defining change (and communicating that definition) and (b) defining the scope of the change system.Change management is usually overseen by a change review board composed of representatives from key business areas, security, networking, systems administrators, database administration, application developers, desktop support, and the help desk. The tasks of the change review board can be facilitated with the use of automated work flow application. The responsibility of the change review board is to ensure the organization's documented change management procedures are followed. The change management process is as follows\nRequest: Anyone can request a change. The person making the change request may or may not be the same person that performs the analysis or implements the change. When a request for change is received, it may undergo a preliminary review to determine if the requested change is compatible with the organizations business model and practices, and to determine the amount of resources needed to implement the change.\nApprove: Management runs the business and controls the allocation of resources therefore, management must approve requests for changes and assign a priority for every change. Management might choose to reject a change request if the change is not compatible with the business model, industry standards or best practices. Management might also choose to reject a change request if the change requires more resources than can be allocated for the change.\nPlan: Planning a change involves discovering the scope and impact of the proposed change; analyzing the complexity of the change; allocation of resources and, developing, testing, and documenting both implementation and back-out plans. Need to define the criteria on which a decision to back out will be made.\nTest: Every change must be tested in a safe test environment, which closely reflects the actual production environment, before the change is applied to the production environment. The backout plan must also be tested.\nSchedule: Part of the change review board's responsibility is to assist in the scheduling of changes by reviewing the proposed implementation date for potential conflicts with other scheduled changes or critical business activities.\nCommunicate: Once a change has been scheduled it must be communicated. The communication is to give others the opportunity to remind the change review board about other changes or critical business activities that might have been overlooked when scheduling the change. The communication also serves to make the help desk and users aware that a change is about to occur. Another responsibility of the change review board is to ensure that scheduled changes have been properly communicated to those who will be affected by the change or otherwise have an interest in the change.\nImplement: At the appointed date and time, the changes must be implemented. Part of the planning process was to develop an implementation plan, testing plan and, a back out plan. If the implementation of the change should fail or, the post implementation testing fails or, other \"drop dead\" criteria have been met, the back out plan should be implemented.\nDocument: All changes must be documented. The documentation includes the initial request for change, its approval, the priority assigned to it, the implementation, testing and back out plans, the results of the change review board critique, the date/time the change was implemented, who implemented it, and whether the change was implemented successfully, failed or postponed.\nPost-change review: The change review board should hold a post-implementation review of changes. It is particularly important to review failed and backed out changes. The review board should try to understand the problems that were encountered, and look for areas for improvement.Change management procedures that are simple to follow and easy to use can greatly reduce the overall risks created when changes are made to the information processing environment. Good change management procedures improve the overall quality and success of changes as they are implemented. This is accomplished through planning, peer review, documentation, and communication.ISO/IEC 20000, The Visible OPS Handbook: Implementing ITIL in 4 Practical and Auditable Steps (Full book summary), and ITIL all provide valuable guidance on implementing an efficient and effective change management program information security.\n\n== Business continuity ==\nBusiness continuity management (BCM) concerns arrangements aiming to protect an organization's critical business functions from interruption due to incidents, or at least minimize the effects. BCM is essential to any organization to keep technology and business in line with current threats to the continuation of business as usual. The BCM should be included in an organizations risk analysis plan to ensure that all of the necessary business functions have what they need to keep going in the event of any type of threat to any business function.It encompasses:\n\nAnalysis of requirements, e.g., identifying critical business functions, dependencies and potential failure points, potential threats and hence incidents or risks of concern to the organization;\nSpecification, e.g., maximum tolerable outage periods; recovery point objectives (maximum acceptable periods of data loss);\nArchitecture and design, e.g., an appropriate combination of approaches including resilience (e.g. engineering IT systems and processes for high availability, avoiding or preventing situations that might interrupt the business), incident and emergency management (e.g., evacuating premises, calling the emergency services, triage/situation assessment and invoking recovery plans), recovery (e.g., rebuilding) and contingency management (generic capabilities to deal positively with whatever occurs using whatever resources are available);\nImplementation, e.g., configuring and scheduling backups, data transfers, etc., duplicating and strengthening critical elements; contracting with service and equipment suppliers;\nTesting, e.g., business continuity exercises of various types, costs and assurance levels;\nManagement, e.g., defining strategies, setting objectives and goals; planning and directing the work; allocating funds, people and other resources; prioritization relative to other activities; team building, leadership, control, motivation and coordination with other business functions and activities (e.g., IT, facilities, human resources, risk management, information risk and security, operations); monitoring the situation, checking and updating the arrangements when things change; maturing the approach through continuous improvement, learning and appropriate investment;\nAssurance, e.g., testing against specified requirements; measuring, analyzing, and reporting key parameters; conducting additional tests, reviews and audits for greater confidence that the arrangements will go to plan if invoked.Whereas BCM takes a broad approach to minimizing disaster-related risks by reducing both the probability and the severity of incidents, a disaster recovery plan (DRP) focuses specifically on resuming business operations as quickly as possible after a disaster. A disaster recovery plan, invoked soon after a disaster occurs, lays out the steps necessary to recover critical information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure. Disaster recovery planning includes establishing a planning group, performing risk assessment, establishing priorities, developing recovery strategies, preparing inventories and documentation of the plan, developing verification criteria and procedure, and lastly implementing the plan.\n\n== Laws and regulations ==\n\nBelow is a partial listing of governmental laws and regulations in various parts of the world that have, had, or will have, a significant effect on data processing and information security. Important industry sector regulations have also been included when they have a significant impact on information security.\nThe UK Data Protection Act 1998 makes new provisions for the regulation of the processing of information relating to individuals, including the obtaining, holding, use or disclosure of such information. The European Union Data Protection Directive (EUDPD) requires that all E.U. members adopt national regulations to standardize the protection of data privacy for citizens throughout the E.U.\nThe Computer Misuse Act 1990 is an Act of the U.K. Parliament making computer crime (e.g., hacking) a criminal offense. The act has become a model upon which several other countries, including Canada and the Republic of Ireland, have drawn inspiration from when subsequently drafting their own information security laws.\nThe E.U.'s Data Retention Directive (annulled) required internet service providers and phone companies to keep data on every electronic message sent and phone call made for between six months and two years.\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232 g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a U.S. Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record.\nThe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council's (FFIEC) security guidelines for auditors specifies requirements for online banking security.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 requires the adoption of national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers, health insurance plans, and employers. Additionally, it requires health care providers, insurance providers and employers to safeguard the security and privacy of health data.\nThe Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA), also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, protects the privacy and security of private financial information that financial institutions collect, hold, and process.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) requires publicly traded companies to assess the effectiveness of their internal controls for financial reporting in annual reports they submit at the end of each fiscal year. Chief information officers are responsible for the security, accuracy, and the reliability of the systems that manage and report the financial data. The act also requires publicly traded companies to engage with independent auditors who must attest to, and report on, the validity of their assessments.\nThe Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) establishes comprehensive requirements for enhancing payment account data security. It was developed by the founding payment brands of the PCI Security Standards Council \u2014 including American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB, MasterCard Worldwide, and Visa International \u2014 to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures on a global basis. The PCI DSS is a multifaceted security standard that includes requirements for security management, policies, procedures, network architecture, software design, and other critical protective measures.\nState security breach notification laws (California and many others) require businesses, nonprofits, and state institutions to notify consumers when unencrypted \"personal information\" may have been compromised, lost, or stolen.\nThe Personal Information Protection and Electronics Document Act (PIPEDA) of Canada supports and promotes electronic commerce by protecting personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in certain circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic means to communicate or record information or transactions and by amending the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision Act.\nGreece's Hellenic Authority for Communication Security and Privacy (ADAE) (Law 165/2011) establishes and describes the minimum information security controls that should be deployed by every company which provides electronic communication networks and/or services in Greece in order to protect customers' confidentiality. These include both managerial and technical controls (e.g., log records should be stored for two years).\nGreece's Hellenic Authority for Communication Security and Privacy (ADAE) (Law 205/2013) concentrates around the protection of the integrity and availability of the services and data offered by Greek telecommunication companies. The law forces these and other related companies to build, deploy, and test appropriate business continuity plans and redundant infrastructures.The US Department of Defense (DoD) issued DoD Directive 8570 in 2004, supplemented by DoD Directive 8140, requiring all DoD employees and all DoD contract personnel involved in information assurance roles and activities to earn and maintain various industry Information Technology (IT) certifications in an effort to ensure that all DoD personnel involved in network infrastructure defense have minimum levels of IT industry recognized knowledge, skills and abilities (KSA). Andersson and Reimers (2019) report these certifications range from CompTIA's A+ and Security+ through the ICS2.org's CISSP, etc..\n\n== Culture ==\nDescribing more than simply how security aware employees are, information security culture is the ideas, customs, and social behaviors of an organization that impact information security in both positive and negative ways. Cultural concepts can help different segments of the organization work effectively or work against effectiveness towards information security within an organization. The way employees think and feel about security and the actions they take can have a big impact on information security in organizations. Roer & Petric (2017) identify seven core dimensions of information security culture in organizations:\nAttitudes: Employees' feelings and emotions about the various activities that pertain to the organizational security of information.\nBehaviors: Actual or intended activities and risk-taking actions of employees that have direct or indirect impact on information security.\nCognition: Employees' awareness, verifiable knowledge, and beliefs regarding practices, activities, and self-efficacy relation that are related to information security.\nCommunication: Ways employees communicate with each other, sense of belonging, support for security issues, and incident reporting.\nCompliance: Adherence to organizational security policies, awareness of the existence of such policies and the ability to recall the substance of such policies.\nNorms: Perceptions of security-related organizational conduct and practices that are informally deemed either normal or deviant by employees and their peers, e.g. hidden expectations regarding security behaviors and unwritten rules regarding uses of information-communication technologies.\nResponsibilities: Employees' understanding of the roles and responsibilities they have as a critical factor in sustaining or endangering the security of information, and thereby the organization.Andersson and Reimers (2014) found that employees often do not see themselves as part of the organization Information Security \"effort\" and often take actions that ignore organizational information security best interests. Research shows information security culture needs to be improved continuously. In Information Security Culture from Analysis to Change, authors commented, \"It's a never ending process, a cycle of evaluation and change or maintenance.\" To manage the information security culture, five steps should be taken: pre-evaluation, strategic planning, operative planning, implementation, and post-evaluation.\nPre-Evaluation: to identify the awareness of information security within employees and to analyze current security policy\nStrategic Planning: to come up a better awareness-program, we need to set clear targets. Clustering people is helpful to achieve it\nOperative Planning: create a good security culture based on internal communication, management buy-in, security awareness, and training programs\nImplementation: should feature commitment of management, communication with organizational members, courses for all organizational members, and commitment of the employees\nPost-evaluation: to better gauge the effectiveness of the prior steps and build on continuous improvement\n\n== Sources of standards ==\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an international standards organization organized as a consortium of national standards institutions from 167 countries, coordinated through a secretariat in Geneva, Switzerland. ISO is the world's largest developer of international standards. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is an international standards organization that deals with electrotechnology and cooperates closely with ISO. ISO/IEC 15443: \"Information technology \u2013 Security techniques \u2013 A framework for IT security assurance\", ISO/IEC 27002: \"Information technology \u2013 Security techniques \u2013 Code of practice for information security management\", ISO/IEC 20000: \"Information technology \u2013 Service management\", and ISO/IEC 27001: \"Information technology \u2013 Security techniques \u2013 Information security management systems \u2013 Requirements\" are of particular interest to information security professionals.\nThe US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a non-regulatory federal agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce. The NIST Computer Security Division\ndevelops standards, metrics, tests, and validation programs as well as publishes standards and guidelines to increase secure IT planning, implementation, management, and operation. NIST is also the custodian of the U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard publications (FIPS).\nThe Internet Society is a professional membership society with more than 100 organizations and over 20,000 individual members in over 180 countries. It provides leadership in addressing issues that confront the future of the internet, and it is the organizational home for the groups responsible for internet infrastructure standards, including the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Architecture Board (IAB). The ISOC hosts the Requests for Comments (RFCs) which includes the Official Internet Protocol Standards and the RFC-2196 Site Security Handbook.\nThe Information Security Forum (ISF) is a global nonprofit organization of several hundred leading organizations in financial services, manufacturing, telecommunications, consumer goods, government, and other areas. It undertakes research into information security practices and offers advice in its biannual Standard of Good Practice and more detailed advisories for members.\nThe Institute of Information Security Professionals (IISP) is an independent, non-profit body governed by its members, with the principal objective of advancing the professionalism of information security practitioners and thereby the professionalism of the industry as a whole. The institute developed the IISP Skills Framework. This framework describes the range of competencies expected of information security and information assurance professionals in the effective performance of their roles. It was developed through collaboration between both private and public sector organizations, world-renowned academics, and security leaders.The German Federal Office for Information Security (in German Bundesamt f\u00fcr Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI)) BSI-Standards 100\u20131 to 100-4 are a set of recommendations including \"methods, processes, procedures, approaches and measures relating to information security\". The BSI-Standard 100-2 IT-Grundschutz Methodology describes how information security management can be implemented and operated. The standard includes a very specific guide, the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs (also known as IT-Grundschutz Catalogs). Before 2005, the catalogs were formerly known as \"IT Baseline Protection Manual\". The Catalogs are a collection of documents useful for detecting and combating security-relevant weak points in the IT environment (IT cluster). The collection encompasses as of September 2013 over 4,400 pages with the introduction and catalogs. The IT-Grundschutz approach is aligned with to the ISO/IEC 2700x family.\nThe European Telecommunications Standards Institute standardized a catalog of information security indicators, headed by the Industrial Specification Group (ISG) ISI."
