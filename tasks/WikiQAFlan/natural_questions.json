      "question": "What is the significance of the polynomial degree in the cube attack on Trivium?",
      "answer": "The polynomial degree is significant in the cube attack on Trivium because it determines the number of initialization rounds that can be attacked. The authors of the cube attack claim that their technique can be used to attack 735 initialization rounds of Trivium with a complexity of 2^230, and they conjecture that this technique may extend to breaking 1100 of Trivium's 1152 initialization rounds and possibly even the original cipher. However, this attack is still a subject of controversy, with some experts claiming that it is merely a reinvention of existing techniques."

      "question": "How did AppShield revolutionize the market and what were its initial market adoption challenges?",
      "answer": "AppShield, conceptualized by Eran Reshef and Gili Raanan, was the world's first Application Firewall, introduced in 1999 by Perfecto Technologies (now Sanctum). The product offered several innovative features, such as inspecting incoming Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests and blocking malicious attacks based on a dynamic policy generated through analysis of outgoing HTML pages. However, initial market adoption proved challenging, and Sanctum had to introduce a complementary solution, Appscan, to showcase the need for Application security. In 2004, F5 Networks acquired AppShield's intellectual properties from Sanctum and discontinued the technology."
