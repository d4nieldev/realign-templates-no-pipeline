In this context, MrBlack serves as a \"bot,\" enabling the attacker to orchestrate DDoS attacks, MITM attacks, and other malicious activities using the compromised routers within the botnet."

However, removing traitorous components from the agreement may require additional steps and mechanisms beyond the scope of the quantum protocol itself."
