      "question": "What are algorithmic complexity attacks and how do they help an attacker exploit a TOCTOU race condition?",
      "answer": "Algorithmic complexity attacks are a technique used by attackers to exploit TOCTOU race conditions. They involve manipulating the operating system state to force the victim to spend their entire scheduling quantum inside a single system call traversing the kernel's hash table of cached file names. This delay allows the attacker to execute their operations between the victim's system calls. The attacker creates a very large number of files with names that hash to the same value as the file the victim will look up."

    "output": "answer: Mod n cryptanalysis is a specific partitioning attack that uses the congruence classes modulo some integer for partitions. Partitioning cryptanalysis is a form of cryptanalysis for block ciphers that involves dividing the sets of possible plaintexts and ciphertexts into partitions, where the distribution of ciphertexts is significantly non-uniform when the plaintexts are chosen uniformly from a given block of the partition. Mod n cryptanalysis is unique in that it uses congruence classes modulo some integer for the partitions, which can be an effective way to uncover weaknesses in certain ciphers. It has been used to demonstrate a toy cipher that exhibits resistance against ordinary linear cryptanalysis but is susceptible to partitioning cryptanalysis.",
