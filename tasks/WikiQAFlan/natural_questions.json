      "question": "Why is shellcode commonly written in machine code?",
      "answer": "Shellcode is commonly written in machine code because it is generally desirable to make it both small and executable, which allows it to be used in as wide a variety of situations as possible. Writing good shellcode can be as much an art as it is a science, and good shellcode writers can put small opcodes to use to create more compact shellcode."
